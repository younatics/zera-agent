"(CNN) -- To offset carbon dioxide, a Japanese airline is asking its passengers to go to the toilet before boarding. All Nippon Airways is asking passengers to use the restroom before flying to reduce weight. The unusual request by All Nippon Airways (ANA) is part of its ""e-Flight"" promotional program to reduce the amount of carbon expelled on 38 domestic routes and its twice daily international flights to Singapore. ""Asking passengers to go to the toilet (before boarding) is just a small part of the program,"" said spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka, which includes using recycled paper cups and plastic bottles instead of glass. ""We are making these items lighter -- and making the passengers lighter, a little bit,"" Tezuka said. The airline estimates that if 50 percent of passengers relieved themselves before boarding, it would reduce carbon dioxide by 4.2 tons a month. Flights will also show educational films on the environment. The month-long trial program, which began October 1, will be evaluated and may be extended if successful, Tezuka said. In true Japanese fashion, the encouragement to eliminate is more suggested than explicit. This is what is announced before boarding the flights: ""This flight is a so-called 'eFlight.' The idea behind the operation is to think about the Earth in the sky above. Fuel reduction by lightening the weight of the aircraft will lead to restrain the carbon dioxide emission, which is one of the causes of global warming. Thank you for your understanding."" So no mother-like admonishments to use the toilet before leaving? ""No, it's more subtle than that,"" Tezuka said. People are also encouraged to pack lighter for the flights, although no additional weight restrictions apply. The program comes as the airline industry in Japan is struggling. The nation's largest carrier, Japan Airlines, is seeking a government bailout and forecasts $700 million in losses this year. This week, ANA's stock price hit a 52-week low in trading Wednesday.","All Nippon Airways is asking passengers to go to toilet before flights .

"(CNN)  -- Didier Drogba is backing his Ivory Coast team to make history by becoming the first African country to reach the final of the World Cup next year. Drogba is contemplating a big challenge by the Ivory Coast in South Africa. The Chelsea striker scored the decisive goal as the Elephants sealed their place in South Africa with a 1-1 draw against Malawi on Saturday, but he is now looking ahead to the finals with relish. ""It is going to be a challenge,"" the 31-year-old told reporters. ""To make it to the final will not be easy because there are great teams like Brazil and Germany who have won the World Cup for many years. ""But my teammates and I want to make history and want to change the way the world sees African football. Can an African team win the World Cup next year ? ""I hope that we'll be the team that is going to go to the final and win the competition."" Ivory Coast have joined Ghana as definite qualifiers from Africa, with three other places up for grabs in the final round of matches in November. Drogba is one of several stars in the Ivorian squad with Champions League experience, including Barcelona's Yaya Toure who is anxious to erase memories of their failure to qualify from the group stages in the 2006 finals in Germany. ""At the last World Cup we played really well in Germany, but we were unlucky because we were in a very tough group with Argentina and Holland and so went out in the first round,"" he said. ""But I think with this kind of experience, it will be possible at South Africa 2010 to do much better. Perhaps we can make the quarterfinals and then semifinals, this is something we can achieve."" Coach Vahid Halilhodzic is also upbeat after seeing his side fight back from a goal down against Malawi to top African Group E. ""We are very proud to participate in the World Cup for the second consecutive time and this time it is going to be better,"" he added.","Didier Drogba targets World Cup glory with African powerhouses Ivory Coast .

"(CNN)  -- Lance Armstrong and 2007 champion Alberto Contador will head a strong Astana team for next month's Tour de France. Armstrong (left)  will be backed by a strong Astana squad in Tour de France. Armstrong is bidding for an unprecedented eighth victory in cycling's most prestigious race while his teammate Contador will start as favorite for the yellow jersey. The Kazakh-backed squad will have strong support riders with Andreas Kloeden, Levi Leipheimer, Yaroslav Popovych and Haimar Zulbedia also named in the tea, . Kloeden and Leipheimer have both been podium finishers in the Tour de France while the team is packed full of good performers for the key mountain stages. The remaining three riders to make up the squad of nine will be picked from Jani Brajkovic, Chris Horner, Benjamin Noval, Dmitriy Muravyev, Sergio Paulinho, Gregory Rast and Tomas Vaitkus. ""The complete 2009 Tour roster will be chosen based on the strongest team from both a sportive and team-spirit criteria,"" Astana's team chief Johan Bruyneel told Press Association Sport. Astana have also settled doubts over outstanding debts run up by the team which left their participation in the Tour in doubt with the Kazakh government putting up guarantees that riders would be paid. The team is returning to the Tour after a two-year absence, having been barred from the 2008 because of doping misdemeanors by former squad members. It left Contador to win the Giro d'Italia and Tour of Spain and he will be bidding for a second Tour triumph when racing gets underway in Monaco on July 4. Armstrong returned to the peloton earlier this year after a three-year absence and finished 12th in the Giro d'Italia, his preparation hampered by breaking his collarbone at a minor stage race in Spain in March. In other Tour de France news, organizers have barred former world champion Tom Boonen from competing in this year's race. The Belgian, who won Parix-Roubaix for the third time this year, tested positive for cocaine in April. His Quick Step team said on Friday that they would consider legal action to challenge the decision.","Lance Armstrong is named in a strong Astana squad for the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- When she was about 8, Frida Sepulveda developed dark folds of skin around her neck. It's a well-known warning sign of type 2 diabetes. Blanca Sepulveda, right, was ""devastated"" when her daughter Frida began showing signs of type 2 diabetes. Frida's mother, Blanca Sepulveda, who has watched other family members struggle with diabetes and obesity, was ""devastated"" to see her daughter experience similar health problems. Now at age 11, Frida is about 5 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs around 180 pounds, her mother said. Despite a high body weight for her age and height, Frida does not seem to have additional symptoms of diabetes -- or any other major health concerns -- but her parents are trying to reverse the weight problem Frida has had since infancy. The San Diego, California, family is among a disproportionately high number of Latino-American families with overweight and obese children. According to the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, 16.6 percent of Latino high school students were obese and 18.1 percent were overweight. The corresponding national averages for high school students were 13.3 percent obese and 15.8 percent overweight. It's an epidemic that shocked and saddened Lorena Garcia, a chef who appears on Univision and Telemundo. ""I travel all over the country to the major Hispanic festivals and I realized that 90 to 95 percent of the kids that I saw at the festivals were overweight,"" said Garcia, who established the Big Chef Little Chef program to teach Latino youth healthy cooking and eating habits.  Watch Garcia interact with her fans » . The problem is caused by a wide range of cultural, social, economic, environmental and possibly genetic factors. Experts agree it is an uphill battle to solve. ""You can't just try to change someone's behavior necessarily without trying to change their environment,"" said Dr. Michael Goran, director of the University of Southern California's Childhood Obesity Research Center. How can childhood obesity be reduced? Blanca Sepulveda, 38, believes her own upbringing in Mexico before coming to the United States in junior high school ultimately contributed to her daughter's weight problem. ""The way I was raised ... you don't [leave] the dinner table until you're done with all your food. That's instilled in you,"" Sepulveda said. Back in Mexico, she said, the food was healthier and fresher, and she didn't drink soda. But she still applied that mentality to her own children, who were born and raised in the United States, where sugar-laden and fattening foods are widely available. The Sepulveda family's story is similar to that of other immigrants who are healthier than their American-born children: Those born outside the United States are less likely to be obese than native-born children, said Luisa Franzini, Ph.D., of the University of Texas School of Public Health. Despite the trends, more study is necessary to determine whether American acculturation is entirely to blame for poor diets among Latinos, an expert says. Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a nutrition and public health professor with the University of Connecticut, wrote in the June 2009 issue of Journal of the American Diabetic Association that adaptation to U.S. society may explain, to some degree, ""deterioration of dietary quality"" and the risks of diabetes and other chronic diseases. However, he wrote, it's still not completely clear. Healthy food harder to come by . Economic factors play a major role for many Latinos in their weight struggles. Angelica Delgado is trying to overcome the obstacle with the Healthy Latino Families initiative, a culturally tailored nutrition and exercise program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As the Community Research Supervisor for the United Community Center, Delgado is trying to get healthy school lunches in the Bruce-Guadalupe Community School, with which she's working on Healthy Latino Families. About 80 percent of Bruce Guadalupe's student body, which is 97 percent Latino, come from low-income households and therefore are eligible for reduced-price or free lunch. Without money coming in to support the lunch program, it's difficult to fund better quality food and equipment to ensure that it's freshly cooked, Delgado said. For now, she hopes the fun, bilingual setting of Healthy Latino Families will teach children to make smart food choices. The lack of availability of inexpensive, fresh, healthy food is a common for low-income populations in general, Franzini said. Research suggests that more affluent neighborhoods have a higher availability of healthy food, she said, adding that the cost of healthy food is lower in more advantaged communities. The community factor . Exercise also poses tricky problems for Latino children struggling with weight, as many live in disadvantaged areas may make it tough for them to play outside or walk to school. From a physical point of view -- in terms of sidewalks and litter -- those areas tend to be in worse shape than an average neighborhood, Franzini said. But her research also suggests that the social component of a neighborhood affects children's physical activity levels. ""It's not sufficient to just clean up the neighborhood -- pick up the trash and build sidewalks,"" said Franzini, whose study on the impact of neighborhoods' social characteristics was published earlier this year in the American Journal of Public Health. ""It also needs to be a neighborhood where people feel safe and they feel that they can go out and walk and run and exercise and do whatever they want to do."" To that end, Franzini's research indicates that those Latinos living in tight-knit communities often get more exercise than those in more mixed neighborhoods. ""Having a neighborhood which is more connected, where people feel safe -- I think it's all a matter of feeling empowered in a way. And so those who feel that they have this stronger neighborhood from a social point of view, they are also more likely to be physically active,"" Franzini said. Finding solutions . Researchers and community advocates are attempting to combat the Latino youth obesity problem. But the multitude of factors makes the issue a moving target and results of interventions are mixed. For example, about a year after a previous phase of Healthy Latino Families in Milwaukee wrapped up, children reportedly ate better and watched less television per day. Delgado said they are awaiting results from the current program, but she has seen some success already. USC's Goran worked with Latino teenagers over 16 weeks to improve their diets, promoting fiber-rich tortillas and altering recipes of aqua fresca so it would have less sugar. But at the end of the four months, he saw ""no significant improvement in the outcomes."" ""We have to do those studies over longer time periods than we have previously done to kind of give these things a chance to work and kick in,"" Goran said. ""We're ... taking it one step at a time."" And Frida's mom, Blanca Sepulveda, said she is focusing on modifying her own behavior to help her entire family. ""It's a retraining of the mind,"" Sepulveda said. ""It gets hard because you have to be an example.""","A disproportionately high number of Latino-American families struggle with obesity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. professor claims he has identified the parts of the brain that help to make someone a good leader. Pierre Balthazard is using EEG to find out what parts of the brain are involved in leadership. Pierre Balthazard, an associate professor at the Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, also says he can use neuroscientific techniques to help people improve the skills that play a part in leadership. Balthazard uses electroencephalography (EEG) to produce a ""brain map"" of his subjects. By attaching electrodes to their heads, he says he can measure electrical activity generated by neurons in their brain. Much of his work has focused on calibrating the EEG data with standard psychometric tests, and now Balthazard says that just by looking at someone's brain map he can predict their capacity for certain traits linked to leadership. ""From someone's brain map I can tell if someone would rank high, medium or low on a psychometric assessment of their transformational leadership, and just that is an earth-shattering finding,"" he told CNN. He has been working with the U.S. military to produce a model that will allow them to scan soldiers' brains for complexity. The idea is that more complex brains produce better situational awareness and adaptive thinking -- essential skills for the modern soldier, who must be able to transition from front-line combat to nation building. He refers to traits like complexity and transformational leadership as antecedents to leadership itself. But for Balthazard, the ability to assess these skills is only half the story. What really excites him is the possibility of brain training and improving leadership skills. ""If you could only assess and not develop then it's only an exercise in social engineering, and that's of no interest to me,"" he said. Balthazard explained that brains can be trained using positive and negative reinforcement, in the same way that disorders like ADD are treated. A subject is wired to software programmed to recognize ""correct"" functioning of a specific part of the brain. If the brain isn't performing correctly, there is a negative reinforcement, such as a noise emitted from a speaker at an unpleasant frequency. ""The brain is amazing at adjusting so it doesn't get the negative feedback,"" he told CNN. But others think it may prove difficult to develop something as intangible as leadership. Dr Bob Kentridge, a member of the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Unit at Durham University, in England, told CNN, ""Even if you find differences in the brains of people with different leadership abilities, it's very difficult to say if that difference is just related to leadership. ""It could be due to all sorts of things that might be fairly tangentially related to leadership."" ""Leadership is such a fuzzy quality that it's hard to say conclusively what you are changing,"" Kentridge added. ""You might change things that contribute to leadership, for example people might learn to stay calmer in conflict situations, but is that the same as saying you're improving the leadership center of your brain?"" So, what's inside the brain of a born leader? Interestingly, intelligence is not a requirement. ""There's zero correlation between IQ and leadership,"" Balthazard told CNN. ""Emotion control has a lot to do with leadership. People who lead very well tend to have a much more coherent brain on the emotional, right side, and more differentiated brain on the more rational, left side, that can assess more different options."" Balthazard says that although he has identified brain profiles for antecedents to leadership, he stresses that before he can produce a set of exercises designed to improve leadership itself, he must develop a ""leadership norm"" -- a standard for what makes a good leader. He has currently analyzed the brains of between 200 and 225 subjects, including bankers and military leaders, and says he must test twice that amount before he has his ""norm."" But he said plenty of people are already going to neurotherapists to train their brain for skills linked to leadership, such as decision-making, cognition, and memory retrieval, and Balthazard says he'll soon be able to use neuotherapy techniques to develop leadership itself. ""At some point in the next 18 months we'll have a seminal paper out that says we've done this. We're not there yet but I've seen it in the lab."" If that happens, budding CEOs might be queuing up at neurotherapists to plug themselves in and turn themselves into the business brains of the future.","Researcher says he can spot a good leader just by scanning their brain .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A new lawsuit alleges that convicted swindler Bernie Madoff financed a cocaine-fueled work environment and a ""culture of sexual deviance,"" and he diverted money to his London, England, office when he believed federal authorities were closing in at home. A new lawsuit alleges Bernie Madoff financed a sex-and-drugs workplace with investors' money. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in New York's State Supreme Court, was brought on behalf of former investors and seeks unspecified punitive damages and compensation. Beyond that, it offers a look at what the plaintiffs' attorneys say was once Madoff's multimillion-dollar empire and what is now his world in a federal prison in North Carolina. Among the allegations in the 264-page lawsuit are that during the mid-1970s, Madoff began sending employees to buy drugs for company use. The complaint alleges that some employees and investors were aware of the drug purchases, and that BMIS [Bernard Madoff Investment Services] was known by insiders as the ""North Pole"" in reference to the excessive amount of cocaine use in the work place. Attorneys Joseph Cochett and Nancy Fineman filed the complaint based on an investigation, including a four-hour interview with Madoff in prison in July, that they conducted for former investors. They also allege that major financial institutions, including KPMG, the Bank of New York and JP Morgan Chase, were aware that Madoff was transferring stolen funds to his London office for personal purchases. According to the complaint, Madoff transferred funds to London to buy extravagant personal items. ""In 2006 Madoff thought the end was near because the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] investigated. He realized he had to change things up so his focus shifted to London,"" Fineman said. ""We know that KPMG were the auditors for the London branch and that money was used to buy yachts and Bentleys, they are supposed to look at related-party transactions. KPMG should have noticed these as a red flag."" Officials of KPMG and the Bank of New York did not immediately respond to calls from CNN Wednesday evening for comment on the lawsuit. JP Morgan Chase spokesman Tom Kelly said, ""We do not comment on pending litigation."" The alleged illicit behavior outlined in the complaint did not stop at drug use and extravagant spending. Company parties consisted of topless entertainers, and some employees had affairs in places such as Madoff's own office, the lawsuit says. Madoff was fond of escorts and masseuses, and used money stolen from investors to pay them, according to the complaint. Madoff was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. He pleaded guilty in March to 11 counts, including fraud, money laundering and perjury, and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors. Before Madoff, 71, was transferred to Federal Butner Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina, he lived a life of luxury. The lawsuit states that he had multimillion dollar residences in Manhattan, Montauk on New York's Long Island; Palm Beach, Florida; and Cap d'Antibe, France. The complaint includes details of Madoff's drastically different life now in prison. He lives in a cell where he sleeps on the bottom bunk while up top sleeps his 21-year-old cellmate, who is serving time for drug crimes, according to the lawsuit. Madoff's recreational activities consist of walking around the prison track at night, and eating pizza cooked by a convicted child molester, the lawsuit says. Madoff now spends his time with infamous inmates, the lawsuit says, including Carmine Persico, a former organized-crime former boss, and Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy for Israel. Many of his fellow inmates are in prison for drug and sex crimes, according to the lawsuit. Going after large financial institutions that allegedly allowed Madoff's scheme to flourish is the goal of Fineman and her associates. ""Our goal of meeting with Madoff during the investigation is to get as much money back from responsible parties and that's why lawsuits are filed and why lawyers do what they do,"" Fineman said. ""Even now, 10 months later, the pain in the victims' voices is still evident. I still hear it when I talk to people who were being defrauded for so long."" According to the complaint, Fineman and Cochett are seeking punitive and compensatory damages for their clients with ""an amount to be determined at trial, including interest thereon."" Fineman said that during the prison interview with Madoff, ""He said he was apologetic, but he didn't seem apologetic."" ""I forgot I was in prison, he was talking to us as if we were in a restaurant -- he has quite an ego, you could see why people would be drawn to him,"" Fineman said. ""He told us things that were self-serving to him,"" she said. ""But he told me he knew he would die in prison.""","Lawsuit seeks punitive damages, compensation on behalf of former investors .

"Editor's Note: In an exclusive series this week on ""Campbell Brown,"" the FBI has unveiled three additions to its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. The FBI says Semion Mogilevich has been involved in arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion and murder for hire. NEWTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Semion Mogilevich may be the most powerful man you've never heard of. The FBI says Mogilevich, a Russian mobster, has been involved in arms trafficking, prostitution, extortion and murder for hire. ""He has access to so much, including funding, including other criminal organizations, that he can, with a telephone call and order, affect the global economy,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Peter Kowenhoven. Mogilevich's alleged brutality, financial savvy and international influence have earned him a slot on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, though he has lived and operated from Moscow, Russia, for years.  Watch CNN report on Mogilevich » . ""He's a big man. He's a very powerful man,"" FBI Special Agent Mike Dixon said. ""I think more powerful than a John Gotti would be, because he has the ability to influence nations. Gotti never reached that stature."" He is accused of swindling Canadian and U.S. investors out of $150 million in a complex international financial scheme. It centered on a firm called YBM, which purportedly made magnets at a factory in Hungary. Authorities say the scheme involved preparing bogus financial books and records, lying to Securities and Exchange Commission officials, offering bribes to accountants and inflating stock values of YBM, which was headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania. In a raid in 1998, FBI agents found a treasure trove of documents -- purchase orders, invoices, shipping orders, even technical drawings -- everything a legitimate business would produce. But there was one thing missing. ""There were no magnets,"" Dixon said. It was all a sham, investigators say. ""In essence, what his companies were doing was moving money through bank accounts in Budapest and countries throughout the world and reporting these to the investment community as purchases of raw materials and sales of magnets,"" Dixon said. And because the company was publicly traded, anyone owning the stock would have made a lot of money. ""And of course Mogilevich controlled large, large blocks of stock from the outset, and he made a substantial amount of money in this process,"" Dixon said. Investors lost millions into the pockets of Mogilevich and his associates. He and his associates were indicted in 2003 on 45 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering. Russian authorities arrested him last year on tax fraud charges, but because the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, he remained beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. He is now free on bail. The FBI believes Mogilevich moved on after YBM and began manipulating international energy markets, giving him a large influence on other nations. Dixon noted that Mogilevich had control or influence over companies involved in natural gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine. Authorities say Mogilevich, who has an economics degree from Ukraine, is known for his ruthless nature but also for his business acumen, which led to his nickname ""the Brainy Don."" ""He has a very sophisticated, well-educated, loyal group of associates that he works with,"" Dixon said. ""He hires top-notch consultants, attorneys, risk management firms to assist him and protect him in his criminal ventures."" Louise Shelley, an organized crime expert from George Mason University, says Mogilevich is a new kind of criminal. ""The major criminal organizations in Russia have not only tapped into people with economics degrees,"" Shelley said. ""They've tapped into people with PHDs in finance and statistics who assist them."" The FBI hopes Mogilevich will eventually travel to a country that has an extradition treaty with the U.S. But, in case he doesn't, his wanted poster will be distributed all over Russia.","Semion Mogilevich accused of taking U.S., Canadian investors for $150 million .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating how an international flight into Atlanta's major airport landed on a taxiway instead of a runway early Monday. The pilots of the plane that landed at the Atlanta airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Delta Flight 60, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, was cleared to land about 6:05 a.m. Monday on Runway 27R but landed instead on Taxiway M, which runs parallel to the runway. The flight had 194 passengers and crew aboard, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. No other aircraft were on the taxiway, and there was no damage to either the taxiway or the plane, a Boeing 767, Bergen said. A runway or taxiway collision, particularly with one plane preparing to take off and carrying a full fuel load, would be catastrophic. Bergen said she isn't sure whether or when other aircraft have ever landed on the taxiway at Hartsfield. Both Runway 27R and Taxiway M are 11,890 feet long, Bergen said, but the runway is marked with white lights while the taxiway is marked with blue lights. Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board in their investigation, as well as conducting an internal investigation. The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations, Black said. Bergen and Black said a medical emergency was reported on the plane, but neither offered any details. The incursion came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent from the year that ended September 30, 2008, over the year ending on the same date this year. The FAA said there were 12 serious incursions in 2009 and 25 in 2008. Only two of the serious incursions involved commercial airliners in 2009, compared with nine in 2008. The FAA defines a serious incursion as one in which a collision is narrowly avoided, or there was a significant potential for collision that resulted in the need to take quick corrective action.","Plane landed on taxiway instead of runway Monday morning, FAA says .

"(CNN) -- The best way to get tongues wagging is to say nothing at all, and it's a skill Rihanna has down to a science. Rihanna apparently revealed the release date for her new album over Twitter. The Barbadian songstress arrived a bit late to the Twitter party when she -- or her people -- created a ""rihanna"" tag yesterday and sent out a single, sparse tweet: ""The Wait Is Ova. Nov. 23 09."" Whether that's the name of a new single, the beginning of a viral marketing campaign -- or both -- is unknown, but a representative for Rihanna told Entertainment Weekly that though the date ""looks accurate"" for her album release, ""The Wait Is Ova"" is not the album title. The only other object fans can mine for clues about the singer's upcoming release is the logo, a metallic nail fashioned into a crudely shaped ""R"" that has swarmed the Internet. The new record would be her fourth since her debut at 17. In the four years since, she's evolved from an unknown, breezy pop singer to a sonically and fashionably more distinct persona. One can only expect that her latest effort would continue to show that growth. Yet there are extra layers of anticipation surrounding the unnamed work: Not only is this Rihanna's follow-up to ""Good Girl Gone Bad,"" the album that made her an international superstar, it's also the first time she is piping up as a solo artist since the infamous fight with her ex-boyfriend, Chris Brown, in February. Those who've worked with the star on the record have said to expect something with more ferocity. ""Expect an edgier, almost angrier Rihanna on this one,"" Ne-Yo told E! Online. ""Rihanna says some things on this album that you've never heard her say before."" But, said Mariel Concepcion, associate editor for Billboard.com, that statement shouldn't be taken too literally. ""She has changed a bit, but I think she's simply grown. Fans are expecting her to reveal some details, but I think she's going to subliminally let it be known that 'Yes, [Chris] hurt me, but I'm moving forward with life.' This issue was such a serious issue, it calls for more than putting out an angry song about it."" Tracey Johnson, who said she's been a fan of the singer since the beginning, has high expectations for the upcoming release, but not because she expects to hear about Rihanna's personal life. ""[Some fans] feel like it would be good for her to represent abused women in some sort of way and say something, but in my perspective, she doesn't owe us anything,"" Johnson said. ""She's always been pretty private about the relationship, and she's never opened a lot in her music anyway."" If Rihanna maintains her silence, Johnson said, it will be ""kind of a hit back at the critics who said she disappeared after not becoming the spokesperson for domestic abuse. She's saying this is what you should be paying attention to: I'm a fashion icon, and I make great music."" Johnson, co-founder and editor of celebrity Web site NeonLimelight.com, has paid close attention to Rihanna's reported studio time over the past few months, but said he didn't expect to see the album appear so soon -- and with a tweet, no less. ""I'm definitely expecting more for this album,"" she said. ""Rihanna has a platform now that she didn't have before 'Good Girl Gone Bad.' She's gone a step forward with each album, and I think it's going to be a little more of what we heard on 'Good Girl Gone Bad,' but to the next level."" That's a prediction that Concepcion agrees with, considering that the people who have been pulled in on this album resemble the team who worked on ""Good Girl"": Justin Timberlake, Ne-Yo and Tricky Stewart, who was behind the single ""Umbrella"" that launched Rihanna to a new level of pop stardom. Devin Lazerine, editor of Rap-Up.com, said Stewart isn't trying to top the success of ""Umbrella,"" but rather create a sound that would live up to its success. ""Just from hearing 'Run This Town' we can see the direction she's heading in,"" Lazerine said. ""It's going to be darker and more edgy. She was actually going to put that song on this album, and then Jay-Z heard it and they traded songs."" Still, Lazerine said, ""dark"" and ""edgy"" don't always equal ""personal."" ""She's all about the music and the sound -- I think we're going to get something that embodies her fashion sense,"" he said. ""I don't think there's going to be much about the Chris Brown situation; I don't even think her fans expect that. They just want something that pushes the boundaries."" Rihanna's former other half, Chris Brown, has been busying in the studio as well.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Embattled Sen. Larry Craig accused police after his June arrest of trying to entrap him, but CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says he puts little faith in such a defense. A police mug shot of Sen. Larry Craig after he was arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in June. In a police recording released Thursday, the Idaho Republican denied that he was trying to engage in lewd behavior in a men's bathroom at a Minnesota airport. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. ""You shouldn't be out to entrap people,"" Craig said on the tape. The arresting officer denied Craig's accusation of entrapment.  Listen to police interview Craig » . CNN.com asked Toobin about how an entrapment defense might work in court. CNN.com: What's the legal definition of entrapment? TOOBIN: The key concept with entrapment is the idea of predisposition. A person is entrapped if they are lured into committing a crime that they are not otherwise predisposed to commit. Basically an entrapment defense shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove that the defendant was not predisposed to commit the crime. The question is, did the police entice you to do something that you didn't want to do in the first place? And the important point to raise about entrapment defenses is that they're rarely successful. And most juries tend to think that if you commit a crime, you did it of your own volition. CNN.com: What tactics do police employ to protect their sting operations from the entrapment defense? TOOBIN: Well, what they often do, which was not done here, is use tape recordings or video so the jury can see how anxious the defendant was to commit the crime. Tape and video is the best refutation of an entrapment defense. I think Craig had the possibility of raising an entrapment defense in this case. Now, I don't know if it would have been successful. What you have to remember about that tape is the officer's report says that Craig did a heck of a lot more than just pick up a piece of paper in the stall.  Watch how fellow Republicans are pressuring Craig to quit » . He rubbed his hand along the side of the stall, and he lingered outside and looked through the crack and rubbed his fingers together. I mean there were a whole series of signals. And the jury might very well have believed the officer rather than Craig. I don't mean to suggest that entrapment defense would have necessarily been successful, but it was not an implausible defense given the facts. The whole issue is moot because he pled. I don't take seriously his protestations of entrapment because he pled guilty. You know, he's not innocent until proven guilty. He's guilty. He's an intelligent, sophisticated man with access to lawyers, and he actually told the authorities that he'd consulted a lawyer. He had weeks to reflect on whether to plead guilty. It would have been one thing if the day of the offense, he signed a paper pleading guilty. He could have made the argument that he just panicked on the day of the offense. But there were weeks between the offense and the guilty plea. CNN.com: Is there any way that Craig could use entrapment as a defense to improve his case -- to work backward legally toward vindication? TOOBIN: Out of the question. No way.

"(CNN) -- A few seconds could have made all the difference in the fate of a family who spent three days lost in the snowy California woods, according to the helicopter pilot who found them. Josh and Lexi Dominguez exit a helicopter Wednesday, shortly after being found. The father of the family, Frederick Dominguez, came running out of the culvert where they had sought shelter when family members heard the sound of the California Highway Patrol helicopter Wednesday afternoon. ""Had he not been moving, we would not have seen him, because the tree line was very dense and he came climbing out of the culvert,"" helicopter pilot Steve Ward told CNN on Thursday. ""We were just very lucky."" Dominguez had arranged branches to spell the word ""help"" near the culvert, but rescuers didn't see that until they were turning the helicopter around after spotting Dominguez. The helicopter was on its way out of the area at that point, trying to get ahead of bad weather. ""The small window of opportunity we had to find them, it was nothing short of a miracle,"" paramedic David White, who was riding with Ward, told CNN on Thursday.  Watch White and Ward describe the rescue » . Dominguez and his three children had been lost in the snow since Sunday, when they set out to cut down a Christmas tree. They sought shelter first in a lean-to they made of branches, then in the culvert under a road.  See family's photos of their ordeal » . Dominguez said his daughter Lexi, 14, was the first to hear the helicopter overhead. He said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down. ""When they turned around, man, I was just praising God and saying, 'Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord,' because I knew we had made it,"" he said. Thursday, Lexi was hospitalized after complaining that her feet hurt. Trying to protect their cold, wet feet from frostbite was an ongoing problem while the four were lost in the forest. Through their three-day ordeal, the oldest son, Chris, 18, tried to keep his younger brother and sister optimistic. ""I didn't want them to really lose hope,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, hours after the family was rescued. ""Whenever they would freak out, I would just be like, it's all right. We're going to make it through this. This is nothing. Like, we have already been here a couple of days. What's a couple more days?""  Watch the family talk about their ""scary"" ordeal » . But it was hard to stay hopeful lost in rugged terrain, in heavy snow, with no food and few warm clothes. ""I just remember walking and walking and being like, we're not going to make it,"" said Lexi. ""They can't even see us through all this fog. And I just -- there was just a couple of times where I was really, really scared."" ""I didn't think we were going to make it,"" said Josh, 12. They removed their sodden socks in an effort to stay warm and dry while they waited for rescue, according to the rescuers who found them. They warmed their feet inside each other's shirts to help stave off frostbite. ""You just go to survival mode,"" Frederick Dominguez said. ""Every parent would do that. You would do anything, sacrifice yourself, because these are your kids.""  Watch mother as she finds out family is safe » . While the family huddled in the culvert, Lexi led them in impromptu singalongs. ""Someone would say, sing this song, and I would be like, OK,"" she recalled. ""We would all help her, too,"" her brother Josh added. Chris told CNN one of the things he would remember most about the experience was ""Lexi in there, in the tunnel, singing her heart out."" The four were reported missing Monday night by Dominguez's former wife and the children's mother, Lisa Sams, according to police in Paradise, California, a town of 27,000 people north of Sacramento. Although police found the family's car, it offered no clues as to where they might have gone. The remote area is beyond the reach of cell phones, authorities have said. More than 80 searchers scoured the woods Wednesday until the four were found about 1 p.m. White said the family was found north of where ground crews were searching. All four appeared to be in good condition as they were brought by chopper to the command post and taken to ambulances. After an emotional reunion with her mother Wednesday night, Lexi felt pain, said Brian Clarke, her mother's fiancee. ""She woke up in the middle of the night and her feet were hurting her really bad, so I carried her out to the van and Lisa took her to the hospital,"" he told CNN. ""She just kept saying, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.' I told her she didn't have to be sorry, we just wanted her to get better."" Her brothers have not complained of health problems that require hospitalization, he said. However, doctors asked the other three family members to come in for checkups, said Barbara Mejia, the girlfriend of Frederick Dominguez. Lexi was at Feather River Hospital in Paradise, California, on Thursday,  her father said. ""I'm glad I'm home. Praise God,"" Dominguez told reporters after exiting a chopper at the search command post. ""It was awful."" Asked how he survived, he replied, ""Jesus Christ."" Butte County Search and Rescue dispatcher Madde Watts said, ""They had angels with them, for sure."" Mayor Alan White said he and many others in and around Paradise have cut Christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished. When winter weather sours there, he said, people in the woods can get lost quickly. ""If you're 50 feet from your car, you might not be able to find it,"" he said. ""We weren't prepared at all,"" Chris said. ""We just thought we were going to go up to the mountains, get our tree and go back home. It didn't turn out that way.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Senate passed groundbreaking legislation Thursday that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity. President Obama has said the country must make significant changes to ensure equal rights. The expanded federal hate crimes law now goes to President Obama's desk. Obama has pledged to sign the measure, which was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill. President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure. The bill is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998, and James Byrd Jr., an African-American man dragged to death in Texas the same year. ""Knowing that the president will sign it, unlike his predecessor, has made all the hard work this year to pass it worthwhile,"" said Judy Shepard, board president of the Matthew Shepard Foundation named for her son. ""Hate crimes continue to affect far too many Americans who are simply trying to live their lives honestly, and they need to know that their government will protect them from violence, and provide appropriate justice for victims and their families."" Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate-crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality. Attorney General Eric Holder has asserted that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs. Holder called Thursday's 68-29 Senate vote to approve the defense spending bill that included the hate crimes measure ""a milestone in helping protect Americans from the most heinous bias-motivated violence."" Watch survivor of attack discuss legislation » . ""The passage of this legislation will give the Justice Department and our state and local law enforcement partners the tools we need to deter and prosecute these acts of violence,"" he said in a statement. Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, called the measure ""our nation's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people."" ""Too many in our community have been devastated by hate violence,"" Solmonese said in a statement. ""We now can begin the important steps to erasing hate in our country."" This month, Obama told the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay rights group, that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians. ""Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open,"" he said during his address at the dinner for the Human Rights Campaign. ""This fight continues now, and I'm here with the simple message: I'm here with you in that fight."" Among other things, Obama has called for the repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military, the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. He also has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act. The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage, for federal purposes, as a legal union between a man and a woman. It allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. The Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers. More than 77,000 hate-crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007, or ""nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade,"" Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. The FBI, Holder added, reported 7,624 hate-crime incidents in 2007, the most current year with complete data.","NEW: Senate approves bill expanding hate crimes law .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- During the current economic crisis, high-flying women have been overlooked for promotion, according to a study out Tuesday. At the upper level of management, business is still dominated by men. The study, by U.S. nonprofit research group Catalyst, surveyed 873 MBA alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007, asking how their careers had fared between November 2007 and June 2009. The results showed that overall, male and female MBAs have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the U.S., Canada and Asia, with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period, compared to 36 percent of men. However in Europe, just 26 per cent of women were promoted, compared with 44 percent of men, according to the study published in the Harvard Business Review. According to the Harvard Business Review, of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies only two per cent of the CEOs are women, and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women. Professor Susan Vinnicombe is the director of the Center for International Women Business Leaders at Cranfield University School of Management in England. She told CNN that while it isn't clear why the figures for Europe in particular show such a gender discrepancy, it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general. Read more business related features . ""There is a whole stream of research of male and female MBAs that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion,"" she said. ""Immediately after the MBA -- at the mid level -- women do quite well, but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider. That's not just for MBAs, it's the function of men and women in the workforce in general."" When it comes to the top tier, women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs, with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs, compared with six per cent of men. Eleanor Tabi Haller-Jorden, General Manager of Catalyst Europe told CNN that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise. ""These figures reflect what has been a challenge in Europe for a number years,"" she said. ""The talent pipeline in Europe is clearly not as robust for women. This study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis, but it may have magnified the discrepancy."" Haller-Jorden cites European corporate culture, perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes, exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy. Cranfield University produces what it calls the ""Female FTSE Index,"" showing the percentage of female directors in Britain's top 100 companies. Vinnicombe says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved, increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent. Vinnicombe adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the British banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs, rather than work in a ""high pressure, highly controlling"" work environment brought about by the economic crisis. The Catalyst study also shows that many MBAs aren't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement. Overall, 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move. ""The data almost indicates business as usual, in highly unusual times for business,"" Haller-Jorden told CNN. The common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty, employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market, but the study found that MBAs have been willing to risk career moves, with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs, 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business. Haller-Jorden said that MBAs represent ""high-potential employees"" who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative. She added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers, seeking out new developmental opportunities, exploring lateral moves, looking at options around relocating, and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they aren't negatively impacted by recession. ""The results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and wouldn't necessarily be exploring other options,"" she said. ""For companies to rest on their laurels and assume they don't need to worry about retention is a mistake.""","Study: High-flying women are missing out on promotion .

"(CNN) -- At least 30 people died and 70 were wounded in shelling on a marketplace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Thursday, according to journalists and emergency services. Members of Islamist militia Al-Shaabab patrol Bakara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, earlier this month. A local journalist called the rocket fire on Bakara market ""unprecedented."" ""This was the most brutal shelling,"" according to an ambulance service representative who said they had picked up 61 wounded, but expect the number to climb. Other victims were being brought to hospitals by family and friends. The source of the shelling could not immediately be determined. Journalists saw shell fire coming from AMISOM -- the African Union Mission in Somalia -- strongholds in a fortified district of the capital and from near the airport. AMISOM is the only force in the area believed to have the firepower capable of such an intense attack. However, AMISOM denied any involvement in the incident. The African Union has a 3,400-member peacekeeping force in Somalia, made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda. It operates under a U.N. mandate to support Somalia's transitional federal government. The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. It is the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government. African Union forces have been battling an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia in Somalia called Al-Shaabab. The United States is supporting the Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces. Al-Shaabab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. The United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power in early 2007. Ethiopia invaded Somalia with the support of Somalia's weak transitional government.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Justice Department on Thursday announced 300 additional arrests in a four-year operation that it says produced nearly 1,200 arrests and seizures totaling 11.7 tons of illegal drugs. Authorities look through seized property after a drug raid at a house near Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the wrap-up of Project Coronado, which resulted in arrests in 15 states in the past two days. Holder said the operation targeted the distribution network of a major Mexican drug trafficking organization known as La Familia. About 3,000 federal agents participated in the investigation and raids, officials said. ""This unprecedented, coordinated U.S. law enforcement action -- the largest ever undertaken against a Mexican drug cartel -- has dealt a significant blow to La Familia's supply chain of illegal drugs, weapons and cash flowing between Mexico and the United States,"" Holder said in a news conference.  Watch Holder announce the arrests » . Michele Leonhart, acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said the cartel was known for specializing in the trafficking of methamphetamine and for its brutal violence, including beheadings. Authorities said the arrests made Wednesday and Thursday occurred in California, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Dozens of arrests occurred in the Dallas, Texas, area where agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives filed charges against cartel members believed to have illegally purchased and shipped high-powered firearms to the cartel, which was based in the Mexican state of Michoacan. U.S. officials vowed to indict cartel leaders and extradite them to the United States. One leader, Servando Gomez-Martinez, was indicted in New York on Thursday. He remains at large, and is presumed to be in Mexico. A senior law enforcement official involved in the operation, who asked not to be identified, said he was certain the latest crackdown on La Familia would affect the methamphetamine market in the United States for months. ""It'll make a difference not only because of how hard we hit 'em, but where we hit 'em,"" the official said. Another official said during the course of the investigation that labs run by La Familia had been discovered in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Jose, California. To date, Project Coronado has led to 1,186 arrests in 44 months. During that time, agents seized $32.8 million in U.S. currency, and about 1,225 kilograms (2,700 pounds) of methamphetamine, 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds) of cocaine, 13 kilograms (29 pounds) of heroin and more than 8 tons (7,200 kilograms) of marijuana.","In past two days, Project Coronado resulted in arrests in 15 states .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Authorities are seeking the public's assistance in identifying a teenage girl who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home -- or even her own name. The teen has recalled an excerpt from the fantasy novel ""Fool's Fate"" by Robin Hobb. ""I just want to know who I am,"" the girl says in a statement released by the New York City Administration for Children's Services. The teen, who is being referred to as Jane Doe, continues, ""I want to know who I am and what happened to me."" The Caucasian young woman, described by New York ACS as ""very soft-spoken,"" is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, light-skinned, with short, straight, cropped blond hair and blue eyes. Doctors are estimating her age to be between 14 and 17. ACS Commissioner John B. Mattingly appealed to the public in a statement, ""asking anyone who may know this young woman to help us locate her family as quickly as possible, so we can safely reunite her with those who love her."" The girl was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization tells CNN that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. According to its Web site, with nearly 7,000 youths seeking shelter per year, ""Covenant House New York is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth."" A security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department. Police officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. The NYPD said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered. Children's Services said the girl recently wrote down the name ""Amber"" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name. On another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel ""Fool's Fate"" by Robin Hobb. The girl is also apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, ""who's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom,"" says the young woman. The girl has a 2- to 4-inch scar on her lower left back and had a black, handwritten birthday message on her arm, addressed to a name of Japanese origin, when she was found, police said Friday. Judging from poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appears to have been living on the streets for some time. ""This case has been going on since October 9,"" Zimmerman said. ""Today is the 23rd, and we're vey concerned. It's been a very long time now. That's a long time frame to not identify somebody. Especially someone who we believe is a juvenile. Usually juveniles we get a lot of inquiries about."" While the girl is confused and her story remains vague, Mattingly said, ""she is safe with us, and we are doing all we can to help her, but she needs to find her family."" She is apparently reviewing materials for a high school GED exam, saying that she is able to do the math but has no recollection of studying the history and science portions. However, according to the Children's Services statement, the young woman ""can easily retain the information.""

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican said Tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the Catholic Church. The Vatican says more Anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the Catholic Church. The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion. The parishes would be led by former Anglican clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as Catholic priests, said the Rev. James Massa, ecumenical director of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""This sets up a process for whole groups of Anglicans -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the Catholic Church while retaining their forms of worship and other Anglican traditions,"" Massa said. The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships, said Cardinal William Joseph Levada, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Their talks with the Vatican recently began speeding up, Vatican officials said, leading to Tuesday's announcement. ""The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion,"" Levada said. Levada said ""hundreds"" of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church. Among them are 50 Anglican bishops, said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship. While married Anglican priests may be ordained as Catholic priests, the same does not apply to married Anglican bishops, Levada said. ""We've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we've not anticipated it happening now,"" Di Noia said. ""The Holy Spirit is at work here."" One interested group is the Traditional Anglican Communion, an association of churches that is separate from the Anglican Communion and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide. The TAC in 2007 petitioned the Vatican for unity with the Catholic Church with the stipulation that the group retain its Anglican rites. The TAC's primate, Archbishop John Hepworth of Australia, said in a statement Tuesday that the Vatican's announcement ""more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago."" That is because the Vatican's move involves not only the TAC but other Anglican groups that want to unite with the Catholic Church, said the Right Rev. Daren K. Williams, bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the Anglican Church of America, which is part of the TAC. The Vatican has yet to release all details of the offer, and the TAC's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does, Williams said. But Williams said he believes much of TAC will respond favorably. Williams, who also is rector of All Saints Anglican Church in Fountain Valley, California, said his parishioners have generally been ""very warmly receiving"" Tuesday's announcement. ""It is encouraging for them to know their worship experience wouldn't be turned upside down by the Roman Catholic Church,"" Williams said. ""The person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray. We might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office, in addition to praying for our primate. ""Really, there'd be very little other difference."" The parishes retaining the Anglican rites would answer not to Catholic bishops but to regional or nationwide ""personal ordinariates"" who would report to the pope, Massa said. Those officials often will be former Anglican clergy, Vatican officials said. The Church of England said the move ends a ""period of uncertainty"" for Anglican groups who wanted more unity with the Catholic Church. Both groups have a ""substantial overlap in faith, doctrine and spirituality"" and will continue to hold official dialogues, the archbishops of Canterbury and Westminster said in a joint statement. ""Those Anglicans who have approached the Holy See have made clear their desire for full, visible unity in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church,"" Levada said. ""At the same time, they have told us of the importance of their Anglican traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey."" Preserving Anglican traditions, such as mass rites, adds to the diversity of the Catholic Church, he said. ""The unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity, as the history of Christianity shows,"" he said. ""Moreover, the many diverse traditions present in the Catholic Church today are all rooted in the principle articulated by St. Paul in his letter to the Ephesians: 'There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' "" CNN's Hada Messia and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Vatican opens door to disillusioned Anglicans wanting to join Catholic Church .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's eldest son and a top official in his media empire, says his father was ""always there for me."" Pier Silvio Berlusconi,  vice president of the Mediaset group, in Cologno Monzese, Italy in March, 2009. Berlusconi, 40, is vice chairman of Mediaset SpA, the Italian commercial television network founded by his father and now owned by the Berlusconi family through the holding company, Fininvest. He's held several positions at the company since joining in 1992, at the age of 23, following a serious motorcycle accident. He started in the marketing department of Publitalia, the company's advertising group. Four years later, he was appointed director of scheduling and program coordination for Mediaset's three channels.

The younger Berlusconi, the prime minister's second child, says he grew up in a ""totally normal family ... at least until my father began to go into work in politics. It was a normal family, a healthy family."" Asked what makes a normal Italian family, the younger Berlusconi replied: ""A normal Italian family is where certain values are always very present. Some of these values are connected to being a family. Being closer to each other and respecting certain traditions, being there for one another."" Pier Silvio and Marina Berlusconi, the prime minister's oldest child and also a top official in his media empire, the billionaire entrepreneur's children with first wife, Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio. The couple divorced in 1985 and Berlusconi went on to marry actress Veronica Lario, with whom he had three more children. In May of this year, Lario announced she was filing for divorce after the Italian press reported the prime minister attended the birthday party of an 18-year-old Neapolitan model. Asked what he learned from his father, Pier Silvio Berlusconi said that as a young boy, his father taught him normal father-son things like ""how to swim"" and play tennis. The most important thing he taught him in life though, he told CNN, was ""respect for other people. I am impressed by how much respect he always has for the other person."" The younger Berlusconi said he got into his father's business by accident in 1992 after suffering a terrible motorbike accident. ""I had a very bad motorbike accident when I was 20 years old,"" Pier Silvio Berlusconi told CNN. ""I couldn't walk for one year. After that, I decided I wanted to do something more than just being in college."" He then joined Mediaset, which was not listed on the stock market at the time. Berlusconi says when his father decided to go into politics in 1994 -- something the elder Berlusconi says he did to stop the advance of the Left in Italy -- ""he totally disappeared."" ""In Mediaset, in our company, he was very very present and operative before and he stopped being here. He stopped existing basically,"" Berlusconi said. ""From there on, my job was a continuous revolution and I started looking into things I never thought I would have. In three or four years, I found myself completely into the veins of the company and having important responsibility."" He said his father ""never even knew exactly what I was doing or what my work was. I know this can sound strange, but it is the way things went."" Pier Silvio Berlusconi says he has no plans to follow his father into the political arena, however, saying politics is not something you can learn. ""You have it or you don't have it,"" he said. Asked to describe his flamboyant father in a few words, Pier Silvio Berlusconi replied: ""Positive energy."" ""He's like a battery,"" he said, ""full of energy always, always positive, towards people, towards things he has to do, towards problems which he always tries to do everything he can to resolve."" ""He is really unique in as far as how much passion and devotion he puts into what he does,"" his son told CNN. ""He did a lot as a businessman and now as a politician."" Asked about the passion his dad feels for his sports team, Italian soccer team AC Milan, Pier Silvio Berlusconi said: ""When my father went into Milan, the passion became a really big passion."" ""We had many many happy times connected to Milan,"" Pier Silvio Berlusconi said, ""so it is not only a passion that has to do with a sport. ""For me, it is part of my family and what my father has done."" CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this story.","Berlusconi's eldest son says he grew up in a ""totally normal family""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An Oscar-winning songwriter was indicted on charges of sexually assaulting women whom he would fly in to New York under the impression they were auditioning for movie roles, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said Tuesday. Songwriter Joe Brooks is best known for writing ""You Light Up My Life"" and directing the movie. Joseph Brooks, 71, faces multiple charges including rape, criminal sexual act, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, grand larceny and criminal mischief. The charges involve 11 women, authorities said. Brooks won the Oscar for best original song for the 1977 song, ""You Light Up My Life."" He also directed the movie, which is about a director who has a one-night stand with an actress. ""I'm flabbergasted,"" said actress Melanie Mayron, who starred in ""You Light Up My Life."" Mayron said she did not stay in contact with Brooks over the years but described him as a ""lovely man."" In the indictment, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau alleges that Brooks would fly women in from California, Florida and Oregon for private auditions. He would serve the women one or two glasses of wine, said Lisa Friel, assistant district attorney. The women described feelings that suggest a date-rape drug was used, she said, but added that toxicology results were unclear. Shawni Lucier, Brooks' personal assistant, was also charged with criminal facilitation in connection with arranging some of the encounters. Brooks pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday. Bail was set at $500,000 bond or $250,000 cash. The suspect agreed to the terms and left the courthouse. He is set to return Thursday morning and meet the bail agreement, said Jeffery C. Hoffman, his lawyer. Hoffman said some of the women who made the accusations were trying out for a role in a screenplay Brooks wrote. None of the girls was chosen for the part and may feel ""upset about that fact,"" the lawyer said. Hoffman said he is looking forward to proving his client's innocence. ""All I can say is, my client is anxious to clear his name of these false charges,"" he added.","""You Light Up My Life"" songwriter Joseph Brooks indicted .

"GREENVILLE, South Carolina -- Some are girlish 22-year-olds; others are women approaching 40. They come from South Carolina's rural counties and its booming cities. They are loud and muted, lively and vacant, hopeful and desperate. A pregnant Ashley Hendrix sought treatment at Serenity Place for her painkiller addiction. As different as they are, they share a connection to two powerful forces : their addictions and their babies. They are swallowed by the same shameful past. They don't know if they can be good mothers. They don't know if they can be clean mothers. They're here at a state-run drug-treatment program to learn how to do both. On this summer day, Ashley Hendrix, 24, is eight months pregnant with her first child and one of 16 women at the Phoenix Center's Serenity Place. This is her last shot to get clean -- or face jail. South Carolina's state supreme court is alone in upholding the prosecution of pregnant women for the damage drugs might do to their unborn children. Across the country, local and state agencies have found ways to prosecute pregnant women for drug use, but the cases are often rejected by the courts. And judges in more than two dozen states have overturned decisions that criminalize pregnant addicts. In recent years, Missouri and North Dakota have ruled against charging pregnant women with neglect and endangerment. Illegal substances -- marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription drugs -- consumed Hendrix for more than a decade. ""To this day, I still cry about it, "" she said, ""that if anything does come out wrong with my baby, I know that my drug use is the reason why. Since 1989, at least 126 women in South Carolina have been arrested during their pregnancies, according to the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Most were charged with drug and alcohol use that posed harm to the fetus the woman was carrying. During the same period, only about 80 pregnant women were arrested on similar charges in all other states combined. ""Word on the street"" in South Carolina, says Stephen Donaldson, program manager of a drug-treatment facility in Charleston County, ""is if you use during pregnancy, you're being prosecuted or you're losing your baby."" Over the last 15 years, that message has driven many women to Serenity Place, a residential treatment center designed for pregnant women and new mothers. Here, the ultimate goal is to help the women recover from their addiction but Serenity also strives to give the women the confidence to become better mothers. They want the women to know there are second chances, and there is hope. ""I'm grateful everyday for being here and I'm grateful to have my baby with me,"" says a freckled Kim Clark, 28, who gave birth to her son Jaelyn at the center. ""I've been using drugs since I was 11 years old. I didn't know any other life. And I've learned a lot about myself. I've been taught things here."" She graduated in August, has her own apartment now and works to support herself and her son. Some women arrive here voluntarily. Others were sent by the state's Department of Social Services. Others made a plea bargain with the courts, allowing them one last chance at treatment to avoid prison. ""My biggest fear was the [health of the] baby, but right behind that was that 'I'm going to go to jail',"" says Sandria Doremus, one of Hendrix' classmates at Serenity. Afraid of being turned in for her opiate addiction, she delayed getting prenatal care. ""I should have gone in a lot sooner,"" she admits. Doremus, 37, arrived at Serenity after a hospital reported her drug use to law enforcement officials, as required by law. She has sandy blond hair and warm blue eyes that open up her leathered face. She cuddled her 8-month-old son, Matthew, when CNN visited the center in July. Born with heroin in his system, Matthew was placed on methadone. Today, he is healthy, but studies show drug-exposed babies can face developmental delays and learning disabilities in later years.  Watch the women of Serenity Place share their story » . In 1997, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that a fetus in the third trimester was viable and charges of child abuse, neglect and murder could apply to the mother. Some treatment providers and advocacy experts say this ruling opened the door for prosecutors to charge pregnant women. ""These are addicts who become pregnant,"" says Lynn Paltrow, executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. ""They aren't women who chose to use drugs after becoming pregnant."" 'If I didn't have pills, I felt like I had nothing' Hendrix's drug addiction started long before her pregnancy. She was born into a world of drugs. She says her mother was an addict, her father a violent alcoholic who once held a shotgun to her grandmother's head. Hendrix's grandparents rescued her at age 3 by taking her into their home in rural Union, South Carolina. She has fond memories of her grandfather, but one morning, shortly after her 12th birthday, Hendrix watched her 54-year-old grandfather die from a heart attack. The innocent girl started experimenting with drugs, partly because she couldn't cope with her feelings, she says, but mostly to fit in. By the time she turned 18, marijuana use gave way to cocaine and methamphetamine. Then she discovered prescription painkillers: Lower tabs. OxyContin. Percocet. ""It wasn't even about being high anymore. It was just being able to cope with everyday life,"" Hendrix says. ""If I didn't have the pills, I felt like I had nothing."" Hendrix could no longer leave bed without the painkillers. Her routine consisted of melting OxyContin pills with water, placing the mixture into a syringe and shooting up, even during her pregnancy. By April of this year, she was six months pregnant and on probation for stealing jewelry to feed her drug habit. She took herself to Serenity Place. Tucked alongside empty factories in a once-thriving textile district, the center looks more like a college dormitory inside than a sterile treatment center. Homemade posters, photo collages and cards congratulating the women for giving birth are strewn along the hallways. There is a communal kitchen and colorful playgrounds. Research shows women who remain with their children during treatment have better chances of defeating their addictions. But a national study in 2005 found that only 3 percent of treatment centers had programs  tailored specifically to pregnant women. About 14 percent of treatment centers accepted pregnant or postpartum women. The women at Serenity Place follow a rigid schedule that includes therapy, parenting classes and chores. They aren't allowed phone calls or the freedom to surf the Internet without permission. Security cameras guard all exits. The structure can be particularly hard for addicts who grew up in dysfunctional households with few rules. Women spend on average six months in treatment. If a woman violates the rules, she can be removed from the program. On some occasions, women have walked out of the center, leaving their newborns behind. Why prosecute? Why should addicted women be given a chance at motherhood? What about the welfare of the children? These are the questions asked by South Carolina prosecutors, known as solicitors general. Several solicitors general contacted by CNN declined to comment on how many such cases they have prosecuted, but they say that charging pregnant women has become less common in the state. Bob Ariail, solicitor of Greenville, says his district's policy is a far cry from the 1990s, when then-South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, an anti-abortion advocate, publicly declared he would aggressively crack down on pregnant mothers accused of substance abuse. Condon often referred to a fetus as his ""fellow South Carolinian."" Despite several phone calls by CNN, Condon, who is now a private lawyer in South Carolina, could not be reached for comment. In his two decades as a Democratic state representative, Joe Neal of Columbia, South Carolina, has pushed for more drug treatment funding, an effort he says has little chance in these tough economic times. ""Drug treatment?"" says Neal. ""South Carolina's response to addiction has been incarceration not treatment."" But Wanda McMichael, manager of women's services at Serenity Place, knows treatment can be beneficial. She guides women like Hendrix and the others through that process. Some who graduated from the program when it began in 1993 still remain clean. ""What's the other alternative if they don't come here?"" says McMichael. ""It's prison. That costs more than treatment, but a lot of people don't know that. If these women don't get this treatment, they are going to die."" A healthy baby, a new hope . Most of the women at Serenity Place say they were little girls the first time they used drugs, some as young as 8. Many could not recall what sobriety felt like until they came to the center. Hendrix says her own mother was 15 when she gave birth to her and then abandoned her. ""She was real pretty. Blond hair, pale skin like me,"" Hendrix says. ""I have her nose and lips. She just didn't respect herself."" Hendrix doesn't want to be like her mother. Her son, who was born July 24, is healthy. In August, Hendrix left Serenity for an intensive outpatient treatment program, and she and her baby live with her grandmother in Union. Of the 16 women enrolled in Serenity in July, half have graduated, program directors say. Six continue receiving treatment and two have left the center. Three women are on a waiting list to get in, including one who is pregnant. Hendrix hopes to get her GED and enroll in the University of South Carolina to study psychology next year. ""I am happy today,"" she says, ""and that's something I haven't felt in a long time. ""My grandmother. My baby. They make me happy. But you know, it's not about them, jail or none of that anymore. That all changed. I am doing this for me.""","Serenity Place in South Carolina caters treatment programs to pregnant addicts .

"Dixon, Illinois (CNN)  -- William Heirens, the ""Lipstick Killer,"" is believed to be the longest-serving inmate in the United States. He turns 81 on November 15. Diabetes has ravaged his body, but his mind is sharp. ""Bill's never allowed himself to be institutionalized,"" said Dolores Kennedy, his long-time friend and advocate. ""He's kept himself focused on the positives."" The days are spent mostly watching television and reading magazines. Using a wheelchair and sharing a cell with a roommate in the health unit of Dixon Correctional Center, he still yearns for a chance at freedom. It is something he has not tasted since 1946. Heirens has been locked behind bars and walls for 63 years, making inmate C06103 the longest-serving prisoner in Illinois history, state officials say. According to Steven Drizin, the legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, Heirens ""has served longer than anyone in the U.S. that I can find."" He was put away a year after the end of World War II. It is a dubious record, but fitting for the man dubbed the Lipstick Killer, whose crime spree remains among the most infamous in the history of Chicago, the city of Capone and Leopold and Loeb. The scar-faced gangster and the thrill-kill pair are long gone. Heirens, however, has not slipped into the past. He lives in the present and hopes for a future outside prison. Supporters have championed his cause, convinced that he is innocent, or arguing that he has been rehabilitated, a model inmate who has served his sentence. ""Pray for my release,"" he wrote in a letter dated October 11. ""There is no reason to keep this man behind bars,"" said Drizin. ""He meets all the criteria for parole."" While Drizin, who has represented Heirens since 2001, and others passionately plead for his release and prepare to re-petition the state parole board that has consistently refused to free Heirens, others are convinced he is a manipulative murderer. ""He was the bogeyman,"" said Betty Finn of the man convicted of strangling her sister. ""I don't think you need to feel sorry for him. He chose his life and he chose his actions."" Josephine Ross was the first victim. The 43-year-old was found stabbed to death in her apartment. She was killed on June 5, 1945. In December, police discovered the body of Frances Brown in her bathroom. She was stabbed through the neck and shot in the head. The killer left a message on the wall. It said, ""for heavens sake catch me before I kill more I cannot control myself."" It was scrawled in red lipstick. The press seized on the detail. The headlines would soon scream of the Lipstick Killer. Four weeks later, an intruder used a ladder to enter the second-floor window of Suzanne Degnan's bedroom. The killer approached the sleeping 6-year-old girl and abducted her. ""I was old enough to know everything that happened and remember the looks on my parents' faces,"" Finn said of the crime against her younger sister. ""Can you imagine as a child to have this happen? Can you imagine going to bed at night and all of a sudden your sister is not in her bed?"" There would be a ransom note demanding $20,000. But there would also be the horrific discovery of Suzanne's severed head in a sewer. Other body parts were found within days. Chicago was gripped in fear. Scores of people were questioned, but the investigation dragged on for months without a break. One, however, came in June, when two police officers confronted a burglar near the Degnan home. The young thief was a 17-year-old student at the University of Chicago. His name was William Heirens, and police soon became convinced he was the killer. Drizin said Heirens was subjected to days of brutal interrogation. He also was beaten and given sodium pentothal to make him tell the truth, Drizin said. He underwent a spinal tap, another extreme measure to compel him to talk. Prosecutors said his handwriting matched that of the words scribbled in lipstick at the scene of the Brown killing. The FBI determined that a fingerprint lifted from the Degnan ransom note matched Heirens. That gave the state's attorney two powerful pieces of evidence against Heirens. But a confession would seal his fate. On August 7, 1946, Heirens supplied it, describing how he killed Degnan, Brown and Ross. He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder. In exchange for the plea, Heirens was spared the death penalty and given three consecutive life sentences. Heirens has distinguished himself in prison. He was the first inmate in Illinois to receive a college degree. ""He helped redesign the library system in the department of corrections,"" said Drizin, who also commended Heirens for becoming a ""first-rate jailhouse lawyer."" Drizin said Heirens has been eligible for parole nearly every year since the 1970s. The Center on Wrongful Convictions mounted a clemency campaign for Heirens on the grounds that he has served longer than required, and that the evidence used to convict him was unreliable. ""Smoke and mirrors"" was how Drizin described it. Kennedy, who wrote a book that attempts to prove Heirens is innocent, said a political component is keeping him in prison. ""It's a very political case,"" she said. ""Authorities have made statements that he would never get out. I think the courts managed to look the other way and the [parole] board didn't want to take the heat."" John Russick, senior curator for the Chicago History Museum, said the story of William Heirens is complicated. ""This is not a largely understood case,"" Russick said. ""People know the term Lipstick Killer, and that there was a sensational crime, but I don't think it's talked about in detail."" He added, ""I feel like it defies logic, and that's what's troubling about it. When you look closely at the nature of these kinds [of confessions] and when you know how these confessions were acquired, there's enough there to -- at the very least -- to make you feel very unsure."" Frank Czagany, who met Heirens when both were working in the machine shop at U.S. Steel in 1944, remembers his friend as being ""very quiet, not wild."" ""He wouldn't say crap if he had a mouthful of it,"" Czagany said. Finn calls the efforts supporting Heirens misguided. ""I'm not a vindictive person, I'm not doing this out of anger. It's fear,"" she said. ""There is no evidence that says he's the least bit innocent. How can every single court be wrong?"" Finn, who attended Heirens' most recent parole hearing, in July, said he is not innocent by any stretch of the imagination. ""Keep him locked in jail,"" she said. Kennedy said she and others are looking for a suitable placement in a nursing home for Heirens. She said she believes there is some indication that if an acceptable facility is located, he may have a chance to spend his final days a free man. ""He looks for any glimmer of hope,"" said Kennedy. ""He still wants to be out."" Drizin said that time has come. ""This is a case where I have serious doubts about his guilt,"" he said. ""But it's a case where there is no question in my mind that the circus-like atmosphere that pervaded his arrest and his prosecution resulted in a trial proceeding for Bill and a guilty plea that was fundamentally unfair."" ""They probably have good hearts and are dedicated,"" Finn said of Heirens' believers. ""He is not innocent by any stretch, no matter how they twist it.""","William Heirens may be the longest-serving prison innate in the United States .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Don't confuse Katey Sagal for Peg Bundy -- it's a common mistake. Katey Sagal says being a mother has been her greatest teacher -- for all her roles. While her infamous alter ego was uneducated, Katey is thoughtful and well-spoken; Peg's fashion is time-warped (hello, bouffant!), Katey's is earthy; for every ounce of laziness in Peg's body, Katey has a multitasking one to match. It may have taken years for the actress to shake her TV counterpart, but watch Katey as fierce matriarch Gemma Morrow on FX's motorcycle drama ""Sons of Anarchy"" (which was released on DVD Tuesday), and you'll start to wonder, ""Peg who?"" Rachel Bertsche: You're known for playing three very different mothers -- ""Married with Children's"" Peg Bundy, Kate from ""8 Simple Rules"" and now Gemma. Plus, you have three kids of your own, two teenagers and a 2 1/2-year-old. Given all that on- and off-screen mothering experience, is there any universal quality that you would say all moms have? Katey Sagal: Being a mother has been my greatest teacher and also the most self-sacrificing thing I've ever done. I've never loved anybody the way I love my children. It's an experience I was surprised by. You have your boyfriend, your husband, your friends, but it's a different thing. It's deeper, and it's a fantastic -- and risky -- commitment to love that deeply. I think the characters I've played all have that quality, even Peg Bundy. She was devoted and loyal to her children in her own wacky way. But Gemma is intensely dedicated to her family and would do anything to protect her son and her extended family, which is the club. In my personal life, I don't know that I would go to the lengths for my kids that Gemma does, but close. Bertsche: You were Peg Bundy before you were actually a mom. Once you had your first child, id having firsthand experience change the way you played her? Sagal: Well, I've always been a maternal type, but yes, everything was different once I had kids. Your whole perspective on the world changes -- I love how I wasn't so self-obsessed anymore! I can't say my characterizations of Peggy necessarily changed much. I just understood more what I was doing. Bertsche: You mentioned your husband, Kurt Sutter, who is also the creator of your show. What's it like to mix family with business? Sagal: Most of the time it's super great. There are moments when it's not, of course, but most of the time it's nice because we actually get to see each other. His job is intense, so he doesn't get a day like I have today where he can stay home from work. When I'm there, we can sometimes have lunch together, stuff like that. The hard part gets to be like ""OK, maybe we should talk about something else."" It becomes the constant topic of conversation, the show and the kids, and we have to make a conscious effort to say, ""Let's not talk about it tonight."" Bertsche: People used to say that women of ""a certain age"" -- over 40 -- couldn't find any roles in Hollywood. That's certainly not true anymore, especially on cable, and you might be playing one of the toughest women out there. Why do think that has changed? Sagal: I don't know why it's changed, but I'm really grateful it has. Maybe it has to do with the fact that we're all living longer and suddenly it's okay to get older. Maybe there's a broader audience for these characters. The stories you can tell about older women are deeper. Plus, cable has opened up enormous possibilities. In feature films, you're still lucky if you're not the girlfriend or the wife. But I just read yesterday that Dianne Keaton is going to be on television now, she's doing a series with HBO, so TV is where our stories are being told. Bertsche: Gemma's a pretty controversial character. How do you feel about her? Sagal: I really like her. I like that she's flawed but she doesn't think that she is. She's survived a lot, and people like that tend to live in a lot of denial. She knows how to get through life in her way, and she doesn't question it. It's just, ""This is how it is."" For instance, I don't think Gemma's ever been to therapy. She's not that girl. What you see is what you get. Bertsche: What's on tap for her this season? Sagal: Something very dark happens. The club is going to go through some turmoil -- when you live an outlaw lifestyle, that's the risk you take. As my husband says, this season is all about loyalties. Henry Rollins and Adam Arkin are on the show this year, and they ... well, I don't want to say too much, but they're not really good guys. Bertsche: I promised a co-worker I'd ask you about ""Lost."" She's dying to know if your character, Helen, is really dead. Even though we saw the grave, she doesn't believe it's the full story. Got anything on that? Sagal: I was just reading an article this morning at the gym about how they were going to bring back people who were dead on ""Lost,"" and they didn't mention me! Nobody tells me anything. I'm always thinking that Helen should come back and show up on the island, but as of today, no one's sent me a plane ticket to Hawaii. So I don't think it's going to happen, but I don't know.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A train collision in northern India killed at least 13 people early Wednesday. Indian Railway Protection Force personnel look at a damaged carriage after the collision Wednesday. The death toll remained uncertain. Railway officials said 13 people were killed and 15 injured in the crash. But the top administrative official of Mathura, where the collision occurred, put the number of dead at 21, with about as many injured. The Goa Express slammed into the stationary Mewar Express apparently because the driver overshot a signal to stop, said Anant Swaroop, spokesman for India's northern railway. Indian Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee ordered an inquiry into the crash, according to CNN's sister station in India, CNN-IBN. The Goa Express, bound for New Delhi from the western coastal state of Goa, was running on the same track as the Mewar, which shuttles between New Delhi and Udaipur, in western Rajasthan state. Both trains have stops in Mathura, about 90 miles south of New Delhi. Rescuers had to cut trapped passengers from a wrecked car of the Mewar Express. The car had a special compartment for women, disabled passengers, cargo and train guards, said Aditya Verma, a senior police official in Mathura. Bannerjee said victims' relatives would receive compensation of about $10,000, according to CNN-IBN. Several other trains that go through the Mathura station had to be diverted. Trains are the most widely used mode of transportation for national travel in India. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh in New Delhi contributed to this report.","NEW: Railway officials say 13 people killed, 15 injured after trains collided .

"New York (CNN)  -- Authorities have identified a teenager believed to be suffering from amnesia who was found on the streets of New York two weeks ago. Police say a CNN viewer in Maryland identified the young woman, who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home or even her own name. The 18 year old whose name is not yet being released, is in the process of being reunited with her family. They are from Washington state and are on their way to New York, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said on Saturday. A photo of the woman, who has been referred to as Jane Doe, was circulated by police and aired on CNN this week. The viewer in Maryland was familiar with her situation and knew she had been missing from her family earlier this month. The girl was found in Midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. ""I just want to know who I am,"" the girl said in a statement from the New York City Administration for Children's Services. ""I want to know who I am and what happened to me."" According to its Web site, ""Covenant House New York is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth."" Nearly 7,000 youths reportedly seek shelter there per year. A security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department. Police officers interviewed the young woman, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. The police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered. The children's services agency said the girl recently wrote down the name ""Amber"" and has responded to it on one occasion, but she has no idea whether it is her true name. On another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words, which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel ""Fool's Fate"" by Robin Hobb. The girl also is apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian, ""who's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom,"" the young woman said. Judging from her poor dental hygiene, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, she appeared to have been living on the streets for some time. Evan Buxbaum, Susan Candiotti and Vanessa Juarez contributed to the report.","NEW: New York Police say the 18-year-old is being reunited with family in Washington state .

"New York (CNN) -- For Kenny Ortega, Travis Payne and Michael Bearden, ""It"" is a bittersweet feeling. The three men expected to be spending their time this summer and fall working on Michael Jackson's concert engagement at London's O2 Arena, which was scheduled to begin in July. Instead, they are talking about Jackson's last days and the new movie about that time, ""This Is It."" In an interview, they described ""This Is It,"" the movie that they've made from rehearsal and backstage footage of Jackson, shot just before he died June 25. The film, which has been dominating advance ticket sale outlets, opens wide on Wednesday. The full movie wasn't screened for critics, with only 12 minutes of footage available to the media before the interviews. But as  director Ortega describes it, the film tries to blend backstage footage with the performance to give an inside glimpse of those last days at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The scenes show the superstar working on his dance moves, figuring out choreography, practicing on stage and running the show. From the clips, there's no question that Jackson was in charge. His physicality is vibrant: At one point, he dances with a troupe of top-notch hoofers and keeps up with all of them. There's no indication of the infirmities that would ultimately take his life. All three men -- Payne was the show's choreographer and Bearden its music supervisor -- stressed how they wanted this movie to represent the Jackson they knew. ""It was an honor project,"" Bearden said. According to Ortega, the film is for the fans. He said he was inundated with e-mails from fans wanting to know just what Jackson had planned for the concerts he would never give. Above all, they said they were concerned about Jackson's three children. They said that they wanted to make a film that his kids -- Prince Michael, Paris and ""Blanket"" -- would be able to see in years to come that would make them proud of their father. Though the men acknowledged a heavy responsibility, there were light moments during the interviews. Payne and Bearden both smiled as they talked about working for the King of Pop and how he'd try to tell people what he wanted. ""I know you mean well, but ...,"" Jackson would say as he corrected colleagues, they recalled. But all of them talked about he emotional toll that making this film has taken on them. There were ""a lot of tissue moments on this film,"" Bearden said. Watch a former Jackson guitarist reflect on his career . Ortega added that he didn't know whether he could handle the emotional stress involved in making this movie so quickly. Ultimately, according to Ortega, the movie proved to be cathartic. ""I thought I'd collapse,"" Ortega said. ""I thought I'll never get through it, it's too hard, it's too soon, but in fact it was healing and helpful."" He hopes Jackson's fans will feel the same way.","""This Is It,"" Michael Jackson concert film, is dominating advance ticket sales .

"(The Frisky) -- I once told my mother about a girl I had a crush on. At the time, I think I was about 16, and I had so much acne that if I fell asleep at a library, when I woke up, a blind guy would be trying to read my face. ""Just go for her,"" my mother said. ""It's not that simple,"" I said, while filling out my order form for 25 crates of Noxzema. ""She's got a boyfriend."" ""Well, don't do anything differently. Act like she doesn't. That's how I got your father."" She then walked out of the room, leaving my pasty teenage complexion an extra shade of white as I actually contemplated my mother dating. I've since related this story as an example of how hitting on someone with a significant other isn't always a terrible thing. Hey, if they're not married or serious, go for it. However, if you're considering trying to get a guy who has a girlfriend, there are a few things you should know. The Frisky: The Top 5 online dating do's and don'ts for guys . First, I'll admit guys will hit on anything. I once observed one of my friends hitting on a street sign. Granted, he was drunk, but it did not matter to him that he was hitting on an inanimate object, or that the street sign was a little out of his league. Men do have standards, but when they're single, they'll hit on a woman with a boyfriend. They'll hit on nuns. Very occasionally, they'll hit on nuns with boyfriends. I'm not going to defame my own kind, but women can be better at subtlety, and you should use this to your advantage. The Frisky: Is cheating worse when you're married? I'm a big anti-cheating guy, so if a woman hit on me while I had a girlfriend, I'd be flattered. If she offered to go home with me or tried to kiss me or something like that, milk would shoot out of my nose and I'd run for the hills. (I have an odd fight-or-flight mechanism.) Subtlety is your friend. We'll pick up on the signals. If a guy is interested, wait for him to honorably break up with his girlfriend before the two of you start dating. Frankly, this is just good manners. The Frisky: To tell or not to tell on a cheater? It should go without saying that it's bad form to hit on a guy while his girlfriend is actually there, or even if she's in the same town. Men have a well-honed sense of panic that kicks in when someone's hitting on them while their girlfriends are in the same ZIP code. We know that women can read us, so unless you're hitting on a really shady guy, you'll scare him off as he runs home to call his girl and tell the story of the Evil Homewrecking Woman. The Frisky: Can couples get past infidelity? One last thing: If you do snag a guy away from his girlfriend, be wary. The good news is that, despite the popular perception, most of us men tend to be loyal once we're in a committed relationship. But know that if it happened once, it can happen again.

"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- From the custom-made, hand-beaded white dress to silver-studded high-heeled shoes, diamond jewelry and tiara, Jenny Ferro is preparing for a day she's dreamed about since she was 3 years old. ""I'm really excited,"" says Jenny, eagerly nodding her head. ""Really, really, a lot!"" She isn't getting married. The 15-year-old is preparing for her quinceañera, a coming-of-age ritual in Latin culture, marking a young girl's entrance into womanhood. The centuries-old tradition began as a ceremony to introduce girls to society on their 15th birthday and signified that they were ready for marriage. Today, many quinceañeras have become much more elaborate. Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music. The theme of the party is bedazzled. First, there is the dress, which Marlene had designed specially for her daughter. It cost about $800. Then there are the shoes, high-heeled and silver to match the dress. During the party, the high heels will be ceremoniously slipped onto her feet to replace her flat shoes -- a symbolic transition of her journey from childhood to womanhood. ""It makes her look like a princess,"" gushes Marlene Ferro. Quinceañeras are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of ""Quinceañera!"" a comprehensive guide to the celebration. ""The 15th birthday, culturally, is a milestone. It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special,"" Salcedo says. Experts believe the quinceañera is rooted in Mayan, Aztec and European traditions. Today, many coming-of-age ceremonies resemble lavish ""Sweet 16"" celebrations. Beyond the elaborate apparel, food and festivities, modern quinceañeras often feature a court of 15 people, typically consisting of family and friends. As the event continues to grow in popularity, the makeup of the court has also changed. ""It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends,"" says Salcedo. ""So it's a way of reaching out and extending social ties and bringing people in who might not otherwise have an opportunity to know a Latino family and to know the culture."" Family plays the largest role in the quinceañera, leading up to and during the party. Mothers, fathers, grandparents and godparents can spend years preparing a night to remember for the young girl. The tradition is just as important to the family as it is to the young woman. The large, extravagant celebrations often symbolize a family's hard work and success. How has America changed Latinos? Marlene Ferro, who emigrated from Cuba as a child with her parents, says Jenny's quinceañera was a gift to both of them. The 43-year-old, single mother of three, saved for years and estimates that she spent at least $20,000 on her daughter's quinceañera. ""I was able to accomplish something that I had been looking forward to for 15 years,"" says Marlene Ferro. The parties can be as big and expensive as a family can imagine and costs can escalate into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Salcedo. She recommends that families manage expectations before the party planning even begins. iReporter Alexis Fernandez's quinceañera was a big event in Alaska . ""Sometimes people go way overboard and [spend] much more on the celebration than they can afford and that's the downside of the quinceañera,"" says Salcedo. ""Because when it's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through."" Quinceañeras have changed over the years. Even though her tiara was taller than her daughter's, Marlene says her quinceañera was simple. It was a small gathering at her sister's apartment with family and friends. She wore borrowed jewelry from a family member, had a homemade cake and danced with her father. Marlene Ferro's 15th birthday present was a telephone in her bedroom. ""I didn't have a big quince party. I chose to have a small party with my friends,"" she remembers. ""My dress was really easy ... I didn't have an option. It was this one or that one. Now, we give our kids the option."" iReporter Diamond Ramirez's mother, grandmother never had quinceañeras . There's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well, says Salcedo. The church plays a role in helping to prepare teenage girls for this transition to womanhood. Ceremonies and classes before the coming-of-age celebration teach the young women that with adulthood come certain responsibilities, both physical and spiritual. ""When it's done in the spirit that it probably should be, the girl has certain responsibilities and by the end of the process, she's met them and she has showed her mother that she can, in fact, be responsible and she does acquire ... a bit more maturity then she [had] before,"" says Salcedo. As the celebrations become more popular in the United States, they also offer an opportunity for more Americans to participate. ""It's a way to push back a lot of the negativity that a lot of Latinos feel is directed at Latinos,"" says Salcedo. ""It is a way for people who have recently arrived, or maybe not so recently arrived, to say 'I have done well here' ... I'm throwing this party for my daughter and I'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we've done.""","Quinceañeras, or 15th birthday celebrations, mark a girl's transition to womanhood .

"(CNN) -- It has been 20 years since best-selling crime writer Patricia Cornwell began work on her first novel in the series chronicling the cases of forensic analyst Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Now, both have found celebrity. Cornwell's latest novel, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" places her enduring heroine in a role the author knows all too well, a pop culture celebrity sought-after for her expertise. In an interview with CNN.com, Cornwell discussed the challenges of staying fresh, the need for happy endings and the merits of the History Channel and the movie ""White Chicks."" CNN: The title of your new book, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" has many meanings. Can you tell me about some of them? Cornwell: On the one hand, it's a very direct reference to the fact she's the chief forensic analyst for CNN in this book. But while she's doing the on-air spots, they decide they want her to have her own show and that's what they call it, ""The Scarpetta Factor,"" which is a reference to a cliché that's beginning to float around, that there's one element that she can add that will solve the case like she's Sherlock Holmes. This becomes very upsetting to her, first of all, because it's a cliché and the scientist in her doesn't think she has a special factor, she's a scientist. It begins to pose problems for her because even some colleagues and friends start to wonder if she's begun to believe her own legend and make mistakes. With her years of experience and high level of visibility and exceptional grasp of the criminal world, she would be asked to be on major shows. When someone like Michael Jackson dies or Caylee Anthony disappears, that's the obvious thing that would happen. People would say, I wonder what Scarpetta has to say. I'm trying to put her in the world we live in. CNN: Why did you choose CNN? Cornwell: It would make perfect sense that she would sit on the set with Anderson Cooper or Wolf Blizter and be asked relevant questions from a hard news angle. It's one [network] she would go on and there's lots she wouldn't go on. CNN: How have things changed since you published your first novel? Cornwell: When I was shopping my first book around, it was rejected by the major publishing houses and that was because a lot of people didn't think morgues and labs were interesting, and that's a huge statement about how things have changed. I remember one time, I called my literary agent at that time, and I said I was in a toxicology lab, and she said, I hate talking to you because you're always in these awful places. Forensic science was not viewed as cool, as it is today. CNN: Are there any on-air personalities we might recognize in ""The Scarpetta Factor?"" Cornwell: When she is up at CNN for a scene when she's on a fictitious show, she walks past posters of Nancy Grace and Lou Dobbs and Wolf Blitzer because she's up on that floor, so I do make real references to people, but the characters, the producers, none are real and they're not based on anybody I met or know. CNN: How much of yourself do you see in Kay Scarpetta? Over the years, have you grown into her or has she grown into you? Cornwell: Only insofar as we have the same values and sensibilities and perhaps the same approach to solving cases. I'm imposing the way my mind works in terms of connecting the dots, but beyond that, there are huge differences between us. She's a standalone character. I would feel very self-conscious and bored if she was a projection of me. I have certain things in common with all my characters. Like Marino, I can be a slob and sometimes say stupid things and rush to judgment. CNN: You're known for doing a lot of research on the ground to give your stories depth and realism. Where did your research for ""The Scarpetta Factor"" take you? Cornwell: I've certainly been in the CNN studios so that's helpful. When I was there over in the last year, I made a mental note of everything I saw while walking around so I could create the studio in the novel. I also spent lot of time with the NYPD, their bomb squad, their emergency unit, the Real Time Crime Center, so I could describe the amazing way computers are used to transmit data to police responding to a call. I spent time at the NYPD crime lab, the New York Medical Examiner's office, so I can show Scarpetta actually working there. The scene in the elevator in the beginning and the way people ID loved ones is based on what happens. Even the technology of the electronic nose, the mechanical sniffer that takes the place of cadaver dogs, is based on things I've seen. My research also included looking into the methods and means criminals are using, like TracFones, spoofcards and the different ways to disguise IP addresses. CNN: How has the CSI factor affected your research for your books? Cornwell: I think people are so inundated with this sort of detail that I don't want to make the story just about forensics. The people and their relationships are the heart of my books, the forensics are something they wear like an old pair of shoes. I'll always show you the latest and greatest forensic science and technology, but I can't show it all, so it's very important that I make things interesting in different ways. In the early to mid-'90s, up to the late '90s when I was coming out with new books, I was the only show in town and all of the sudden now they're everywhere, and I don't have any problem with that because I don't own forensics or forensic pathology. CNN: In your opinion, what has been the greatest change in forensic science since Scarpetta started out? Cornwell: DNA has changed our lives forever, just like the Internet has changed our lives, there's no going back to pre-DNA or pre-Internet. I would say both of those. The Internet has dramatically changed everything because it's creating a whole new wave of crimes that our laws and the courts don't know how to deal with. DNA analysis and the ultra-sensitivity of it: When you're dealing with some types of DNA, you only need three or four human cells to get a DNA profile, which is something that can't even see with the naked eye, so that helps investigators but it also creates a whole other set of problems. They're saying there will be a point when you can get DNA just from someone walking in the room, and you can see the problems if you have 20 people walk into a room and only one did something bad. Defense lawyers are going to have a field day with that. CNN: What do you want people to take away from this novel? I'd like them to take away an idea of how someone like Scarpetta deals with being in the same world you and I wake up to. Now she has a BlackBerry and she has to deal with it, which poses as many problems as it offers benefits. I want people to feel happy ending the book. We need to feel good right now, there's a lot to feel bad about and that's something I decided with the last book, I didn't want people to be depressed when they finished it. I used to write very dark books but we lived in happier times. Now, the goal is to scare you, lead you into suspense but when you finish, I want you to feel happy. CNN: What current cases in the news fascinate you? How much attention do you pay to crime and justice news? Cornwell: I'm fascinated by the Michael Jackson situation and the people who disappear and get abducted, all of it fascinates me in terms of the psychology involved and what science might tell us. I'm always frustrated because I love to know what's behind the scenes. I've been following Michael Jackson because it seems so unnecessary, an example of people who should've said no and not taken it upon themselves to solve a problem. I've also been interested in the case in Italy with the American on trial for murder. That is intriguing from a forensic standpoint because I think all of us would like to know more about the evidence and what's there to piece together that could tell us what happened. I'm afraid that because of how much time has passed and how the case was handled that a lot of the answers are gone and the kind of evidence that was collected could have been handled differently, . CNN: What do you like to watch? Cornwell: I don't watch crime dramas. I don't want to subconsciously get ideas from their shows. I try to keep my mind blank, and keep the influence of my own research, so I don't tend to watch crime dramas or crime movies. I rarely read crime novels because my work is so steeped in nonfiction, so I try to keep my mind free of those ideas. What I watch is the nonfiction, documentary type things, shows that depict real crimes that happened. I like the History Channel and I will watch reruns of ""The Sopranos"" until I'm 90 years old. I like comedy, stuff that's mindless. I don't watch stuff that scares me or makes me sad. There's enough of that in real life. CNN: What's the last movie you saw? Cornwell: The last movie I saw was a rerun of ""White Chicks."" How's that to people who think I have this very esoteric repertoire? I think it's a hilarious movie. ... Will Ferrell, I love his stuff, Ben Stiller, I really enjoy comedy, especially stuff that's kind of warmhearted in its own way. I don't like stuff that's really scary. I've seen so much stuff that's real. Blood is always real to me. If they ever make a real movie of Scarpetta, I may not be able to watch it.","Author Patricia Cornwell talks about Kay Scarpetta, fame and forensics .

"Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) -- Some are girlish 22-year-olds; others are women approaching 40. They come from South Carolina's rural counties and its booming cities. They are loud and muted, lively and vacant, hopeful and desperate. As different as they are, they share a connection to two powerful forces : their addictions and their babies. They are swallowed by the same shameful past. They don't know if they can be good mothers. They don't know if they can be clean mothers. They're here at a state-run drug-treatment program to learn how to do both. On this summer day, Ashley Hendrix, 24, is eight months pregnant with her first child and one of 16 women at the Phoenix Center's Serenity Place. This is her last shot to get clean -- or face jail. South Carolina's state supreme court is alone in upholding the prosecution of pregnant women for the damage drugs might do to their unborn children. Across the country, local and state agencies have found ways to prosecute pregnant women for drug use, but the cases are often rejected by the courts. And judges in more than two dozen states have overturned decisions that criminalize pregnant addicts. In recent years, Missouri and North Dakota have ruled against charging pregnant women with neglect and endangerment. Illegal substances -- marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription drugs -- consumed Hendrix for more than a decade. ""To this day, I still cry about it, "" she said, ""that if anything does come out wrong with my baby, I know that my drug use is the reason why. Since 1989, at least 126 women in South Carolina have been arrested during their pregnancies, according to the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Most were charged with drug and alcohol use that posed harm to the fetus the woman was carrying. During the same period, only about 80 pregnant women were arrested on similar charges in all other states combined. ""Word on the street"" in South Carolina, says Stephen Donaldson, program manager of a drug-treatment facility in Charleston County, ""is if you use during pregnancy, you're being prosecuted or you're losing your baby."" Over the last 15 years, that message has driven many women to Serenity Place, a residential treatment center designed for pregnant women and new mothers. Here, the ultimate goal is to help the women recover from their addiction but Serenity also strives to give the women the confidence to become better mothers. They want the women to know there are second chances, and there is hope. ""I'm grateful everyday for being here and I'm grateful to have my baby with me,"" says a freckled Kim Clark, 28, who gave birth to her son Jaelyn at the center. ""I've been using drugs since I was 11 years old. I didn't know any other life. And I've learned a lot about myself. I've been taught things here."" She graduated in August, has her own apartment now and works to support herself and her son. Some women arrive here voluntarily. Others were sent by the state's Department of Social Services. Others made a plea bargain with the courts, allowing them one last chance at treatment to avoid prison. ""My biggest fear was the [health of the] baby, but right behind that was that 'I'm going to go to jail',"" says Sandria Doremus, one of Hendrix' classmates at Serenity. Afraid of being turned in for her opiate addiction, she delayed getting prenatal care. ""I should have gone in a lot sooner,"" she admits. Doremus, 37, arrived at Serenity after a hospital reported her drug use to law enforcement officials, as required by law. She has sandy blond hair and warm blue eyes that open up her leathered face. She cuddled her 8-month-old son, Matthew, when CNN visited the center in July. Born with heroin in his system, Matthew was placed on methadone. Today, he is healthy, but studies show drug-exposed babies can face developmental delays and learning disabilities in later years. Watch the women of Serenity Place share their story » . In 1997, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that a fetus in the third trimester was viable and charges of child abuse, neglect and murder could apply to the mother. Some treatment providers and advocacy experts say this ruling opened the door for prosecutors to charge pregnant women. ""These are addicts who become pregnant,"" says Lynn Paltrow, executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women. ""They aren't women who chose to use drugs after becoming pregnant."" 'If I didn't have pills, I felt like I had nothing' Hendrix's drug addiction started long before her pregnancy. She was born into a world of drugs. She says her mother was an addict, her father a violent alcoholic who once held a shotgun to her grandmother's head. Hendrix's grandparents rescued her at age 3 by taking her into their home in rural Union, South Carolina. She has fond memories of her grandfather, but one morning, shortly after her 12th birthday, Hendrix watched her 54-year-old grandfather die from a heart attack. The innocent girl started experimenting with drugs, partly because she couldn't cope with her feelings, she says, but mostly to fit in. By the time she turned 18, marijuana use gave way to cocaine and methamphetamine. Then she discovered prescription painkillers: Lortab. OxyContin. Percocet. ""It wasn't even about being high anymore. It was just being able to cope with everyday life,"" Hendrix says. ""If I didn't have the pills, I felt like I had nothing."" Hendrix could no longer leave bed without the painkillers. Her routine consisted of melting OxyContin pills with water, placing the mixture into a syringe and shooting up, even during her pregnancy. By April of this year, she was six months pregnant and on probation for stealing jewelry to feed her drug habit. She took herself to Serenity Place. Tucked alongside empty factories in a once-thriving textile district, the center looks more like a college dormitory inside than a sterile treatment center. Homemade posters, photo collages and cards congratulating the women for giving birth are strewn along the hallways. There is a communal kitchen and colorful playgrounds. Research shows women who remain with their children during treatment have better chances of defeating their addictions. But a national study in 2005 found that only 3 percent of treatment centers had programs tailored specifically to pregnant women. About 14 percent of treatment centers accepted pregnant or postpartum women. The women at Serenity Place follow a rigid schedule that includes therapy, parenting classes and chores. They aren't allowed phone calls or the freedom to surf the Internet without permission. Security cameras guard all exits. The structure can be particularly hard for addicts who grew up in dysfunctional households with few rules. Women spend on average six months in treatment. If a woman violates the rules, she can be removed from the program. On some occasions, women have walked out of the center, leaving their newborns behind. Why prosecute? Why should addicted women be given a chance at motherhood? What about the welfare of the children? These are the questions asked by South Carolina prosecutors, known as solicitors general. Several solicitors general contacted by CNN declined to comment on how many such cases they have prosecuted, but they say that charging pregnant women has become less common in the state. Bob Ariail, solicitor of Greenville, says his district's policy is a far cry from the 1990s, when then-South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, an anti-abortion advocate, publicly declared he would aggressively crack down on pregnant mothers accused of substance abuse. Condon often referred to a fetus as his ""fellow South Carolinian."" Despite several phone calls by CNN, Condon, who is now a private lawyer in South Carolina, could not be reached for comment. In his two decades as a Democratic state representative, Joe Neal of Columbia, South Carolina, has pushed for more drug treatment funding, an effort he says has little chance in these tough economic times. ""Drug treatment?"" says Neal. ""South Carolina's response to addiction has been incarceration not treatment."" But Wanda McMichael, manager of women's services at Serenity Place, knows treatment can be beneficial. She guides women like Hendrix and the others through that process. Some who graduated from the program when it began in 1993 still remain clean. ""What's the other alternative if they don't come here?"" says McMichael. ""It's prison. That costs more than treatment, but a lot of people don't know that. If these women don't get this treatment, they are going to die."" A healthy baby, a new hope . Most of the women at Serenity Place say they were little girls the first time they used drugs, some as young as 8. Many could not recall what sobriety felt like until they came to the center. Hendrix says her own mother was 15 when she gave birth to her and then abandoned her. ""She was real pretty. Blond hair, pale skin like me,"" Hendrix says. ""I have her nose and lips. She just didn't respect herself."" Hendrix doesn't want to be like her mother. Her son, who was born July 24, is healthy. In August, Hendrix left Serenity for an intensive outpatient treatment program, and she and her baby live with her grandmother in Union. Of the 16 women enrolled in Serenity in July, half have graduated, program directors say. Six continue receiving treatment and two have left the center. Three women are on a waiting list to get in, including one who is pregnant. Hendrix hopes to get her GED and enroll in the University of South Carolina to study psychology next year. ""I am happy today,"" she says, ""and that's something I haven't felt in a long time. ""My grandmother. My baby. They make me happy. But you know, it's not about them, jail or none of that anymore. That all changed. I am doing this for me.""","Serenity Place in South Carolina caters treatment programs to pregnant addicts .

"(CNN) -- ""Keep the government's hands off my Medicare."" Those words -- quoted by so many TV talking heads -- never seem actually to have been spoken by anyone. It's like that poodle in the microwave story: Everybody has a neighbor who heard it from his cousin. The town hallers were angry, but they were not crazy, and they were not stupid. They knew perfectly well that Medicare is provided by the government. They also knew that their government is proposing to change Medicare in ways they do not like. The health care reform plans backed by President Obama would cut hundreds of billions out of the the growth of Medicare spending over the next 10 years. More ominous for seniors than the dollar figure is the plan behind the number. The president wants to reduce spending on Medicare Advantage, the privately run plans that offer seniors a better deal than conventional Medicare. Over the longer term, the president aspires to shift Medicare patients to teams of health care providers paid by the year, instead of individual doctors charging fees for each particular service -- rather than by the particular medical service they perform. Meet new CNN contributor David Frum . The changes the president has in mind won't kill Grandma. But they will change medicine in ways Grandma may find uncomfortable. Ten years from now, Grandma probably won't have a personal doctor. Her Medicare will cover less -- and cost more. Medicare was under pressure even before the election of Obama. The gap between the future revenues and future obligations of Medicare and Social Security is estimated by the Social Security trustees at some $45 trillion. How much is that? Adjusting for inflation, it's the cost of fighting World War II -- 10 times. Medicare is the single biggest spending commitment of the United States. As Obama stacks enormous new health care spending commitments atop the old, Medicare's already bleak future grows dimmer still. Who wins as Medicare loses? The short answer is: the uninsured. The president will use the money squeezed from Medicare to extend some form of coverage to the 35 million to 40 million people estimated to lack health insurance. And who are these people? About one-quarter of them are foreign-born. Recent immigrants to the United States -- unlike the immigrations who arrived between World War II and 1970 -- have tended to be very low-skilled. Their labor is just not worth enough to their employers to support the high cost of an American health insurance plan: $13,000 a year, on average, for a family of four. So here's how the world looks to a Medicare enrollee: . Over the opposition of some 80 percent of the American people, your government allowed millions of poor newcomers to enter the country, many of them illegally. (Over the past 10 years, half of all immigrants to the United States have arrived illegally.) These people cut the lawns of your more affluent neighbors, tended their babies, cleared their tables after their restaurant meals. If you were not so affluent, they reduced your wages and crowded your schools, highways and hospital emergency rooms. Now you are being told that your old age will be made less comfortable to accommodate them. Unsurprisingly, you don't like it. The debate about immigration and health care has centered on whether immigrants who are here illegally might qualify for coverage under the Democrats' reforms. Theoretically, they will not be eligible, but since Democrats have so far voted against enforcement measures, some illegal immigrants will no doubt slip through. But the debate over illegal immigrants is a proxy for something larger and more unsettling to older Americans. The problem is not illegal immigration, it is all low-skilled immigration, legal and illegal. By importing tens of millions of people who earn too little to pay for their own health insurance, we have made this supremely difficult social problem radically more difficult than it ever needed to be. With ""Obamacare,"" the bill for four decades of permissive immigration has at last come due. Since the 1930s, the United States has run two different kinds of government social programs. One kind of program is sustained by contributions from the very same people who will benefit from the program in future: Social Security, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation. These programs have never been controversial. The other kind of program taxes some for the benefit of others: Medicaid, social housing, the old welfare programs for the poor. These programs have always been intensely resented. Medicare was the first kind of program: social insurance. Obama's public option will be the second kind of program: income transfer. That's the explanation for the resistance the president is encountering. And it's the emotion that explains the actual quote -- not the bogus quote -- we heard from so many town hall protesters this summer: ""Fix old. No new."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Town hallers know government wants to change Medicare in ways they don't like, Frum says .
He says changes won't kill Grandma, but Medicare will cover less and cost more .
Changes will benefit the uninsured, some of whom can't pay for insurance, he says .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A bear on ice skates attacked two people during rehearsals at a circus in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, killing one of them, Kyrgyz officials said Friday. In the incident, which happened Thursday, the 5-year-old animal killed the circus administrator, Dmitry Potapov, and mauled an animal trainer, who was attempting to rescue him. ""The incident occurred during a rehearsal by the Russian state circus company troupe which was performing in Bishkek with the program, Bears on Ice,"" Ministry of Culture and Information director Kurmangazy Isanayev told reporters. It is unclear what caused the bear to attack Potapov, 25, nearly severing one of his legs while dragging him across the ice by his neck. Medical personnel were unable to save Potapov, who died at the scene. The 29-year-old circus trainer Yevgeny Popov, who attempted to rescue Potapov, was also severely injured, according to doctors. ""The victim has sustained serious injuries - deep scalp lacerations, bruising of the brain, lacerations on his body. His condition is considered critical,"" Dr. Gulnara Tashibekova told reporters on Russian state television. After the incident, the circus was cordoned off by police and emergency service workers. Experts have been brought in to examine the bear, which was shot and died at the scene. Russia has a long-standing tradition of training bears to perform tricks such as riding motorcycles, ice skating, and playing hockey. Fatal attacks are unusual.","Ice skating bear kills man during rehearsals at Russian circus .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 30 Iraqi children riding in a bus were among the 160 people killed in Sunday's twin car bombings in Baghdad, the Interior Ministry said Monday. At least 540 people were wounded in Sunday's attacks, the deadliest in the capital in more than two years, the ministry said. One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building, the other outside the Justice Ministry. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., officials said. The children were packed in a mini bus that was outside the Justice Ministry building, a ministry official said. The vehicle carrying the explosives that detonated outside the ministry building was a stolen white pick-up from Falluja, Baghdad Gov. Salah Abdul Razzaq told CNN during his inspection of the bomb site. Images from the time of the attack showed the truck, linked to the Department of Water, pull up to the side of the building and blow up, he said. Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewn with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete. Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged. Among the wounded were three American security contractors, the U.S. Embassy said, declining to provide further details. The area struck is close to the heavily guarded ""Green Zone,"" which houses the embassy. The blasts sparked questions about Iraq's security and national elections planned for January. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who visited the scene shortly after the explosions, said holding the elections as scheduled would send a strong message to the attackers. ""The cowardly attack ... should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party, and the terrorist al Qaeda organization,'"" al-Maliki said in a written statement. U.S. President Barack Obama called the attacks an attempt to derail progress in Iraq, and pledged to work closely with the country as it prepares for elections. Obama spoke with the prime minister and President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support. In August, more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings that led to tightened security in Baghdad. Blast walls were installed across the city and checkpoints were added. Two years earlier, three truck bombings killed hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. Sunday's attacks were the deadliest on Iraqi civilians since those blasts in August 2007. A day before Sunday's explosions, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, visited Iraq for the first time. During her trip, she made a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry, one of six sites attacked in August. Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16, but parliament has not passed key election legislation, putting the balloting in limbo. The president, prime minister and other top officials are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the elections law and security concerns. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Mohammed Jamjoom, and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Death toll in Baghdad double bombing rises to 160 .

"(CNN) -- A key investor with convicted swindler Bernie Madoff drowned in his swimming pool Sunday afternoon, police said. Jeffry Picower, 67, was found unconscious in his pool at his Palm Beach, Florida, home, Palm Beach police said. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. Police said they are investigating his death using ""standard operating procedure in any drowning."" Picower invested with Madoff, who was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. Madoff pleaded guilty in March to 11 counts, including fraud, money laundering and perjury, and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors. Picower's Picower Foundation of Palm Beach announced it was shutting down early this year because of Madoff losses, CNN Money reported. Picower's 2007 tax return valued its portfolio at $955 million. But there were also suggestions that Picower benefited from Madoff's swindle. Citing an unnamed source, Fortune magazine said in April that Frank DiPascali, the chief lieutenant in Madoff's secretive investment business, was ""prepared to testify that he manipulated phony returns on behalf of some key Madoff investors,"" including Picower. Picower also allegedly ""extracted billions of dollars from Madoff's fund before it collapsed,"" according to Forbes magazine.","Jeffry Picower, 67,  found unconscious in his pool in his Palm Beach, Florida .

"Editor's note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is the new president and CEO of the NAACP. Benjamin Jealous says the 100-year-old NAACP has an ambitious agenda for civil and human rights. (CNN) -- Thursday the U.S. Senate passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and for legalized segregation. It arrived more than a hundred years late, but better late than never. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives are expected to pass a similar resolution, and when they do, the bipartisan resolution will acknowledge our nation's need to take a historic leap out of the shameful past of racial discrimination and toward a future that promises all citizens full access to the legal protections laid out in the U.S. Constitution. But we must go beyond the civil rights guaranteed in the Constitution and advocate for the human rights that will assure that America's promise is realized for all. While our Constitution mandates equality, for example, there is no constitutional guarantee for an education, let alone a good education. The fight for good schools is a struggle for our human rights. Some have opined that there is no longer a need for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and that we as a society are post-racial because of the election of our first black president. But we cannot be post-racial until we are post-racism. The case of Troy Davis, an African American man set for execution who we believe was wrongly convicted, is an exemplar of the disparities that still rock our nation (see IAMTROY.com). Davis was convicted of killing a police officer and has spent 18 years on death row. There is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and seven of the nine witnesses recanted or contradicted their testimony. His case has sparked an outcry from both proponents and opponents of the death penalty including former FBI director William Sessions and conservative presidential candidate Bob Barr. Yet our laws don't allow him a new trial to reexamine the evidence that points to his innocence. African-Americans are disproportionately represented on death row. Of the 3,500 people on death row, about 42 percent are black, and virtually all are poor. Studies underscore that it is race and class, more than guilt, that determines whether a defendant, once convicted, is sentenced to death. The statistics paint an ongoing portrait of inequality. Unemployment for African-Americans remains twice that of whites and studies show there is no scientific rationale -- neither education nor experience -- that explains the gap. In some American cities, 50 percent of school-aged black men drop out of school and as much as 50 percent of young black men are unemployed. Now, as we prepare to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NAACP in New York from July 11-16 (NAACP.org), we recognize that despite our many accomplishments, we have a long path ahead to right the inequity that still racks our nation. Prompted by the riots in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois, where a mob of whites containing many of the town's ""best citizens,"" raged for two days, killed and wounded scores of African-Americans, and drove thousands from the city, a multiracial group of intellectuals, journalists and activists gathered in a small New York apartment to launch the NAACP and fight lynching's and mob violence. History has shown the efficacy of our tried and true approach: dreaming bold dreams, breaking them down into incremental steps and ultimately achieving big victories. And our triumphs strengthen the fabric of democracy in America. When, after a multidecade-long struggle, we ended the cruel practice of lynching, not only African-Americans benefited but also Catholics, who were, after black people, the likeliest targets of lynchings in the South. Similarly, our lawsuit against 15 banks for steering African-Americans into the predatory loans that have devastated neighborhoods today would force transparency and accountability that would benefit all Americans. The election of President Obama is the result of a decades-long fight for political inclusion. His victory may have come as a bolt from the blue for some, but at the NAACP, we know that our century of hard work helped pave the way for the junior senator from Illinois, a black man, to win the White House. If our unofficial motto, ""registration, mobilization, education,"" sounds familiar, it is because that deceptively simple formula informed the successful election campaign of Obama. The NAACP has always been about the present and the future, and we choose to focus on solutions, rather than just bemoan the hard work to be done: This doesn't indicate denial, or ineffectiveness, we simply prefer action over rhetoric. Now, we see Lincoln's radical determination to extend the rights of the Constitution to all American citizens as the NAACP's guiding light. We don't often hear the words ""radical"" and ""NAACP"" in the same sentence but I like the proximity: . We've kicked off our next hundred years with actions that might have been perceived as ""radical"" at our founding a century ago -- from ending the death penalty in New Mexico to successfully passing anti-racial profiling legislation in Missouri and other states. Being radical is not new for me. I was born out of resistance to Jim Crow when my mom and dad married despite their union being illegal in many states. My dad, Fred, was disowned for marrying a black woman and was used to being the only white guy thrown out of the diner for trying to integrate the lunch counter. My mom, Ann, was an early activist in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. My generation, was told the civil rights battles had largely been won -- ""Go forth young man and make money, enjoy your life and be successful"" -- but we woke up to find ourselves the most murdered and incarcerated generation in history. So I chose to be an activist, starting at 14 with voter registration drives. I was later kicked out of Columbia University for protesting -- ultimately graduating and becoming a Rhodes scholar. During that forced hiatus, I journeyed south where I learned firsthand about the tenacity and pain of southern racism and poverty. I already knew well its northern urban counterpart. I also learned that we could win -- which filled me with a sense of hope for the nation and confidence in our ability to impact the world. Our many victories and the election of our first black president fuels my optimism over the bright future of the civil and human rights movement. It is spiced with a dash of pride, too. Thanks, in part to the work of the NAACP, my 3-year-old daughter and her girlfriends will grow up in an America where the idea of a woman president -- or a black man, or an Asian woman, or a Latino man -- isn't likely to be ""radical"" at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.","Benjamin Jealous: NAACP formed in response to lynchings and race riots .

"(CNN)  -- Authorities have charged two teenagers and an adult in connection with the beating of a 76-year-old African-American man early Tuesday in Baltimore, Maryland, in an incident police say had a racial connection. From left, Emmanuel Miller, 16, and Zachary Watson, 17 are charged as adults in the alleged beating. Emmanuel Miller, 16, and Zachary Watson, 17 are charged as adults, police said. They and Calvin Lockner, 28, face numerous charges in the alleged beating of James Privott, including attempted murder, assault and harassing a person because of race or religion, according to court documents. Lockner is a white supremacist with the nickname ""Hitler,"" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told CNN. Baltimore Police Commissioner Fred Bealefeld told reporters some of Lockner's tattoos seem to indicate his affiliation with racist groups such as the Aryan Brotherhood, according to audio comments posted on the Web site of CNN affiliate WBAL. There is no evidence the teenagers were affiliated with any white supremacist groups, Gugliemi said, but the two knew Lockner. Police responding to a report of an armed carjacking about 3:25 a.m. Tuesday found Privott with a head injury, according to probable cause statements accompanying charges, filed in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City. Privott told police he was loading his Chevy Tahoe after fishing in the nearby Patapsco River when three or four white males approached him and began to kick and punch him, knocking him to the ground while using racial epithets, according to the statements. One of the men struck him with a baseball bat, Privott said. While he was on the ground, the men stole his wallet, which contained $19, as well as the keys to his vehicle, he told police. The men left in the Tahoe, the statements said. Privott was taken to a hospital and later was transferred to the University of Maryland Hospital's shock trauma center because of his head injuries. Doctors told police he had a possible fractured eye orbital bone and had sustained serious head trauma, according to the court documents. Privott remained in critical condition, but was making progress, a Baltimore police spokeswoman said Thursday . ""What has happened is an unfortunate thing,"" Privott's wife, Ethel, told WBAL. ""I think we're living in a prison world because we can't -- we're not safe here. We go and try to have clean fun and this is what happens."" The Chevy Tahoe's tracking system helped police locate the vehicle, which eventually crashed and overturned, the court documents said. An anonymous witness led officers to Lockner after seeing him running from the accident scene. As he was being arrested, Lockner told police, ""I'm sorry for what I did,"" according to the probable cause statements. Lockner told police he was involved in the beating, but said another man -- later identified by police as Watson -- was the one who assaulted Privott and took his wallet. Both Miller and Watson, however, told police it was Lockner who assaulted Privott, according to the court documents. Watson claimed Lockner used a sledgehammer and Miller used a bat. Both youth said Lockner forced them into the Tahoe after the assault, according to the statements. Watson said the three then smoked marijuana, police said. Bealefeld told reporters that while authorities have received conflicting information from the three, ""I think the consensus is that Mr. Lockner played a leading role in a lot of this."" Miller said, according to the probable cause statements, that he, Lockner and Watson were at Fort Armistead Park near the river when they saw Privott and a woman fishing. Miller said the three asked the man and woman if they had any water or cigarettes, but they said no. Lockner grew angry at their refusal, Miller told police, and used a racial epithet as they were walking away, the documents said. Miller said the three waited for the woman with Privott to leave and then Lockner assaulted him, hitting him about 10 times, according to the probable cause statements. Ethel Privott told WBAL the two enjoy fishing near the park and have been doing so for more than a decade. ""It's usually a party,"" she said, but the two had stayed late on Tuesday. ""A lot of seniors go down there. It's a nice secluded area, and we have fun. Until this,"" she said. A preliminary hearing for all three suspects is set for September 18.","James Privott, 76, says white males kicked, punched him, used racial epithets .

"(Mental Floss) -- Have you ever been watching television and thought, ""Wow, this soap opera is so good it could cause the downfall of a corrupt communist regime,"" or even, ""I bet one day this show is going to send the first woman into space""? Well, maybe you're not giving the boob tube enough credit. Popular television shows have influenced politics in the United States and around the world. While others are busy blaming television for all of society's downfalls, we think it's time someone stood up for ye olde idiot box. After all, these 10 television shows didn't just entertain, they helped convince the world to get with the program. 1. ""DALLAS"" The Show that Overthrew a Dictator . (Well, kind of.) ""Dallas"" was one of the most popular TV shows in history -- and nowhere was it more talked about than in Nicolae Ceausescu's communist Romania. How did the soap opera get past Romanian censors? With help from ""Dallas"" leading man, J.R. Ewing, of course. Because J.R. was portrayed as a despicable oil baron, Ceausescu's government presumably decided the show must be anti-capitalist. Whatever the reasoning, ""Dallas"" became a runaway hit when it arrived in Romania in 1979. A series about wealthy, beautiful people (evil or not) was an inspiration to Romania's poor and dejected masses. Eventually, the government decided such Western television was a bad influence, and ""Dallas"" was taken off the air in 1981. But by then, it was too late. The fantasies of Western life lived on in the imaginations of Romanians, and in 1989, Ceausescu was overthrown during a public uprising. Not incidentally, the actor who played J.R., Larry Hagman, visited Romania some years later and was treated as a hero. In an interview following the experience, Hagman said, ""People from Bucharest came up to me in the street with tears in their eyes saying, 'J.R. saved our country.' "" 2. ""SEE IT NOW"" The Show that Ended McCarthyism . If you know your 1950s history (or if you saw the movie ""Good Night, and Good Luck""), you know the impact crusading journalist Edward R. Murrow had on American politics. His vehicle for galvanizing change? The current affairs show, ""See It Now,"" which premiered in 1951. Well known as a World War II radio correspondent, Murrow wasn't a fan of television initially. He wanted to go beyond the talking-head discussions and newsreels that filled most nightly news shows at the time. So when he finally decided to move forward with ""See It Now,"" he did so on his own terms. The show's debut episode featured television's first live coast-to-coast transmission, which included a split-screen of the Brooklyn Bridge on one side and the Golden Gate on the other. Murrow also broke new ground by airing a day in the lives of Korean War soldiers. Of course, the show's most influential role was in exposing Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist fear campaign and opening Americans' eyes to the many lives and careers it was ruining. Thanks in part to fallout from Murrow's broadcast on March 9, 1954, the U.S. Senate reprimanded McCarthy for abusing his power, and McCarthyism came to an abrupt end. Murrow wasn't afraid to take on rogue senators, and later, he proved he wasn't scared to take on Big Tobacco, either. Two episodes of ""See It Now"" explored the link between cigarettes and cancer -- a brave move, considering television depended heavily on tobacco sponsorships at the time. But perhaps Murrow had a personal interest in the story. A three-pack-a-day smoker who regularly appeared on camera with a cigarette in hand, Murrow died of lung cancer in 1965. 3. ""GENERAL ELECTRIC THEATER"" The Show that Turned Ronald Reagan into a Republican . In the early 1950s, film actor Ronald Reagan was at a low point in his career. So when Taft Schreiber, of the Music Corporation of America, got him a gig as the host of the anthology series ""General Electric Theater,"" Reagan jumped at the opportunity. For $125,000 a year and part-ownership of the program, he not only hosted the show, but also toured America as a ""goodwill ambassador"" for the electricity giant, giving speeches to plant employees and acting as its public spokesperson. By the time ""General Electric Theater"" was cancelled in 1962, Reagan was a new man. Turns out, all those years defending free enterprise for one of the nation's biggest multinational companies had transformed Reagan into one of America's leading conservative speakers. Although the actor had long been a Democrat, the Republican Schreiber convinced Reagan to change political parties. Four years later, the newly Republican Reagan was elected governor of California, and the rest is presidential history. 4. ""CATHY COME HOME"" The Drama that Transformed the Welfare State . Directed by Ken Loach (who later became one of Britain's most respected filmmakers), the drama ""Cathy Come Home"" was a poignant episode of the BBC-1 anthology series The Wednesday Play. It told the tragic story of Cathy Ward, a young wife and mother who becomes the victim of Britain's welfare state. Going from working-class struggle to dire poverty, Cathy's journey begins when her husband loses his job following an accident and becomes unable to support the family. In a painful spiral toward destitution, Cathy suffers through various states of homelessness, separates from her husband, and eventually, has her children forcibly taken away from her by government council workers. A truly horrifying story, its impact was compounded by the fact that ""Cathy Come Home"" was filmed in such a realistic style that some viewers thought it was a documentary. And although the Conservative Party government claimed the movie was ""full of blunders,"" Labour Party politician Anthony Greenwood said the show should be ""compulsory viewing once a month for the next five years."" British audiences agreed, and ""Cathy Come Home"" was aired again shortly after. The ensuing public outrage helped bring major changes to British welfare law. Other nations followed suit, with similar reforms and charities. 5. ""THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR"" The Show that Swung an Election . ""The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour"" was many things. It was the first network TV show to make fun of the Establishment, support America's counterculture, and have enough nerve to put blacklisted singers (such as Joan Baez and Pete Seeger) back on the air. Ironically, however, the show's major achievement might have been making Richard Nixon president. As a gag, show star Pat Paulsen ran for office during the 1968 presidential election. ""I'm consistently vague on the issues,"" announced Paulsen on national television, ""and I'm continuing to make promises that I'll be unable to fulfill."" Regardless of his humorous motives, Paulsen seemed to have a ""Ralph Nader Effect,"" stealing 200,000 votes from the Democrats and helping to swing one of the closest elections in history. Thanks to Paulsen's efforts, Nixon narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey. ""Hubert Humphrey told me I cost him the election,"" recalled Paulsen, ""and he wasn't smiling when he said it."" E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Editor's note: Steve Perry is the founder and principal of the Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Connecticut, and author of ""Man Up!: Nobody is Coming to Save Us,"" which offers solutions to problems in the black community. Steve Perry says a question from a parent started his journey to creating a top-performing school. HARTFORD, Connecticut (CNN) -- ""Why do only rich kids get good schools?"" I was the founder and director of a part-time out-of-school college preparatory program. The questioner was a parent; herself a victim of a dulled urban education. The statement was more of an indictment than question, and I had no answer. ""Well, why can't this program be a school,"" she offered. The program sent 100 percent of our graduates to college. We served poor students who were the first generation in their families to attend college. We provided college preparation through a six-week summer program, after-school tutoring and in-school academic advising. That single mother's question came at the end of the summer program. This was always a tough time. As the kids said goodbye to their friends and the program's high expectations, we all looked at the school year with great trepidation. We knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match. Like that mom, I too wondered why wealth and whiteness are too often linked to quality education. Her question connected to a discussion that I'd been having with some colleagues during the summer program. All of the teachers in that program worked in failed urban schools. Many had tried to reform traditional urban schools. They'd started formal and informal programs, identified groups of kids and connected to parents. Each had had some success with some kids, but the conditions that led to the need to do something went unchanged. The question was raised at the end of our 2002 summer program. My first instinct was to begin down the path of opening an all-male minority charter school. In Connecticut, charter schools are publicly funded and privately run, with no teachers' unions, no school board influence and no centralized curriculum. These were the pluses. There was only one minus: There was no money. The charter idea was dead as soon as it began. I assembled an all -black team. My plan was to put black educators together, and we would show 'em. Brothers and sisters were gonna open a successful charter school. Black educators serving black kids. This was my first major mistake. Talent and commitment have no color. Kids don't care what color their teachers are, and I shouldn't have either. After almost a year of stops and starts with a team that was not effectively assembled, I realized that I failed in my judgment because I did not keep my eye on the goal, which was to build a school that sent kids to college regardless of their hue or economic status. I have never made that mistake again. I doubled back and went into the schools and found the teachers who stayed the latest and arrived the earliest. I looked for the most ambitious teachers who had a reputation of being the most talented, and we started a second team. I am a social worker. I knew that I could run an organization, but wasn't sure about developing curriculum. When I created Team 2, my first pick was the best teacher I could find. Rich Beganski is the perfect complement, or opposite, of who I am. He's meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum. He is an operations genius. He was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach. I've never been an assistant and don't want to be one. Our team was composed of a white guy, a Latina, a black woman and a black man bound by a single commitment: to send kids to college. In 2003-04, Connecticut was settling a desegregation case. A component of the agreement was to open eight magnet schools in Hartford in two years. Magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme-based schools, complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board. The part-time college preparatory program was hosted in a community college. The college's president was an impulsive visionary. On a Friday afternoon elevator ride from the 10th to the seventh floor, he said, ""Steve, we're gonna start a high school, you should run it."" I told him I would and got off on the seventh floor. First thing that following Monday, I was in his office with the dead charter school application. Over the next few months, we tweaked it until it became a magnet application. With the help of some of the program's parents, we submitted it to Hartford's mayor, superintendent, and then the board. The process was anything but smooth. The district could not conceptualize what Capital Prep would become. A year-round college-preparatory uniform school for grades six to 12 was the absolute antithesis of the district's offerings. Hartford was either the worst or second-worst school system in Connecticut, with a high dropout rate and three failed traditional high schools. At first, Capital Prep was a poorly received idea. It became real, in large part, because of the state's settlement and our team's determination to answer the question. After receiving school board and state approval in December 2004, we were expected to open for August 2005. The problem was that while we had a ""team,"" Capital Prep didn't have a single employee. Since we were becoming Hartford Board of Education employees, we all had to apply for our jobs. My hire was relatively painless. Beganski, the team's operations genius, was turned away as an ""internal"" candidate. After two years of working 30 hours a week to turn an idea into a reality, he became our first central office/union casualty. I promised to resign if he wasn't hired. Finally, the district relented and gave him the job that he had designed. This was to become an ongoing theme in the school's first few years: ridiculous actions focused on maintaining the failed status quo. We worked through the summer with the rest of the team. The district stumbled and stalled until, with less than two weeks before our first day of school, Capital Prep only had two staff members: Beganski and me. We were not allowed to hire a single teacher. Even though we had had a team that had worked for years researching and designing the school for no money, we were told that none of them could be hired because union rules dictated who and when we could hire. This meant that our last employee for year one was hired 14 hours before the first day of school. In the years that have followed, the struggles with the union and central office's narrow, regressive policies have tested our commitment to answer that mother's simple question. The complexity of the answer is rooted in Capital Prep's relationship to the failed policies of the once highly centralized district and educators' union. In recent years, a new superintendent has come on board -- the third in our first three years. His approach has been absolutely aligned with what we need to exist. He leaves us alone as long as we get results. He can't shield us from the unions, but he has supported our creativity and commitment to our kids. He lets me run the school, and our teachers teach what works. That's all we've ever sought. Answering the question of ""why only the rich kids get good schools"" has set our team on an odyssey. Seven years later, we have an answer that we are proud of. Rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools, because Capital Prep's 80 percent black/Latino, 60 percent poor students attend one of America's top high schools, according to US News & World Report. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Perry.","Steve Perry: A parent asked why only rich kids get good schools .

"(CNN) -- Meet Bailey. She's a registered therapy dog, but you won't find her in hospitals or nursing homes. Instead, Bailey makes weekly visits to libraries and schools. She sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book. And no, she's not napping, and the kids don't have treats in their pockets. She's actually helping these children learn to read. It sounds implausible. After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working. The philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference. Kathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence. ""A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,"" she says. ""They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog."" The children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher. ""One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,"" says Klotz. ""Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together."" Bailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the ""Sit. Stay. Read."" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States. ""The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,"" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. ""It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system."" And the dogs really do pay attention, according to Lisa Saroyan. Her pomeranian, Minnie, has been a reading therapy dog for about a year in Fresno, California, as part of Therapy Dogs International's ""Tail Waggin' Tutors"" program. Minnie, who weighs in at only five pounds, sits calmly but alertly on a table for an hour at a time as children take turns reading to her. ""She really does sit there and stare at them,"" says Saroyan. ""And sometimes as they're turning the pages, she follows the page with her nose, and the kids just light up. She just knows what she's supposed to do.""   See Minnie in action . And then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading. For older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs. ""A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,"" she explains. ""They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it."" It's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids. ""It's not just reading scores,"" she says. ""They start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework. They don't want to miss school when they're going to read to the dog, so it improves attendance. It kind of just flows over onto everything."" R.E.A.D. staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program's results at first, but Klotz says anyone who's spent time with a dog will understand. ""It sounds a little kooky when people first hear the idea,"" she admits. ""But if they know dogs at all, and the way people relate to dogs, it quickly starts to make sense. But you don't quite ever grasp how really lovely it is until you see it happen and you see the kids light up and you see how excited they are. You see all these changes in them that they just weren't able to make."" And therapy dog owners say the pups love the program as much as the kids. ""They kind of benefit each other,"" says Saroyan. ""[Minnie] just craves that human attention, and [the kids] really benefit from her just sitting there and listening.""","Therapy dogs in libraries can help kids become more comfortable with reading .
It's less intimidating for a child to read to a dog than a parent or classmate .
Spending time with a dog also helps physiologically reduce effects of stress .
Dogs in libraries and schools are a small but growing trend across the U.S."
"Washington (CNN)  -- The Federal Aviation Administration revoked the licenses of two Northwest Airlines pilots Tuesday in an extraordinary letter in which the agency chastised the pair, saying they endangered the public by flying an hour and half without contacting controllers ""while you were on a frolic of your own."" The letter to Northwest Captain Timothy B. Cheney and First Officer Richard I. Cole puts the total time the pilots maintained radio silence at 91 minutes -- 13 minutes longer than originally defined by federal investigators. The letter said the pilots were ""extremely reckless."" ""Not only did you not comply with ... [air traffic controller] instructions, you did not even monitor the aircraft's air-ground radios,"" the letter said. ""You were disengaged and impervious to the serious threat to your own safety, as well as the safety of people for whom you are responsible. This is a total dereliction and disregard for your duties."" The letter provides new details about the flight. Cheney, 53, and Cole, 54, were piloting Flight 188 from San Diego, California, to the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in Minnesota on Wednesday when air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the Airbus A320 over the Denver, Colorado, area. Instead of beginning to descend as planned about 22 minutes before its scheduled arrival, the plane continued flying at its cruise altitude of 35,000 feet and passed over the Minnesota airport. At 8:14 p.m. CT -- 36 minutes after the plane was to begin its descent and 14 minutes after its scheduled arrival -- the pilots contacted controllers, the FAA said. One of the pilots radioed: ""We got distracted and we've overflown MSP [Minneapolis-St. Paul airport]. We are overhead EAU [Eau Claire, Wisconsin] and would like to make a 180 and to [make] an arrival from over EAU."" Cheney and Cole told federal investigators that they ""lost track of time"" while working on personal laptop computers, the National Transportation Safety Board said. They became aware of their plane's position only after a flight attendant asked about the landing time, according to the NTSB. The FAA said the revocations cite several violations of regulations, including failure to comply with air traffic control and clearances and operating carelessly and recklessly. The pilots have 10 days to appeal the revocations, which are effective immediately, to the NTSB, the FAA said. Flight 188 carried 144 passengers, the two pilots and three flight attendants. Cheney was hired in 1985 and has more than 20,000 hours of flight time, while Cole was hired in 1997 and has about 11,000 hours of flight time, according to an NTSB report released Monday. Neither pilot reported having had an accident, incident or violation, neither had any ongoing medical conditions, and neither said he was tired, the report said. They each had had a 19-hour layover in San Diego; neither said he had slept or argued during the flight, but both said ""there was a distraction"" in the cockpit, according to the report. The pilots said there was ""a concentrated period of discussion where they did not monitor the airplane or calls"" from air traffic control, though both said they heard conversation on the radio, the report said. Neither pilot said he noticed messages sent by company dispatchers, the report added. It said the men were talking about a new monthly crew flight scheduling system that was put into place in the wake of Northwest's merger with Delta Air Lines. ""Each pilot accessed and used his personal laptop computer while they discussed the airline crew flight scheduling procedure,"" the report said. ""The first officer, who was more familiar with the procedure, was providing instruction to the captain."" After landing at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, both voluntarily underwent alcohol breath tests, which proved negative, the report said.","NEW: Pilots were ""extremely reckless,"" ""on a frolic,"" FAA says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Three men who kidnapped and tortured a man over a drug debt were sentenced Tuesday in Atlanta, Georgia, to decades in prison, in a case tied to Mexican drug cartels. Federal authorities point to the 2008 case as evidence that Atlanta has become a major distribution hub for powerful Mexican drug groups such as the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels. Victor Abiles Gomez, 20, Omar Mendoza-Villegas, 19, and Gerardo Solorio Reyes, 23, were sentenced to more than 20 years each in the kidnapping and beating of Oscar Reynoso in a suburban Atlanta home, federal authorities said. Gomez and Mendoza-Villegas were sentenced to 24 years in federal prison; Reyes was sentenced to 26 years. The three gagged the victim and left him chained to a mattress in an unfinished basement for six days because of a $300,000 drug debt, authorities said. The three are illegal immigrants from Mexico and had ties to powerful drug cartels there, authorities said. ""This case demonstrates the danger inherent in the illegal business of drug-dealing,"" said Atlanta U.S. Attorney David Nahmias. ""Fortunately, this violent episode did not spill over to innocent members of our community."" In fiscal 2008, authorities confiscated about $70 million in drug-related cash in Atlanta, more than anywhere else in the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration has said. Atlanta has become a stopping point for truckloads of Mexican cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine, agents say. The drugs are held in stash houses before being distributed on the East Coast.","3 men linked to cartels kidnapped and tortured man over drug debt, authorities say .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) --  The militants behind Wednesday's deadly strike on a Pakistani marketplace that killed at least 90 people -- most of them women -- are ""on the losing side of history,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a joint news conference with her Pakistani counterpart. ""If the people behind the attacks were so sure of their beliefs let them join the political process, let them come forth to the people and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school, that they want women to be kept back, that they believe they have all the answers,"" Clinton said in response to the car bombing in Peshawar. ""They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is."" Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also condemned the deadly attack, offering his condolences to the victims and their families and directly addressing the attackers. ""We will not buckle, we will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said. ""You are on the run and we know that. We defeated you in Swat and Malakand. You think by attacking innocent people and lives you will shake our determination? No, sir, you will not."" The blast at the Meena Bazaar killed at least 90 people, most of them women, and injured more than 200 others, according to North West Frontier Province's information minister. The market is a labyrinth of shops popular with women in the Peepal Mandi section of the city. The attack is the deadliest ever carried out in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province. Clinton arrived in Pakistan on Wednesday for a series of meetings with top Pakistani officials. Talking with reporters en route to the country, Clinton said she wants to ""turn the page"" on what has been, in the past few years, ""primarily a security-anti-terrorist agenda."" ""We hold that to be extremely important, and it remains a very high priority,"" she said. ""But we also recognize that it is imperative that we broaden our engagement with Pakistan."" Clinton said there have been ""a lot of misconceptions"" about American intentions. ""We have a relationship that we want to strengthen, but we don't want it to be lopsided. We don't want it to be just about security and just about our anti-terrorist agenda,"" she said. ""It is unfortunate that there are those who question our motives, who perhaps are skeptical that we are going to commit to a long-term relationship, and I want to try to clear the air up on that while I am in the country,"" she said.","Clinton condemns bombing of Peshawar market which killed at least 90 people Wednesday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, ""Antichrist"" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter. Danish auteur Lars von Trier has been making films that shock, provoke and impress for over 40 years. Filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at Cannes and the two-hander starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception. But it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many. Von Trier was labeled a woman-hater for the wince-inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead Charlotte Gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a DIY clitoridectomy right to camera. An Ecumenical Jury that normally hands out a prize at Cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award ""Antichrist"" an ""anti-prize"" for being ""the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world."" ""Lars von Trier, we get it,"" wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times. ""You really, really don't like women."" Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: ""I mostly see myself as the female character,"" the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes. Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . The director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness. Indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von Trier, who is famously multi-phobic, would be able to make another film. In the winter of 2006, he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital, the aftermath of which left him ""like a blank sheet of paper,"" he told Danish paper Politiken at the time. Today, if not fully recovered -- the most terrifying thing he can think of is still ""myself"" -- he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues. Despite, or perhaps because of, what he describes as his ""sensitive"" nature, von Trier is one of today's great contemporary European auteurs, considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of Scandinavian filmmaking. ""I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it,"" said von Trier. ""The good side is that you can sometimes achieve something creatively. But, of course, it always also allows some of these negative thoughts in.""  Watch Lars von Trier talking to CNN's The Screening Room about ""Antichrist"" » . He has been nominated for the top prize at Cannes, the Palme D'Or, a staggering eight times, winning once in 2000 for the harrowing operatic tragedy, ""Dancer in the Dark,"" starring Icelandic musician, Bjork, who also took home the Best Actress prize that year. It is rumored Bjork became so unhinged filming ""Dancer in the Dark"" she ate her own cardigan. Von Trier claimed each morning she would say ""Mr von Trier, I despise you,"" and spit at him.  In pictures: The wierd world of Lars von Trier » . Von Trier has a reputation for being tough on his actors. His friend and long-time collaborator, actor Stellan Skarsgard describes von Trier as ""not uncomplex."" ""I was scared,"" admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance. ""I had heard stories about him as a director ... maybe he's cruel and vicious."" But she now describes him as her ""guide"" and ""the greatest director I've ever worked with."" Fueled by his unconventional approach and upbringing, the mythology surrounding von Trier looms large over everything he touches. Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying. Each visit to Cannes involves a five-day road trip from Denmark to the French Riviera by camper van. He has an undeniable egotistical streak: this year at Cannes, he declared, ""I am the best filmmaker in the world,"" and in 1991, when displeased that Cannes jury president Roman Polanski had only awarded ""Europa"" the runner-up Grand Prix prize, he called him a ""dwarf."" He also seems to actively court controversy: 1998 Palme D'Or contender ""Dogme #2: The Idiots"" grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non-simulated sex on screen, and for von Trier's typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude. But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates. He says he finds it difficult to know how to satisfy the needs of others with his films and so works only for himself. ""I feel very strongly for satisfying, maybe not my own needs, but my own idea of the film and the images that come from within,"" he told CNN. ""If I didn't follow my instinct, then I can't work.""","Pornographic sex and visceral violence in ""Antichrist"" shocked early audiences .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- The line-up at this year's Cannes Film Festival is a cineaste's dream. There are high expectations for Jane Campion's ""Bright Star,"" a drama about 19th-century poet John Keats. Packed with big name auteurs (Pedro Almodovar, Ken Loach, Lars Von Trier, Quentin Tarantino, and Park Chan-wook among others) and intriguing propositions, the competition for the coveted Palme d'Or is sure to be fierce. While there may be a dearth of surprises in the line-up, the world's shiniest cinema event has certainly proved that in these tough economic times it can still cherry pick the best of what's out there. But what among the dizzying array of celluloid magic has caught the eye of industry insiders and professionals? The Screening Room asked a blogger, a critic and a film buyer attending the festival what films they will be watching out for at this year's event. THE CRITIC . Name: Jonathan Romney . Credentials: Film critic for British newspaper The Independent on Sunday . Cannes experience: 17 years . It's heavily loaded with big names and the strange thing is that this year there are very few surprises in there. Last year there was Italian Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" (which won the Grand Prize) and Israeli Ari Folman's animation ""Waltz with Bashir,"" films that nobody knew anything about in competition. The one that people are either really looking forward to or dreading is ""Enter the Void,"" Gaspar Noe's new film. Noe gave everybody a rough time in 2002 with ""Irreversible,"" a violent, confrontational rape-revenge drama. The thing about him is once he's got you in the cinema you're not going to get out. This one has been made in Japan and is the story of someone looking at the events leading up to their own death. In particular, I'll be looking at Jane Campion's film, ""Bright Star,"" starring Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw. It's based on the three-year romance between 19th-century poet Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by his death at the age of 25. She hasn't delivered for quite a while. Her last few films were at best patchy and at worst disappointing. She's shown skill at her version of costume dramas in the past with films like ""The Piano,"" which won the Palme d'Or in 1994. Five-times Palme d'Or nominated German[-born] Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" is another film people are talking about. It is set in 1914 and is apparently about the emergence of Nazism. I imagine it will be fairly austere and confrontational. I also imagine it will be very good. He has never made a film that doesn't really engage or impress on some level. There's also Danish Cannes stalwart Lars von Trier's film ""Antichrist,"" starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg about a grieving couple who retreat to a small cabin in the forest to mourn following the death of their child. There has been some controversy over why he is making what looks like a conventional Hollywood horror. It almost certainly won't be that. I suspect it will be philosophical. A lot of these filmmakers are not entertainers. They like to give their audiences a hard time. One of the keynotes of this year is going to be confrontation. THE BLOGGER . Name: Karina Longworth . Credentials: Co-founder of Cinematical film blog and editor of Spout blog . Cannes experience: two years . In the Directors' Fortnight section I'm really excited about ""Go Get Some Rosemary,"" which is directed by these two young American brothers, Joshua and Benny Safdie. Their style is reminiscent of the French New Wave -- but with this sense of humor and willingness to experiment in real locations, and use the people that are walking by as accidental characters. They're sometimes lumped together with the young American ""Mumblecore"" scene but their films are really different. They've got a really interesting sense of style. Another film I'm really excited about is a documentary by French Oscar-winner Michel Gondry. The English title is ""The Thorn in the Heart,"" and it is about his aunt. Because it is in the Special Screening section and it's not in competition, it won't get the full red carpet treatment. But while the international press is looking the other way, if it's really good it could stand out from the crowd. Of course I'm excited to see a Quentin Tarantino movie, but my experience of being at Cannes is that going to see one of those giant films ends up taking all day long. I try to go and see films that I might not ever be able to see again. The film I'm most excited about seeing is Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist."" It looks sort of ""Rosemary's Baby""-ish and it is a return to working in English with American-known actors. I'm also looking forward to Jane Campion's new film. THE BUYER . Name: Robert Walak . Credentials: Senior vice-president, Acquisitions Worldwide, Momentum Pictures . Cannes experience: seven years . Sometimes a film is going to ""pop"" where you least expect it, and it's often not the film with established directors. It's quite difficult to find those -- the ones that create industry buzz, the ones that the critics suddenly go for, but also when you finally do get around to releasing it in your territory that the film actually crosses over and becomes an art house hit. I've already read the scripts for a lot of the films in competition -- you really want to get all of the information and do your homework. This year there's buzz about a film by an Iranian director, Bahman Qobadi, called ""No One Knows Persian Cats,"" which is being sold by innovative production company Wild Bunch. Qobadi has served as a juror on the Cannes jury before and took home a Golden Camera award in 2000 for ""A Time for Drunken Horses,"" a drama about young Iranian Kurds. I'm also looking forward to ""Antichrist."" It's going to be interesting to see what von Triers' take on a horror movie is going to be. The script was off the wall and I want to see how he brings it all together. The Ken Loach film ""Looking for Eric,"" which stars ex-footballer Eric Cantona, is meant to be fantastic. It's already sold in the UK but the script was wonderful and I think it's going to be a very distinctive, different film for Loach. Feel-good is a very overused term, but people are going to be looking for more feel-good films now anyway.","From Quentin Tarantino to Ken Loach, Cannes is packed with big names .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- A new video and a photo of ailing Communist leader Fidel Castro surfaced on Sunday, revealing a healthier-looking man than in previous photos. A man in Havana, Cuba, reads a newspaper on Sunday featuring a picture of a healthy-looking Fidel Castro. State-run Cubavision aired video of Castro during its Sunday news broadcast, saying the footage was taken Saturday when the former president met with Venezuelan law students. It was the first video of Castro broadcast in at least a year. The photo -- the second in 10 days -- published in Cuba's state-run youth newspaper, Juventud Rebelde, shows Castro, 83, meeting with Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa on Friday. The photo shows a well-groomed Castro wearing a white short-sleeve shirt and standing face-to-face with Correa. The meeting involved discussions of economic matters and medical checkups, according to the state-run newspaper. Another photo of the former Cuban president was released on August 13 by Pastors For Peace, a U.S.-based advocacy group that recently traveled to the island nation and is pushing for an end to the near half-century-old U.S. trade embargo. Castro, who came to power in 1959, underwent abdominal surgery in 2006. The Cuban leader ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul, last year, but has retained leadership of the Communist Party, the only legal political party in Cuba. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","NEW: The video of Castro is the first broadcast in at least a year .

"(CNN)  -- Loretta Chaisson Lewis, 28, was the first to die. She was reported missing on May 17, 2005. Three days later, fishermen found her body floating in a canal off Highway 26 in Jennings, Louisiana. Victims, clockwise: Laconia Brown, 23, Whitnei Dubois, 26, Brittney Gary, 17 and Necole Guillory, 26. Her father, Thomas Lewis, recently posted a plea on a Web site established in September by the Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff's Office to draw attention to the killing of his daughter and the deaths of seven other women in the area. Police say the slayings may be linked. ""We love and miss her,"" the father's message said. ""She was a loving mother, wife and daughter. If you have any information about her death, please let someone know."" There have been eight killings in four years in a small town that averages one homicide a year. The victims' bodies were dumped on the outskirts of Jennings -- population 10,546 -- west of Lafayette, Louisiana. Townspeople are perplexed. They're asking themselves, ""Is there a serial killer among us?"" That seems likely, authorities say. ""Based on an analysis of the investigation thus far, we believe the homicides may be linked to a common offender,"" Sheriff Ricky Edwards said in a recent news release. The victims ranged in age from 17 to 30 and had similar lifestyles. They were drug abusers who in some cases resorted to prostitution, ""trading sex for drugs,"" Edwards said. The throats of two of the victims were slit and the others died ""from some sort of asphyxiation, according to the coroner's office,"" he said. The bodies of all but two of the victims were either nude or partially nude, the sheriff said, but the coroner's office has not determined whether any were sexually assaulted. One month after Lewis' death, the body of Ernestine Patterson, 30, was found in a drainage canal. Two young women were killed in 2007, Kristen Lopez, 21, and Whitnei Dubois, 26. Mike Dubois, Whitnei's brother, criticized the slow pace of the investigation. ""How can there not be anything?"" he asked. ""I want justice, not just for my family, but for the families of all the girls. We live in fear that someone else is going to get killed."" But Edwards said his department and investigators from the neighboring parishes of Acadia and Calcasieu, the state attorney general's office, the Louisiana State Police and the FBI are doing everything they can. ""This investigation is intense,"" he said. ""We are following up on all leads. I assure you that we are working tirelessly to solve these murders."" In 2008, the bodies of three women were found: Laconia ""Muggy"" Brown, 23; Brittney Gary, the youngest victim at age 17; and Crystal Shay Zeno, 24. Zeno's mother, Sarah Benoit, posted this message on the Sheriff Department's Web site: . ""How beautiful you are. Your smile is forever a reminder of how special you are. It has almost been a year, but it seems like yesterday that you were taken from us. If anyone has any information on my daughter's death, please come forward. Without closure, not knowing who could have done this is very frightening. I pray every day that God will give the task force what they need to solve these cases."" In the most recent case, the body of Necole Guillory, 26, was found in Acadia Parish, off Interstate 10, in August.  Edwards believes this represented a change in the killer's modus operandi. The bodies of all the previous victims were left on the side of smaller, rural roads. ""It's likely whoever's responsible changed behavior because of increased attention in the public and the media,"" he said. Investigators think the offender has significant ties to Jefferson Davis Parish and is known to its residents, because he has demonstrated a strong familiarity with the area, Edwards said. Of the victims, the sheriff said, ""All of these young ladies had substance abuse problems and would go anywhere to fulfill their addictions."" But he said he stopped referring to their ""high-risk lifestyle"" after the family of one of the victims expressed outrage and accused his department of not caring about the women. ""Jennings and Jefferson Davis Parish is hurting and grieving the deaths of eight women since 2005,"" the sheriff said. ""The investigative team continues to pray for Loretta, Ernestine, Kristen, Whitnei, [Laconia] 'Muggy,' [Crystal] Shay, Brittney, and Necole and your families."" He encouraged anyone with information to visit the site, www.jeffdaviscrimes.net, or contact the task force at 337-824-6662. In the meantime, the families continue to wait for news. Benoit, Zeno's mother, has distributed more than 1,200 fliers in the community urging everyone to attend an October 17 prayer vigil at Lake Arthur. ""It's called Community United in Prayer,"" she said. ""Everyone is invited to pray for the victims and their families. It's a healing for our community."" ""We try to shoulder each other up,"" said Dubois, Whitnei's brother. ""It's not the time to be quiet. It's time to say 'enough is enough.'

"(CNN) -- For astronaut Jose Hernandez, his first space flight, scheduled to be aboard the space shuttle Discovery, marks a remarkable journey from the farm fields of California to the skies. Astronaut Jose Hernandez is an American-born son of immigrants from Michoacan, Mexico. Hernandez, an American-born son of immigrants from Michoacan, Mexico, is getting plenty of attention at home and abroad for his journey from working the fields to operating some of the most advanced mechanics on the space shuttle. Mexican President Felipe Calderon called the 47-year-old astronaut over the weekend to congratulate him. A transcript of the entire conversation was promptly posted online by the Mexican government. Hernandez is also reaching out to fans through Twitter, where he posts updates under the name ""@Astro--Jose."" ""I come from a very humble family and what I would call a typical migrant farm working family,"" Hernandez said in a NASA interview. As a child, Hernandez's family split their time between Mexico and California, where they worked as migrant farm workers. During the school year his parents emphasized his education, but on the weekends Hernandez would help the family, he said in the interview, posted on the NASA Web site. Growing up in Stockton, California, it was Hernandez's job as the youngest child to hold up the rabbit ear antennas on the family's television set in order to get the best reception while everyone watched the Apollo missions. ""Now I kid around with my family saying that, you know, it was through osmosis that I became an astronaut because I was closest to the whole situation,"" Hernandez told NASA. The real catalyst for his dream to become an astronaut, however, came when Franklin Chang-Diaz, became the first Latin American astronaut in 1981. ""There was a lot of parallels and that's when I challenged myself. I said, ""Hey, if Franklin can do it, why can't I do it?"" Hernandez said in the interview. Hernandez earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering, and before joining NASA worked on a number of high-tech projects, including an X-ray laser to be deployed in space, a digital mammography system and the disposal of excess nuclear material in Russia, his official biography states. According to NASA, there are nine Hispanics currently in the astronaut program, and 13 total in the program's history. Astronaut Danny Olivas, also of Mexican descent, will also fly on Discovery's upcoming 13-day mission. The scheduled launch of Discovery on Tuesday was scrubbed twice, once because of weather and then hours later because of of mechanical issues involving a drain valve. NASA did not announce a new launch schedule.","Astronaut Jose Hernandez is an American-born son of Mexican immigrants .

"(CNN) -- We are losing in Afghanistan, on two fronts. The most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the Taliban well recognizes -- is the American public. And now, most Americans are opposed to the war. For years, Afghanistan was ""the forgotten war,"" and when Americans started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of President Obama's inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight: a corrupt Afghan government, a world-class drug trade, a resurgent Taliban and steadily rising U.S. casualties. Many surely thought: Didn't we win this war eight years ago? Americans, of course, hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat, but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing, which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the Iraq war in 2006. Within a couple of years, Iraq came back from the brink and started to turn around, after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most Americans. Similarly, the American public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in Afghanistan if they saw real progress being made there. And right now, they don't. The second front we're losing is the Afghans themselves, who are the United States' center of gravity in the Afghan war. Eight years into this conflict, America and its NATO allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of Afghans -- are not providing large swaths of the Afghan population with the most basic public good, which is security. It's time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about ""connecting the Afghan people to the government"" -- Afghans have never had, and don't expect much, in the way of services from their government, and it's time now to focus on something much more basic: security. The last government to provide Afghans with real security was ... the Taliban. When they ruled the country before 9/11, security came at a tremendous price: a brutal, theocratic regime that bankrupted the country and was a pariah on the world stage. But in the context of Afghan history, the Taliban bringing security was decisively important, since what had immediately preceded their iron rule was a nightmarish civil war during which you could be robbed or killed at will by gangs of roving ethnic and tribal militias. It is has been a staple of Western political theory since the mid-17th century, when Hobbes wrote ""Leviathan,"" that if the state does not provide security to its people, life will be ""nasty, brutish and short."" Hobbes wrote ""Leviathan"" in the shadow of the English Civil War, deriving from that bloody conflict the idea that the most important political good the state can deliver is security. The United States relearned this lesson in Iraq with some success starting in 2007. But the U.S. seems to have developed instant amnesia about this issue in Afghanistan, where around 40 percent of the country was controlled by the Taliban or was at high risk for attacks by insurgents, according to a private assessment prepared by the Afghan military in April, which was obtained by CNN. A glaring symbol of the collapse of security in the country is the 300-mile Kabul-to-Kandahar highway, economically and politically the most important road in the country, which is now too dangerous to drive on. Who will then provide security? The Afghan army is relatively small and generally ineffective. The police are worse. The plans to ramp up the size and efficacy of those forces are, of course, a key part of the American exit strategy from the country. But that training mission is going to take years. Nor are NATO allies going to add significantly more troops. Indeed, a number of NATO countries are already heading to the exits. That means that it now falls to the United States to do the heavy lifting in Afghanistan, and if Obama is serious about securing the country and rolling back the Taliban, he really doesn't have much choice but to put significant numbers of more troops on the ground. That way, he can start winning the war: win back the American public, roll back the Taliban -- who have melded ideologically and tactically with al Qaeda -- and provide real security to the Afghan people. Such a ramp-up will have an additional benefit. In the larger war on al Qaeda and its allies, the center of gravity is the Pakistani public, military and government because it is in Pakistan where al Qaeda and its Taliban allies are headquartered. And in one of the most important strategic shifts since 9/11, the Pakistani military and government are now getting serious about wiping out large elements of the Taliban and allied groups on their territory and, most importantly, are doing it with the support of their population. No longer are Pakistani military operations against militants in Swat and Waziristan seen by Pakistanis as ""America's war"": they are now seen as being in the vital interests of the Pakistani state because the Pakistani Taliban and other jihadist groups have made major strategic errors since early 2009, including marching close to Islamabad, attacking Pakistan's equivalent of the Pentagon and killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers and policemen. This new development is vitally important. Over the years, U.S. military commanders have often talked about hammer and anvil operations in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan that would bring an American hammer down on the militants based along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, who would then in turn be caught on a Pakistani anvil. In reality, the American hammer was never large and the Pakistani anvil was never strong. But the ongoing Pakistani military incursion into Waziristan, which was preceded by months of ""softening up"" operations with air strikes and artillery as well as a ramped-up American drone program aimed at al Qaeda and Taliban leaders there, is today setting the conditions for a real anvil. The hammer must now be applied. Armed groups don't sue for peace when they believe they might have the upper hand, and right now, the Taliban feel that they are winning the war -- or at least not losing it, which for most insurgencies amounts to the same thing. If there is to be some kind of political reconciliation with elements of the Taliban, that will only come once they truly believe they have no prospect of military success. At the same time, key roads, cities and towns in Afghanistan must also be secured. Without providing that security, as Hobbes wrote three and half centuries ago, governments of any kind will fail at their most basic task. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","Peter Bergen: Most Americans now oppose the war in Afghanistan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There are no immediate plans to commit more U.S. troops to the ongoing war in Afghanistan, President Obama said Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, left, and President Obama meet in Washington on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters alongside Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Obama said he would consult with U.S. allies before determining a strategy in Afghanistan after last month's elections there. ""I'm going to take a very deliberate process in making those decisions,"" Obama said. ""There is no immediate decision pending on resources, because one of the things that I'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a determination about resources."" The United States has about 62,000 U.S. troops in the country, and NATO allies -- including Canada -- have another 35,000. The Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year. There have been indications that Obama soon could be asked to commit even more American troops. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more. Support in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low. Just 39 percent of Americans favor the war, while 58 percent oppose it, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday. Recent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in Canada. Obama thanked Harper for his country's commitment to Afghanistan, where more than 2,800 Canadian troops and dozens of civilians are stationed. ""They have fought; they have had staying power; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for,"" he said.  Watch Obama and Harper meet » . Most of the Canadian forces are based in the southern Kandahar province, home to some of the worst violence and instability. At least 130 Canadian troops have been killed in the war. Last year, after a national debate, the Canadian government extended the mission -- which was to end this February -- until the end of 2011. Harper said Wednesday that ""Canada is not leaving Afghanistan"" but is ""transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011."" The two leaders also discussed economic issues, issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that ""open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in North America and globally."" Obama acknowledged that the ""Buy American"" clause in the economic stimulus package has been a ""source of irritation"" between Canada and the United States and is something Harper has repeatedly brought to his attention. The clause is a provision in the $787 billion stimulus package enacted in February that states only American goods can be used in stimulus projects. But it stipulates that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Harper said Canada's concerns about the clause are ""important irritants ... but relatively small"" when compared with the overall U.S.-Canadian trade relationship.","U.S. already planning to send 6,000 more troops to Afghanistan this year .

"Editor's Note: Al Vivian is president & CEO of BASIC Diversity, Inc., a 35-year-old consultancy that specializes in diminishing cross-cultural biases that has worked with clients such as Coca-Cola, Ford, Kroger, McDonald's, the National Security Agency and CNN. He is also an adviser to the United States Army for diversity and cultural affairs. Al Vivian says Eric Holder was right to urge Americans to confront diversity issues now. FAYETTEVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African-American male and I am privileged. Not on race; but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed. As a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post-September 11 profiling. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others . Recently Attorney General Eric Holder made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in cross-racial dialogue. Holder's comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race. On confronting our history he said: . ""To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. ... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. "" Concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined: ""If we are to make progress in this area, we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us."" In a recent interview, President Obama responded by saying, America has made ""enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that ... I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language."" The president went on to say, ""I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here."" They were both right; but they were addressing two different things. Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions. Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions. Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation's human capital. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half-truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others. Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate a White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. This privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: ""When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing."" It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month. It's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters. What's missing is what the late Paul Harvey would have called ""the rest of the story."" George Washington Carver, a black man, had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut. His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context. The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut. George Washington Carver revitalized the agricultural south; thus the financial south. He saved the south. But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was a tremendous invention. However its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time, until a black man named Lewis Latimer contributed his invention, the carbon filament, to the project, making possible the widespread use of electric light. Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison. But most history books have no mention of Latimer. Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776. Great nation, strong republic, yes! Democracy, no. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people. To deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half-truths with reputably documented facts, our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history. We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot only talk. We must also listen. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism. As Holder said, this will be uncomfortable, but ""this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one America."" It's unusual when someone who is out of the norm makes his or her way into the seat of privilege, because those with whom you now share this privilege do not expect you to speak for those who do not. Welcome to your seat Mr. Holder, it fits you well. And thank you for not taking the coward's route. By the way, mission accomplished. We're talking.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""You break it, you buy it..."" Clark Howard says shoppers may save money if they keep their hands off the merchandise. ""Look, but don't touch..."" ""Keep your hands to yourself..."" Three tired platitudes you might hear in the world of retail that all suggest a direct connection between the power of touch and the act of buying something. Now a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research confirms what many have long believed, when you touch something in a store, you feel a sense of ownership and you're more likely to overpay for that item. That's why retailers like Apple always encourage you to play with the merchandise. First and foremost, the Journal of Consumer Research study presents a real caveat emptor for your wallet during a recession. And second, it confirms that I have the reading habits of a really dull guy!  Hear a few interesting tips for saving money at the grocery store » . The warning for you is that if you don't want to spend money, don't go out and handle the merchandise. Whenever I shop at Costco Wholesale, I never get a cart. I only buy what I can carry in my two arms. Once my arms are full, I'm not constantly picking up new items along the way to the register. You'd be surprised how you can cut down on your bill using this simple trick. But there's a further caution in the study. Even window shopping or browsing online can prove dangerous for your budget. The study's authors talk about the power of visualization. They suggest that if e-tailers can get you to picture yourself owning something -- even if you really can't afford it -- they have a better chance of converting you into an online sale. The question of why people spend money in ways that don't make sense is one that's addressed by behavioral economics. It's a field of study that used to be discredited in serious academic circles. But now it's proving to be an important discipline as people look for new ways to save more and spend less. A 2008 study in The American Journal of Psychiatry found that about 1 in 16 Americans -- that's some 6 percent of us -- have compulsive spending habits. This kind of behavior leads to a momentary rush of adrenaline, but afterward comes the financial hangover. Christa, my radio show's executive producer, has done a lot in her life to take control of her wayward spending habits. She believes that if you're always buying new clothes, for example, you disrespect the things you already have in your closet. When the shopping bug bites you, try paying attention to the stuff you've already acquired in your life. Speaking of closets, I once owned a house built in 1937. The master bedroom's sole closet was all of 2 x 1.5 feet in dimension! During those Great Depression years, that was big enough for a middle-class husband and wife. Today, a closet of that size would never work. Some people have so much clothing that they can go for months without wearing the same thing. So the best way to tackle compulsive spending is with shock therapy -- you've got to ban yourself from stores! Let's say you're prone to go on a shopping binge when you feel blue. You've got to make sure you don't even get into the car to go to the store or the mall. Go for a walk or go to the park if it's a nice day. If you have a conditioned response that's bad for you, you've got to work to change it. And the next time you're tempted to pick something up while shopping, remember the study in the Journal of Consumer Research. Or if that's too pointy-headed for you, just start humming the refrain from that old song by the Georgia Satellites: ""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself!""","Research says if you touch an item in a store, you are more likely to overpay for it .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The world has lost almost one-fifth of its coral reefs according a new report released by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Coral reefs could be wiped out in 30-40 years according to a new report. Compiled by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the report has brought together the work of researchers from 15 countries with data stretching back 20 years. It's not just climate change -- which raises ocean temperatures and increases seawater acidification -- which is damaging reefs. In some parts of the world overfishing, pollution and invasive species are proving equally harmful. Scientists are warning that reef destruction will have alarming consequences for around 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for their livelihood. Left unchecked, remaining reefs could be completely wiped out by 2050, the report says. Professor Olof Linden from the World Maritime University in Malmo, Sweden, told CNN: ""We see a great and imminent threat of more reefs being lost."" Speaking from the U.N. Climate Conference in Poznan, Poland, Professor Linden said that the 19 percent figure is an average. ""For many developing countries like Sri Lanka and countries in East Africa the percentage of damage is much worse. Sometimes three times as high in some places,"" he said. ""In these areas we have local effects like dynamite fishing and other destructive fishing techniques combined the threat of coral mining, unmanaged tourism and all kinds of pollution from agriculture."" But overall the biggest threat to reef survival is climate change. ""The most destructive climate event to impact the coral reefs so far,"" said Linden, ""was the 1998 El Nino which caused major coral bleaching and disrupted ecosystems all over the planet."" iReport.com: What little things are you doing to save the planet? Scientists say reefs have recovered somewhat from those bleaching events. But the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, coupled with coral disease and human effects, have slowed their recuperation. Coral reefs not only provide an income and food for those who live near them, but are also effective natural barriers against storm surges. Despite the report's pessimism, researchers see some encouraging signs. Forty-five percent of the world's reefs are currently in good health and the hope remains that damaged reefs can recover and adjust to the changing conditions. ""We must focus on helping corals to adapt to climate change and on diverting people away from destructive practices such as overfishing,"" Linden said.","The world has lost almost one fifth of its coral reefs, according a new report .

"Editor's note: Clark Howard, the Atlanta, Georgia-based host of a nationally syndicated radio show, is host of a television show designed to help viewers save more, spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times. The show airs at noon and 4 p.m. ET Saturdays and Sundays on HLN. Clark Howard says it's smart to cut back and save, but sometimes being cheap doesn't pay. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Over the last several years, we as Americans became ""negative net savers"" -- a fancy term used by pointy-headed economists to say that we spent more money than we made. In fact, our savings rate was at negative 2.7 percent as recently as four years ago. Now, however, the trend seems to be reversing. We actually saved five percent out of every dollar of disposable income in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Wow, a whole nickel out of every dollar. Thomas Jefferson would be proud! Sure, it's not the ""dime on a dollar"" rule of thumb for savings that I rave about, but it's a start.  Watch Clark talk with an amazing saver » . The truly noteworthy thing here is how we're saving this much-heralded five percent. Where exactly are we cutting back to satisfy our newfound hunger for pinching nickels? The BEA's numbers show that vehicles and fuel expenses account for nearly two-thirds of the savings. That category alone has seen a $115.2 billion decline compared with January 2008 numbers. Americans are riding their vehicles until the wheels fall off. The second largest category where we've cut back on is eating out, which is down $55.7 billion from last January. After that, we're also trimming the budget on clothing, jewelry, alcohol and more. In most recessions, the sales of alcohol do very well as people try to drown their worries in a bottle. I'm not so sure that behavior itself has changed, but this time around, people are trading down in their drink of choice. For example, fancy wine drinkers may be switching to Trader Joe's lines of Charles Shaw wines (a.k.a. Two Buck Chuck, for their $1.99-$3.49 per bottle price). Beer drinkers, meanwhile, are skipping expensive and exotic microbrews in favor of cheaper choices. Of course, there are other ways to save a nickel without having to trade down or go without. Many people are simply becoming ""do-it-yourselfers."" This trend has also been called insourcing -- when you do something yourself instead of paying someone else to do it. Some marketers have seized on insourcing to great effect. For example, Target recently ran an ad campaign that aimed to reinvent the store's image for these new, leaner times. Consider this: The ailing retailer has always positioned itself as an affordable splurge over the years. But suddenly, any kind of splurge is seen as irrelevant in today's economy and Target's sales are suffering. So their recent ad campaign was all about the ""new."" A circular I saw showed the ""new"" room service (store brand orange juice and cereal served at home); the ""new"" personal trainer (using home exercise equipment instead of paying for a gym membership); and the ""new"" restaurant (eating at home) -- all things that can be pricey, but are now being repositioned on the cheap in an effort to boost sales. Insourcing is making direct inroads into the home too -- quite literally. The Wall Street Journal's Weekend Journal recently reported on ""closet boutiques"" where women are now opening up their homes and closets to strangers in order to sell unwanted designer clothes. Closet boutiques are typically advertised on Craigslist. There were 715,000 postings in February -- more than double the amount last year at that time. For buyers, a closet boutique offers the opportunity to pick up designer threads at a tiny fraction of their new cost. But a word of caution for sellers: You'll almost certainly have some questionable characters coming into your home. Store away all your valuables, and make sure you have enough eyeballs on hand to ensure that people don't wander around your home with sticky fingers. In other DIY (do-it-yourself) moments, The Washington Post recently reported that sales of sewing kits at Wal-Mart are up 30 percent in just the last few months. People are mending their own clothes instead of paying a tailor or seamstress to do the same. And let's not even mention all the botched dye jobs that hairdressers are having to work with from women (and some men) who tried to take matters into their own hands. Sometimes, it doesn't pay to be cheap!","Americans are saving five percent out of every dollar .

"(CNN) -- American tennis legend Andre Agassi has admitted using crystal methamphetamine a year before he won the French Open in 1998, and that he lied to the sport's governing bodies in the same period about a positive drugs test to avoid a ban. The 39-year-old, who is only one of six men in history to have completed a career grand slam of winning titles at all four majors, confessed in his autobiography that he took the highly addictive narcotic in 1997 while suffering poor form and to quell worries about his upcoming marriage to actress Brooke Shields. The eight-time grand slam champion revealed in his book how he felt when he first took the substance -- possession of which carries a maximum five-year jail sentence in the United States. ""Slim [Agassi's assistant] dumps a small pile of powder on the coffee table. He cuts it, snorts it. He cuts it again. I snort some. I ease back on the couch and consider the Rubicon I've just crossed. ""There is a moment of regret, followed by vast sadness. Then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head. I've never felt so alive, so hopeful -- and I've never felt such energy,"" Agassi recounted in an excerpt of his book that has been serialized by British newspaper The Times. Following his use of crystal meth, the former world number one pulled out of the French Open and admitted he did not practice for Wimbledon a month later. Later in the year an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) doctor confirmed to Agassi -- who is currently married to former number one women's tennis player Steffi Graf -- that his use of recreational drugs had shown up in a positive dope test and that he faced a three-month suspension. The tennis great revealed how he lied in a bid to retain his reputation: ""My name, my career, everything is now on the line. Whatever I've achieved, whatever I've worked for, might soon mean nothing. Days later I sit in a hard-backed chair, a legal pad in my lap, and write a letter to the ATP. ""It's filled with lies interwoven with bits of truth. I say Slim, whom I've since fired, is a known drug user, and that he often spikes his sodas with meth - which is true. Then I come to the central lie of the letter. ""I say that recently I drank accidentally from one of Slim's spiked sodas, unwittingly ingesting his drugs. I ask for understanding and leniency and hastily sign it: Sincerely. I feel ashamed, of course. I promise myself that this lie is the end of it,""  Agassi added. Following the letter from Agassi the ATP dropped the case, allowing the American to regain a form that would see him go on to win the French Open in 1998 and the U.S. Open in 1999 before retiring in 2006.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Kurdish bloc in the Iraqi parliament intends to boycott the vote on a proposed election law if the oil-rich province of Kirkuk is banned from voting in next year's national elections, two Kurdish lawmakers said. A vote may be held Thursday on a proposal that would govern the elections, now set for January 16, legislators Mahmoud Othman and Abdul Bari al-Zebari said on Wednesday. Kirkuk, north of Baghdad, was excluded from provincial elections last January. Kurds displaced under Saddam Hussein's rule settled on land they say is rightfully theirs. However, Arab and Turkmen residents claim many more Kurds have moved into Kirkuk than were displaced, and that allowing them to vote would create an unfair advantage. Without the Kurdish lawmakers there will be no quorum, thereby blocking the vote, Sunni lawmaker Salim al-Jabouri, a member of the small Sunni political bloc, the Iraqi Front for National Dialogue, told CNN. Before conducting balloting next year, Iraq needs an election law that lays out basic rules. If one is not adopted, the government may have to either reschedule the election or rely on the law used in the 2005 national elections, officials say. Lawmakers failed to reach agreement on the issue a week ago. The other contentious election issue is that of open lists versus closed lists on ballots. Open lists would name candidates and their parties; closed lists would name only parties. Existing law, used in the 2005 election, mandates a closed list. President Jalal Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other political leaders -- members of the Political Council for National Security -- reached a tentative agreement on the draft bill Tuesday evening. Talabani's office released no details on the content. The constitutional deadline for the elections is January 31. The election commission needs at least 90 days after passage of the law to carry out elections, which U.S. and Iraqi government officials call a vital step in Iraqi efforts to solidify a democratic system in the post-Saddam Hussein era. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .","A boycott would lead to no quorum, blocking a vote, Sunni lawmaker says .

"Editor's note: Leonard Pitts Jr., a columnist for The Miami Herald, won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and is the author of a new novel, ""Before I Forget"" and ""Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood."" Leonard Pitts says we know what it takes to improve the performance of African-American students. (CNN) -- Back in 1972, on an episode of ""All in the Family,"" Gloria posed the following riddle to Archie and Meathead. Father and son go driving. There's an accident. The father is killed instantly, the son is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. The surgeon walks in, takes one look at the patient and says, ""I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."" The answer to the apparent paradox eluded Archie, Meathead and the guys down at Kelsey's bar for the balance of the half hour. They floated theories involving stepfathers, sons-in-law, priests, adoptions and returns from the dead. All of which Archie apparently found more believable than the true answer which was, of course, that the surgeon was the boy's mother. ""If that's the answer,"" he spouted, ""that's the dumbest riddle I ever hoid!"" Thirty-seven years later it is, perhaps, difficult to appreciate why this riddle ever was a riddle, how so apparent an answer could have stymied Archie, Meathead and, I would wager, the vast majority of the viewing audience. The riddle speaks volumes not just about how the world has changed in four decades, but also about how unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious. In 1972, one expected a man when one heard the word ""surgeon."" Much as, in 2009, one expects a white kid when one hears the word ""scholar."" People will deny this, will say all the right and politic things. But the disclaimers will be as thin and transparent as Saran Wrap. Black, white and otherwise, we are all socialized by the same forces and all carry, by and large, the same unconscious assumptions. One of which is that a certain level of achievement is black and another is white. This is what you are hearing when a black kid speaks standard English and another black kid chides him for ""talking white."" This is what George W. Bush was alluding to when he decried ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."" And this is what we need to address forthrightly if we ever hope to close the so-called achievement gap that looms between black kids and white ones. In 2007 and 2008, I traveled the country for a series of columns called ""What Works,"" aimed at profiling programs that addressed that gap. I traveled between big programs and small ones, from the Harlem Children's Zone, which encompasses 90 square blocks of holistic education, family counseling, medical care and tutoring in New York City, to the Freedom Project in Sunflower County, Mississippi, which offers field trips, martial arts and academic enrichment in a rural county where the median income is $25,000 a year and the teen pregnancy rate is said to be 25 percent. I toured Self Enhancement Inc. in Portland, Oregon, a KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) School in Gaston, North Carolina, the East Lake Foundation in Atlanta, Georgia, and many others. In all these places, I saw black kids -- well-spoken, clean-cut and noon-sun bright -- making a lie out of other peoples' expectations. Over the course of 13 months, common themes began to emerge whenever I would ask why kids such as these were doing such wondrous work in these places and substandard work elsewhere. We have more power to fire bad teachers and reward good ones, they said. We require parental involvement. We have a longer school day and a longer school year. We mentor children that need it. We counsel children and families that need it. We are invested in them and make sure they know it. Most of all, they spoke of the simple power of expectation: making it a conscious point to look for greatness in black kids in whom people had not thought to look for it before. What I came to understand in those interviews is that we already know the secret to improving academic performance for African-American children. What is missing is the will to do so. And that, I think, is because where they are concerned, we have other expectations. I asked Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, how he justifies asking for money to uplift poor kids in Harlem. His response struck me: ""Someone's yelling at me because I'm spending $3,500 a year on `Alfred.' 'Alfred' is 8. OK, Alfred turns 18. No one thinks anything about locking him up for 10 years at $60,000 a year."" But then, we expect Alfred to be locked up, don't we? Expect it so blithely that we will not challenge the expectation even when it works against our own economic self-interest. Canada, after all, presents a rather stark choice: invest a smaller amount early and produce a citizen who pays taxes and contributes to the system or pay a much larger amount later for the upkeep of a citizen who consumes tax monies and contributes nothing. That we consistently choose the latter says something about how we assess the educability, the salvageability, of African-American kids. Thirteen months of interviewing young scholars left me more impatient than ever with a culture that writes off black kids because they are black kids. Somewhere between the 13-year-old in rural Mississippi who wants to go to Harvard and the second-graders in Harlem studying Vincent Van Gogh, I ceased being surprised and started being angry that what I saw was still the exception and not the rule. Everywhere I went, there were black kids excelling. And at some point, you say to yourself: well, of course. What did you expect? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leonard Pitts Jr.","Leonard Pitts Jr.: Unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Her identity revealed, a blogger who posted rants about model Liskula Cohen said she was the real victim in the case and plans to sue Google for violating her privacy. Rosemary Port says she plans to sue Google for not doing enough to protect her identity. Rosemary Port and her lawyer said Monday that they will file a $15 million lawsuit against the search engine giant for not doing enough to protect her identity. ""I not only feel my client was wronged, but I feel now it sets precedent that anyone with money and power can get the identity of anyone that decides to be an anonymous blogger,"" said Salvator Strazzullo, Port's lawyer. A New York Supreme Court judge ordered Google to reveal Port's identity after Cohen sued the company to acquire information about the anonymous blogger.  Watch model explain her persistence » . ""I wanted it gone,"" Cohen said. ""I didn't want it to be there for the rest of my life. And I knew the only way for it to be gone was to call my lawyer."" In August 2008, Port, a user of Google-owned Blogger.com, created ""Skanks in NYC."" The site assailed Cohen, 37, a cover girl who has appeared in Vogue and other fashion magazines. The blog featured photos of Cohen accompanied by derogatory terms. The judge rejected Port's argument that blogs on the Internet ""serve as a modern-day forum for conveying personal opinions"" and should not be regarded as fact. Cohen's attorney, Steve Wagner, said he couldn't believe Port's nerve in suing Google. ""Her being a victim here? I have trouble understanding that in its entirety,"" he said. Legal experts said Port is not likely to win her case. Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst, said Google was complying with a court order and that disclosing Port's name cannot be viewed as violating her rights. ""Google never promises anyone absolute anonymity,"" Toobin said. ""There are all sorts of circumstances when Google cooperates with law enforcement."" Blogger.com requires only a valid e-mail address to register for a blog. After the court demanded Port's identity, Google handed over her e-mail address to Cohen's lawyers so they could track her down. In response to CNN's request for an interview, Google issued a statement: . ""Google does comply with valid legal processes, such as court orders and subpoenas, and these same processes apply to all law-abiding companies. At the same time, we have a legal team whose job is to scrutinize these requests and make sure they meet not only the letter but the spirit of the law."" Online activists have closely followed the model blogger's case. Nick Thompson of  Wired magazine said the case will force people to recognize that the blogosphere, however anonymous, is not above the law. On the other hand, it could deter some bloggers who fear the cloak of anonymity could be lifted at any moment. ""There will be people who won't publish things that maybe they should publish or that would be good for society,"" Thompson said.","Rosemary Port created ""Skanks in NYC,"" a site that assailed cover girl Liskula Cohen .

"(CNN) -- David Bartal is a journalist who grew up in Los Angeles and moved to Sweden after marrying a Swedish woman. He has lived in Stockholm for more than 20 years and writes the blog ""Cool Stockholm,"" which looks at the hottest trends in the Swedish capital. Blogger David Bartal describes Stockholm as ""progressive, quite tolerant, somewhat reserved and beautiful."" CNN: What is your favorite thing about Stockholm? David Bartal: Nature is close and accessible. Even if you live in the middle of the city you can get to a forest in a short time, but you still have that big-city feeling. CNN: Swedes have a reputation as being cold or hard to get to know -- is that fair? DB: I wouldn't say they're cold, but they are shy. People aren't especially keen to talk to strangers -- they can do quite nicely without them. People are a bit more reserved than in the U.S., which may not be a bad thing, but if you take the initiative they may be delighted to get to know you and become good friends. And no people are entirely homogenous. There are lots of extrovert, crazy Swedes -- and many of them are my friends. Watch ABBA songwriter Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . CNN: What is Stockholm like in the winter? DB: Between December and March the winter can get a bit long. It's not the cold as much as the dark -- it can make people glum. In the winter, the sun sets at four o'clock, but in summer you get incredibly long, beautiful days. It's one of the most beautiful cities on earth and it's fun to be here in the summertime. CNN: What do Stockholmers like to do in the summer? DB: In the summertime many will go to their country houses, they want to get out of the city. If they have a boat they want to be on the boat. In early August there are crayfish parties. People get together in groups and put on conical hats and paper napkins and eat crayfish, drink hard liquor and sing drinking songs. I've become quite assimilated, but not assimilated enough for crayfish parties! Foreigners just shake their heads in wonder. See photos of Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm » . CNN: What areas are good for nightlife? DB: There are two options: Stureplan has glitzy clubs and fancy restaurants. Party people might typically start their evening at the ""little bar"" at Riche, which has good DJs and attracts an arty crowd, then shift to Berns at midnight for flirting and dancing, and if they know the doorman or are feeling lucky, party in the early hours at celebrity hot-spot Spy Bar. There's also an area on the south side, mainly up on Mosebacke. It's funkier, a little more bohemian and a little more mellow, with clubs and music venues. You have to trudge up a steep cobble-stone street to get to the top of Mosebacke, but it's worth the climb. The view of the city at night is amazing and there are some cool nightspots. One of them is Kägelbanan (which means bowling hall). I danced my socks off not long ago there to some high-energy Turkish pop. What makes Stockholm special to you? Tell us in the SoundOff box below . CNN: Sweden is known for its design -- are Stockholmers a fashionable bunch? DB: They are fashion conscious -- people follow trends quite slavishly. This season men are wearing red pants and women are wearing gladiator sandals -- it's almost mandatory. CNN: What are the latest trends in the city? DB: There's a lot of variety in coffee shops that didn't exist previously. There are imitation New York coffee shops, but there is also some innovation. Ljunggren Cafe, on the south side of town, is very designed. It has low, gray couches spread over a large area creating a very social environment; it's great for people watching. Also, when it comes to coffee shops I recommend Vete-katten at Kungsgatan 55. It's authentic and retro, furnished like your great-aunt's parlor. They make a delicious open-faced shrimp sandwich and awesome pastries. CNN: If Stockholm were a person, what would he or she be like? DB: Progressive, quite tolerant, somewhat reserved, and beautiful.","Culture-vulture David Bartal has lived in Stockholm for more than 20 years .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Repair work on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge will continue nonstop into the weekend and the bridge may reopen Monday, but officials were making no promises Friday. ""Commuters are going to need to check back with us over the weekend,"" said Bart Ney, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation. ""We're going to do everything we can to get the bridge open for the Monday morning commute, but safety is the priority for us right now."" Repair work has not stopped since it began Tuesday night when two steel rods and a steel crossbeam plummeted from the bridge, landing on the roadway and forcing the span's closure. The same section had been the site of repairs over Labor Day weekend, when crews fixed a crack. On Friday, workers were grinding the areas where there was the potential for steel-on-steel connection, Ney said. ""We want them to be very smooth."" The rods' alignment has not been completed to the point where workers could begin stressing them, he said. Once that work is complete, a third-party group will look at how the system handles vibrations, he said, adding, ""There is still a lot of work to be done."" Transportation officials had said Thursday night that repairs of the bridge, which carried about 280,000 vehicles per day, would be complete by late Friday morning, but Ney said contractors were still working on custom-fitting steel for the structure. Crews worked Friday to replace four steel rods. One of those had failed and caused the problems, Dale Bonner, California's secretary of business, transportation and housing told reporters Thursday. Engineers also will make sure the rods are centered and will strengthen the welds to ensure stability, Bonner said. Vibrations in the rods, affected by strong winds, caused the break, officials said. In the wake of the bridge's closing, commuters flocked to the Bay Area's rail system. On Thursday, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) said, the system carried the most passengers ever, breaking a record set the day before. About 442,000 people took BART, 24 percent more than on an average Thursday, the agency said in a news release.","NEW: ""We're going to do everything we can to get the bridge open"" Monday .

"(CNN)  --  A search has been launched for a 50-year-old convicted rapist and suspect in the killings of six people whose bodies were found in and around a house in Cleveland, Ohio, police said Friday. The incident began unfolding a month ago, when a woman accused Anthony Sowell of rape and felonious assault, Cleveland Police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho told CNN. ""Once we were able to get the cooperation of the victim, we secured an arrest warrant for Mr. Sowell and subsequently a search warrant for his premises,"" Stacho said. On Thursday, detectives from the department's sex-crimes unit and members of its SWAT team went to Sowell's home to execute the warrant and to arrest the suspect, but he was nowhere to be found, Stacho said. What they did find were the badly decomposed remains of two bodies on the third floor of the house, which is owned by an elderly relative of Sowell who did not live there, Stacho said. A subsequent search on Thursday revealed what appeared to be a freshly dug grave under the stairs in the basement, he said. On Friday, investigators returned to the house, dug up the grave and found a third body, he said. A further search of the house and property found two more bodies in a crawl space and a sixth body was found in a shallow grave outside the home, Stacho said. Read local coverage on CNN affiliate WJW . None of the bodies has been identified, and the genders of only two -- those found on the third floor -- have been determined, he said. Both were female. ""He apparently is a serial rapist,"" Stacho said about Sowell, who he said makes his living as a ""scrapper."" ""He walks around and picks up scrap metal and takes it to junk yards to make a few pennies."" Sowell was convicted for a 1989 rape for which he was imprisoned from 1990 to 2005, Stacho said. Authorities plan to continue their search of the house on Saturday.","Search launched for a convicted rapist, 50; he's suspect in six slayings .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- The state's governor gave his support to the embattled chief minister, who had tendered his resignation after an allegation that he was involved in a sex scam dating back to 2006. Omar Abdullah denies any link to a prostitution ring, saying he has stepped down to clear his name. The allegation was leveled Tuesday against Omar Abdullah, 38, by a senior leader of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Muzaffar Hussain Beigh, on the floor of the state assembly. Omar's swift resignation plunged the state into a constitutional crisis that appeared to end Thursday when the New Delhi-appointed governor, N. N. Vohra, issued a communique asking Omar to ""continue in office as (Vohra) had got the allegation investigated through the Indian home ministry."" The governor said that, ""based on the information supplied to him by the union home ministry, there is no basis for Omar Abdullah seeking to resign."" Vohra urged the chief minister to ""most vigorously devote himself to discharging responsibilities of chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir."" The opposition party dismissed the governor's communique, saying, ""It has the potential of bringing the highest constitutional authority of the state also into controversy as the communique doesn't make mention about the chief minister's resignation."" A relaxed Omar told journalists Thursday evening that he had ""full confidence"" in his innocence. Omar had delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member Muzaffar Hussain Beigh accused him, during a session of the state legislative assembly, of being connected to a prostitution scandal. Muzaffar served as deputy chief minister in the previous government, when several top pro-India officials were arrested on charges that they had misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in Kashmir. Omar denied involvement but said he could not ""continue in the office following the allegation"" and would not serve again until he was cleared of the charges. Omar entered office in January after elections in late 2008 that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly 20 years, since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency. Voters went to the polls in large numbers, despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting. Most recently, the chief minister has been working to defuse tensions that are still running high after the arrest of four police officers in the probe of the alleged rape and murder of two young Muslim women in May. Two people have died and many have been wounded in clashes between Muslim protesters and Indian security forces stemming from the case. The arrests included the former police chief of south Kashmir's Shopian district and three of his subordinates, who are accused of ""destruction of evidence"" and ""dereliction of duty"" in connection with the deaths, which occurred in the town of Shopian. Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades during which, 43,000 people have been killed, according to official figures. Various rights groups and non-governmental organizations in Kashmir, however, contend that the number killed during the last two decades is twice the official figure.","New Delhi-appointed governor Vohra asks Omar to ""continue in office""

The policy, announced Thursday by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, continues to give border officials the authority to search files in travelers' laptop computers, mobile phones, Blackberrys and similar devices with or without suspicion that a crime has occurred. That is in keeping with long-standing court rulings that say the federal government's powers of search and seizure are greatest at the border to protect the country. But the new policy also attempts to address complaints from travelers that border officials are needlessly perusing confidential information, downloading it and keeping devices and information indefinitely without any explanation. The policy gives travelers the right to be ""present in the room"" during searches, although they are ""not necessarily ... permitted to witness the search itself."" It says searches should be conducted ""as expeditiously as possible."" And Customs and Border Protection officers should keep devices no longer than five days unless there are ""extenuating circumstances."" Officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the investigative branch of the Homeland Security Department, can keep devices up to 30 days. It also requires border officers to document searches and conduct them in the presence of a supervisor. And it says they should take steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information and share it only with federal agencies ""that have mechanisms in place to protect"" the data. Border officers have long had to deal with issues pitting privacy versus security. But with the proliferation of laptop computers, travelers increasingly are traveling with sensitive information, including confidential legal documents, medical records, credit card and bank information and trade secrets. ""Keeping Americans safe in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully screen materials entering the United States,"" Napolitano said in a written statement. ""The new directives ... strike the balance between respecting the civil liberties and privacy of all travelers while ensuring DHS can take the lawful actions necessary to secure our borders."" The American Civil Liberties Union said the new rules are a ""welcome first step,"" but said they do not go far enough. ""There are two key aspects of this new policy worth applauding -- the limitations on the time that electronic devices can be held by customs officers and requirements that information from electronic devices only be retained if there is probable cause that a crime has been committed,"" said ACLU attorney Christopher Calabrese. ""These procedural safeguards recognize that the old system was invasive and harmed many innocent travelers."" ""But unless and until the government requires agents to have individualized suspicion before reviewing such sensitive information as medical records, legal papers and financial information, even the most elaborate procedural safeguards will be insufficient,"" he said. The ACLU this week filed suit seeking records about the Customs and Border Protection's policy of searching travelers' laptops. The Homeland Security Department's statement said its new policies ""enhance transparency, accountability and oversight of electronic media searches at U.S. ports of entry."" ""Searches of electronic media ... are vital to detecting information that poses serious harm to the United States, including terrorist plans, or constitutes criminal activity -- such as possession of child pornography and trademark or copyright infringement,"" the statement said. The department said it searches electronic media ""on a small percentage of international travelers."" The border protection agency said that between October 1, 2008, and August 11, it conducted about 1,000 laptop searches while processing more than 221 million travelers at U.S. ports of entry. Just 46 searches were in depth, it said.","New policy attempts to address travelers' complaints about privacy at borders .

She was named among the ""top five trendspotters"" by VNU in 2004 and has been credited with popularizing the term ""metrosexuality."" She blogs at www.pnintelligentdialogue.com. See Salzman on American Morning and CNN.com Live Monday, December 29. Marian Salzman says ""cuspers"" are staking out a separate identity from the baby boomer generation. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rarely has there been a year when so many things went out of style in such a short time: not just investment bankers, gas-guzzling vehicles, corporate jets, conspicuous consumption and political polarization, but also a whole generation. After strutting and tub-thumping and preening their way across the high ground of politics, media, culture and finance for 30 years, baby boomers have gone from top dogs to scapegoats in barely a year. As baby boomers lose their authority and appeal, generational power is shifting one notch down: to cuspers (born roughly 1954-1965), who arrived in style in 2008 with their first truly major figure, Barack Obama (born 1961). George W. Bush, born in 1946 at the start of the postwar baby boom for which his generation is named, will leave office with the lowest approval ratings since Richard Nixon was president. As Thomas Friedman has written, Bush epitomizes what's now seen as ""The Greediest Generation."" Who's to blame for the economy going into serious decline? The short and easy answer is greedy boomers. This is the generation that knew better than their cautious, fuddy-duddy parents, the generation that protested, that had ideals and marched to the beat of defiant music: ""Street Fighting Man,"" ""We Want the World and We Want It Now,"" ""Hope I Die Before I Get Old."" It's the generation that pursued pleasure, proclaimed ""I can have it all"" and refused to grow old -- ""50 is the new 30,"" etc. And now, after years of taking credit for changing the world, baby boomers are taking the rap for the reversal of fortune that's shaking the world. Whatever history may decide, today's commentators and pundits of all ages have decided that boomers, the dominant cohort in many developed countries, are guilty. And whether they're really to blame, what counts is that they look like they are. Their profile fits. Like a big-name Hollywood director who's lived on the edge too long, caused one too many scandals and made one too many turkeys, suddenly the boomers are the generation no one wants to be associated with. Cuspers, the age cohort that have been living in the shadow of the boomers, now have even more reasons to stake out their own separate identity and values. It's taken a long time for this rising demographic to be recognized as a distinct generation in its own right. They've been called ""late boomers"" because they missed the formative boomer experiences of the '60s, such as civil rights and anti-war protests. They've been called tweeners or cuspers because they straddle the divide between Boomers and Gen X. American social commentator Jonathan Pontell has worked hard to establish their identity as Generation Jones. There's still debate about whether cuspers are even a generation apart from boomers and where the generational boundaries lie. But those arguments miss the key point, which is that Americans want change. In Obama, they see the hopeful prospect of a new generation taking over. And in these dark days, they're hoping against hope that his generation can usher in new, better values to guide the nation. His victory has been portrayed as the end of Vietnam War politics and the 1960s ""culture wars."" About half those Obama named to major posts in the new administration are also cuspers including the proposed energy czar, education secretary, treasury secretary and U.N. ambassador. Cuspers may have another poster child if Caroline Kennedy, born in 1957, is named to the New York Senate seat that Hillary Clinton is expected to vacate. Obama himself has made clear he thinks in terms of generational difference. He has spoken of carrying on the work of the ""Moses generation"" -- the Martin Luther King Jr. generation --  whose successors he has referred to as the ""Joshua generation."" His activists rallied under the banner of Generation Obama, and his campaign's ability to mobilize the youth vote proved decisive in his victory. Whether we call them cuspers, Generation Jones or Generation Obama, there are enigmas and paradoxes within this generation and its fans. They respond to Biblical imagery, but they're not dogmatic in their faith. They value traditional notions of family but see men and women as equals in parenting. They go back to older American values -- civility, community, responsibility -- yet keenly embrace technology and use the Internet naturally. In fact, embracing digital technology is one of the telling dividers between boomers and cuspers. It's no coincidence that leading-edge Cuspers such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Tim-Berners Lee, all born in 1955, helped create the digital universe cuspers and younger generations now inhabit as a matter of course. It's also telling that Gates and wife, Melinda, another cusper, are the parents of philanthro-capitalism. For marketers and brand specialists, cuspers are a fast-emerging challenger brand that's fascinating to watch as it defines itself and attracts fans. Brand attributes once seen as disadvantages -- living in the shadow of boomers, a lack of major formative experiences, no ""heroic"" narrative -- have turned out to be advantages as the boomer brand loses its sheen. The cusper brand can define itself by what it's not: greedy, selfish, confrontational, hung up on past battles. The cusper generation is as much an ideal as it is a demographic group, and that appeal extends well beyond the birth years that define it. Watch out for tweets (messages on the Twitter platform) that proclaim ""Ich bin ein cusper."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marian Salzman.","Marian Salzman: For 30 years, baby boomers dominated politics, culture .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's president escaped an opportunistic attack by Islamic militants Wednesday as deadly fighting erupted in the center of Mogadishu, officials said. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was returning from a trip to Yemen when insurgents began firing mortars, resulted in a clash with African Union peacekeepers, the president's director of communications told CNN. ""The Islamic insurgents were just guessing the arrival of the president so they started firing mortars, just to send a kind of their regular violent message that they are around,"" said Abdulkadir Barnamij. The heaviest of the fighting was centered on Maka Al Mukarama, which links the airport to the presidential palace but it is heavily guarded by forces from the African Union Mission in Somalia. Meanwhile Ali Muse, head of an emergency group in the city, confirmed to CNN that three people died and 16 others were wounded in the fighting. ""The casualty (number) is small because people deserted the streets soon after the fighting started,"" said Ali Muse. -- Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report .","President's office: Islamist insurgents, African Union peacekeepers exchanged fire .

"(CNN) -- A former Alabama judge accused of checking male inmates out of jail and forcing them to engage in sexual activity was found not guilty Monday on charges of sexual abuse, attempted sodomy and assault, his lawyer said. Attorney Robert Clark said former Judge Herman Thomas was found not guilty on several charges and the judge in the case granted a directed verdict of acquittal on all the other counts. The Mobile County district attorney did not immediately return CNN calls for comment. Thomas, 48, denied wrongdoing. Clark said on October 20 that the judge was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them. The judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office, Clark said last week. ""He was mentoring them. He was trying to get them to do right, to be productive citizens."" Thomas cried after the verdicts were read, Clark said Monday. ""He hugged me and he hugged his wife. And he had a courtroom full of supporters. It all worked out in the end,"" the attorney said. One of the alleged victims testified October 19 that he doesn't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by Thomas, according to The Mobile Press-Register newspaper. But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions, the newspaper reported, and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room, in the small office and at a Mobile, Alabama, fraternity house. Another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002, Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury, according to the Press-Register. Thomas convicted him of lesser charges, he testified, and sentenced him to a 90-day boot camp. He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse, the newspaper reported. Neither man was identified. ""All of them [the alleged victims] were given preferential treatment at some point,"" Nicki Patterson, chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County, said earlier this month. ""And ultimately, when some of them refused to continue participating [in the activities], they were given what I would view as excessive sentences. But certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege, the state would say, it was extremely lenient sentences."" Clark said his client's next hurdle is the Alabama State Bar. ""They suspended him back in March because he got indicted. And we're fighting to give him his law license back,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have decided to call off a search-and-rescue mission for nine people who may have plunged into the Pacific Ocean off southern California after a Coast Guard C-130 plane and a Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopter collided Thursday night. ""I've reached the conclusion that hope is no longer viable,"" Coast Guard Rear Adm. Joseph Castillo said Sunday. ""We no longer believe there is any chance somebody could still be alive."" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger offered his condolences to family members of the missing Sunday. ""Together, we send our thoughts and prayers to their families and friends,"" Schwarzenegger said in a statement. ""Our hearts are with them during this difficult time."" Searchers had scoured the ocean for 60 hours without finding any sign of survivors. They reported Saturday that the search had covered 644 square miles. The Navy, Marine Corps and Customs Border Protection helped in the search. The Coast Guard weighed the exhaustive nature of the search, the wreckage, the nature of the collision, the temperature of the water and the time elapsed. A Coast Guard captain said Friday that survivability could be up to 20 hours. On Saturday night, relatives of the missing were briefed about the decision to call off the rescue effort. The order was to go into effect as soon as the planes involved in Sunday morning's dawn search returned about 9 a.m. Coast Guard pilots had been searching for a missing person in the water. That person was ""reported to have gotten in a dinghy and attempted to row to Catalina [Island],"" Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris said Friday. ""We were searching in that area because of the drift that would have naturally occurred after that event."" The collision occurred about 7 p.m. Thursday, when the Coast Guard plane with a seven-person crew collided with a Marine AH-1 Cobra helicopter carrying two people. A pilot not involved in the incident reported seeing a fireball about 7:10 p.m. Thursday near the crash site. The two Marine pilots were conducting routine training about 15 miles off San Clemente Island when their helicopter collided with the U.S. Coast Guard plane. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar identified them as Maj. Samuel Leigh and 1st Lt. Thomas Claiborne, both with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 469. The Coast Guard's seven missing personnel were stationed at Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento, California, where their aircraft was based. Castillo has said that an investigation was beginning with the Marine Corps. A large debris field has been located, and pieces have been collected, the Coast Guard spokesman said. The Coast Guard identified its seven missing personnel as Lt. Cmdr. Che J. Barnes of Capay, California, aircraft commander; Lt. Adam W. Bryant of Crewe, Virginia, co-pilot; Chief Petty Officer John F. Seidman of Stockton, California, flight engineer; Petty Officer 2nd Class Carl P. Grigonis of Mayfield Heights, Ohio, navigator; Petty Officer 2nd Class Monica L. Beacham of Decaturville, Tennessee, radio operator; Petty Officer 2nd Class Jason S. Moletzsky of Norristown, Pennsylvania, air crew; and Petty Officer 3rd Class Danny R. Kreder II of Elm Mott, Texas, drop master. The Coast Guard announced that a memorial service for personnel missing in the collision will be at 11 a.m. PT Friday at the Coast Guard station in Sacramento.","Spokesman: Search halted because ""hope is no longer viable""

"(CNN) -- Sen. Ted Kennedy would have had a ""very, very difficult"" time politically surviving the drowning death of a young woman if it happened in the era of blogs, talk radio and 24-hour news cycles, experts said. Sen. Ted Kennedy hit the airwaves to say it was ""indefensible"" he didn't immediately report the accident. Mary Jo Kopechne, 28, drowned after Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off a bridge following a regatta party in July 1969. The incident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, helped dash the youngest Kennedy brother's chances at the Oval Office in 1972 and 1980. Massachusetts was more forgiving than the rest of the nation, however, backing Kennedy by a 3-to-2 margin in his 1970 bid to keep his Senate seat. That his brothers, John and Robert, had been assassinated in recent years may have been a factor, experts said.  Watch Kennedy attend brother Robert's funeral » . ""Great expectations and great tragedy has always been the storyline of the Kennedys,"" said Christopher Arterton, dean of George Washington University's graduate school of political management. ""The people of Massachusetts were prepared to forgive a lot of transgressions."" Kennedy vanished to the family compound for days after the incident, huddling with advisers before emerging the following week to plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. A judge suspended his two-month jail sentence. Critics saw the plea as an attempt to stifle details that would have emerged during a trial. In a display of the senator's legendary oratory, he delivered a nationally televised explanation and apology, saying it was ""indefensible"" that he hadn't called police until the day after the accident.  See how Chappaquiddick fit into Kennedy's legacy » . ""If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office,"" Kennedy said. Jim Baughman, author of ""The Republic of Mass Culture: Journalism, Filmmaking, and Broadcasting in America since 1941,"" said he recalls Kennedy's address being ""less an explanation to the country than to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."" The nation's response was tepid. According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed ""to tell the real truth,"" 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately. However, 58 percent of respondents said ""he has suffered, been punished and should be given the benefit of the doubt.""  Watch a timeline of Kennedy's tragedies, triumphs » . ""I think the national repercussions would have been more severe [today],"" Baughman said. In 1969, the national media were dominated by three TV networks and a handful of magazines and newspapers. New media and talk radio would be a ""much more ferocious force"" today, he said. Media reports from the time indicate few mysteries were solved by Kennedy's address. Then-Edgartown Police Chief Jim Arena was often lambasted for his handling of the case. He said Thursday he would handle it no differently today except that he would charge Kennedy with vehicular homicide, a charge that did not exist in 1969. ""I will always contend that what happened that night was an accident. What happened afterward has never been completely explained,"" said Arena, who is now 79. In his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired. He denied ""widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct"" and also refuted reports that he was ""driving under the influence of liquor.""  Watch Kennedy's explanation » . Kennedy said his unfamiliarity with the bridge, which had no guardrails and met the road at an awkward angle, caused him to drive off the side and into Poucha Pond. ""The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water,"" Kennedy said. ""Water entered my lungs and I actually felt the sensation of drowning, but somehow I struggled to the surface alive."" Kopechne did not. Kennedy said he dived back into the water several times, ""but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm."" Conceding he did not seek a telephone, Kennedy said he returned to the party and summoned a cousin and friend to the scene. They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said. ""All kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some of them irrational, many of them which I cannot recall, and some of which I would not have seriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during this period,"" he said. He asked to be taken to the ferry slip, he said, where he jumped into the water, swam the 500-foot channel back to Edgartown, returned to his hotel room and collapsed. It wasn't until morning that he called police, and then, only after he called legal adviser Burke Marshall, he said. The media clamored with questions: Why had Kopechne left her purse and room key at the cottage and told no one she was going home? How did Kennedy get lost on a one-turn trip to the ferry? Was the ferry operating when Kennedy and Kopechne left? ""The larger anger about it was the 10-hour lag [in reporting the accident], that he was more concerned about his reputation than this young woman's life,"" Baughman said. ""He didn't take enough time to blame himself and take responsibility."" Today, Baughman said, Kennedy could still survive a Chappaquiddick -- largely because of the Kennedys' clout and because Massachusetts is so enamored with the family -- but it would be tougher with the Slate.coms and Drudge Reports of the world hounding him. George Washington University's Arterton concurs that, like Jesse Helms' North Carolina or Strom Thurmond's South Carolina, Massachusetts would likely forgive one of its favorite sons today. If Kennedy survived his first re-election, as he did in 1970, he likely would have prevailed in later ones, though it would have been ""very, very difficult to remain in office,"" Arterton said. He also doubts Kennedy would have been able to isolate himself with advisers for days without making a statement.  Watch a newsreel of Kennedy's early years » . ""In the cable news era, that would not have been possible,"" he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers. ""There would have been much more effort to dig into that story nationally."" At the least, Baughman said, ""you'd have maybe a more diverse conversation about Kennedy's culpability and judgment."" Then-Chief Arena remembers the intense criticism of his investigation from his own counterparts. Diver John Farrar, who pulled Kopechne from the car, told media outlets she may have lived had Kennedy called police immediately, and George Killen, a detective-lieutenant with the State Police, alleged at the time that Kennedy ""killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger."" Kennedy's explanation was a ""weak defense,"" Arena acknowledges, but he insists there was no evidence of negligence to facilitate manslaughter charges. Arena said the Kennedys never pressured him during the investigation. He also never obfuscated details to benefit Kennedy -- in part, because of a paternal adage he has always held dear. ""When you tell the truth, you don't have to worry about what you said the first time,"" he said. ""The charge I came up with was the only one I thought we could prove. ... I did what I could, and I'll stick by it.""","Media ""more ferocious"" today, wouldn't have left questions unanswered, expert says .

"New York (CNN) --  Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination, the CDC said late Monday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville, New York, was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli, a potentially deadly species of bacteria. The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe's, Price Chopper, Lancaster and Wild Harvest, Shaw's, BJ's, Ford Brothers, and Giant Food Stores. The exact products affected are listed on the USDA's Web site. The recall was for distribution centers in eight states, but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states. Each package is printed with ""EST. 492"" inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label. They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28, the USDA said. Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall, the USDA said. E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products, whether they are fresh or frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature, the FSIS said. Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak, eight are in Massachusetts; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire; two each are in Maine, Pennsylvania and South Dakota; and one each is in California, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Vermont, according to the CDC.","Two people have died after becoming infected with E. coli in this outbreak .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Portland, Oregon, doesn't lack for fashionable boutique hotels, but to the west, along the Pacific Ocean, the options have tended to be as primal as the shoreline. Recently, however, a group of properties has sprung up on the northern coast, aiming to seduce 21st-century travelers with designs steeped in post-World War II Modernism. The Cannery Pier Hotel was built on the site of a fish-packing facility on the Columbia River. Each stop on this easy three-night itinerary provides a stylish Oregon beach getaway -- along with postcard-worthy water views. Day 1: Portland to Astoria . Follow the Columbia River Highway (U.S. 30) as it meanders along the waterway that led Lewis and Clark to the sea. (For more shore-hugging river views, cross the Oregon Way Bridge, just west of Rainier, and drive on Washington's Ocean Beach Highway -- but be sure to return to Route 30 by crossing back over at Cathlamet.) Make your way to Astoria, the oldest American settlement west of the Rockies (founded in 1811), a revitalized former fishing town with Victorian architecture and a restored 1913 riverfront trolley. Take in the town -- and the mouth of the Columbia River -- from the 125-foot Astoria Column, and for a dramatic close-up of the Astoria Bridge, which connects Oregon and Washington, check in to the Cannery Pier Hotel (doubles from $299). Built on the site of a fish-packing facility on a pier that extends 600 feet into the river, the four-year-old hotel embraces a Pacific Northwest version of loft architecture, with exposed steel beams in the atrium-style lobby and hardwood floors in the 46 balconied rooms. The best place to eat is just a short stroll down the pier at the Bridgewater Bistro (dinner for two $75; 503/ 325-6777). The restaurant offers exceptional views of the river and bridge, a tasting room for the Oregon Coast's Flying Dutchman Winery, and a small-plates menu featuring watermelon-and-feta salad and a savory cheesecake with Dungeness crab. Day 2: Astoria to Arch Cape . The Oregon Coast Highway (U.S. 26) crosses Youngs Bay and snakes southward almost to Arch Cape, set in the lush green terrain of Oswald West State Park. It's a 30-mile trip that passes through the monied enclave of Gearhart, as well as Seaside, one of the first beach resorts in Oregon. Travel + Leisure: 45 best new hotels of 2009 . Be sure to explore the Cannon Beach art colony, comprising 19 galleries and crafts studios; then hit the sand to behold Haystack Rock, a 235-foot-tall basalt formation that's the third-largest such ocean monolith in the world. You might also want to scope out a spot for dinner in Cannon Beach -- locals love the French-Italian dishes such as pesto-and-prawn pasta at Newmans at 988 (dinner for two $110, 503/ 436-1151) -- or stock up on Oregon wine and Tillamook cheese before heading to Arch Cape, a tiny residential community with no restaurants. It is here that Bruce Bessey transformed an old beach house into the Ocean Point Inn & Spa (doubles from $275). The three handsome suites, with mod furnishings, are perfect for curling up in when the rain lashes the wild surf. In fair weather, guests mingle on the oceanfront deck to watch gray whales or gaze at the stars. In the morning, a hearty breakfast with fresh pastries provides fortification for beachcombing. Nestled between two state parks, the inn offers direct access to a nearly deserted Pacific stretch with sand dollar-filled tide pools. Day 3: Arch Cape to Lincoln City . Lincoln City is a straight 79-mile shot down the 101, past open stretches of sand with more clumps of beach grass than sunbathers. Along the way: Laneda Avenue, in Manzanita, is a charming shopping strip; the Picnic Basket (503/ 355-8500), in Rockaway Beach, has 97 flavors of salt-water taffy; Garibaldi Marina (503/ 322-3312) will hook you up for crab hunting and clam digging; and the Hawk Creek Café (503/ 392-3838), in Neskowin, serves fresh seafood and a popular wood-fired pizza. Tillamook is the home of the famous cheddar, as well as ice creams made from local berries. Past Lincoln City, in Newport, is a worthwhile detour: the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, dating from 1871. The beachfront at Lincoln City is stacked with condo-by-the-sea complexes which makes the recent renovation of the 141-room Surftides (doubles from $134) that much more welcome. Under the new management of the owners of the hip Farmer's Daughter hotel, in Los Angeles, the Surftides -- first opened in 1936 -- is now decorated with cork bulletin-board walls and jazzy striped daybeds. The balconied guest rooms reference Midcentury Modern design with sleek built-ins and bold orange accents. You'd swear you were sleeping in an urban boutique hotel, except the roar outside your door is waves, not traffic. Planning a beach getaway?

"BELLEVUE, Nebraska (CNN)  -- If LeRoy Carhart's abortion clinic had a terror alert scale, it would be at Code Red this weekend. Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. ""I feel safer on an airplane than I do in my clinic,"" Carhart said, sitting at his desk in his windowless office in Bellevue, Nebraska. ""You try to think about every way an attack could happen. You try to do all you can to prevent it, but obviously Dr. [George] Tiller thought he was safe in church."" It's been nearly three months since Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions, was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, plan to launch protests outside Carhart's clinic this weekend in Bellevue, just south of Omaha. They will be the first major anti-abortion protests since the Tiller killing. The demonstrations are set to culminate Saturday with so-called Truth Trucks -- delivery trucks with giant rolling billboards of dismembered fetuses on the sides -- parking outside Carhart's clinic and canvassing area neighborhoods. Protesters carrying anti-abortion signs also are expected. Operation Rescue President Troy Newman has vowed a peaceful demonstration and said that any hints of possible violence are ginned up by what he calls left-wing groups and the liberal media. His group scaled down plans to protest at Carhart's facility Friday when it learned women's rights groups, including the National Organization for Women, would be there. Operation Rescue will hold a rally at a church instead Friday. ""Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...,"" said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation. ""We fear that these kinds of activities can eventually erupt in violence, and I urge the community to make sure violence doesn't happen."" Abortion rights supporters were predominant in the 50 to 75 people gathered outside the clinic Friday morning. ""Welcome, welcome, this clinic stays open,"" some shouted when cars pulled into the clinic's driveway. Newman said earlier, ""I'm not interested in putting our folks in any situation where the other side might flare up. I'm very confident about our side. They're very peaceful moms and dads and families that will be showing up with signs."" He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller. ""Shooting someone in the head in a church,"" he said, ""is not a pro-life act. Sorry, it doesn't qualify."" Scott Roeder, a 51-year-old anti-abortion activist, is charged in Tiller's killing. He has pleaded not guilty. Newman said he wants Carhart shut down -- through legal means. He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle. ""I vehemently disagreed with what Mr. Tiller did, as well as all abortionists for what they do. But they're still human beings, and they deserve due process,"" Newman said. Tiller was one of about a dozen U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. In the wake of his death, his family decided to close his clinic permanently. Carhart was a close friend and understudy of Tiller's. He performed abortions at Tiller's clinic for a week every month, including late-term procedures. Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy. He said he's performed more than 60,000 abortions in the past two decades. About 400 of those were after 24 weeks, he said. Staring across the room at a poster of Tiller, he said, ""I don't want his death to be in vain. He spent his whole life trying to ensure better health care for women."" Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning. He learned of the news by phone from Tiller's head nurse. ""That's when she told me that George had been shot in church and that he was dead."" Carhart is unlike many abortion doctors. He's doesn't parse his words about his profession. The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska. He said he takes pride in the term abortionist. ""I do abortions, and that is what I do,"" he said. On Friday, Carhart teared up when talking about the abortion rights supporters outside his clinic. ""It's unbelievable,"" he said of the support. Mark Gietzen, the driver of a truck for Operation Rescue, beamed with pride ahead of the protests. He stood outside his truck in Wichita adorned with a poster showing the dismembered hand of a fetus on a quarter. Across the top of the van, it reads, ""Abortion is an ObamaNation.com."" He said he knew Tiller ""quite well"" from the vantage point of a peaceful common enemy over the years and said the killing was a setback for ""pro-lifers."" He's only had one encounter with Carhart -- when the doctor drove his car by protesters and ""quacked like a duck."" Carhart acknowledges he might've done that. Gietzen's message to Carhart: ""Please respect the life of the babies. Stop the killing, stop committing such a horrible act for money."" Newman, the head of Operation Rescue, said he'll keep praying Carhart ""turns back to the healing arts and not taking babies' lives."" Carhart remains unmoved. ""When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down. We say choice is right. If you don't want to have an abortion, don't have one."" Here in America's heartland, a battle is being waged and both sides are entrenched. There is no middle ground.","NEW: Abortion rights supporters dominant outside clinic on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Last year's world champion Lewis Hamilton has claimed pole position for Sunday's inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix while his successor as Formula One's top driver, Jenson Button, qualified fifth. Hamilton will be looking to end a disappointing year for McLaren with victory in the season finale at the new Yas Marina circuit, but even with a win can do no better than hold onto his fifth overall placing in F1's first day-night event. The 24-year-old will start a race from the front of the grid for the 17th time in his career, and the fourth in the last seven races, after setting the fastest time in all three sessions. He clocked a best lap of one minute 40.948 seconds as the sun set on Saturday evening to head off the Red Bull duo of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. Vettel, whose bid to prevent Button clinching the world title ended last time out in Brazil, timed 1:41.615 while Webber recorded 1:41.726. ""The car is the best it has been all year. It was a smooth lap, and it just kept getting better and better,"" Hamilton told reporters. ""The place is just stunning. They all said it would be a great event, but it's mind-blowing. It's a great place to come to, a great country. The weather has been great and the people are so respectful and so welcoming. I hope we can put on a great show tomorrow."" Button's bid to ensure the first all-British front row since 1995 came to nothing as he was out-qualified by teammate Rubens Barrichello for the 10th time this season. The Brazilian is expected to be making his final race outing for world champions Brawn, who are expected to sign Nico Rosberg from Williams. The German, who announced during the week that he will be leaving the British team, qualified ninth as Toyota's Jarno Trulli and BMW Sauber duo Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld took sixth, seventh and eighth places. Kimi Raikkonen, who will be making his final race appearance for Ferrari, finished outside the top-10 for only the third time this season, and will start in 11th behind Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi. Heikki Kovalainen's chances of keeping his drive with McLaren took a blow as he finished 15th after suffering gearbox problems. The Finn, fastest in Friday's practice sessions, was just ahead of two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who along with Renault teammate Romain Grosjean failed to make it beyond the opening 20-minute session. Alonso, at least, can look forward to joining Ferrari as Raikkonen's replacement, but Frenchman Grosjean faces an uncertain future as he has failed to take his chance since taking over from the sacked Nelson Piquet Jr. Former world champions Ferrari will prop up the grid as veteran Giancarlo Fisichella again struggled ahead of what could be the final race of his career as he will be the team's reserve driver next year when the injured Felipe Massa returns.","Last year's world champion Lewis Hamilton claims pole position for inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- He lies in a bed on a balloon-type mattress, to reduce pressure on his burned body. He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can't do it for himself. He's hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15-year-old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again. Sixty-five percent of his body is covered with second- and third-degree burns. ""People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about,"" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. ""I've been to movies like everyone else, and Hollywood hasn't even thought of something like this,"" Namias said. Brewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak. His open wounds are covered by bandages, which are changed daily. It's a four-hour process. He has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire. The attack occurred after Brewer reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father's bicycle. Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game. According to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer ""a snitch"" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze. Namias explained how Brewer's organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery. ""He's still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation. We are breathing for him. His contribution to the breathing is trivial,"" Namias said. Namias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly. ""When you say he's doing OK, in this situation it means he's alive and responding to treatments,"" Namias said. ""We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive."" On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida. State prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case. Formal charges are expected later this month. For now, all five teens are being held in custody. Four of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults. The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies. Michael Brewer's parents, Valerie and Michael Brewer Sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week. They are not granting interviews. ""The recovery process will be baby steps, but eventually he will be whole again,"" they wrote. But their son's injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee. ""There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn,"" Namias said. ""Surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do. This is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [operating room], and say everything's going to be OK,"" he added. ""We never give up, and we never predict it. ... Our expectation is survival."" Across the hospital floor in the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, six other people's lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to Michael Brewer's. They, too, are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have. ""It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents,"" Namias said. ""But this was no accident. This didn't have to happen at all.""","Police say teens doused Michael Brewer, 15, with rubbing alcohol and set him ablaze .

"(CNN) -- It seems the world of the golf cart is changing if certain industry manufacturers are to be believed. By shedding their normal surroundings, improving their dowdy image and hitting the streets -- ""pimped up"" carts may increasingly be seen away from the course. Celebrities have been queuing up to jump on the buggy-wagon. The most recent purchase was by pop star Cheryl Cole, who bought husband and Chelsea footballer Ashley Cole a ""Mini-Hummer"" buggy as a gift, spending $8,000 customizing the cart with gold-plated hub caps, Swarovski crystals and a trunk for his golf clubs. Dominik Jackson, owner of Mini-Hummer says demand for the vehicles has rocketed since 2006: ""It started as a glorified golf buggy, but since adapting the look we've had demand from all over Europe and even from royal families in the Middle East."" The carts are already on the roads in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, and the company are planning to launch a new fully enclosed Mini-Hummer in London next year. While Europe is catching up with the trend, there has been a big market for ""pimped"" golf carts in the United States for some time. ""I'd say about 99% of our sales these days are for individual use,"" says Randy Hopper, owner of Sick 'N' Twisted Designs, one of the largest bespoke golf cart manufacturers in California. ""We build customized golf carts to the specific requirements of the customer - we pretty much do everything."" And this really means everything. Modern carts are now built with leather seats, wooden dashboard, surround-sound systems, iPod players, lower lighting and air bags, in a variety of themes - street, lifted, off-road and even Limo carts. Sick 'N' Twisted customer Dave Johnson is having his golf cart pimped and modified to match the color of his boat: ""It's going to be burgundy with 12-inch wheels, full sound system and air-bags that adjust the height of the cart."" Dave insists that in his neighborhood, golf carts are more of an everyday than a luxury item: ""They're practical, affordable and it's  nice to cruise around and see your neighbors."" So is this a case of keeping up with the Joneses? ""There's no official competition on our street, but people take notice of things like that. It's definitely seen as a status symbol."" While the golf cart remains a staple on the fairways, the souped-up street version is no longer just par for the course.","Adapted golf carts are growing in popularity across Europe .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Turn back time, more than 90 years, to a cold case that won't gather dust. It's a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press. At the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia. Considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian. In the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums. Who murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care? Answers to these questions, or theories, keep coming. ""Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,"" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, ""The People v. Leo Frank,"" will air Monday on PBS. ""The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable."" Mixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways. The accused . ""The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,"" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank. Frank was the one who handed Mary Phagan her check when she stopped by the factory on April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day. The night watchman, Newt Lee, would find the body and call police early the next day. Smithline, of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was 16 when she first heard about the case. Her mother sat her down, told her a story about what a man in the South had been through, said it was based on her uncle and handed over a book: ""A Little Girl is Dead."" It turns out Smithline's mother got the news in her teens, too, when her boyfriend turned to her after seeing ""They Won't Forget,"" a 1937 Hollywood film. ""You know that's about your uncle,"" he said. She'd grown up hearing Uncle Leo died of pneumonia, and after asking family about it, the truth was revealed, followed by the words, ""We will never talk about this again,"" Smithline said. ""I think it was a family embarrassment,"" she said. ""My grandmother [who died when Smithline was 1] was very close to her brother. It cannot be easy to tell someone your brother was lynched and why."" The first victim . Mary Phagan Kean was 13 when the story hit her. She was in a South Carolina classroom, and her name stopped short a teacher taking attendance. ""Mary Phagan, you say?"" she recalled the teacher asking, peering up from his list. He wanted to know if she was related to a girl with that name who died in 1913. Confidently, she told him she wasn't. But the boys on the playground taunted her anyway, telling her she was reincarnated from a dead girl. Traumatized, she asked her father about her name. ""He turned whiter than white,"" she remembered. Mary Phagan had been her grandfather's little sister. He only wept when asked about her. When Mary Phagan Kean's family moved back to Marietta, questions about that name never stopped. ""I went on a campaign,"" said Kean, 55, who sought out every article and piece of information she could find. ""I did that for years and years and years."" The consensus of historians is that the Frank case was a miscarriage of justice. Crime scene evidence was destroyed, they say. A bloody hand print was not analyzed. Transcripts from the trial vanished. Frank's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor, Jim Conley, who most came to see as Phagan's killer. He'd written notes found with the body, but said they were dictated to him. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, used race in his argument, saying a black man couldn't be smart enough to come up with such stories. Witnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt. Conley's own attorney, William Smith, came to believe in Frank's innocence, scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later. Conley, who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years, eventually disappeared. Dorsey, the prosecutor, had political aspirations riding on this win. ""A conviction of just another black guy wasn't going to do anything for his career,"" said Sandy Berman, the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit, ""Seeking Justice: The Leo Frank Case Revisited."" Two years after Frank's lynching, Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia. But the story was interpreted differently by Kean, who wrote ""The Murder of Little Mary Phagan,"" and stands by this conclusion: ""Leo Frank was guilty as sin. He was a sexual pervert."" Kean often visits her namesake's grave in Marietta. She's not the only one. She says she's struck by the teddy bears people leave there. The governor . Elizabeth Slaton Wallace couldn't be prouder of her heritage. At 81, she's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton, the man who commuted Frank's death sentence to a life sentence, believing Frank's innocence would be proved and, in doing so, ruined his political career. The Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton. Frank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where an inmate slashed his throat. He survived, but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison, with no resistance from officials, and abducted Frank in the dark of night. By dawn, he was hanging from a tree in Marietta. Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards. ""Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that. He was railroaded. Uncle Jack knew that,"" said Wallace, who lives in Atlanta. She can't explain why the story persists to this day. But throughout her life she's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community, especially toward her father, who was named for the late governor. ""The Jewish community could never do enough for my father,"" said Wallace, who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s. ""They could have given us the shop."" As grateful as they were to Slaton, Frank's lynching left Georgia's small Jewish community frightened. Many left the state; those who stayed kept a low profile. For decades, they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones. The lynching party . The lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South. But this case, the only lynching of a Jew on American soil, was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy, historians say. While Georgia Jews remained quiet, so did those who were involved in Frank's killing, said Steve Oney of Los Angeles, California, who wrote the authoritative book ""And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank."" It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly, and not just secretly, known. ""They were not liquored-up yahoos,"" said Oney, a journalist, editor and Atlanta native who spent 17 years researching his book. ""These were smart, deliberate people -- from good, prominent families."" They included a former governor, a former mayor, a U.S. senator's son, a judge, lawyers, a state legislator and business owners. One of the 25 or so men was Cicero Dobbs, the grandfather-in-law of Roy Barnes, a Georgia lawyer and politician who is a former governor himself and will be running again in 2010. Barnes and his wife, Marie, never knew Dobbs, who owned a taxi company in Marietta and likely provided transportation to the prison where Frank was held. Oney broke the news about the family connection to them. ""Marie's parents didn't know. It was never mentioned,"" Barnes said. ""On death beds, people confessed. It was just that powerful."" Barnes, who is featured in the new documentary, said it's important to keep the story alive and learn from it. ""It's a terrible blot on our history,"" he said. ""How we keep it from happening again is to never forget.""","Mary Phagan's murder in 1913 spawned an Atlanta trial that's still talked about today .

"(CNN) -- Investigators discovered four more bodies Tuesday at the Cleveland, Ohio, home of a convicted rapist -- making a total of 10 since last week, Police Chief Michael McGrath said Tuesday. Authorities on Tuesday charged Anthony Sowell with five counts of aggravated murder after unearthing the bodies of women at his home last week, police said. Sowell, 50, also was charged with rape, felonious assault and kidnapping, police said. His arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday morning. Police arrested Sowell on Saturday, two days after discovering the decomposing bodies of five females inside his home and another woman's body outside the house. Earlier Tuesday, a source close to the investigation had told CNN that a seventh body had been found in the home. The source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, did not reveal the gender of the seventh body found at Sowell's home. The source did not say exactly where the body was found at the residence. Authorities found the first two bodies last week while trying to serve an arrest and search warrant on Sowell related to a sexual assault investigation, and an intensive search began. Sowell was not home at the time; officers found him after a tipster told them of his whereabouts. The decomposing bodies of the first six women, all of whom were African-American, could have been lying where they were found for ""weeks, if not months or years,"" Cuyahoga County Coroner Frank Miller III told CNN on Saturday. All six deaths were ruled homicides, Lt. Thomas Stacho of the Cleveland Police Department said Monday, with five of the deaths due to strangulation. About a month ago, a woman accused Sowell of rape and felonious assault, Stacho noted last week. Investigators obtained the warrants that set off the search after the ""cooperation of the victim,"" he said. Officers serving the warrants Thursday discovered the badly decomposed remains of two bodies on the third floor of the house, he added. A subsequent search revealed what appeared to be a freshly dug grave under the stairs in the basement. On Friday, investigators returned to the house, dug up the grave and found a third body, Stacho said. A further search of the house and property found two more bodies in a crawl space and a sixth body in a shallow grave outside the home. Five different burial methods were used on the victims, and the bodies were in varying states of decomposition, said Miller, which made it difficult to determine the ages of the victims. Stacho said Sowell makes his living as a ""scrapper."" ""He walks around and picks up scrap metal and takes it to junk yards to make a few pennies,"" he said. Sowell was convicted of a 1989 rape and was imprisoned from 1990 to 2005, Stacho said. CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report.","NEW: Four more bodies unearthed on Tuesday, Cleveland police chief says .

"(CNN) -- They were there for the view -- spectators awed by a vista of massive waves smashing against the rocky shore. A U.S. Coast Guard rescue boat reaches a man swept out to sea Sunday at Acadia National Park in Maine. But then one wave struck violently, sweeping three people into the churning ocean, one of them a 7-year-old girl. What spectator Mary Ellen Martel saw next were bodies bobbing along in the frothy waters. And in a heartbeat, a day of spectacular surf turned tragic.  Watch a dramatic rescue at sea » . Thousands of people flocked to the jagged shoreline of Maine's Acadia National Park on Sunday as Hurricane Bill weakened offshore on its trajectory north and delivered dramatic waves to the New England seaboard. ""People were clapping and laughing when the wind would bring the spray over. It was a very festive atmosphere,"" Martel told CNN in a telephone interview. ""It was a warm, sunny day, and everyone was just enjoying the show that Mother Nature was offering, but not everybody knows to stay away from the edge -- or way away from the edge."" A section of the shore is known as Thunder Hole, a popular tourist attraction where waves crashing against the shore mimic the sound of thunder. But Sunday, conditions were such that even the walkway to Thunder Hole was closed for the safety of spectators. On a rock cliff about 20 feet above the sea, a wave struck about 11:50 a.m., pushing water onto the ankles of some of the people standing on ""top of what we think would be a safe area,"" Acadia Chief Ranger Stuart West told CNN. People started to turn back, to get farther away from the edge, and then a second, monstrous wave hit them. The unrelenting sea dragged in seven onlookers, forcing four to claw their way back to shore but sweeping three others out into the chilly waters. Two were rescued, but 7-year-old Clio Axlerod of New York perished, West said.  Watch preparations for the storm » . Martel, a resident of Maine's Southwest Harbor for more than 35 years and a frequent park visitor, had come there with her husband, and she said she feels ""pretty certain"" she had been on the same ledge as the three victims swept out to sea. Martel had stood far enough back that the first wave did not affect her much, but when she saw the second coming, she turned her back to protect the camera she used to photograph the surf. She was doused from her shoulders down, she said. She said she knew then she had to get back to the road that led to the area. ""When I looked [back], everybody was scrambling to get off the ledge,"" she said. Her husband, a volunteer firefighter, ran back to offer his help and overheard a woman say that her husband and daughter were swept away from the spot where the Martels and maybe 30 others had been, she said. U.S. Coast Guard rescuers arrived about 20 minutes after the first call and had the tough task of finding the three drifting in the rough seas. ""Of course, trying to locate a head in frothy, agitated water like it was is a very difficult operation,"" West said. ""But the rangers on the shore could still spot them."" Martel saw bobbing buoys out in the distance, but not until she used a zoom lens on her camera could she tell the buoys from the bodies, she said. At 12:52 p.m., the Coast Guard picked up Simone Pelletier, 12, of Belfast, Maine, and Peter Axlerod, 55, Clio's father. The 7-year-old was found at 3:32 p.m., West said in a statement. Petty Officer Dayton Trubee of the Coast Guard said he was not present during the rescue effort, but heard from his colleagues what happened when they grabbed Peter Axlerod out of the sea's grip. ""They told me when they pulled them on board he was exhausted,"" Trubee said. ""He really didn't have any idea what happened to his daughter. He was totally worn out from just struggling."" Six others at Acadia suffered broken bones and cuts from the effects of the intense waves, West said. Park officials had warned visitors of the dangers of the surf, West said, but he was not sure whether those seven pulled out by the massive wave got the warning. West said that people ask why rangers didn't just close off the park's shoreline. ""The reality is we have so many miles of boundary that if we close up one section people just go to the other section,"" he said. Instead they concentrate rangers in the areas they know people want to visit, he said. But nature can't be managed. The second wave has been reported by some as a rogue wave, because it was unexpected and ""monstrous,"" said Chief Christopher Wheeler of the Coast Guard's field office for Northern New England. Martel said she did not initially think the waves would be an injurious, ""imminent"" threat. ""It's kind of like a false sense of security, and then out of nowhere comes this monstrous wave that's like, holy moly,"" Wheeler said.","People flock to Maine seashore to watch waves stirred up by Hurricane Bill .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly all healthy pregnant women who receive a single dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine will be protected from that flu, according to just-released clinical trial data. In a news conference Monday at the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said out of about 100 pregnant women who participated in trial studies, over 90 percent showed a robust immune response to a single 15-microgram dose of the H1N1 vaccine. And at this point, there have been no reported side effects, Fauci said. Fauci stressed that these results should be reassuring for already-vaccinated pregnant women and this is ""vital information for those who have not yet been vaccinated."" He added that ""pregnant women have tolerated the vaccine well, and no safety concerns have arisen."" Pregnant women are considered to be among the highest at risk for serious complications of this new flu strain. Since H1N1, also known as swine flu, first emerged in April, 28 pregnant women reportedly have died from complications of this flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite health officials repeatedly saying the H1N1 vaccine is safe, questions about it persist. To reassure those who question the safety of the vaccine, Dr. Bruce Gellin, director of the National Vaccine Program Office, noted that a new independent panel has been formed to review data from all sources on the safety of the vaccine. The group will monitor all sources reporting problems with the vaccine. ""The vast amount of adverse events have been minor,"" said Gellin. He said there has been one reported death linked to the vaccine, but further investigation showed that the person died from the actual H1N1 flu, not the vaccine. Gellin said the panel was designed to keep an eye on any possible negative consequences and report them immediately. According to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, who also attended the news conference, 30 million doses of the vaccine are available for states to order. She explained that that does not mean 30 million shots are available to the public at this point. The vaccines need to be ordered by each state and distributed before they make it to doctor's offices and clinics. Schuchat reassured the public that more vaccines would be made available within the next few weeks, as demand for shots continues to rise. Fauci also noted further studies on children -- youngsters between the ages of 6 months to 35 months, and children from the age of 3 years to 9 years -- found they responded much better to two 15-microgram doses of the vaccine, than one single dose. For children 9 and older, a single 15-microgram dose gave young people a robust immune reaction that should protect them against the virus. When asked how this H1N1 virus differed from the seasonal flu, Schuchat said they were at opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to high-risk patients. ""With seasonal flu,"" said Schuchat, ""Ninety percent of the deaths every year are in people over the age of 65."" She noted, ""But with H1N1, 90 percent of the deaths, thus far, have been in people under the age of 65."" And she added, ""half of those are under the age of 25 years, in young people. So those are the people we want to get our message to. Children, pregnant women, young people should be getting vaccinated."" Fauci agreed saying, ""You need to look at the risk ... Right now, the risk of becoming seriously ill, even dying from this virus, outweighs the risk of something happening to you if you take the vaccine. It's really that simple.""

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's off-year election might not have the high stakes of the 2008 presidential election, but there are several significant races worth watching: . • Virginia governor: McDonnell is projected winner . CNN has projected that Republican Bob McDonnell will be elected Virginia governor. The 55-year-old former state attorney general will be the first Republican to win the state's highest office in 12 years. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, McDonnell was leading Democratic opponent Creigh Deeds 59 percent to 41 percent. The race was seen as an early referendum on voters' attitudes toward President Obama and his policies and an opportunity for Republicans to turn back recent Democratic gains. More on Virginia gubernatorial race . • New Jersey governor: GOP's Christie is winner, CNN projects . Republican challenger Chris Christie will defeat New Jersey Gov. John Corzine, CNN has projected. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Christie was leading Corzine, a Democrat, 49 percent to 45 percent. Chris Daggett, an independent candidate, had 6 percent. Corzine, who was seeking a second term, trailed Christie during the summer, but recent polls showed them in a dead heat. As Election Day approached, some thought growing support for the moderate Daggett might siphon votes from Christie. More on New Jersey gubernatorial race . • New York mayor: Bloomberg to win third term, CNN projects . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will win a third term despite a tough challenge from Democrat Bill Thompson, CNN has projected. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Bloomberg led Thompson 51 percent to 46 percent. Bloomberg's apparent victory comes after he changed the city's constitution to lift a two-term limit. Bloomberg, an independent candidate, had led Thompson, the city comptroller, by double digits in most pre-election surveys. Bloomberg has outspent his rival in TV ads, $33 million to $2.66 million. • Boston, Massachusetts, mayor: Menino wins, Globe says . Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has won a record fifth term, the Boston Globe reported. CNN is not making a projection in the race. With all precincts reporting, Menino led City Councilman Michael Flaherty 57 percent to 42 percent, according to the Globe. In Menino's previous races, he either won overwhelmingly or he ran unopposed. Boston.com: Menino wins fifth term . • Maine same-sex marriage vote: Early results are close . Early results on a measure that would reject a law allowing same-sex marriage were tight, according to the Bangor (Maine) Daily News. With 70 percent of precincts reporting, nearly 52 percent of voters chose to reject the law, with more than 48 percent voting to retain it, according to the Daily News. When Gov. John Baldacci signed the legislation on May 6, he did so knowing there was a possibility that voters could overturn it. In September, opposition groups delivered the necessary signatures to get a vote. Maine would be sixth state to allow same-sex marriage if voters uphold the legislation. iReport.com: Same-sex marriage proponents work to get out the vote . • Medical marijuana in Maine: 'Yes' has lead . Early results seemed to favor the passage of a referendum that would expand the use of medical marijuana in Maine. With 70 percent of precincts reporting, 59 percent of voters chose ""yes"" in the referendum, according to the Bangor (Maine) Daily News. Voters in Maine, one of 14 states to allow the use of medical marijuana, were asked to decide whether to expand the list of conditions that could be treated with medical marijuana and make it easier to expand the list further in the future. It also would create state-licensed dispensaries. Portland Press Herald: Turnout may surpass 50 percent, official says . • New York's 23rd Congressional District . Why it matters: A conservative backlash against a moderate Republican candidate propelled this race into national headlines as proof of an ongoing family feud between the far right and moderates for control of the party. What's the story?: Local Republican leaders picked Dede Scozzafava because of her appeal to centrist Republicans, independents and even some Democrats. But it sparked a conservative revolt, and Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman outpolled Scozzafava, forcing her to withdraw. Scozzafava has since endorsed Democrat Bill Owens.

"(The Frisky) -- Like the David Letterman Debacle wasn't bad enough, now we have the story of Steve Phillips, the ESPN analyst, who had an affair with a 22-year-old coworker. Unfortunately for the 46-year-old sports dude and married father of four, his latest dalliance (and apparently there've been others before her) turned bunny boiler when he broke it off with her. Brooke Hundley, the jilted junior, allegedly went ballistic; repeatedly emailing and calling Phillips' long-suffering wife, tricking their 16-year-old son into an online flirtation, and then finally showing up at the family home, scaring the crap out of everyone. Lucky for Hundley, the Phillips's declined to press charges, but her reputation, both professionally and personally, is shot. (His too. He's since been fired from ESPN and has entered a treatment facility.) Obviously, being some cad's side action is always a sucker's game, but if you're going to do it, do it right. The Frisky: If he's not on the market, shop elsewhere! Choose carefully . It's bad enough that you're ""dating"" a married guy, but when you start sleeping with someone who's in a position of authority over you, you're screwing yourself twice. Every good grade will be chalked up to your romance with the professor and every promotion, credited to time served on your back. Don't kid yourself that nobody in your class or office knows, because people aren't blind and you're not that slick. Don't go home with him . Maybe he's too cheap to pay for a hotel room, could be he secretly wants to get caught . . . then again, maybe he's just a sociopath, but I can't even tell you how many times I've heard about a marriage dude bringing his girlfriend back to the house he shares with his wife and kids -- usually when everyone's out of town, but not always. Letterman even took his mistress on vacation with his family! Whatever his motivation, resist. You're already hurting this woman by having sex with her husband; at least have the decency to stay out of the bed they share. The Frisky: Can couples get past infidelity? Accept that you're No. 2 . Married guys will tell you a lot of things in their quest to bed you. That they haven't slept with their [insert bitchy descriptor here] wives for [insert insanely long period of time here] and that they're only staying together for the [kids/finances/etc.]. You need to know going in that you will always come second. (Or third. Or fourth.) Sure, you might get expensive gifts, but you'll also be spending nearly every holiday by your lonesome, you'll never meet his friends, and plans will be canceled on a moment's notice if something more important (i.e., anything) comes up. The Frisky: How to handle being the other woman . You're not his first . . . When an acquaintance of mine started an affair with a married coworker, she was furious when I suggested this might not be the first time he'd strayed during his very long marriage. She screamed that I was a cynic and that their love was a special flower they alone shared. (On the conference room floor.) Okay, she didn't use the term ""special flower,"" but that was the gist. A week later I got an embarrassed call back reporting that, contrary to what he'd told her, he'd been straying since his wedding day. A cheat and a liar -- who would've guessed?!

"(CNN) -- A U.S. serviceman was among six victims of an early morning shooting at a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, strip club Wednesday, officials said. Unidentified gunmen entered the Amadeus club in the border city across from El Paso, Texas, just after midnight and fatally shot six men, Chihuahua state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. An additional person was injured, he said. Two of the victims were identified as employees of the strip club, a waiter and a security guard, the spokesman said. Another was identified as an American citizen and member of the U.S. Air Force, Sandoval said. A statement from Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, confirmed that the airman was based there, and identified him as Staff Sgt. David Booher, 26. The gunmen appeared to have targeted the victims, Sandoval said. ""Everything indicates that these people were looking for these men,"" he said. Investigators recovered more than 30 shells from the scene. Because of drug-related violence, particularly in border cities, Juarez is considered off-limits for the U.S. military. At Fort Bliss in El Paso, for instance, a memorandum prohibits its soldiers from traveling into the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juarez is located. More than 2,000 killings have been recorded in Juarez this year. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario, Mike Mount, Dave Alsup and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Air Force Staff Sgt.

"FREDERICK, Maryland (CNN) -- Andrew Stein, 10, and his brother, Nathan, 7, are having a typical end-of-summer vacation: hanging out at the pool, visiting their grandparents and waiting for the beginning of school. Nathan Stein, 7, said getting some shots was worth it to help other kids. But this week they're doing something most of their classmates will never do. The Stein brothers will be testing the new vaccine to prevent swine flu. Because the younger population, from 6 months to 24 years, is at high risk of developing complications from the H1N1 virus, the National Institutes of Health is conducting a clinical trial specifically to make sure the vaccine is safe for children. Vaccine developers hope to get the doses out by mid-October, before the flu season really shifts into high gear. Although both boys dislike needles, they are willing to make the sacrifice. ""One boy that I knew at our school died from a type of the flu,"" said Andrew, frowning. ""So I wanted to prevent that as much as I could."" The boys, who live in the suburbs between Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, got their first inoculations at the vaccine satellite office in Frederick, Maryland. The trial is being conducted by the University of Maryland School of Medicine, one of 11 institutions across the country holding pediatric trials. Researchers will test the boys' blood, have them keep journals and make sure they have no severe reactions after each vaccine. The pediatric studies are divided into two groups within the United States. Half the sites will be comparing reactions between the H1N1 shot and the seasonal influenza vaccines on kids; the others will be looking at the effectiveness of a two-dose vaccine. The Steins are enrolled in the dosage trial. The data are crucial for developing a safe vaccine, said Dr. Karen Kotloff, who heads both the pediatric and adult trials at Maryland. ""The purpose of the studies we are doing is to try to collect information that will help to inform policymakers about the best way to give the pandemic H1N1 flu vaccine,"" she said. ""Whether we need one or two doses and what strength we need."" Before they received their shots, both boys, along with their parents, Christy and Eric Stein, got an explanation of the procedure and were warned about possible complications. Nancy Wymer, who coordinates the study, says the boys will receive two inoculations over six weeks and will continue to check in periodically over the following six months. Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports on the H1N1 clinical trial » . Neither brother gave more than a grimace as he rolled up his sleeve and took a shot for science. Andrew Stein said it was no big deal. ""It was in and out, in a couple of seconds."" Why would parents have their children be part of such a trial? Most say to help other children. Christy Stein was involved in a pediatric trial for the swine flu vaccine in 1976 and understands what her sons are going through. But she also believes it's good for the country's public health. ""I trust the people who are running the study,"" she said. ""And I'm not concerned about it at all."" The studies are based on other influenza trials in the past. Many parents have already volunteered their children but openings still exist. Children 6 months to 35 months are needed, Kotloff said.  ""Like with any shot, children may have a sore arm. Your arm can be red...There might be some fever or achiness, but the symptoms go away in a couple of days. ""There can be allergic reactions, mostly rashes, but in some rare circumstances there can be severe allergic reactions,"" she added. ""Each volunteer is informed about these possibilities, so it's up to the parents to make that choice."" The 11 main sites across the U.S, in nine states, are currently recruiting children for the vaccine trials. The two-dose vaccine tests are being conducted at the University of Maryland Baltimore; Duke University in Durham, North Carolina; Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri; Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington; and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. And the trial comparing H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines is at Hope Clinic, Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia; St. Louis University in Missouri; the University of Iowa in Iowa City; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio; Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; and the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Each location has a Web site to sign up if more children are needed. Andrew and Nathan are doing fine. They will keep a diary on how they feel and what, if any, reactions they have. Each was rewarded with a $40 gift card for his trouble. And even after being stuck with a couple of needles, Nathan Stein says it was worth it. ""Not just for the gift card,"" he said, ""but for being able to help other kids.""","National Institutes of Health has specific H1N1 vaccine trials for children .

"(CNN) -- Former England forward and Harlequins director of rugby Dean Richards has been banned from coaching for three years for his part in masterminding a fake blood injury to one of his players. Tom Williams spitting fake blood from his mouth in a match between Harlequins and Leinster. The 46-year-old was hit with disciplinary action after a hearing by an independent European Rugby Cup (ERC) panel found he had ""organized the fabrication of a blood injury"" on wing Tom Williams during a European Cup quarterfinal match against Leinster. With his side trailing by one point Williams, under instructions from Richards, faked a cut in his mouth with a capsule of fake blood, thereby allowing goal-kicker Nick Evans to return to the field of play. The plan may have worked if Williams had not winked to the oncoming player as he left the pitch, an action that infuriated their opponents Leinster. The ERC confirmed in a statement on their official Web site that Richards had acknowledged his role as the orchestrator of the plan that has since been dubbed ""bloodgate,"" and the subsequent cover up of the injury. Watch journalists discuss club's 'shame' » . Richards was initially cleared of improper conduct by a hearing in July in which Williams was given a 12-month ban, but the verdict was challenged by ERC disciplinary officer Roger O'Connor. Further evidence came to light in an appeal made by Williams before an admission of guilt by Dean Richards, who recently resigned from his position with Harlequins, prompted the ban. The ERC appeal committee chairman Rod McKenzie said details of four other incidents of Harlequins faking injuries had been passed to the relevant authorities. Williams's ban was reduced to four months and the fine imposed on Harlequins has been increased from $340,000 to $425,000 -- the club still awaits to hear whether they will be expelled from this season's European Cup. The physiotherapist for the London-based club, Steph Brennan, has also been banned for two-years. Richards had not decided whether to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but reacted to his ban by telling reporters: ""I'm surprised. Three years is a long time but I'll reflect on it overnight. ""I took full responsibility for it. It was a farcical situation, it really was. It didn't pan out particularly well on the day. Everybody looked at it and thought, 'That's unreal', which is what I thought on the touchline as well. ""But I had to hold my hands up,"" Richards added.","Ex-England rugby player Dean Richards is hit with three-year coaching ban .

"(Mental Floss) -- Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country. Be warned, this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol. We've compiled a list to get you started. 1. If you're at Starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. It's the Short size, and they don't advertise it. It's like a little baby cup of coffee. It also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me). 2. It's a good thing we don't have Jamba Juice here in Iowa, because I would be all over candy-based smoothies. Because it's considered a health-food chain, Jamba Juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the Web site Mighty Foods assures us that the secret flavors exist. The ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include Strawberry Shortcake, White Gummy Bear, PB&J, Various flavors of Starbursts, Fruity Pebbles, Push-Up Pops, and Skittles. Other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: Chocolate Gummi Bear, Apple Pie, Sourpatch Kid, Tootsie Roll, and Now and Later. 3. This one might be my favorite. At Fatburger, you can order a Hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon. 4. Chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. Things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. Some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one. Mental Floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong . 5. If you're at Wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the Grand Slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. This option is only available at select Wendy's, and it's also known as the Meat Cube. 6. Several places, including McDonald's and In-N-Out, will serve you the Neapolitan milkshake. It's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup. 7. In-N-Out Burger's ""secret menu"" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their Web site. But in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food Web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something ""Animal Style"" at In-N-Out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of Thousand-Islandy) and grilled onions. You can even get your fries Animal Style. Mental Floss: Why is it called ""Thousand Island"" dressing? ""Protein Style"" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. A Grilled Cheese is two slices of American cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose). And you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3×3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4×4 gets you four of each, and so on. According to photos posted at SuperSizedMeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a Las Vegas store a few years ago. One item not listed on the Web site secret menu: the Flying Dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun. 8. Feeling a little health-conscious at Popeye's? If you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. But there's a little hope for you -- ordering ""naked chicken"" will get you breading-free poultry. The word is that this is on the menu at some Popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them. 9. Like Chipotle, Taco Bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. Since most of the food at Taco Bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. One ""secret,"" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent. 10. Some Subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. Once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that Canadian and Mexican Subways still offer them on a regular basis). But if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. Be warned, though -- Jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce.

"(CNN) -- Among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the USO in recent years are Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Scarlett Johansson, Kid Rock, Queensryche, Toby Keith, Lewis Black and Robin Williams. Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning. But when the USO conducts a public opinion survey asking people who they think of when the military service organization is mentioned, one name always comes up. ""The first thing out of their mouths is 'Bob Hope,' "" said Mark Phillips, the USO's vice president for communications, with an audible shrug. ""And if they're not part of the military, the list stops there."" As the country celebrates Independence Day and pays tribute to the men and women who serve in its armed forces, the USO is trying to change that mindset. The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips. As part of that initiative, it's paying a great deal of attention to the troops' desires, whether they be for high technology -- the USO recently brought video game/HDTV entertainment centers and satellite-based telephone systems to some areas -- or a diversity of entertainers, including rappers and NFL players. The Colbert trip was a meeting of the minds between the Comedy Central star and the military, said Rachel Tischler, the USO's vice president for entertainment operations. The ""Colbert Report"" host, who has attested to his interest in Iraq in such venues as Newsweek magazine (he was a guest editor last month), expressed interest in going, a request that made its way up the chain of command to Gen. David Petraeus, the former leader of coalition forces in Iraq. Petraeus liked the idea, said Tischler, and the principals were put in touch with the USO. Colbert's excursion, which the comedian called ""Operation Iraqi Stephen,"" was unusual for the USO, she added. ""We try to keep our footprint small,"" she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests. In ""Colbert's"" case, the footprint was considerably larger: Colbert's staff and several USO employees -- not to mention 150 volunteers. The trip required six months of planning. But the broadcasts went well, with Colbert paying tribute to the military and the USO's volunteers (as well as his own staff) on the ""Report."" He also put in a plug for USO donations: ""The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad,"" Colbert said on the show. ""They also deliver much-needed care packages to the troops."" (Whereupon, in a care-package primer, Colbert and Tom Hanks filled a box with shaving gel, Tang and a demolished ice sculpture.) The group remains greatly dependent on the kindness of strangers, said Phillips. ""We're primarily a volunteer organization,"" he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers. Though the USO does receive a small congressional appropriation -- $20 million in 2008 -- much of its funding comes from individuals, corporations and in the form of in-kind services. Jamie Masada, the owner of Los Angeles' Laugh Factory comedy club, said the organization is close to his heart. He followed a tour of Laugh Factory comedians with an invitation to service members to visit his club. ""What we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say, one day if you come to Los Angeles, if you want to be a comedian, our door is open to you. We want you to send us some material, some jokes,"" he said. At a recent USO fundraiser, five service members were given the opportunity to compete for the title of ""funniest service member."" The group was given advice from several notable comedians, including Tom Dreesen and Paul Rodriguez, and the winner received cash, gift certificates and a performance at the club, complete with name on the marquee. A number of performers return again and again. Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; ""He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places,"" said Phillips. Actor Gary Sinise and his Lt. Dan Band are also frequent participants. ""There aren't enough words to describe just how grateful I am to our nation's troops,"" said Keith in a press release before this year's tour. ""I've participated in several USO tours over the years and I've seen firsthand their sacrifice. And I will not stop doing all I can to show my support and lift their spirits."" Many entertainers shy away from publicity, particularly on the home front. ""We have celebrities come to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Walter Reed ... and they almost always insist we don't talk about [the visits],"" said Tischler. At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members. ""Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases,"" said Phillips. ""There's little in the way of creature comforts. Those are the things we try to deliver.""","USO often brings thoughts of Bob Hope, but organization well beyond that .

"(CNN) -- A global commodities trading company says it is considering a settlement to legal claims that it is responsible for the deaths of 15 people and thousands of illnesses after 500 tons of toxic waste were dumped in the African nation of Ivory Coast. Signs such as this were still up in ""toxic zones"" around Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a year after the waste dumping. The Dutch company Trafigura said studies by 20 experts it has hired conclude that the chemicals did not harm anyone. ""In view of that expert evidence, and the fact that claims are not being made in this litigation for deaths, miscarriages, still births, birth defects and other serious injuries, the parties are exploring the possibility of compromising the claims which have been made,"" Trafigura said in a release Wednesday. ""A global settlement is being considered by the parties and it currently appears that this settlement is likely to be acceptable to most, if not all, of the claimants."" A United Nations report also released Wednesday said Trafigura did cause death and injury when the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to the company at sites around Abidjan, the West African nation's largest city. The incident happened in August 2006. ""According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,"" said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council. ""We still don't know -- and we may never know -- the full effect of the dumping. But there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping of the waste."" Ibeanu, who visited Ivory Coast and the Netherlands during his investigation, urged all parties to take steps ""to address possible long-term human health and environmental effects of the incident."" According to a U.N. statement, Ibeanu said last month that the areas where the toxic waste was dumped still have not been decontaminated and continue to threaten residents' health. Many people, he said, are still reporting headaches, skin lesions, digestive difficulties and nose, throat and lung problems. Trafigura noted in its release Wednesday that it initiated a plan two years ago that would compensate, without any admission of liability, any claimants who could demonstrate any injury caused by exposure to the waste, which the company calls ""slops.""

"(CNN)  -- At least 14 people were dead and four missing in the Philippines a day after Typhoon Mirinae roared through the heart of the country, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said Sunday. Mirinae was the fourth typhoon to affect the archipelago of more than 7,000 islands in a month. It quickly dissipated after Saturday's landfall, becoming a tropical storm. Mirinae was forecast to weaken further before hitting Vietnam on Monday, forecasters said. The hardest hit areas were the Southern Luzon and Bicol regions, the Philippines News Agency reported. Civil Defense administrator Glenn Rabonza said more than 13,000 people were affected by the storm. The storm brought at least 85 millimeters (3.3 inches) of rain to Manila. The city of Daet, on the eastern coast, received 149 millimeters (5.8 inches) of rain, and Virac, which sits on an island that juts into the Pacific, received 72 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain. The first of the four typhoons to threaten the Philippines happened in late September, when Ketsana drenched the island nation with its heaviest rainfall in 40 years. Eighty percent of Manila flooded and more than 420 people died. Are you there? Share photos, video of the weather . Flooding from Ketsana has lasted well into October and tens of thousands of people are still in evacuation centers, according to the disaster coordinating council. Typhoon Parma made landfall on October 3 in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands. It destroyed 55,000 houses and killed more than 430 people. Last week, a third typhoon, Lupit, narrowly missed making landfall, but brought lots of rain to the Philippines.","Typhoon Mirinae leaves at least 14 dead, four missing .

"(CNN) -- A Republican Party that struggled in the wake of recent Democratic landslides sprang back to life Tuesday with wins in hotly contested races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, according to CNN projections. In Virginia, 55-year-old former state attorney general Bob McDonnell will be the first Republican to win the state's highest office in twelve years, CNN projects. Republicans will win races for Virginia's lieutenant governor and attorney general as well.   In New Jersey, former federal prosecutor Chris Christie will oust first-term Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine, CNN projects. Christie will be the first Republican to win the top office in heavily Democratic New Jersey in 12 years. Corzine will be the first New Jersey governor to lose a re-election bid since 1993, when then-Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to GOP challenger Christie Todd Whitman. The two gubernatorial contests have been deemed by some analysts as the first major referendum on President Obama's administration. Republicans leaders, demoralized after landslide defeats in 2006 and 2008, have been hoping to capitalize on wins in Virginia and New Jersey to help fuel a nationwide Republican resurgence. They were buoyed by a huge swing of independent voters to the Republican column. Democrats sought to minimize the defeats. Since 1989, it was noted, the party winning the White House has always gone on to lose the gubernatorial races in both states the following year. CNN also projects that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be re-elected to a third term. The billionaire mayor is believed to have spent well over $100 million of his own money in his quest for a third term -- shattering the record for personal spending in any American campaign. Democrat Bill Owens has won a vacant U.S. House seat in upstate New York, CNN projects. The contest to fill the seat sparked a vicious internal fight between GOP conservatives and moderates. The struggle has been viewed as a proxy for a national struggle between activists arguing the GOP slipped by betraying conservative values and officials warning a rightward move would further alienate an increasingly independent-minded electorate. The split could result in the election of a new Democratic congressman from a region that has backed Republican congressional candidates since 1872. Voters in nearby Maine -- not generally noted for their hard-edged, ideological politics -- tackled an emotional hot-button issue as voters decided whether to overturn a recently enacted law legalizing same-sex marriage. Results on the measure were not immediately expected, however. Washington state voters are choosing whether to uphold a law granting same-sex domestic partners the same rights as heterosexual married couples. Results on either measure were not immediately available, however. The fight for control of New York's City Hall is one of 380 mayoral races across the country, including contests in Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; Detroit, Michigan; Houston, Texas; and Seattle, Washington. It was the two races for governor, however, that appeared to attract the most interest at the White House. Obama personally campaigned for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in both states. A plurality of voters in both states cited the economy as their top concern, according to exit polls. Majorities in both states said Obama's job performance was not a factor in their vote. In Virginia, McDonnell beat Democratic nominee Creigh Deeds, a state senator from the rural western part of the state, by 21 points among critical independent voters. Last year, in contrast, Obama edged out GOP presidential nominee John McCain by one point among Virginia independents. African-Americans, as expected, voted overwhelmingly for the 51-year-old Deeds. Their total share of the vote, however, dropped from 20 percent from last year -- when Obama topped the ballot -- to 16 percent. McDonnell benefited from a Virginia electorate that, according to the exit poll, was slightly more conservative Tuesday than it was in 2008. Conservatives were also more unified in their support for McDonnell than they were for former GOP presidential nominee John McCain. McDonnell himself is a staunch conservative, but stressed bipartisan solutions to problems relating to job growth and transportation. Deeds sought to peel social moderates and political independents away from McDonnell in part by highlighting McDonnell's graduate school thesis, in which the Republican was critical of homosexuals and women in the workplace. The attacks appeared to backfire on Deeds. Almost two of every three voters said Deeds attacked McDonnell unfairly; those voters broke for McDonnell by a 21-point margin. McDonnell's expected victory is in keeping with Virginia's tradition of backing candidates from the party that most recently lost the White House. Republican George Allen was elected in 1993, one year after Bill Clinton won the presidency. Democrat Mark Warner won in 2001, a year after George W. Bush's first presidential victory. In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry an increasingly diverse Virginia in more than four decades. Fewer than one in five voters on Tuesday, however, said their vote was meant to express support for the president. Almost one in four said their vote was meant to express opposition to Obama. Further north in New Jersey, Corzine had pulled even in the final surveys before Election Day with the help of a virtual 2-to-1 spending advantage. Many analysts believed independent candidate Chris Daggett, a socially moderate former Republican, was also be digging into Christie's support. Obama, who carried New Jersey by almost 16 points in 2008, campaigned for Corzine three times, most recently this past Sunday. The president's help, however, was not enough to save Corzine, who was saddled with burden of seeking reelection in the midst of a steep economic downturn. Almost one-third of New Jersey voters cited the economy as their top concern in early exit polls, with another 25 percent citing the state's high property taxes. One in five voters said their top concern was the state's ongoing struggle with corruption. Independent voters broke even more heavily for Christie in New Jersey than for McDonnell in Virginia. Corzine was able to keep the race close, however, due to New Jersey's political landscape. New Jersey voters were both more Democratic and more liberal than Virginia voters. Last year, the president also managed to carry New York's sprawling 23rd congressional district, a traditional GOP stronghold running along the Canadian border from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario. The area has sent Republican representatives to Congress since Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant occupied the White House. But this year it was the scene of a GOP civil war. The district's U.S. House seat opened up a few months ago after nine-term Republican Rep. John McHugh stepped down to become secretary of the Army. Local Republican leaders picked state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava as their nominee to replace McHugh because they felt her moderate views would appeal to centrist Republicans, independents and even some Democrats. The decision, however, sparked a revolt among conservatives angry with what they saw as Scozzafava's liberal views on same-sex marriage, abortion and fiscal matters such as the president's $787 billion economic stimulus plan. They backed Doug Hoffman, an accountant, ran on the state's Conservative Party line. Scozzafava suspended her campaign Saturday after her poll numbers plummeted following a flood of support and contributions to Hoffman from leading conservative politicians and organizations. Republican leaders were fractured by the choice. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed Scozzafava. Gingrich's one-time deputy, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, backed Hoffman. After dropping out, Scozzafava endorsed Democratic nominee Bill Owens. She campaigned for him on Monday.

"(CNN) -- The Scottish Rugby Union has appointed Andy Robinson, formerly coach of bitter rivals England, as the new national team boss. Andy Robinson will be seeking to revive the fortunes of Scotland's struggling rugby side. The 45-year-old won eight caps as a flanker for England, and was assistant coach in Clive Woodward's 2003 World Cup-winning set-up before taking over for an ill-fated reign himself in 2004, winning just nine of 22 matches. Robinson returned to top-class coaching with Celtic League team Edinburgh in 2007, and has sufficiently impressed Scottish officials in the 20 months since then to win favor as the replacement for Frank Hadden. He had been part of Hadden's backroom staff, and had already been chosen to coach Scotland A this summer. Hadden resigned on April 2 after Scotland again struggled in the Six Nations, finishing second from bottom with just one win from five outings. Robinson was delighted to be given the chance to return to the international stage. ""With the World Cup in New Zealand in 2011, I believe we have a crop of players who can really challenge the world's best, and preparation for that starts now,"" he told the SRU Web site. ""I'm looking forward to leading Scotland A into the IRB Nations Cup in Romania next week and thereafter preparing for our Autumn Tests at Murrayfield against Fiji, Australia and Argentina."" Robinson is believed to have headed off the likes of South Africa's World Cup-winning coach Jake White and former Australia boss Eddie Jones for the job. Former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lion Gordon Bulloch was part of the interview panel that determined the appointment. ""Andy was the outstanding candidate from a quite exceptional shortlist which underlines the allure of coaching the Scotland team,"" he told the SRU's Web site. ""I know from having had the privilege of his coaching and guidance on Lions tours that he is passionate about his rugby, is a skilled communicator and has values and an ethos which are absolutely at one with developing a winning Scotland team."" Scottish Rugby chief executive Gordon McKie said he was confident Robinson would prove to be successful. ""Andy has proved himself at every level of the game and we are thrilled that he will now be leading the Scotland team as we look towards the challenges of the next three years, including the 2011 World Cup,"" McKie said. ""He has been part of the Scottish Rugby family for the past two years and has brought success both to Edinburgh Rugby, with their highest ever Magners League finish in successive seasons, and has also guided the Scotland A team to notable successes.""","Andy Robinson appointed new coach of Scotland's national rugby team .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan electoral officials Monday declared incumbent President Hamid Karzai the winner of another term in office, after canceling this weekend's second round of voting. U.S. President Barack Obama called Monday for a ""new chapter"" of improved governance in Afghanistan now that Karzai's re-election as president is complete. Observers say Karzai's real test will be whether he can form a government that is seen as legitimate in the eyes of the Afghan people and the international community. Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission announced Karzai's victory Monday after it canceled Saturday's presidential runoff because of the withdrawal of candidate Abdullah Abdullah. A runoff could have been held with just one candidate, but commission president Azizullah Lodin said electoral officials decided to cancel the second round of voting for several reasons, including security and money. The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai. Afghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud. Karzai had initially claimed victory, but two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. That left Karzai short of a majority, and he eventually agreed to the runoff. Abdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial. But that request was not met, Abdullah said Sunday, and he did not believe a transparent election was possible. ""I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,"" Abdullah told reporters. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Kabul on Monday hours before the commission's announcement. He issued a statement welcoming the decision, congratulating Karzai, and restating the U.N.'s commitment to supporting the new government. ""This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned,"" Ban said in the statement. ""Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community."" On Monday, Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah, as well as U.N. officials, including Kai Eide, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission's decision and congratulating Karzai. In Washington, President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation. ""Although the process was messy, I'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law,"" Obama said. He said he told Karzai ""that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance, a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption, joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security."" Obama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment, ""but as I indicated to him, the proof is not going to be in words, it's going to be in deeds."" Despite the resolved election issue, Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan. Instead, Gibbs repeated past language that the decision would be made within weeks. ""Now begin the hard conversations about ensuring credibility and ensuring improving governance, addressing corruption"" in Afghanistan, Gibbs said. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican defeated by Obama in last year's presidential race, said Monday that Karzai's re-election should encourage Obama to fulfill Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for up to 40,000 more troops. ""The most urgent priority now is to support our Afghan partners in reversing what General McChrystal has rightly called the 'deteriorating' security situation,"" McCain said in a statement. ""This requires a properly-resourced counterinsurgency strategy, and I urge President Obama to provide our civilian and military leaders with the resources they need to succeed."" The cancellation of the runoff ""puts the election issue behind us,"" but Karzai has yet to achieve a true victory, according to the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad. ""Now the key issue is how the Afghan people will react to this, what kind of government will President Karzai put together, and how the international community will react,"" Khalilzad said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""We're in a new stage now in Afghanistan."" Khalilzad had predicted last week that Abdullah would quit the race, in an interview for CNN's ""Amanpour."" ""First, he doesn't have much money left,"" he said in the interview, which aired Sunday. ""Second, I think that he thinks that given the situation, he's likely to lose, and maybe he'll get less votes than he did in the first round, so that would be embarrassing."" Speaking to CNN following his withdrawal, Abdullah said his decision does not mean he has given up public life. ""I will be available to serve this country,"" he said. ""At this stage, I am in consultation with my followers, with my supporters and a movement for change will be there and I will lead that movement. There is no doubt about it."" Karzai served as acting president following the U.S. ouster of Taliban rulers in 2001, then secured a victory in the 2004 elections. He begins his second term in office amid a resurgence of the Taliban. The militants claimed responsibility for a Wednesday attack that killed five United Nations workers -- two of whom were helping with the vote. Nine others were wounded in the attack, on a guest house in Kabul. In response, the United Nations ordered nonessential personnel out of the country. International troop levels increased this year to provide security for the Afghan election in August. Attacks against U.S. and NATO forces have also spiked: 59 American troops died in Afghanistan in October, the highest U.S. monthly toll since the war began eight years ago. CNN's Jonathan Wald in Kabul, Afghanistan contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama called for ""new chapter"" of improved governance in Afghanistan .

"(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize the airlines. But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future. This test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles. Driverless pods at airports . Someday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. Currently, 18 pods are being tested at London Heathrow's Terminal 5. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust. Improved design of coach seats . Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats. In-cabin mood lighting . Poor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights. Luggage check before you get to the airport . Schlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport. Paperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide. More power --sockets -- for the people . Sometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane. Because while Wi-Fi is nice (even when there's a fee for it), it's even nicer to know that you won't run out of juice in the middle of a flight. Sockets obviously work with portable DVD players and cell phone chargers, too. Replacements for outmoded radar-tracking systems . Radar is outdated. Locating a plane's position can take up to half a minute, a long time when planes are traveling at speeds over 500 mph. To play it safe and avoid accidents, planes fly extremely far apart from each other. They also fly routes that zigzag rather than go straight. The reason? Aircraft need to remain within signal range of radar beacons, which are irregularly spaced around the country. To shave flight times -- and improve safety -- the FAA is rolling out NextGen, a GPS-based air traffic control system that provides real-time plane locations to pilots and air traffic controllers. Using GPS technology (already in trial use by Alaska Airlines), planes will be able to fly straighter, more efficient routes while maintaining a safe distance from other aircraft. But we may have to wait until 2025 to see this technology adopted nationwide. Sigh. Easier upgrades . With most airlines, upgrading is an esoteric process that may involve loyalty program points, elite status, or just dumb luck. But when you check in at the airport for a Spirit Airlines flight, the kiosk presents a simpler formula. The screen may inform you that one of Spirit's Big Front Seats (the carrier's version of business class) is available for as little as $35 extra. The roomy seats are often dispensed on a first-come, first-served basis close to departure time. Depending on how you're feeling that day, you may very well decide that an upgrade to a more comfortable seat is money well spent. Copyright 2009. Newsweek Budget Travel, Inc.

"Thanks to the flu, a broken ankle, a staph infection, and bronchitis, plus several school cancellations, my three children were at home -- hurting, vomiting, coughing, or tracking muddy water into our house -- all but seven days last February. (Shall I pause to let the horror of that number sink in? All but seven.) I'm normally an efficient, organized person who thrives on plans and checklists, but by the end of that month, I'd accomplished almost nothing beyond reading aloud the entire fifth book of Harry Potter. I felt so anxious that I was on the verge of hyperventilation. Originally a form of self-defense, the ancient Chinese art of tai chi promotes serenity through gentle movement. ""You need to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself surrounded by an egg of light,"" a Buddhist friend said. But when I closed my eyes and took a breath, I was surrounded by used tissues and dirty laundry. Obviously, I was in need of some inner peace. Studies have shown that learning to still the mind, if only for a few minutes, can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, limit stress hormones, and enhance immune function. But traditional forms of meditation don't work for me. If I sit still and close my eyes, I fall asleep or think about my to-do list. So, I gave myself a new task: Find an activity that calms my mind without giving my weary body a chance to nod off. Does such a thing exist? Health.com: Making time for me . Tai chi . This ancient Chinese practice -- believed to offer all the health benefits of silent meditation while giving you something to do with your hands and feet -- seemed like an obvious place to start for an antsy, toe-tapping sort like me. The thing is, I have a poor sense of balance and tai chi often requires standing on one foot. To avoid the not-so-peaceful experience of looking like a dork in front of a group of total strangers, I opted for a DVD, with only the tiniest hope of success. I surprised myself. The quiet music and the calm voice of the middle-aged woman demonstrating the moves were so reassuring that I forgot I looked like an idiot. The effort it took to follow along in what resembles the slow-motion version of a beautiful dance was literally mesmerizing. If I didn't feel peaceful, exactly, at least I was filled with quiet concentration, the kind that banishes all thoughts of picky eaters, mortgage payments, and unreliable co-workers. I emerged from the first lesson feeling refreshed and rested. Health.com: A new prescription for happiness . Knitting . I have friends who are passionate about knitting. Don't they know that it's possible to buy an immediately wearable sweater for less than the cost of the yarn it takes to knit one? Nonetheless, stressed-out 21st-century workingwomen are returning in droves to the craft. It made no sense to me ... until I tried it, that is. Knitting, it turns out, is the perfect example of active stillness. In fact, 20 minutes of knitting can lower your heart rate and blood pressure -- the same physical response triggered by yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation. Some hospitals have even begun to offer knitting courses for stress release. The secret seems to lie in the soothing combination of rhythm and repetition. By the end of my first lesson, I'd become proficient enough that my hands could make the motions almost automatically. The sound of the needles had a metronomic quality, a calming pace that automatically slowed my thoughts. And the feel of the wool sliding through my fingers was almost like a caress. Health.com: Boost your mood with color . Walking in the woods . I'd read somewhere that exposure to nature can boost a person's general well-being and sense of calm -- and I certainly needed a dose of that. So I headed to some nearby woods where the redbuds and crab apples were in full bloom. Birds called piercingly, squirrels quarreled, and high branches clattered together in the wind. In other words, nothing about the forest was still or quiet or remotely peaceful, but somehow it made me feel peaceful. I stopped thinking about my family and work deadlines and all that laundry. In fact, I stopped thinking altogether. Back at my car, I checked the clock and was shocked to learn that more than an hour had passed. Now, I can't realistically give up an hour every day to nature. But studies have shown that even small doses of nature can be healing, so I've tried a few smaller-scale nature interactions, as well. I started a small aquarium, planted a windowsill bean garden, and hung a bird feeder where I can see it from my desk. Health.com: Make time to play . OK, so the fish aren't as interesting as I'd hoped for: Watching them swim aimlessly in their small tank, in constant motion but getting absolutely nowhere, hits a little too close to home for me. But the sight of tiny leaves unfurling on the bean vines and the scent of soil filling the room when I water them have been surprisingly gratifying. As for the bird feeder? It's the best minidose of nature I've found so far. All spring I watched goldfinches and cardinals courting right outside my window. Watching them hop from branch to branch as they get their fill and move out of the way for others to feed may not be meditation, per se, but it's something similar -- a reminder that the world can offer peace and stillness, even in the midst of mayhem.

"New York (CNN) -- Outside a Manhattan mosque where the imam preaches against terrorism, the brothers of the ""Revolution Muslim"" are spreading a different message. Protected by the Constitution of the country they detest, radical Muslim converts like Yousef al-Khattab and Younes Abdullah Mohammed preach that the killing of U.S. troops overseas is justified. In their thinking, so were the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States -- and so are attacks on almost any American. ""Americans will always be a target -- and a legitimate target -- until America changes its nature in the international arena,"" Mohammed said in an interview to air on tonight's ""AC 360."" Al-Khattab and Mohammed consider al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden their model. ""I love him like I can't begin to tell you, because he doesn't seem to have done anything wrong from the sharia,"" al-Khattab said, referring to Islamic law. ""If you're asking me if I love him as a Muslim, I love him more than I love myself."" They hand out fliers outside the gleaming 96th Street mosque, where up to 4,000 people visit every day. Inside the sleek, modernistic house of worship, Imam Shamsi Ali preaches against the violence that now sweeps many Muslim countries. ""What we try to do is reminding our people about the real Islam,"" Ali said. ""We tell them what the real Islam is all about. Islam is about peace. Islam is about moderation. Islam is about friendship. Islam is opposed to any kind of hatred against anybody."" Law enforcement sources have told CNN the men walk right up to the line of protection under the First Amendment, but their message is not going unnoticed. Al-Khattab handed CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin a business card from an FBI agent who he says is keeping tabs on him. The agent would not comment without clearance from his superiors, except to say, ""Obviously, if they gave you my card, you know we are watching them."" The mosque has called police on Al-Khattab and Mohammed several times, and passers-by occasionally engage them in heated debates. Ali told CNN that ordinary Muslims are ""disgusted with their behavior."" But they insist they don't fight themselves, and don't incite others to do so. Al-Khattab calls President Obama ""a murderer, a tyrant, a scumbag,"" and says he wouldn't ""shed a tear"" if Obama were killed. But he added, ""Would I incite his murder? That's not what I teach."" Mohammed calls himself an American ""by default"" who identifies with Muslims. Al-Khattab, a Jew who lived in Israel before converting to Islam, says he ""would like to see a mushroom cloud"" over the Jewish state -- ""but before that, I'd like to see the people guided, and I'd like them to go back to their original countries where they're from."" But federal agents are not only watching them, they're watching some of those who are listening. Neil Bryant Vinas, a young New Yorker who has pleaded guilty to plotting to attack trains on the Long Island Rail Road, met with al-Khattab. Al-Khattab said Vinas and ""some brothers"" traveled to Atlantic City, New Jersey, and had dinner with him. Al-Khattab said they considered him something of a hero because he left Israel and converted to Islam. Al-Khattab also claims friendships with Tarek Mehanna, now under indictment in Boston, Massachusetts, on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, and Daniel Maldonado, who pleaded guilty before a federal judge in Texas to receiving military training from Islamic militants in Somalia. Mohammed says he and his fellow radicals are ""commanded to terrorize the disbelievers ... making them fearful so that they will think twice before they go rape your mother or kill your brother or go onto your land and try to steal your resources."" ""We are defending innocent women that are bombed every day, innocent children that are bombed every day,"" he said. But asked whether those who take their fliers should take up arms against Americans, he said, ""We certainly have never said that.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Diane Sawyer will take over nightly news anchor duties for ABC when Charlie Gibson retires from ""World News"" at the end of this year, a network spokesman confirmed Wednesday. Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer worked together on ""Good Morning America."" Sawyer, 63, will be the second woman to be the solo host of an evening newscast for an American broadcast TV network. Sawyer will take the chair in January, ABC's Jeffrey Schneider said. Gibson, 66, and Sawyer worked together for years on ABC's morning show -- ""Good Morning America"" -- before Gibson was promoted over Sawyer to anchor ABC's ""World News"" in May 2006. Elizabeth Vargas and Bob Woodruff co-anchored the newscast before Gibson. That duo came to an end after Woodruff was seriously wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Maria Brennan, president of the Washington-based American Women in Radio and Television organization, called the announcement a ""watershed moment"" and said Sawyer was the ""obvious choice"" to take over ABC's anchor chair. Asked about the significance of two out of three network nightly news anchors being women -- the other being CBS' Katie Couric -- Brennan said, ""It comes with some excitement and some glee for groups like ours, who have worked for years to ensure that women have parity with their male counterparts."" ""When we get to a point in time when we don't even notice the gender, we can really celebrate,"" Brennan said. Sawyer worked for President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, first in his White House press office and later helping him write his memoirs after his resignation. After a stint with CBS News -- including five years as a ""60 Minutes"" correspondent -- Sawyer joined ABC News in 1989. She worked on news magazines for ABC -- including ""Primetime Live"" and ""20/20"" -- before being assigned to co-host ""Good Morning America"" with Gibson in 1999.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- No running water, no electricity, no fuel and little food. Pakistanis displaced by fighting demand government assistance during a protest Sunday in Karachi. International Red Cross officials are ""gravely concerned"" about the stark situation in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where a monthlong offensive against the Taliban has displaced more than 2 million civilians. Members of the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived in the Swat Valley this weekend for the first time since the onset of violence there. The organization evacuated more than a dozen people in need of urgent medical care and called for an immediate humanitarian response. ""The people of Swat need greater humanitarian protection and assistance immediately,"" Pascal Cuttat, head of the organization's delegation in Pakistan, said Sunday. ""The ICRC will do its utmost to meet those needs without delay. Given what we have already seen on the ground, we are mobilizing additional resources, but safe and unimpeded access to the area remains essential for our teams to deliver."" Those who have left their homes tell of the whole valley being turned into a battlefield as citizens flee on foot, many of them with no shoes. Some fall ill from sun and heat exposure, particularly infants and those already weak and sick. According to the most recent United Nations numbers, about 2.4 million Pakistanis registered as displaced persons since May 2. Currently, the clashes are concentrated near Mingora, the valley's largest city. ""People have been blocked for weeks,"" said Daniel O'Malley, who led the ICRC team. ""There is no running water, no electricity, and food is scarce. There is no fuel left for generators and most medical facilities in the district are no longer functioning. Phone lines are down, so people have been cut off from the outside world and are anxious for contact with relatives who fled the area."" The Red Cross team visited Khwazakhela hospital, one of the few medical facilities left in Swat Valley, to deliver supplies and found a small group of hospital staff members struggling to work without water, electricity or supplies, O'Malley said. ""They simply cannot cope with the influx of patients,"" he said. The team evacuated 14 patients. Meanwhile, one soldier was killed in a roadside bombing, and security forces killed two militants in the Swat Valley over the last 24 hours, the Pakistani military said on Sunday. The military said an unknown number of slain militants were found in a training facility destroyed by security forces in Shangla district, and a government girls' school at Baiderra was torched by militants. The Pakistani military said on Saturday its security forces have taken back the city of Mingora from the Taliban, calling it a significant victory in its offensive.","Residents of Pakistan's Swat Valley need help immediately, Red Cross official says .

"FORT HOOD, Texas (CNN)  -- The first people who came across Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the psychiatrist suspected of Thursday's murderous rampage, told tales Friday of quick, calm efforts in the face of danger. By the time it was over -- in less than five minutes, base commander Lt. Gen. Bob Cone said -- 13 people were dead and 38, including Hasan, were wounded. Mark Todd was one of two civilian police sergeants credited with helping take down Hasan. He and partner Kimberly Munley pulled up outside the building where the shooting was occurring at the same time, and Todd saw the shooter standing outside -- about 15 yards away. He appeared calm. ""As soon as we got there, it was game on, and then that's when it escalated, and we did what we had to do,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper."" ""I yelled at him, 'Stop! Drop the weapon!' And that's when he raised his weapon and fired a couple of shots at me."" Todd said he and Munley both took cover and as Hasan walked around one side of the building, he went around the other. ""That's when I saw him again. I told him to drop his weapon and he fired a couple more rounds. He fell, I went up and secured his weapon."" As soon as his weapon had been taken away, medics appeared, Todd said. ""It was like instantaneous,"" he said. ""We started life-saving measures to keep him alive as well."" Specialist Francisco de la Serna, a medic, was among those who treated the wounded, including Munley, shot in both thighs and a wrist, and the suspect. ""When the first gunshots started, you know, it was complete chaos,"" he told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""Just everyone outside the building started scattering. They just all ran behind anything that would stop a bullet -- cars, trash cans, trees, anything."" De la Serna said he came upon Munley, who was already being helped by others. ""I made a tourniquet, put it around her thigh and put it down until the bleeding stopped, but she'd already lost a lot of blood,"" he said. ""She was fading in and out of consciousness."" He then turned his attention to Hasan, asking him where he had been shot. ""I couldn't get him to answer,"" de la Serna said. ""He looked really calm, really pale."" Army reservist Sgt. Jeannette Juroff also stepped in to help the wounded, but first she and some co-workers took refuge in a bathroom. Juroff told CNN's ""Campbell Brown"" that she was taking her lunch break when she overheard fellow soldiers saying they heard shooting. At first, that didn't alarm her. ""This is Fort Hood, shooting goes on,"" she said. But when a major told her to call 911, she tried to do so, but couldn't get through, she said. Soon, it became apparent that the threat was real. ""I was walking down the hall and wondering what I would tell 911 and then a lot of my coworkers come in and they said, 'Just get in the bathroom.'"" They took refuge there for about a minute, ""but it felt like it took forever,"" she said. ""It was so quiet, but then we heard just loud screams and stomps, a lot of chaos going on."" Unwilling to stay cooped up in the tiny room as an unknown danger lurked outside, they opened the door and ran out, she said. Ahead of them she saw the building exit and the conference center where the shooting was taking place. Then, her cell phone rang -- it was one of her captains calling to talk about administrative matters. ""I just said, 'Shut up, I need to talk to you. Call 911.' He called 911,"" she said. By now, she had figured out what to say. ""I said, 'We're coming under attack. There's somebody shooting at the SRP,"" she said, using soldier shorthand for ""soldier readiness program."" ""As I'm talking to him, I'm seeing a soldier who's wounded and there's two soldiers holding his leg up, a medic and others helping,"" she said. Share thoughts on Fort Hood shooting, memories of victims . The soldier they were working on appeared in shock, his lips a pasty white, so Barbour said she tried to calm him down. ""I just went in there and said, 'Hey kid, whatcha doing?'"" she recalled. The two talked about pool, about their weekend plans ""and, little by little, he started to look good."" Authorities said Friday that the 18-year-old wounded soldier was going to recover. All around them, medics were working at high speed, she said. ""They were just completely doing everything they were told to do, every soldier was helping everybody out, every civilian that worked there."" In one area, a ""nearly naked"" soldier -- his pants torn -- was using his hands to put pressure over a wound to keep the blood from pouring out, she said. ""He was staying calm and everybody else was doing the same,"" she said. ""It was really awesome.""","First responders credited with stopping Maj. Nidal Hasan, saving his life .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Famed for keeping people slim, healthy and living longer, the Mediterranean diet has followers all over the world. Cultural treat? Moves are underway to get the Mediterranean diet on UNESCO's world heritage list. However, the diet is being increasingly shunned by people who live in the Med as the convenience of fast food gains popularity. The renowned low-fat, high-fiber diet has ""decayed into a moribund state"" in its traditional regions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). So sharp is the decline that governments from the region are scrambling to protect their traditional fare from becoming an ""endangered"" species. Populations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, tend to eat these foods, and governments there have joined forces to apply for their diet to be placed on the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Heritage list. Those lobbying for UNESCO protection have argued that its inclusion would ''fend off the watered-down clones assailing its integrity worldwide in this age of killer fast food.'' The UNESCO list is famous for including historic and cultural sites but in recent years the UN body has opened its register to include ''intangible heritage,"" such as endangered languages or vanishing traditions. ""The Mediterranean diet is a heritage that should be protected and shared,"" Paolo de Castro, a former Italian Agriculture minister, said earlier this year. ""Science has long recognized the unusual health properties of the diet, which has strengthened and accompanied the common cultural identity of Mediterranean countries,"" he said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. ""The diet is an integral part of the historical and cultural identity of the Mediterranean, and an opportunity for growth for the countries in the area."" Originally considered the diet of the poor, who didn't have much money to buy meat, the ""Mediterranean diet"" is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, whole grains, fish and olive oil. Numerous studies have associated it with long life-spans and low rates of cancer, heart disease and other ailments.  See a comparison of the old and new diets in Mediterranean countries » . However, some fear that it has become supplanted by supermarket ready-made foods and fast food as people have become more cash-rich and time-poor. ""The European diet has become too fat, too salty and too sweet,"" senior FAO economist Josef Schmidhuber concluded in the group's report on the European Union diet. The FAO's 2008 report ranks Spain as the country with the biggest leap in fat consumption in Europe -- from 25 percent of the diet 40 years ago to 40 percent now. EU and Mediterranean countries with the worst dietary changes are Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Malta, where calorie intake has increased by 30 percent in the last few decades. Three-quarters of the population of Greece is overweight or obese, while in Spain and Italy the number is more than 50 percent. In the U.S., 66 percent of the population fits into this category. Alarmed by the growing health problems associated with obesity, Spain's Health Ministry has launched a series of initiatives to combat obesity. In 2007, it ordered fast-food chain Burger King to remove ads for its Big King XXL, which contains 1,000 calories, and which were aimed at teenagers and young people. A 2001 report by Foodservice Intelligence, a London-based market research firm, found that traditional-style restaurants in Italy and Spain were outnumbered two-to-one by their fast-food counterparts. UNESCO will decide whether to include the Mediterranean diet in its Heritage list late next year. Until then, Spain and other countries in the region undoubtedly will hope they can retain their reputation as a rewarding destination for the gourmet traveler.","Mediterranean diet has declined into a ""moribund state"" according to the U.N.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is asking parents to immediately stop using a series of inflatable floats for babies in swimming pools, announcing a voluntary recall of about 4 million floats Thursday. The Squirtin' Tootin' Tugboat is among the floats covered by the recall. The items -- which inflate to seat babies and toddlers as they float on water -- are manufactured by Massachusetts-based Aqua Leisure Industries. The company has voluntarily recalled 14 models because the leg straps in the seat of the float can tear, causing children to slip into the water, posing a drowning risk, the commission said in a statement. There have been 31 reports of float seats tearing, though no injuries have been reported, the commission said. The floats were sold from December 2002 through June 2009 at retailers nationwide, including Target, Toys ""R"" Us, Wal-Mart, Dollar General, Kmart, Walgreens, Ace Hardware and Bed, Bath & Beyond. The commission is asking consumers to stop using the floats and to send them back to the company. Aqua Leisure officials could not be immediately reached for comment, but the company's Web site has posted the commission's recall advisory.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. military said disturbing video that shows masked boys brandishing guns was an al Qaeda in Iraq training and recruiting tool. The U.S. says this image of young boys is from an al Qaeda in Iraq training and recruitment video. ""Al Qaeda in Iraq wants to poison the next generation of Iraqis,"" said Rear Adm. Gregory Smith during a Baghdad news conference about the release of the tape. The video, he said, showed boys, ""many below age 11"" being used ""to produce the next generation of al Qaeda."" Masked boys are seen in the tape armed with grenade launchers, AK-47s and pistols. They're standing in front of a black banner hung on a wall, shouting slogans.  Another video shows a boy, surrounded by automatic weapons and wearing a suicide vest, according to The Associated Press. Also in the video, armed boys in black hoods, with weapons pointed, shout and force a man off his bicycle, search a car, and clear a building while a male voice off camera instructs them. Smith said the military doesn't know how many children al Qaeda in Iraq uses in its operations. He said it's believed the boys in the video were willing participants.  Watch the disturbing video » . ""Al Qaeda often refers to the children as the new generation of the mujahedeen,"" Smith said, using the Arabic term for holy warriors. ""We've also seen evidence of al Qaeda entering schools, disseminating propaganda and no doubt terrorizing the children and their teachers."" The video indicates that al Qaeda in Iraq was increasingly targeting children and posting propaganda on some of the 5,000 al Qaeda-affiliated Web sites. The U.S. military said the video excerpts were culled from five propaganda videos obtained during a raid targeting a senior member of al Qaeda in Iraq in December in Diyala province. In Baghdad on Wednesday, roadside bombings in south-central Iraq killed seven people and wounded nine others, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. A roadside bomb targeting police killed four people and wounded nine others in the south-central Iraqi provincial capital of Diwaniya on Wednesday morning, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. The city is the provincial seat of the largely Shiite Qadisiya province. Police were transporting prisoners at the time of the attack. The four killed, two women, a child and a man, were civilian passers-by. Four civilians, three detainees, and two police officers were wounded. A roadside bomb exploded midmorning in central Baghdad's Andalus Square, killing three civilians, according to the ministry. In eastern Baghdad, a third roadside bomb targeted a U.S. military patrol, the Interior Ministry said. There was no immediate word on casualties. The U.S. military on Wednesday also reported the deaths of two Sons of Iraq members who were trying to thwart a suicide attack on Tuesday in a town northwest of Baghdad.

The Sons of Iraq, Concerned Local Citizens and Awakening Councils are the names of anti-al Qaeda in Iraq citizen groups that have emerged across the country in recent months. The U.S. military on Wednesday also reported a series of raids across Iraq over the last few days that led to the detentions of 20 suspected militants.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama and top aides have quietly stepped up talks with moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine on a scaled-back health care bill, according to two sources familiar with the negotiations. Sen. Olympia Snowe is part of the bipartisan so-called ""Gang of Six"" negotiating on health care. The compromise plan would lack a government-run public health insurance option favored by Obama, but would leave the door open to adding that provision down the road under an idea proposed by Snowe, the sources said. One of the sources said White House officials are ""deep in conversations"" with Snowe on a much smaller health care bill than Obama originally envisioned. The modified proposal would include insurance reforms, such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, according to the source. The potential deal would give insurance companies a defined period to make such changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a so-called ""trigger"" would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies, the source said. Snowe is pivotal to the debate because she may be Obama's last possibility for getting a Republican senator to support his push for a health care overhaul. She is one of the so-called ""Gang of Six"" members of the Senate Finance Committee, three Democrats and three Republicans, involved in separate negotiations on the only bipartisan health care proposal in Congress so far. However, the slow pace of those talks and recent partisan attacks by the other two Republicans in the negotiations have dimmed hopes for a breakthrough, leaving Snowe as the only Republican senator that White House aides believe they can work with on the issue. Snowe first proposed the so-called ""trigger"" idea for a public option months ago, and has talked to Obama about it on several occasions, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The source told CNN that the White House staffers increased their phone calls to Snowe aides and their interest in her trigger idea this week. Obama and Democratic leaders seek a solution that could win support from a Republican or two, and more importantly, help bridge a divide among Democrats on the public option issue. Allies of the president hope that if Snowe accepts a health care agreement, she might also bring along her Republican colleague from Maine, moderate Sen. Susan Collins. Getting some Republicans to sign onto a proposal would improve Obama's chances of gaining the support of key moderate Democratic senators such as Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. All three are skeptical of a government-run public option supported by their more liberal fellow Democrats. Despite the flurry of direct talks this week between Snowe and White House staff, Snowe aides insist she remains engaged in the ""Gang of Six"" bipartisan talks that have been going on for months. Those talks have focused on creating nonprofit health insurance cooperatives instead of a public option to force competition and lower medical rates. The source familiar with Snowe's discussions with the White House said Snowe's trigger idea isn't being considered in the bipartisan negotiations because of early resistance from fellow Republican negotiators, especially Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Enzi and the other Republican negotiator, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, insist they are still committed to the bipartisan negotiations. However, their recent sharp criticism of Democratic health care proposals favored by Obama has caused tense relations with the White House.","Maine Sen.

"Bakersfield, California (CNN) -- When Vincent Barrett died alone in July at age 72, the coroner's office could not find any next of kin. Similarly, Ronald Axtell was listed as indigent -- no survivors and no funds for a funeral -- when he died at age 69. And yet a small army of men and women gathered to pay their respects to the two men, both Air Force veterans, as they were buried at Bakersfield National Cemetery in September. Marsha Dickey, who works in the Kern County coroner's office, was instrumental in making sure the men got the honors they deserved. ""She worked very hard to see that they were veterans ... and without that ... we probably would not be here today to honor them,"" said Lynn Sprayberry, founder and chairwoman of Friends of Fallen Heroes, a local organization that makes sure veterans receive a respectful service at Bakersfield National Cemetery. The coroner's office also discovered that Barrett, a former staff sergeant, had been awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received in Korea. Axtell was a former airman second class. ""Without [Dickey's] persistence, these two individuals would be placed in a county-owned site,"" said Wesley Jones, director of the Bakersfield National Cemetery. ""Nobody would have known. ... Nobody would have any concept of who these individuals were."" Leon Thomas, who served in the U.S. Army in Korea in 1951 and was awarded the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star medal for bravery, helped spread the word about the double funeral. ""The folks at the coroner's office are patriotic Americans,"" Thomas said. ""We got on the phone and on the Internet and invited our friends."" News of the funeral even made the local paper. ""I really didn't know there would be this many people to come out,"" Sprayberry said. And come they did, civilians and veterans. An awning built to shade mourners from the hot San Joaquin Valley sun was not big enough to cover everyone. A few brought umbrellas for shade. Many held American flags, some small and some very large and carried on poles. Some brought flowers; one vet held a few yellow roses; another left a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers with a simple message printed on a white ribbon: ""Thank you."" When the honor guard approached with Barrett's flag-draped casket, civilians put their hands over their hearts. The veterans -- some wearing motorcycle leather and bandanas, some sport shirts and slacks, others donning the suit jackets and pea caps favored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars -- stood at attention and snapped crisp salutes. They saluted again when the honor guard fired three volleys of seven shots and when the lone bugler played taps. As the guard tightly folded the flag that draped Barrett's casket, a woman in her 20s took cell phone video with one hand and wiped tears with the other. Barrett's ceremony was brief, not much longer than 10 minutes. Axtell's ceremony started shortly after, his ashes carried by the honor guard in a small wooden box. It lasted about as long as the first, with the same volley of shots, taps and salutes. The sergeant of the guard gave Barrett's folded flag to Sprayberry. Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood, who also serves as the county coroner, received Axtell's flag. In the minutes between services, cemetery director Jones asked the crowd whether there were ""any family representatives here for Mr. Axtell?"" No one came forward. ""There were 125, give or take, people here who had no idea who ... Barrett or Axtell were,"" Jones said. ""They didn't know if they were African-American, Hispanic, Caucasian. They didn't even know they were in the Air Force. But they were here."" ""They're patriotic Americans, and they showed up,"" Thomas added.

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN)  -- There is no evidence of ""friendly fire"" during this week's deadly shooting at Fort Hood, an Army spokesman said Saturday. Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman Chris Grey said authorities did not believe that any of those killed or wounded were shot by anyone other than the suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan. Furthermore, Grey reiterated that all evidence indicates that the suspect ""acted alone."" Grey said there was ""no evidence to contradict that finding."" He added that the investigation is continuing. Thursday's mass shooting left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and 42 people wounded, according to the post's public information office. It was unclear how many of those injured suffered bullet wounds. By Saturday night, 17 people and the suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, remained hospitalized, Col. John Rossi told reporters. All had suffered gunshot wounds, he said. Rossi said Hasan is no longer on a ventilator, but is still in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center. Earlier Saturday, W. Roy Smythe, chief of surgery at Scott & White Memorial Hospital, said ""a lot of progress has been made"" in treating patients wounded in the rampage and that ""some of them are out of the woods."" But Smythe, flanked by Texas Gov. Rick Perry and two state representatives, told reporters there is a possibility some patients will be ""physically impaired"" for life. And, he said, there's ""no doubt many"" will be ""psychologically impaired the rest of their lives."" The incident has sparked national outrage. In his Saturday address, President Obama said it was ""an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking had it occurred anyplace in America."" But the president said, ""it's all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims."" The White House said President Obama and the first lady will be attending a memorial service on Tuesday and the president ordered flags flying over the White House and other federal buildings to be lowered to half-staff until Veterans Day on Wednesday. In Texas on Saturday, Smythe told reporters that of the 10 patients admitted to that hospital after the Thursday massacre, four have gone home and one may go home later Saturday. He said of the six originally in the surgical intensive care unit, only two remained there Saturday morning, with the others moved to a regular in-patient floor. The people in the intensive care unit ""are no longer on the ventilator and quite stable."" Despite improvements, he said the injuries to some ""are so severe that only time will tell how they'll do in the long run."" He said ""some of these patients are young and sometimes young patients will surprise you in regards to their rehabilitation."" And at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, Jeri Chappelle, a representative of that facility, said eight patients are currently being treated there -- five in the hospital's intensive care unit and three others in a regular unit who are in fair condition. Perry -- speaking outside the Scott & White hospital -- lauded the hospital's quality and professionalism and praised the patriotism of the soldiers. ""What I heard time after time in those hospital rooms that it's their honor to be able to serve our country, and that is a very humbling thing to watch a young man or woman whose life has been irreparably harmed in a violent act, yet their concern and their interest is in continuing to be able to serve this country,"" Perry said. Also, he praised the first responders, and mentioned Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, the civilian officer who confronted and disabled Hasan in a shootout. Munley has drawn praise from the military and from citizens across the nations for her quick and bold actions. Perry called her a ""true professional"" and a ""selfless public servant."" ""She's very understated,"" said Perry, who spoke with Munley on Friday. ""A person who understands the gravity of what occurred, but also a classic public servant who is not interested in anything but getting on with her life and hopefully never having an event like this ever occur again."" Citing other reports, Perry said, ""this is not the first time that she's been called to action"" and said ""we all should be thankful that we have people like that in America."" Perry said he is in contact military and state law enforcement officials and that the Texas Rangers are helping federal officials in their probe. The governor also said the Department of State Health Services to send crisis counseling teams to the area. Share memories of victims . As for the investigation, Obama said he met with FBI Director Robert Mueller and representatives of other relevant agencies to discuss their probe. ""I'll continue to be in close contact with them as new information comes in,"" he said in his Saturday radio address. Obama, a Democrat, and Perry, a Republican, both said that the situation brought out the best in people, citing the efforts of soldiers and civilians to aid others. ""Even as we saw the worst of human nature on full display,"" the president said, ""we also saw the best of America.""","NEW: Official: Evidence so far indicates alleged shooter acted alone .

"(CNN) -- South Africa lock Bakkies Botha will miss the final Test against the British and Irish Lions in Johannesburg on Saturday after failing in his appeal against a two-week ban. Bakkies Botha will be eligible to return for the start of the Springboks' Tri-Nations campaign. The 29-year-old was cited for a dangerous charge which left Lions prop Adam Jones with a dislocated shoulder. Jones was forced off shortly after halftime during last Saturday's second Test in Pretoria, in which the Springboks fought back to snatch a 28-25 victory and clinch a 2-0 series triumph. The incident ended Jones' tour, while Lions center Brian O'Driscoll also went home early after suffering concussion in the same match.  Beginner's guide to the Lions. The South African management decided to appeal as they felt Botha had legally been trying to clear out a ruck. Assistant coach Dick Muir said: ""We certainly don't see any wrongdoing in that challenge and if it wasn't for the injury which came from it, I don't think anything would have been said about it."" The Blue Bulls forward will return in time for the Springboks' Tri-Nations opener against the All Blacks in Bloemfontein on July 25. For Saturday's third Test against the Lions, Botha will be replaced by Johann Muller, who captained his Sharks province to defeat against the tourists in one of the warm-up matches. He gets his chance with Andries Bekker injured and versatile loose-forward Danie Rossouw struggling with concussion. The Springboks will also be without flanker Schalk Burger, who was banned for eight weeks for eye-gouging Lions wing Luke Fitzgerald. There was no appeal on that ruling, but the International Rugby Union has pledged to review its punishments for such offenses in the wake of criticism that the player got off lightly. Peter de Villiers has made 10 changes, leaving captain John Smit, vice-captain Victor Matfield, Fourie du Preez, Tendai Mtawarira and Juan Smith as the only survivors in the starting XV. Last weekend's match-winner Morne Steyn starts in place of fly-half in place of Ruan Pienaar, who has paid for his poor goalkicking form. Zane Kirchner will make his debut at full-back, while Odwa Ndungane, Jaque Fourie, Wynand Olivier and Jongi Nokwe also come in to the backline. Chiliboy Ralepelle, Heinrich Brussow and Ryan Kankowski join Muller as new faces in the forward pack. Lions boss Ian McGeechan has made seven changes and one positional alteration, meaning mean just four players will have started all three Tests: fly-half Stephen Jones, scrum-half Mike Phillips, skipper Paul O'Connell and No. 8 Jamie Heaslip. With Wales center Jamie Roberts joining O'Driscoll on the sidelines due to a wrist injury, England's Riki Flutey forms a new midfield combination with Tommy Bowe, who switches from the wing. Ugo Monye, dropped after the first Test defeat, returns on the right wing, with world player of the year Shane Williams starts in place of Fitzgerald on the left. Teams for the third Test: . South Africa:  Z Kirchner; O Ndungane, J Fourie, W Olivier, J Nokwe; M Steyn, F du Preez; T Mtawarira, C Ralepelle, J Smit, J Muller, V Matfield, H Brussow, J Smith, R Kankowski.  Replacements: B du Plessis, G Steenkamp, D Carstens, S Sykes, P Spies, R Pienaar, F Steyn. British and Irish Lions: R Kearney; U Monye, T Bowe, R Flutey, S Williams; S Jones, M Phillips; J Heaslip, M Williams, J Worsley; P O'Connell, S Shaw; P Vickery, M Rees, A Sheridan.

"(CNN) -- Portugal have confirmed that captain Cristiano Ronaldo will not be fit for the World Cup playoffs against Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus ending a growing club-versus-country row. The Portuguese Football Federation had insisted that the world's most expensive player travel home to be assessed, despite his Spanish club Real Madrid insisting that he could not play due to his ongoing ankle problems. Coach Carlos Queiroz had selected the forward in his squad for Saturday's match in Lisbon and the return leg in Zenica four days later despite the objections of the Spanish club. Real at first refused to release the 24-year-old, having sent him to see Dutch specialist Niek van Dijk, but relented on Tuesday to allow the Portuguese medics to make their own verdict. ""After clinical evaluation and imaging, it was concluded that the player is not physically able to integrate the preparation stage of the national team for these games,"" read a statement on the Portuguese FF's Web site on Tuesday night. ""The Portuguese Football Federation wish the player a good and quick recovery."" Ronaldo has been sidelined since October 10, when he aggravated an ankle problem playing for Portugal in a qualifier that he had suffered on club duty the previous month. Real do not expect him to be fit for at least another two weeks, but Portugal had hoped he could help them qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa. Queiroz defended his decision to make Ronaldo travel home to be assessed. ""Based on the rules and principles governing clubs and associations, we have put Cristiano in the squad,"" he said. ""I was coach of Real. The club deserves respect. I know the medical team, president and CE,. I have every respect for that club. This fact cannot compel me to put any club below or above the others. All clubs and players deserve equal treatment.""","Real Madrid's injured star forward Cristiano Ronaldo will not be fit for World Cup playoffs .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Thirteen flag-draped coffins left Fort Hood on Friday as authorities searched for a motive in the massacre that left more than 50 casualties at the largest U.S. military base. Thursday's mass shooting killed 12 soldiers and one civilian and wounded 38 people at the Fort Hood Army Post in Texas. The suspect in the shooting, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a licensed Army psychiatrist, was among the two dozen who remained hospitalized Friday night. Hasan was transported to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, and was in critical condition but stable, a spokesman said. Investigators were waiting to speak to the comatose Hasan, who is under heavy guard, said Col. John Rossi, the post's deputy commander. The bodies of the 13 personnel who died were transported through a ""ramp ceremony"" to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for a dignified transfer, he said. It was a ""truly moving ceremony."" FBI agents helping investigate the shootings searched Hasan's apartment on Friday while investigators sifted through the crime scene, Fort Hood's military processing center, where soldiers report before they go to war. Are you there? Share your stories, photos and videos . Hasan, who worked at a hospital on the base, is accused of using two handguns in the shooting. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that one of the weapons used is an FN 5.7-millimeter pistol, a semiautomatic purchased legally at Guns Galore, a Killeen gun shop. Details on the other gun, identified only as a type of revolver, were not immediately available. Rossi told reporters late Friday that both guns were privately owned and never registered at the post. Earlier, officials said investigators were looking into whether some soldiers may have been shot accidentally by others trying to shoot the gunman. However, Rossi said, ""All indications are that this is not a friendly fire incident. And, of course, that will be validated when the investigation is complete."" Rossi attributed the high casualty rate to the ""more than 100 rounds"" fired by the gunman and the relatively small size of the room, among other factors. Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, who has been credited with shooting Hasan and ending the massacre, was among the wounded. She was in stable condition Friday night, according to her family and military officials. Munley's partner, Senior Sgt. Mark Todd, was also lauded for ""engaging"" the shooter, Rossi said. Todd, in an interview Friday night with CNN's Anderson Cooper, described the intense scene as both officers fired shots at the accused gunman. ""He looked like he was calm. He was just pointing a finger at me,"" Todd said. ""The weapon ... I just know I saw the weapon and that's when we returned fire."" Todd, a retired member of the military police, offered his condolences to the families of the victims. ""I wish we could've gotten there sooner and helped out a lot sooner -- but we got there as soon as we possibly could."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry was scheduled to visit hospitalized victims of the shooting Saturday. As the Fort Hood community grieved its numerous losses, holding a candlelight vigil and setting up support lines, some details about the alleged gunman emerged. Relatives say Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was a ""calm"" individual who had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Others described him as a vocal opponent to the war on terror whose rhetoric concerned colleagues. Fort Hood's commanding general said witnesses have reported that the gunman yelled ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great,"" during the rampage. However, Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said investigators had not confirmed that. Hasan's neighbors at his Killeen, Texas, apartment complex said he cleaned out his place just hours before the rampage and gave copies of the Quran to several residents. President Obama, in remarks Friday morning, cautioned against ""jumping to conclusions"" about what had triggered ""one of the worst mass shootings ever to take place on an American military base."" He ordered that flags at the White House and other federal buildings be flown at half staff until Veterans Day, Wednesday of next week. ""This is a modest tribute to those who lost their lives, even as many were preparing to risk their lives for their country,"" the president said. ""It's also a recognition of the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our safety and uphold our values. We honor their service, we stand in awe of their sacrifice, and we pray for the safety of those who fight and for the families of those who have fallen."" Obama said he met with FBI Director Robert Mueller and representatives of other relevant agencies to discuss the investigation. He promised his administration will provide updates. The central question investigators want to answer: Why would a member of the military who had been trusted with helping others achieve a healthier mental state allegedly shoot his comrades? ""He took care of soldiers with behavioral health problems and also evaluated people who had disability evaluations,"" Braverman told reporters Friday morning. Asked whether Hasan, 39, had seemed adequately prepared for his job, Braverman responded, ""We had no indication otherwise."" According to the American Psychiatric Association, Hasan co-chaired a panel at the group's May convention titled ""Medical Issues for Psychiatrists in Disasters."" Military records show Hasan received his appointment to the Army as a first lieutenant in June 1997 after graduating from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, with a degree in biochemistry. Six years later, he graduated from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences' F. Edward Hebert School Of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland, and was first an intern, then a resident and finally a fellow at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He was promoted to major in May. Army Lt. Col. Wayne Hall said Hasan was to deploy to Afghanistan to work with a unit already there as part of behavioral health support. It wasn't clear when Hasan was scheduled to go overseas for what would have been his first deployment. Since 2001, Hasan had been telling his family that he wanted to get out of the military but was unsuccessful, said a spokeswoman for his cousin, Nader Hasan. She added that he told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Nader Hasan issued a statement late Thursday on behalf of relatives, saying they were shocked by the shootings. Another family statement on Friday said, ""We are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification, whatsoever, for what happened. We are all asking why this happened -- and the answer is that we simply do not know. ""We can not explain, nor do we excuse what happened yesterday. Yesterday's violence in no way reflects the feelings, beliefs, or principles of our family,"" the statement continued, adding that the family is cooperating with authorities.

"Washington (CNN) -- The aging veterans gingerly walk from the plane in the nation's capital. Some get pushed in wheelchairs. A brass band strikes up World War II era tunes. Strangers rise to their feet and clap their hands. ""Why are they doing this?"" says Frank Bales, 86, a co-pilot on a B-24 during World War II. ""I feel as humbled as a mouse."" Walter Victor was overwhelmed as he made his way through the crowd. ""The chills came over me. Very seldom do you see something like that,"" says the 92-year-old army veteran. These World War II veterans have traveled here to visit the National World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million U.S. armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle. The vets made the trip thanks to a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A physician's assistant at the VA in Springfield, Ohio, Earl Morse was struck by the WWII vets he treated and how few made the journey to see the memorial that honors them. ""They dedicated the WWII memorial in May of 2004, 60 years after the war had ended. That was a cause of celebration in my clinic. All of the veterans wanted to see it but they were in poor health or didn't have the means to visit it."" ""Reality set in,"" Morse says, ""they were never going to see their memorial."" Morse was determined to change that, because he so admired the quiet grit and heroism of the unassuming men he treated every day. He took his cause to a local air club. ""I stood before 150 pilots and told them I was going to start flying WWII veterans to Washington. I said if you want to help me, the WWII veteran doesn't pay a penny. You'll have to rent an airplane and cover all the travel costs."" ""Honor Flight"" took to the skies in May of 2005. Six planes flew 12 veterans. The next month, eight planes flew 16 veterans. Today, it operates like a volunteer airline, with 86 hubs in 33 states. Instead of renting small planes, they charter Boeing jets, thanks to donations that keep the planes in the sky. So far, more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial, courtesy of Honor Flight. ""Witnessing their emotions is what fuels our cause. When you see WWII veterans break down in tears because they had no idea how much this nation reveres, cherishes and loves them for what they've done, it really overwhelms them,"" Morse says. In the days and weeks before each Honor Flight, an army of ground volunteers coordinates every detail of each trip -- from the buses that pick them up to the meals they eat. Shortly after Bales and his group arrived in Washington this day, they were taken by bus to the memorial. Many said they were stunned by its size and scope. Inscriptions carved in granite recognize specific battles that were fought in Europe and across the Pacific. A wall of stars marks the high price of freedom. They paused to remember the 448,000 who died in the war -- and their fellow survivors who didn't live to see this moment. ""Each of those stars represents 100 men and women who died in WWII, and I realized that my division has almost 39 stars on that wall,"" said Tom Rone, 85, who stormed the bullet-ridden beaches on Guadalcanal as a platoon sergeant with the Marines. Morse says the trip often provides closure for the vets who visit. Many veterans open up at the memorial and speak in detail for the first time about what they went through. ""I've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping,"" Morse says. ""You can't fathom what it's like to have experienced what they went through fighting for their lives."" The same ""Honor Flight"" that transported the veterans to Washington returns them back home, landing just 12 hours after it took off. The elderly warriors seem renewed rather than exhausted by their whirlwind trip. ""I will never forget this,"" say 86-year-old Marcus Lee Long, who served in the Pacific on the USS Ellet. ""Everybody is so happy and treating us so nice."" Allen Pittard, 88, added, ""I feel so fortunate to be here. So many didn't make it."" For Morse, the founder of Honor Flight, the end of each flight is a bittersweet experience. His mission continues with an air of urgency, because less than 10 percent of the Americans who served in World War II are still alive. An estimated 1,200 WWII veterans die every day. ""In another five to seven years, our efforts will be a moot point because they will be gone or too infirm to participate in a mission like this,"" he says.","Program called Honor Flight takes WWII vets to see memorial in Washington .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""Late Show With David Letterman"" bandleader Paul Shaffer is a walking Wikipedia of rock 'n' roll history -- and now he's added his own story to the mix. Paul Shaffer has been David Letterman's bandleader for 27 years. Shaffer's new memoir, ""We'll Be Here for the Rest of Our Lives: A Swingin' Showbiz Saga"" (Flying Dolphin Press) offers his take on a colorful career, from piano lessons in his native Canada to a ""Saturday Night Live"" stint to the gig he's had, and relished, for 27 years -- Letterman's sidekick. Oh yeah, and he co-wrote the hit disco song ""It's Raining Men."" Shaffer appeared this week at a Manhattan Barnes & Noble to sign books and give a performance. Among those who dropped by were the Beach Boys' Al Jardine -- who joined in for ""Help Me, Rhonda"" -- Martin Short and girl group belter Darlene Love. Shaffer also took questions from the audience. Though the topic of Letterman's recent troubles was off-limits, one audience member did ask Shaffer what the host was really like -- emphasis on ""really."" Shaffer responded that the boss he's respected and admired for nearly three decades is ""very transparent on the air and you can see exactly what he's like."" Shaffer talked to CNN about how he picks songs to introduce guests, his renowned Passover celebrations and his chance to be on ""Seinfeld."" The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: When guests are introduced on the ""Late Show,"" you usually add a musical accompaniment that's an obscure reference to their name. My favorite was when Dustin Hoffman was a guest, and you played ""Dust in the Wind."" Can you tell me how you come up with those, and what some of your favorites have been? Paul Shaffer: We think of them in rehearsal before the show. I have about 15 minutes, and I often throw it open to the floor. And by the floor, I mean the musicians, the band [the ""Late Show's"" CBS Orchestra members]. And I say ""Who has an idea for this?"" And I pick the one that I like the best. [Once we] had a new actor named Aziz Ansari, and one of the guys in the band says, ""I'm Sorry"" [referring to the Brenda Lee song]. So we did it, and it cracked Dave [Letterman] up so I know that I got my one laugh -- and the most important laugh. CNN: What's the story behind using Ray Charles' ""Busted"" for Tom Brokaw? Shaffer: He was particularly difficult to come up with something for because he's on all the time, and we didn't want to play a news theme or a song about the news. So Will Lee, my bass player, suggested ""Busted"" ... ""I'm broke, aw -- I'm busted."" And Brokaw asked about it once: ""Why do you play Ray Charles' 'Busted' when I come on?"" He asked on camera, and I said, ""I'm broke -- aw -- I'm busted."" CNN: What is your favorite song of all time? Shaffer: As far as favorite ""overall package"" record of all time, I'd have to say ""My Girl"" by The Temptations. I like everything about it, not only the composition -- but the arrangement, the production, the lead vocals, the background vocals, the horns, the strings. That one I listen to over and over again. And, of course, ""Be My Baby"" by the Ronettes. Maybe that's my favorite song, and ""My Girl"" is my favorite record. CNN: For some reason I thought it was ""He's a Rebel"" by the Crystals. Shaffer: Well that's way up there. I consider that my national anthem. When I hear ""He's a Rebel,"" I stand. CNN: Are there any musicians you regret never having had a chance to work with? Shaffer: Well, of course, Frank [Sinatra] is one, and Elvis is the other. But aside from those two I think I've done pretty well. CNN: Can you tell me a little bit about your famed ""Celebrity Seders""? Shaffer: We spent a lot of time at the show during the early days of ""SNL"" [""Saturday Night Live""]. We had no personal lives at all. ... And, of course, we were there doing a show around Passover time, and Suzanne Miller, who was one of the writers, came up with the idea that we should have a seder for the cast and crew and writers who wouldn't be going home. So I said, ""I can conduct it!"" I knew how to conduct a seder at lightning speed because my parents couldn't wait to get to the matzo ball soup. So I have that skill, and I also sort of had an act, too. As a prize for finding the matzo, I gave out a pizza on [""SNL's""] ""Weekend Update."" [Producer] Lorne Michaels liked it so much that he had matches printed up immediately that said ""Paul Shaffer's Celebrity Seder"" and that became legendary. CNN: In the late 1980s, you were offered the role of George Costanza on ""Seinfeld."" Any regrets on not accepting that part? Shaffer: Just to be clear, I was offered the role of Jerry Seinfeld's sidekick. He had three sidekicks, and I had a feeling mine might've been that role. And any regrets? Well, I mean it was only the most beloved show of all time. ... Truthfully, though, I would have missed the opportunity to play music. CNN: How do you stay hip and current in a world where today's kids don't appreciate showbiz legends and the origins of comedy? Shaffer: I still talk incessantly about ""SCTV,"" and I say, ""Screw the kids!""","Paul Shaffer: The David Letterman viewers see on air is who he really is .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The FBI is asking for public assistance in finding a serial bank robber dubbed the ""Granddad Bandit,"" who is believed to have struck in at least seven states. The man, thought by authorities to be between 50 and 60 years old, is suspected in a string of nine bank robberies beginning in April in Houston, Texas, the FBI's Atlanta Field Office said in a news release. Since then, police believe he has robbed two banks in Atlanta and single banks in Roanoke, Virginia; Little Rock, Arkansas; Dallas, Texas; Birmingham, Alabama; Syracuse, New York; and Tallahassee, Florida, the last bank robbery, which occurred on October 16. ""His robberies are described as being calm, with a deliberate attempt to not attract attention to himself,"" the FBI said. ""The robber quietly presents a demand note to the victim teller and thereafter departs the bank without disruption to normal banking business going on around him."" The man is described as being between 6 feet and 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighing between 220 and 250 pounds. He is described as stocky and bald, with short gray hair on the sides, and wears glasses. A $10,000 reward is being offered by law enforcement. To offer information in the case, contact the Atlanta FBI. In September, a man sought in at least 10 bank robberies in at least four states was arrested in Missouri. The FBI posted photos from the bank robberies on billboards, leading to the man identified as Chad Schaffner. A retired state trooper saw Schaffner in Kingdom City, Missouri, and notified authorities. Schaffner is suspected of robbing banks in states including Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, authorities said.","Last bank robbery occurred October 16 in Tallahassee, Florida .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The sound of taps echoed across the Texas plains Tuesday after President Obama pledged that the work of those killed in last week's Fort Hood massacre will go on despite their ""incomprehensible"" slayings. Speaking to an estimated 15,000 people at a memorial service at the post, Obama vowed that justice will be done in the attack that left 13 dead and 42 wounded. Though he told the families that ""no words can fill the void that has been left,"" he added, ""your loved ones endure through the life of our nation."" ""Their life's work is our security and the freedom that we too often take for granted. Every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town; every dawn that a flag is unfurled; every moment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- that is their legacy,"" the president said. After his remarks, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama laid a presidential coin before each of the 13 battlefield crosses -- the helmet, boots and rifle representing each of those killed -- before family members and comrades filed past. Fort Hood Army Post has seen 545 soldiers killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, the post's commander, ""but never did we expect to pay such a high price at home."" Gen. George Casey, the Army's chief of staff, added, ""Grieve with us. Don't grieve for us."" ""Those who have fallen did so in the service of their country,"" he said. ""They freely answered the call to serve, and they gave their lives for something that they loved and believed in."" Obama called the wartime killings of American troops on their home soil ""incomprehensible."" But he said the values the dead volunteered to defend will live on and will be extended even to the man accused of carrying to the slayings. The suspected gunman in the attack is a 39-year-old Army psychiatrist, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who remained in intensive care at an Army hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Hasan, an American-born Muslim of Palestinian descent, was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan but had told his family that he wanted to get out of the military. ""No faith justifies these murderous and craven acts,"" Obama said at the memorial service. But he said soldiers who responded to the attack ""remind us of who we are as Americans."" ""We are a nation of laws whose commitment to justice is so enduring that we would treat a gunman and give him due process, just as surely as we will see that he pays for his crimes,"" he said. No charges have been filed, and authorities have not identified a motive in Thursday's attack. But in a statement issued Monday night, the FBI said its investigation ""indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot."" Thursday's victims included 12 soldiers and a retired soldier working as a civilian physician's assistant. Shortly before the ceremony and 1,200 miles away, the remains of one of the soldiers was carried off a chartered jet in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. An honor guard met the casket of Sgt. Amy Krueger on the apron at General Mitchell International Airport. Krueger, 29, was a high school athlete who joined the military after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. She was assigned to a medical unit that was doing checkups on soldiers bound for Afghanistan and Iraq when the shooting erupted. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and more than a dozen members of Congress were among who attended the service on the warm Texas afternoon. CNN correspondent Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","""Grieve with us.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Rapper Kanye West and his business manager must complete 50 hours of community service in exchange for the dismissal of charges stemming from a Los Angeles airport scuffle with paparazzi last year. Kanye West must complete 50 hours of community service by December 23. West has already attended 12 hours of anger management classes and paid for the camera that was broken during the incident, his lawyer told the judge during a hearing Friday morning. Police arrested West and Don Crawley on September 11, 2008, after an altercation with a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos, airport police said. West and Crawley were later charged with three misdemeanors counts: vandalism, battery and grand theft. ""There was not a situation where there was a lot of time for either defendant to reflect on what they were doing,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Mark Zuckman. Zuckman, who presided over Friday's hearing, said he could take the position that ""a brief impulsive response"" by West and Crawley ""doesn't necessarily demonstrate a severe character flaw that needs to be addressed in a criminal case."" Still, he said, he did not want ""to send a message that ripping the camera from someone's hand and destroying it [in] an act of vandalism is acceptable, no matter what kind of provocation caused them to be angry. There are other remedies."" Zuckman said if anyone had been injured in the incident, his decision would have been different. West and Crawley have until December 23 to complete 50 hours of community service, Zuckman said. If they do, he will dismissed the charges. If convicted, West could have faced up to two years and six months in jail, while Crawley could have faced up to five years, according to Frank Mateljan, the spokesman for the city attorney.","Rapper and his business manager must finish 50 hours of community service .

"(CNN) -- Britain says it has suspended the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands and imposed direct rule after allegations of systemic corruption and ""serious dishonesty"". Former Turks and Caicos Islands Premier Michael Misick, shown here with his wife, LisaRaye, could be investigated. British Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said he instructed the British governor of the island territory to suspend the ministerial government and the House of Assembly for as long as two years. Bryant said his order also suspends the constitutional right to trial by jury in the Turks and Caicos. ""This is a serious constitutional step which the UK government has not taken lightly, but these measures are essential in order to restore good governance and sound financial management,"" Bryant said in a statement. ""It remains our intentions that elections should be held by July 2011, if not sooner. It is also important that the people of Turks and Caicos Islands continue to have a voice in the interim and the order puts in place an advisory council and consultative forum to make sure this happens."" The move follows allegations of corruption in the Turks and Caicos, a British Overseas Territory of eight major islands and numerous uninhabited keys, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Miami, Florida. The British government set up a commission of inquiry in July 2008 to look into possible corruption or other serious dishonesty in recent years of past and present elected members of the legislature. The commission's report, delivered May 31, found ""information in abundance pointing to a high probability of systemic corruption and/or serious dishonesty"" in the Turks and Caicos, the Foreign Office said. ""This, together with clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative incompetence, demonstrated a need for urgent suspension in whole or in part of the constitution and for other legislative and administrative reforms,"" the Foreign Office said. The report also recommends criminal investigations into former Premier Michael Misick and four of his former Cabinet ministers. ""This is not a 'British takeover,'"" said Gordon Wetherell, governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands. ""Public services will continue to be run by people of the Turks and Caicos Islands, as indeed they should be. But I hope we can now begin to run them better."" Queen Elizabeth is the head of state of the British territory, and the governor is her official representative. The governor is responsible for defense; external affairs; internal security, including the islands' police force; and the appointment of some public officials, but he is normally required to act on the advice of the Cabinet. The islands' ministerial system includes the premier and six other ministers who must act according to Cabinet policies.","Britain says it has suspended the government of the Turks and Caicos .

"(CNN) -- Brazil has confirmed 557 deaths caused by H1N1 flu, the highest total in the world, the nation's Health Ministry says. A vaccine against H1N1 is being tested but is not expected to be available until at least mid-October. The United States has counted 522 fatalities through Thursday, and nearly 1,800 people had died worldwide through August 13, U.S. and global health officials said. In terms of mortality rate, which considers flu deaths in terms of a nation's population, Brazil ranks seventh, and the United States is 13th, the Brazilian Ministry of Health said in a news release Wednesday. Argentina, which has reported 386 deaths attributed to H1N1 as of August 13, ranks first per capita, the Brazilian health officials said, and Mexico, where the flu outbreak was discovered in April, ranks 14th per capita. Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the United States have the most total cases globally, according to the World Health Organization. The Brazilian Ministry of Health said there have been 6,100 cases of flu in the nation, with 5,206 cases (85.3 percent) confirmed as H1N1, also known as swine flu. The state of Sao Paulo had 223 deaths through Wednesday, the largest number in the country. In addition, 480 pregnant women have been confirmed with H1N1, of whom 58 died. Swine flu has been shown to hit young people and pregnant women particularly hard. Many schools in Sao Paulo have delayed the start of the second semester for a couple of weeks, and students will have to attend classes on weekends to catch up. Schools also have suspended extracurricular activities such as soccer, volleyball and chess to try to curtail spread of the disease. Flu traditionally has its peak during the winter months, and South America, where it is winter, has had a large number of cases recently. The World Health Organization said this week that the United States and other heavily populated Northern Hemisphere countries need to brace for a second wave of H1N1 as their winter approaches. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other U.S. health agencies have been preparing and said this week that up to half of the nation's population may contract the disease and 90,000 could die from it. Seasonal flu typically kills about 64,000 Americans each year. A vaccine against H1N1 is being tested but is not expected to be available until at least mid-October and will probably require two shots at least one week apart, health officials have said. Since it typically takes a couple of weeks for a person's immunity to build up after the vaccine, most Americans would not be protected until sometime in November. The World Health Organization in June declared a Level 6 worldwide pandemic, the organization's highest classification.","Nearly 1,800 people died worldwide of H1N1 through August 13 .

"(CNN)  -- In death as in life, Michael Jackson continues to light up the Internet. Millions worldwide watched online coverage of Michael Jackson's funeral service in Los Angeles. Millions of people around the world watched coverage of Jackson's memorial service on the Web, although the event appeared to fall well short of online viewership records. Global Web traffic was at least 19 percent above normal, and as high as 33 percent above normal, during most of the star-studded memorial at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, California, according to Akamai Technologies, a Massachusetts-based firm that monitors Internet traffic. CNN.com reported 9.7 million live video streams Tuesday between 12 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET -- which included the entire memorial service -- according to CNN spokeswoman Jennifer Martin. The news site's all-time viewership record for a full day, almost 27 million video streams, was set on President Obama's inauguration day in January. During that period Tuesday, CNN.com also attracted 81 million page views, 11.8 unique visitors and a peak of 781,000 concurrent live video streams, according to internal data. Jackson's startling June 25 death nearly brought the Web to a standstill, with several sites buckling under the sheer weight of traffic. The Internet appeared to fare better during Tuesday's memorial service, however. ""So far we are seeing some slowdowns ... [but] overall the Internet is performing OK,"" said Dan Berkowitz, spokesman for Keynote Systems, a mobile and Internet monitoring firm based in San Mateo, California, midway through the Staples Center event. Keynote monitors the 40 most popular news Web sites from major cities around the United States. CNN.com partnered with Facebook, the social-networking site, to let friends and family share commentary while watching Jackson's memorial service live online. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, shortly before the memorial service began, the partnership was yielding about 6,000 status updates per minute, said a Facebook spokeswoman. CNN.com and Facebook entered into a similar collaboration during Obama's inauguration, although Facebook saw twice as many status updates during that event. With many North Americans at work during Jackson's memorial service, online traffic had been expected to reach near-record levels. ""This event will almost certainly shatter records for the biggest single live stream ever, and could be one of the biggest worldwide media events in history,"" wrote blogger Ben Parr on Mashable, the social media news site. Other Web sites, including CBSNews.com, ABCNews.com, FoxNews.com and Hulu.com, also hosted live streaming coverage of the service. The 10 most popular topics on Twitter Tuesday afternoon were all connected to Jackson's memorial. Google Trends rated the Jackson memorial's online popularity as ""volcanic,"" while on Web-traffic monitoring site Alexa, most of its hottest stories Tuesday were Jackson-related. But early numbers suggested that Internet traffic Tuesday may have lagged behind other recent news events. Akamai recorded a peak of 3.9 million global Internet visitors per minute shortly after noon ET -- less than half the number of users who went online the evening of November 4, 2008, to follow presidential election returns. ""It may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,"" said Toni Fitzgerald, managing editor of Media Life, in an e-mail interview with CNN. Long before the memorial service began about 1:40 p.m. ET, many Web sites braced themselves for an onslaught of traffic. During the sign-up period for the memorial ticket lottery, the Staples Center Web site took down all non-essential materials to ensure that it coped. Jackson family spokesman Ken Sunshine said the computer servers hosting the registration site counted 500 million ""hits"" -- 120,000 a second -- in the first 90 minutes on Friday. About 17,500 fans were randomly selected to watch the memorial live at the Staples Center -- only a small fraction of the 1.6 million fans who applied for tickets.

"(CNN) -- October has been the deadliest month for the US and NATO militaries fighting in Afghanistan as well as UN workers trying to organize an election runoff. Surely the surge in deaths serves to underscore why Afghanistan matters. For all the debate happening away from the battlefield, here are a couple of important bottom-line questions: . Is the world prepared to see the Taliban and their opportunistic allies al Qaeda return to power in Afghanistan? Are people prepared for the terrorists' dream- photo-op of Mullah Omar and Osama Bin Laden sitting smiling together in Kabul? And here's what's at stake: . The West fortunately has been free of terrorist attacks on its major cities in the last few years, but it was not so long ago that the London Tube bombings; mass murder in Madrid; mayhem in Mumbai in 2008;  the murders of Benazir Bhutto and Daniel Pearl; the Bali bombing; the shoe bomber and, of course, 9/11 and the attacks on the World Trade Center changed our world and our way of life. Together, those events created pervasive fear and anxiety, not to mention a change in our lifestyle caused by security measures in airports, trains, banking transactions and office buildings. What all of these events have in common is that the perpetrators all came from, visited, were financed by, or were led by terrorist organizations operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, especially the ungovernable territories on those countries' border. The Bush administration, in the view of some, may have gone too far in responding to these events by creating an all-encompassing ""war on terrorism."" However, for the eight long years America and NATO countries have been at war in Afghanistan, this war, uniquely in modern history, is still supported by all the world's major powers, the neighbors of Afghanistan, and mostly by the people of Afghanistan, who dread both insecurity and a return to the brutal horrors of the Taliban. If the threat of new terrorist attacks is not enough, what about the threat of a nuclear catastrophe? Look at Pakistan this week. Horrific bombings in the frontier town of Peshawar and elsewhere have also killed scroes of people, just as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives to firm up security and development co-operation with that country. While foreign policy and intelligence experts continue to worry that terrorism, Islamic extremism, the continued threat of renewed war between Pakistan and India, plus the presence of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries, could prove a combustible mix in the not-too-distant future. This is not scare-mongering; it's simply the reality that what happens in South Asia could affect all of our lives. That's why all of us must be concerned by the outcome of the war that is being fought today in mountains of the tribal areas in Pakistan and the plains of Afghanistan. Many of the soldiers and officers I speak to in Afghanistan say the best way to beat back the threat of Taliban insurgents is with boots on the ground and additional military resources, as well as a proper development assistance for the Afghan civilians. The Afghan people need protecting and enabling. I have been reporting from Afghanistan since 1996 and the one thing I've noticed over the years is that every Afghan asks foremost for security. Then next on the list is development to help them earn a decent living and raise their families. They also want a decent government. They know this will take years of patience and effort. They know it will be a hard slog. After all, they have been at war for 30 years now, during which the traditional, honor-bound society they had for decades has all but vanished. Though it is true that fierce tribal traditions mean some Afghans distrust even the tribe next door, not to mention foreign troops, over and again, Afghan men, women and children have told me they do not see the U.S. and NATO forces as occupiers, rather as armies from countries who came to help them ... but who have fallen short of their promises. This fear and disenchantment is what the Taliban feeds on today. They want the U.S. and NATO out, they try to convince the people those outsiders are occupiers bent on harming them. And yet, if you look at the current trends and the latest polls in Afghanistan, despite massive governmental corruption, abuse and dysfunction, the majority of the people want nothing to do with the Taliban. Polls show only a tiny minority support them. And that is mostly because they are desperate for security and safety, something the West has failed to follow through on after roundly defeating the Taliban and al Qaeda in seven weeks after 9/11. And across the border in Pakistan surveys show Osama Bin Laden has lost his luster among Muslim youth. Support for Islamic extremists is dropping. The Pakistani government is finally fighting back against the extremists who threaten the future of this mostly moderate Muslim country. Under pressure, the militants are lashing out in parts of the country. See Christiane Amanpour's special report on ""Generation Islam"" Unfortunately, at this crucial moment, people in America and Europe are tiring of their governments' support for the war in Afghanistan and the battles in remote parts of Pakistan. The agonized debate over strategy in Washington hides the sad fact that since sending the Taliban and al Qaeda packing, shortsighted U.S. vision snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. The Bush administration mostly ignored Afghanistan while diverting its attention and resources to Iraq. Now that the U.S. is finally refocusing on the war in Afghanistan it's an opportunity to look at what is at stake: the urgency of finishing the job in Afghanistan pitted against the real war-weariness of western voters. This is the dilemma of the modern world where the latest of life's challenges such as the financial crisis, unemployment, new flu pandemics, health care, and the housing market dominate daily life. Getting the job done in Afghanistan will take years in time and resources. It will require faith and patience. The mass media is not the best place to reflect that. It does not usually focus on the hard slog, instead it is constantly in search of the new and the now. But the next time there is a major terrorist attack, in all likelihood it will have been generated by an organization somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. Again, people will ask: Why weren't our leaders and the media there to warn us of the dangers? As a member of the media I believe that's our job: to report the facts.","Amanpour: Is the world prepared to see the Taliban return to power?
They'll bring their allies, al Qaeda, with them, she says .
Majority of Afghans want nothing to do with the Taliban, she says .
But they feel NATO, U.S. troops have fallen short of their promises, she says ."
"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The first child in Britain known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born Friday, a spokesman for University College London told CNN. Genetic screening allows lab-fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems. Her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the BRCA-1 gene, linked to breast and ovarian cancer. People with the gene are known to have a 50-80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes. British newspapers have dubbed the girl the ""cancer-free"" baby. ""This little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life,"" said Paul Serhal, a consultant at University College London Hospital and Medical Director of the Assisted Conception Unit. ""The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter. The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations."" Yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life, a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis. ""This is not a cure for breast cancer,"" said Josephine Quintavalle, co-founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction. What do you think about testing embryos for gene defects? ""This is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody (prone to) the disease,"" she said. ""It is basically a search-and-kill mechanism."" She opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease-causing genes often are discarded. She says that is essentially murder. ""They will be destroyed,"" she said. ""They will never be allowed to live."" Doctors in Britain and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or Huntington's Disease. What's different about the girl born Friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in Britain as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease. In the United States, geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life. Quintavalle opposes any form of in-vitro fertilization where embryos are ""killed,"" she said. But she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the BRCA-1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease, and the disease is not always fatal. ""The message we are sending is: 'Better off dead than carrying (a gene linked to) breast cancer,'"" she said. ""We have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope."" Peter Braude, one of the top British experts on the genetic testing of embryos, said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits. ""There has always been a vociferous group in opposition,"" he said. But ""there are people who can benefit and I think they should be allowed to do so."" In fact, he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three-day old embryo in a lab. Only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted. ""I don't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child,"" said Braude, head of the department of women's health at the King's College London School of Medicine. For many couples, the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy. Some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect. Diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab, testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found. Braude agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions. ""How serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo?"" he asked. ""Are you prepared to throw away a 16-week embryo for Huntington's, which will not manifest until age 40?"" In Britain, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority determines the conditions for which geneticists can test. It has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990. The authority approved testing for the BRCA-1 gene in 2008. Dr. Mark Hughes, who founded a genetics clinic in the United States, said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in Britain -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so. At his Genesis Genetics Institute in Detroit, Michigan, Hughes carries out about two tests a month for BRCA-1 or BRCA-2, a related gene. ""The couple is the best one to be making these decisions, because they live with these diseases,"" he said. ""When it hits your family over and over again, many couples are saying: 'Enough of this. Let's prune this out of our family tree forever.'"" He rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children. ""You can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children, but let's give these families more credit,"" he said. ""They just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease."" Hughes said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies. That's partly because it costs the equivalent of about $11,755 -- 8,000 British pounds -- to screen embryos. It's also because the process is very complex. ""It's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago,"" when Hughes did his first test for cystic fibrosis, he said. ""But it has not exploded, not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do. ""No one would use these technologies for a trivial reason. It's too much effort,"" he said. ""Not just the money -- it's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic.""","""Cancer-free baby"" born; baby girl is first in UK to be screened for cancer gene .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Top flight golf is a high-stakes, high-stress sport -- but it's not just the pros who are feeling the strain. Stress can affect golfers of all abilities. Swede Robert Karlsson returned from a four-month layoff recently with an eye condition that's thought to be stress-related, while England's Ian Poulter defended his decision not to play in the Vivendi Trophy by saying that he wanted to avoid fatigue -- mental as well as physical. While professional sport is bound to have its pressures, recreational golf is usually regarded as a way to unwind and relieve stress. But it seems that weekend players are having to deal with anxieties of their own. Victor Thompson, a London-based sports psychologist, told CNN that golf is a much more psychological sport than most. ""It can be particularly stressful because, unlike team sports, you very much have the spotlight on you while you're playing,"" he said. ""You've got a lot of time between your shots for you to think, time for other people to watch you and time for you to think about what people will think of you if you don't play well."" That doesn't just apply when there's an audience of millions watching on TV -- it's just as true when you're playing at your local municipal course with your friends. ""It can actually be tougher playing against your mates and people you know because they can ridicule you or laugh at you, or you might worry about disappointing them if you're playing on their team,"" said Thompson. That would appear to be borne out by a 2004 study on the moods of older recreational golfers. The subjects reported being no happier or calmer after playing golf -- in fact, they reported feeling more angry and depressed. One of the researchers, Haydn Jarrett, senior lecturer in sport and exercise science at the University of Worcester, told CNN that the study also showed that golfers reported feeling more fatigued and less vigorous after playing golf, as most players walked an average 10.2 km during a game. Jarrett's study was carried out on ""senior"" golfers, with an average age of 68, but he said the findings on mood change tied in with other studies carried out on younger recreational golfers. ""Golf does appear to be stressful for recreational players,"" he told CNN. ""If we wanted golfers to enjoy it more fully it might be nice to engage with golfers and bring potential negative moods to their attention."" While those negative feelings probably don't last for long, they can have disastrous effects on your golf. Thompson says negative thoughts on the golf course can make you tense and frustrated, giving you an adrenaline rush that can affect your swing and timing. As you start dropping shots you can overanalyze your game, which just make things worse. The secret of dealing with golf stress is to get on top of your thoughts, says Thompson. Rather than thinking in terms of how badly you're playing or what other people will think of you, you need to realize that your emotions are getting the better of you and that anxiety is the problem, not your technique. So with all that stress, could playing golf actually be bad for you? ""If you're beating yourself up emotionally and getting angry that's not very good for your health,"" said Thompson. ""But it's all a matter of attitude. Somebody might go out and enjoy it, see it as a chance to get away from work, have a nice stroll and catch up with their mates."" And Jarrett has encouraging news when it comes to golf and health. He has carried out unpublished work showing that a round of golf can give a significant reduction in blood pressure. ""My gut feeling is that golf is incredibly positive for health,"" he told CNN. ""The positives of the distance walked, the heart-rate increase and the blood-pressure suppression will outweigh any negative mood states. But it might be that we need to recognize that mood profiles can go down and mediate against that.""","Golf is especially stressful, says sports psychologist Victor Thompson .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic is up to number three in the world after defeating Marin Cilic in the final of the China Open in Beijing on Sunday. Novak Djokovic holds aloft the giant China Open trophy after victory over Marin Cilic in Beijing. The Serb captured his third ATP title of the year with a 6-2 7-6 victory over the battling Cilic, who beat fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko and top seed Rafael Nadal en route to the final. Second seed Djokovic took advantage of a 90-minute rain delay, which came at 2-2 in the first set, coming back on center court at the Beijing Olympics tennis venue with sharper ground strokes and well-placed serves. After holding serve to go 3-2 up, Djokovic broke Cilic straight away and then a second time to take the opening set, with the Croat the victim of two unlucky net cords in the final game. In the second, Cilic -- a wild card entry -- and Djokovic traded breaks three times to force a tie-break, with the Cilic failing to serve out twice. Djokovic took control midway, winning a rally that left Cilic sitting on the court to go up 4-2. The Serb closed it out on his second match point when the Cilic sent an inside-out forehand sailing wide. ""I certainly played much better after the rain delay,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""I kind of got my nerves together -- I was very fresh on the court after that. Even though it was a straight set win, it wasn't easy at all. Marin could have had at least a set under his belt."" Djokovic, by reaching the final, is assured of taking over the world number three ranking, surpassing injured Scot Andy Murray.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British-led military operation meant to clear the Taliban from parts of Afghanistan has succeeded, UK officials said Monday. A file image shows a British Royal Marine sniper team on an operation in Afghanistan. NATO and its Afghan allies launched Operation Panther's Claw to flush the Taliban from parts of southern Helmand Province before Afghan presidential elections next month. Major fighting is mostly over, and the military will now focus on ""holding"" the areas that have been cleared of Taliban so they do not return, Lt. Gen. Simon Mayall said in a briefing. The operation's success will enable up to 80,000 people in Helmand to vote. ""Panther's Claw has been extremely successful,"" said Brigadier Tim Radford, the top British military commander for the operation. ""There will be many Taliban who will not be fighting any more."" He said the Taliban suffered ""significant casualties,"" but refused to say how many. Nine British troops were killed in action in the operation, he said, and there were three Afghan civilian casualties. Radford estimated that there were 450 to 500 Taliban fighters in the area at the time of the operation, which he called ""one of the biggest that has taken place."" The British gave several weeks' warning that they were planning to attack, he said, both to exert psychological pressure on the Taliban and to give civilians a chance to flee. As a result, ""quite a few Taliban managed to get away,"" Radford said. ""They will always get away and they will always come back in."" Mayall, the deputy chief of the British Defence Staff for Operations, said the challenge now was to convince local people that the Afghan government and its allies could protect them from the Taliban. The Taliban ""are going to assume that we are going to lose interest and move on,"" he said. But they are wrong, he said. NATO forces were going to ""stay in Afghanistan for a very long time,"" he said, adding that active NATO-led fighting should ""tail off"" as Afghan security forces develop the ability to fight the Taliban themselves. The counter-insurgency strategy of clearing and holding an area to allow for development of infrastructure and the rule of law echoes the coalition forces' plan in Iraq. Panther's Claw focused on the area around the town of Babaji in Helmand Province. The operation mirrored a similar operation by U.S. Marines in the area. At least 20 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan this month, sparking intense debate in Britain about the country's military role there. The British-led operation involved about 3,000 troops -- mostly from the British military but also with Afghan, Danish and Estonian forces, the British Ministry of Defence said in a written statement. The operation started in mid-June with an air assault along a canal about 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of the city of Lashkar Gah, the ministry said. British-led forces attacked from three different directions over the next three weeks, essentially creating a ""gated community"" where Taliban insurgents could not get in or out, Radford said. Major fighting ended July 20, he said.","Major fighting in Operation Panther's Claw over, British military says .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five people connected to an Afghan presidential candidate have been released after being kidnapped the day before, an official with the candidate said. Five of Dr Abdullah Abdullah's campaign workers were kidnapped and later released. The group of five, who worked for Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, were in a two-car caravan in northwestern Afghanistan on Wednesday when they were abducted, said Sayed Ahmad Samey, the security chief of Badghis province. Elders negotiated for their release, Samey said. The workers have now been freed and are in a good condition, according to Sami Panah of Abdullah's campaign office. Abdullah is a former Foreign Minister who is seeking to unseat incumbent President Hamid Karzai in the August 20 election. This is not the first time that Abdullah's supporters have been targeted. One of the presidential hopeful's campaign workers was wounded by an unknown gunman in late July. A month earlier, gunmen in the province of Kapisa killed another of Abdullah's campaign managers in a midnight attack. Hundreds of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers have headed to southern Afghanistan to secure polling stations and protect citizens during the elections. It will be the nation's second presidential election since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.","Afghan election campaign workers released after 24 hour kidnap .

"(AOL Autos) -- Protecting drivers and passengers from injury has been a high priority for car makers for the last 40 years or more. A truck driver tests an anti-collison system. The red light goes on if the car in front of him is too close. Not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because having a reputation for building safe vehicles helps automakers sell more cars. But in recent years, high-tech advancements have come along at such a fast and furious rate that auto-safety systems have entered a whole new universe. For most of the history of auto manufacturing, car makers' efforts in the area of safety have been devoted to developing ""passive"" safety features -- seat belts, air bags, building a stronger frame for the cabin, side-impact door beams, etc. All those things help you stay safe once you are involved in an accident. But just as advanced technology has changed almost every other industry, so too has it changed the automotive industry, leading to the design of more ""active"" safety features. AOL Autos: Safest cars . It started with now-common features like anti-lock brakes (ABS) and electronic stability control systems (ESC). But in recent years, engineers have taken safety technology to a new level. And these days, they spend more time and money researching and developing ""crash avoidance"" features and technologies. These computerized systems, instead of protecting you if a crash occurs, help you avoid accidents in the first place. Some of these systems are already in vehicles on the road today, while others are coming down the pipeline in the next few years. Mercedes uses radar, rear-view monitor . Given that it's a higher-priced luxury brand, it figures that Mercedes-Benz is one of the leaders when it comes to these kinds of high-tech crash-avoidance systems. Finely-tuned anti-lock brake and electronic-stability-control systems are standard equipment in all Mercedes cars. AOL Autos: Best and worst hybrids . ""And presently, a number of our vehicles offer Distronic Plus, a crash-avoidance system that employs dual-band radar that measures the distance between you and the vehicle ahead of you,"" said Patrik Borenius, Mercedes' manager of advanced product planning. ""If that distance closes too rapidly, indicating that a crash might be imminent, it emits first an audible signal, then a visual warning, and the system can actually start to apply the brakes to a certain threshold. ""Or, if you start to apply the brakes yourself, but not quickly enough to help you avoid impact, our Brake Assist system applies even more braking power."" AOL Autos: Most popular fuel-efficient cars . ""We also have a Blind Spot Monitor that uses radar to examine the area just to the rear and to the left of your vehicle,"" added Bart Herring, product manager for Mercedes' S-Class and CL-Class. ""So when another vehicle, or any object, enters into that blind spot, a red indicator light in your side view mirror lights up. And if you start to change lanes while that other car is in your blind spot that also triggers an audio alert to warn you."" Plus, Mercedes' Rear View Monitor ""views"" anything that is directly behind the vehicle as it is backing up, and then projects that image onto the navigation-system screen. This feature helps avoid accidents in situations where the vehicle is going in reverse and the driver's view of oncoming traffic is impaired -- like in parking structures, or when backing out of a driveway on a heavily-trafficked street. AOL Autos: Most popular crossover vehicles . Mercedes also offers a Night View system in the S-Class and CL-Class, which, at night, ""gives you a very sharp, daytime-quality picture of everything that is going on in front of you,"" Herring said. ""And it's projected onto a separate display screen that's in the middle of the instrument cluster, right in front of you."" The ""new frontier"" of safety technology . Ford Motor Company is another car maker where the engineers are excited about its tech-driven crash-avoidance systems -- some currently in use, some still in development. AOL Autos: Luxury cars with the best MPG . ""Developing new active-safety systems really is the new frontier in safety technology in the auto industry,"" said Steve Kozak, Ford's global chief engineer for safety systems. Ford has owned Volvo since 1999, so Ford is benefiting from many of Volvo's renowned safety features. ""Some of the more advanced features that were first offered in Volvo's vehicles are cascading down into the Ford product line, due to our engineers working together with theirs,"" Kozak said. One Ford system in development addresses the fact that many accidents happen because drivers aren't paying attention. ""Studies have shown that in 50 percent of accidents, the drivers never even stepped on the brake,"" Kozak said. So, one technology that excites Kozak is the ""collision mitigation system"" that originated in the 2007 Volvo S80 and will be cascading into the Ford product line in the near future. ""It senses that that the car ahead of you is coming to a rapid stop, so if you're not paying attention, it essentially tells you to 'wake up and do something,' "" Kozak explained. ""With this system, there is a light mounted at the top of the instrument panel that reflects into the windshield, it's essentially a heads-up display, so in this kind of panic situation, that light will illuminate plus you get an audio alert telling you it's time to take action."" Ford is also presently developing a blind-spot alert system (for early '09 rollout) and a lane-departure warning system (similar to those offered in Mercedes vehicles) -- technologies that also originated in Volvo vehicles. ""One interesting aspect of the lane-departure system that we're working on is that it may involve 'tactile input' in addition to an audio warning,"" Kozak said. That is, when you're coming up too fast on the car ahead of you, ""you could get a vibrating sensation in the car seat or steering wheel."" From roll mitigation to trailer stability -- and more . Meanwhile, Chrysler LLC is ""devoting plenty of resources and doing a lot of system-development work devoted to trying to mitigate a crash,"" said Chris Barman, Chrysler's director for active and passive safety systems. One such crash-avoidance system currently employed in various Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep vehicles is an electronic Roll-Mitigation System. ""It senses when the vehicle is in danger or is moving sideways at a rapid pace, which could lead to a rollover,"" Barman explained. ""So it applies more brake pressure to the outside front wheel, which corrects the lateral motion and keeps the car moving forward."" Chrysler's own version of a computerized Brake-Assist system helps in another situation that is all too common, Barman said. ""Many times, in an emergency-braking situation, drivers will initially hit the brakes -- but then, unknowingly, let off the brake pedal, which means they lose a lot of stopping distance. ""So, if they don't hit the brakes with enough pressure, or don't brake fast enough, this system will detect that, and automatically applies the optimum amount of brake pressure in the shortest amount of time -- which could go a long way toward avoiding a crash and any resulting injury."" Another Chrysler feature Barman likes is the trailer-stability control system. ""Sometimes, if you've never towed a trailer before, or if maybe you have too much weight in the rear of the trailer, the trailer can start swaying back and forth,"" Barman explained. ""Well, this system uses sensors to determine yaw rate and lateral-movement rate, and then provides brake pressure that is counter to the sway of the trailer to get it to settle down."" Other crash-avoiding features being introduced for the 2009 Chrysler Town & Country and the Dodge Caravan minivans are Chrysler's own version of the Blind Spot Monitoring system, plus the Rear Cross Path system, which uses an illuminated icon in the mirror and an audible chime to warn you of the presence of an oncoming vehicle when you're backing up -- like in the parking-structure scenario cited above. ""We're trying to take a 360-degree view all around the vehicle, in order to determine everything we can do to help a person avoid a crash,"" Barman said.","High-tech advancements push auto-safety systems forward .

"(CNN) -- People with a stable mood and better capacity to handle stressful situations without anxiety have a reduced risk of developing dementia, according to a study published this week in the journal Neurology. Stress can increase the risk of dementia in older people, a study has found. This finding was particularly strong in highly extroverted people, the study said. Subjects who were both socially active and not easily stressed had the lowest risk for dementia. But even socially isolated individuals who were more calm and self-satisfied showed a reduced likelihood of dementia, the study said. Extroverted people usually have more optimistic outlooks on life, and ""may be better equipped to cope with stressful events and therefore less prone to depression,"" said Hui-Xin Wang of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and lead author of the study. The study looked at 506 older people from the Kungsholmen Project in Stockholm who did not have dementia at the first examination. These people then filled out questionnaires that determined their personality types and level of social activity. Those who said they were easily distressed were classified as having high neuroticism. Researchers followed these participants for six years, during which time 144 of them developed dementia. Although it is not easy to change someone's personality, ""The good news of our finding is that an active lifestyle -- having a rich social network and participating in physical, mental and social activities -- may buffer the negative effect of high neuroticism on dementia risk,"" Wang said. One in seven Americans age 71 and older, or about 3.4 million, have dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health. In this age-group, 2.4 million people have Alzheimer's disease, NIH research has shown. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic. Previous research has documented that personality factors may play a role in how people cope with dementia. This study is unique in that it looks at a combination of different lifestyle and personality traits, said Dr. Yaakov Stern, professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center, who was not involved with the study. Stern and colleagues have found that people with higher educational or occupational attainment, or who engage in leisure activities, appear less demented. They call this concept ""cognitive reserve,"" because these lifestyle factors seem to allow them to cope with the pathology of the disease better. That is, as the disease progresses in the brain, those who have a greater ""reserve"" do not show symptoms of Alzheimer's -- memory loss and impairment of day-to-day functions -- as quickly. Mounting evidence suggests that lifestyle factors also directly influence brain changes, he said. The Swedish study builds off the established idea in the field that stress actually harms the brain. The pathology of dementia appears about 10 to 15 years before a person actually develops Alzheimer's disease, Stern said. That means, just like a man with prostate cancer may not have any symptoms, a person's brain may have undergone changes that lead to Alzheimer's without visibly affecting a person's day-to-day life. Doctors can look for indications of the disease using positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A chemical called Pittsburgh Compound B is used in the imaging of brain tissues to find signatures of Alzheimer's -- namely, beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. ""The working idea is that if we can detect it before it's clinically expressed and stop it then, we can prevent people from developing the disease,"" Stern said.","Study: Less-stressed older individuals had lower risk of developing dementia .

"DOUGLASVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- Like many young girls, Jennifer Marnell always dreamed that one day she'd become famous. Jennifer Marnell once maxed out at 300 pounds. She lost 180 pounds and is now a fitness instructor. Bubbling with personality and quite the ham -- she was no stranger to performing. Marnell loved singing, dancing and acting in local plays while growing up on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia. Even though her family showered her with adoration and unconditional support -- Marnell was hiding something that she was afraid to share with anyone. Since the age of 8, she struggled with her weight. ""I was the only one in the whole family who was overweight,"" Marnell recalled. ""[They] were always supportive and told me I was beautiful ... I didn't realize how depressed I was because my family loved me no matter what."" But other people weren't so nice. Marnell says classmates and other people teased or ridiculed her about her weight. Instead of talking about her feelings -- she turned to food for comfort. As she ate to soothe her pain -- Marnell's weight spiraled out of control.  Watch more on Jennifer Marnell's journey » . ""It got out of control over the years because it became an addiction,"" said Marnell. ""Food didn't talk back to me and didn't tell me no ... I didn't know how to stop and listen to my body."" Working as a nanny at the age of 27, Marnell was 5-foot-tall and weighed 300 pounds. The wife and mother says a series of embarrassing moments such as not fitting into a restaurant booth, running out of breath while walking and lacking the energy to play ball or skate with her daughter -- took an emotional and physical toll on her health. But the final straw came during a trip to an amusement park with her family. ""We were at Six Flags waiting on a ride and we waited for an hour-and-a-half,"" said Marnell. ""When we got on, I couldn't latch the belts because I was too big and they had to ask me to get off."" Devastated by the incident, Marnell says she broke down in tears and had a heart-to-heart talk with herself. Afraid that she might die before the age of 30, she was tired of being a ""fat mom"" and wanted to set a good example for her daughter. After the mental pep-talk, Marnell started her weight loss journey by joining a gym. She started by exercising in the women's-only section and ate a low-fat, low-calorie diet. After a few months, she'd lost 50 pounds. The weight loss boosted her confidence and she decided to try a water aerobics class which was a lot less stressful on her bones and joints. Over the next two years, Marnell continued taking group fitness classes, hired a personal trainer to get past a plateau and eventually lost 180 pounds.  CNN I-Reporters share weight loss photos » . After reaching her goal weight of 120 pounds, she decided to start a new career as a fitness instructor and provides personal training advice on her Web site http://www.fitbyjen.com/. One of the most important lessons she's conquered is emotional eating. ""You've got to learn to talk through your problems instead of using food,"" Marnell says. ""An alcoholic can't just have one drink. I will never eat a Snickers bar because that is my one weakness ... the one thing I won't have."" The weight loss has also helped her realize another dream -- being in the limelight. In January, she was featured on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" and in People Magazine's ""Half Their Size"" issue and will appear on the game show ""Don't Forget the Lyrics"" with Wayne Brady. She's also touring the country as a spokesperson for Gold's Gym and has just inked a book deal to tell her weight-loss story. Marnell says all of the recent attention has been a bit overwhelming but she's enjoying every minute of her new career and life. ""It's made life more exciting,"" said Marnell. ""I still feel like the same person on the inside, I have the same heart. But the outside, it's just enhanced the inside even more."" What advice does she have for other people who want to lose weight? The toughest part of losing weight, according to Marnell, is staying mentally focused. She recommends taking ""baby steps,"" trying not to do everything at once or focus on how much you have to lose and joining an online support group. ""Learn to accept yourself for who you are,"" Marnell advises. ""It can be done ... it's not going to be easy -- but it can be done.""  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hope was 14 years old when her uncle raped her. Betty Makoni founded the Girl Child Network to help Zimbabwe's young sexual abuse victims. ""He trapped me to the ground and covered my mouth with his hand,"" said the 18-year-old from Zimbabwe. ""He threatened to kill me if I ever told anybody."" So, she kept quiet. ""After a while people around the villages started saying that I looked pregnant,"" she said. Hope was not only pregnant, but her uncle had infected her with HIV. Like many young girls in Zimbabwe, Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease. This so-called virgin myth, perpetuated by Zimbabwe's traditional healers, has led to the rape of hundreds of girls, according to UNICEF. Some of those victims are too young to walk, much less protect themselves. Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country's young girls from sexual abuse. And she's witnessed some of the worst cases of the myth in action. ""The youngest girl I ever came across was a day-old baby who was raped,"" said Makoni, 37. Through her Girl Child Network (GCN), Makoni has helped rescue 35,000 girls from abuse -- including Hope; thousands more have found an empowering community and a public forum in which to speak out. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""Ten girls per day report rape cases,"" she said. ""It means if we keep quiet, at least 3,600 girls per year may just be contracting HIV and AIDS."" Makoni's own tragic experiences fuel her fierce determination. ""I was raped when I was 6 years old,"" she recalled. Her attacker was a local shopkeeper. Makoni said her mother would not allow her to report the abuse. ""She said, 'Shh, we don't say that in public,' "" Makoni remembered. ""I had no shoulder to cry on."" Three years later, she witnessed her father murder her mother. In that moment, Makoni said she realized the potentially deadly consequence of a woman's silence. ""I told myself that no girl or woman will suffer the same again,"" she said. Believing an education would provide her the best opportunity and means to speak out, Makoni earned two university degrees and became a teacher. While teaching, she noticed that girls were dropping out of school at an alarming rate. She approached her students with an idea. ""I [said] to girls, 'Let's have our own space where we talk and find solutions,' "" Makoni said. Girl Child Network was born.  Watch Makoni help young girls find safety and empowerment in Zimbabwe » . By the end of the first year, there were 100 GCN clubs throughout Zimbabwe where girls could find support. Makoni said she was not surprised: ""Every woman and girl identified with the issues that we were raising,"" she said. In 2000, she quit her teaching job to volunteer with GCN full time. ""I decided to become an advocate because I walked my own journey to survival,"" she said. The following year Makoni successfully procured a piece of land and opened the organization's first empowerment village, designed to provide a haven for girls who have been abused. Girls are either rescued or referred to the village by social services, the police and the community. The healing begins as soon as a girl arrives. ""In the first 72 hours, a girl is provided with emergency medication, reinstatement in school, as well as counseling,"" said Makoni. It is important to her that the girls are in charge of their own healing. ""It gives them the confidence to transform from victims to leaders,"" she explained. The process helped Hope work through the times when she said ""I thought my life had come to end."" ""They offered all they could ... as I was in a traumatized state,"" she said. ""I really appreciate what [Betty Makoni] has done and is doing in my life."" Today, GCN has grown to 700 girls' clubs and three empowerment villages across Zimbabwe. An estimated 300,000 girls have received assistance. For those who were at greatest risk, Makoni believes that help was especially critical. ""If my organization didn't exist, the 35,000 girls I've saved from rape and abuse could have died by now,"" she said. But for Makoni, speaking out came with a high personal cost. In 2008, she was forced to flee her native country. ""I left Zimbabwe because my life was in danger as a result of my project being interpreted politically.""  Watch Makoni describe her reasons for leaving her homeland » . Today, she lives with her family in the United Kingdom. She still serves as executive director of her organization and shows no signs of slowing down. GCN has partnered with the DOVE project, a group based in Essex, England, that deals with domestic violence. ""We are now bringing the girls from a local community to the international scene,"" she said. Her efforts in Zimbabwe will also be highlighted in an upcoming documentary, Tapestries of Hope. Makoni says nothing will end her fight for the rights of women and girls. ""This is the job I have always wanted to do, because it gives me fulfillment. And in girls I see myself every day.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The bodies of three American contractors who died in a plane crash in Afghanistan earlier this month have been recovered, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Tuesday. The C-12 plane went down in the mountains of Nuristan province October 13, but the military withheld information about it until the recovery operation was complete, ISAF said in a statement. The crew were subcontractors working for Lockheed Martin, the company confirmed. A spokesman named two of them as Jeff Lehner, a former Air Force member working for Sierra Nevada, and Randolph Bergquist, a former Marine working for Avenge. They are not releasing the third name at the family's request. Thomas Casey of Lockheed Martin confirmed the third victim was the co-pilot and also worked for Avenge. The cause of the crash that killed them is not yet clear, but it is not thought to be enemy action, ISAF said. A helicopter sent to recover the remains October 17 itself made ""a hard landing"" that required the crew to be rescued, ISAF said.

"Ann Arbor, Michigan (CNN) -- Even among the hundreds of applications, this one stood out. Most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods. This writer's stories concerned the daily ordeals of a boy living with his family on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, and the horrific plight of a Rwandan girl whose mother is Tutsi and father Hutu. Not only did the applicant have what writers call ""material,"" he was blessed with an uncanny ear for human speech and the poetry to describe his characters' very unpoetic lives. I can still remember the young Kenyan boy watching his mother decant the glue she intends to sniff. The glue, the boy tells us, ""glowed warm and yellow in the dull light,"" and when his mother had poured enough, ""she cut the flow of the glue by tilting the tin up. The last stream of gum entering the bottle weakened and braided itself before tapering in midair like an icicle."" Still, this applicant gave us pause. The writer had so much to say, he seemed to be trying to channel a raging waterfall through the tiny funnels of two short stories. His use of punctuation was idiosyncratic, to say the least. And the applicant was a priest! Would the other students be willing to share their stories, rife as these tend to be with profanity, drugs and sex, if a clergyman was in the room? And would this particular clergyman understand what all great religious writers know -- that true literature doesn't spring from one's certainties about the universe, but rather from one's questions? That said, how could our students be inhibited by a classmate who didn't hesitate to describe a 12-year-old Kenyan prostitute being paid by rich white tourists to perform sexual acts with their monkey? As to the shapelessness of the applicant's prose and the eccentricity of his punctuation, anyone with this writer's gifts could be taught to structure his material and punctuate his characters' speech correctly. If I still felt apprehensive about having a priest in my workshop, that anxiety vanished when Uwem Akpan walked in the room. Rather than wear his clerical garb and collar, Uwem showed up in a blue and maize University of Michigan sweatshirt. With his wide, gap-toothed smile, wall-shaking laugh, disarming candor and gleeful giggle, he exuded magnetic charm. Nor was Uwem out of place for being the only Nigerian in his cohort. Despite what the judges of the Nobel Prize might say about American writers being too insular to compete with their European counterparts, this country's MFA programs provide one of the only spaces on the planet where writers of many races, religions, nationalities and sexual orientations can come together. Writers find common ground not through the homelands they once inhabited but the thematic questions with which they grapple. Early that first semester, I assigned a story by Philip Roth called ""Defender of the Faith,"" in which a Jewish sergeant who has witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps must decide whether to grant special favors to the Jewish recruits in his command or enforce strict impartiality. I didn't know whether Uwem would connect to Roth's quintessentially Jewish outlook. But the moment the discussion started, Uwem's hand shot up. ""This is the story of my continent!"" he declared. If Africans continued to put tribal allegiances above universal fairness, Uwem said, progress would remain unattainable. This abhorrence of tribalism is what makes Uwem so open-minded. Like most people who are comfortable in their own skins, he is wonderfully able to inhabit the skins of others. One semester, he audited a seminar on Holocaust literature. The professor had no idea who Uwem was, so she couldn't help but be surprised when he asked, ""Can you tell me, please, how is it that people can do such terrible things to one another?"" If anyone else had asked that question, the professor might have thought he was simpleminded. But she could tell that this mysterious stranger was asking his question in the most profound way, from the depths of his own experience. A few months later, Uwem accompanied me to my temple for the Jewish New Year. After sitting -- and standing -- for hours through the service, he commented that he had studied in the Bible how Jesus opened the scroll to read, but he had never quite understood how that worked, so it was beautiful for him to see how the Jews really did that. And he was happy to note what Catholicism had copied from Judaism. Just as Uwem opened his mind and heart to us, I opened my mind and heart to Uwem. An atheist with a degree in physics, I don't believe in prayer. And yet, when Uwem stopped by the evening before a frightening operation on my spine, I granted his request that he pray for my well-being. Startled by the warmth I felt flowing along my spine as Uwem held his hands above my head, I burst out crying. Of course, my colleagues and I never forgot why Uwem was in Ann Arbor, Michigan. During his two years in our program, all of us worked hard to help him develop his many gifts. But mine was the first workshop Uwem took, and I saw his stories at their rawest. As I waded through the reams of rough drafts he had given me, it occurred to me that I had been called upon to help the children of Africa the only way I could -- by helping Uwem to write their stories. We talked about the need to focus each story around a single character's conflict and a single thematic question rather than attempting to convey everything Uwem knew about all his characters. I also urged him to allow his young protagonists at least a chance for freedom or redemption. Yes, the children whose lives he wanted to depict were the victims of adults who abused, exploited and betrayed them. But even in a society in which a child can be prostituted to provide her family's food and pay her brother's school fees, the prostitute's brother might choose to decline that money, to leave the family, to walk away. Uwem listened attentively, but I wasn't sure that he believed what I was saying. I didn't see another version of his story about the street family in Nairobi for several months. When I did, the hairs at the back of my neck stood up. That second version of ""An Ex-Mas Feast"" was so powerful and finely polished that I asked Uwem if he would send it to the deputy fiction editor of The New Yorker, whom I had met a few weeks earlier when the magazine brought its college tour to Ann Arbor. Uwem hesitated -- I didn't know this, but he already had submitted an earlier version of the story, twice, to ""The Editor"" at The New Yorker -- but I kept nagging him until he sent the new version. The rest, as they say, is history. The magazine accepted Uwem's story for its fiction issue. Then, a year later, it published a revised version of the story about the half-Tutsi, half-Hutu Rwandan girl. In many ways, Uwem's success makes sense. Even when he was studying to be a priest, he gave up precious hours of sleep to stay up writing. He applied to an MFA program and got accepted. His teachers recognized his extraordinary potential and helped Uwem to achieve it. And yet, much of Uwem's success is inexplicable. In a world in which so little attention is paid to children's suffering, a world in which fewer and fewer publishing houses remain interested in acquiring literary fiction and independent bookstores, even in college towns such as Ann Arbor, are closing their doors, the editors at every major publishing house in New York competed for the privilege of publishing a book that might not sell many copies but had shaken them to the core. And Oprah ... how could Oprah, who had never selected a collection of stories for her book club, choose a collection like Uwem Akpan's, with its multilingual patois, complete absence of pathos or sentimentality and nearly unbearable-to-read violence toward children? Yet all of this came to pass. Oprah respected her audience enough to assume that if she was so deeply moved by Uwem's stories, they would be moved as well. In choosing ""Say You Are One of Them,"" Oprah brought to Uwem's cause the intelligence and heart of her many readers. That any of this happened at all, let alone in five short years, is a literary miracle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eileen Pollack.","Eileen Pollack: There was concern about Uwem Akpan's application to a writing program .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Interpol is chasing more than 200 leads on the potential identity of a pedophile suspected of molesting young boys, just one day after launching a global manhunt. Interpol has launched a global appeal to find this man, accused of abusing young boys. The organization, which facilitates global cooperation among police agencies, said its Web site logged 30 times more visitors than in an average day after it made its plea for the public's help Tuesday. Interpol is trying to locate a man who is pictured sexually abusing young boys in hundreds of images on the Internet. ""'The public's response has been very positive,"" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings unit, in a news release. ""The smallest piece of information from anywhere in the world could be crucial in identifying this man."" The man is featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of six and 10, Interpol said. The organization posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site. The pictures came to light in 2006, when Norwegian authorities discovered them in the possession of a man they arrested.  Watch a report on Interpol's man-hunt » . ""While these images were only discovered two years ago, we believe the photographs were taken between April 2000 and May 2001, so clearly this man will be older than he appears in the pictures,"" said Kvigne. Last October, Interpol disseminated pictures of another man whose face appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children. It dubbed its operation Vico, because the images were thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. Ten days later, Christopher Paul Neil -- a 32-year-old Canadian man who had been working as an English-language teacher in South Korea -- was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse. Following the success of that operation, the organization's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations.","NEW: Interpol chasing 200 new leads in global manhunt for serial pedophile .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The number of drug-related killings in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, so far this year has reached 1,647, surpassing the death toll for all of 2008, a city spokesman told CNN. Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in early September. A spate of killings since the weekend, including 12 on Tuesday, pushed this year's death toll higher than the 1,607 recorded murders for last year, spokesman Sergio Belmonte told CNN. Killings in Juarez, located across the border from El Paso, Texas, began to spike in early 2008, when the Sinaloa drug cartel began a turf war with the Juarez cartel. In response, President Felipe Calderon sent federal troops to patrol the city. About 7,500 troops will remain in Juarez at least for another six months at the mayor's request, officials said. The army presence has helped curb the violent daylight shootouts that damaged the city's image and threatened its economy, but killings and reprisals among street-level dealers continue to mount, Belmonte said. On Monday, 635 new police officers graduated from the police academy and joined the ranks of a force that had been thinned by about 700 in the city's effort to root out corrupt cops. The police department is now up to more than 2,600 officers, Belmonte said. Another 400 cadets are expected to join the force in October. Officials hope that the larger police force, together with investments in police equipment and a new crime-stoppers phone system, will turn things around for the city. More than 5,100 have been killed in drug-cartel violence across Mexico this year, according to a tally by the newspaper El Universal.","Killings since the weekend pushed 2009 death toll past 1,607 killed in 2008 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military hopes to kill or capture some 50 Afghan drug traffickers with financial ties to the Taliban in an effort to shut down one of the insurgency's biggest sources of revenue, a U.S. Senate report says. Afghan men smoke heroin in the city of Herat on August 7, 2009. The new plan is the first time the U.S. military has been directly involved in anti-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan, and commanders say it is an essential part of the overall plan to stabilize the country, which is under heavy Taliban influence. Until now the U.S. military has left the eradication programs to other U.S. agencies and the Afghan military, keeping its ""most wanted"" list to insurgent leaders tied to bomb making, weapons smuggling or facilitating foreign fighters into the country. ""The change is dramatic for a military that once ignored the drug trade flourishing in front of its eyes,"" according to the report. ""No longer are U.S. commanders arguing that going after the drug lords is not part of their mandate."" It does not name the 50 targets, but says they are on a list of 367 names of Taliban and other insurgents targeted by the U.S. military. ""Some"" of the 50 have already been apprehended or killed, according to a senior military official. The official would not quantify the amount further and would not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the issue. The yet-to-be released report was prepared by staff for members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A copy was provided to CNN. It is based on testimony by U.S. military officials to the committee. Bush-era efforts by the United States and the U.S.-trained Afghan Army to eliminate poppy farms did very little to solve the problem, with numerous farmers' crops flourishing while other farmers were left with no source of income and bitterness toward the Afghan government, the report concludes. It criticizes former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for failing to push forward on a military role in drug eradication even after being shown proof of the connection between the drug lords and the Taliban. The change in the U.S. military's approach to fighting the drug war came last fall after the United States told NATO members that the drug trade was a threat to NATO troops because there was a direct connection between it and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. ""There is what we call a nexus of insurgency. There's a very broad range of militant groups that are combined with the criminality, with the narco-trafficking system, with corruption, that form a threat and a challenge to the future of that great country,"" then-U.S. commander in Afghanistan Gen. David McKiernan told reporters at the Pentagon last October. But with a new approach to the war by the Obama administration, the United States has started attacking the drug problem head on. According to the report, this year U.S. and NATO combat forces started attacking militants, drug labs and buildings connected to insurgents with ties to drug lords for the first time since the start of the war in 2001. Referring to people tied to narcotics and militants, the report says, ""The military places no restrictions on the use of force with these selected targets, which means they can be killed or captured on the battlefield."" The Pentagon's spokesman said the effort is still focused on fighting terrorism. ""There is a well-established link [between] the drug trade and financing of the insurgency and terrorism,"" said spokesman Bryan Whitman. ""It's important to delineate that we target terrorists that are connected to the drug trade. ... Terrorist do interface with drug networks and we know they provide finance for the insurgency, and it's this nexus that creates the security and force-protection issues that make them a legitimate target."" A major U.S. Marine offensive against the Taliban was launched last month in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, home to the majority of the poppy farms and opium trade. The report says the Taliban make about $70 million a year on the drug trade. The report concedes that counter-narcotics alone will not win the war, but says slowing the flow of illicit money will play a crucial role in ""determining whether we can carve out the space required to provide the security and economic development necessary to bring a level of stability to Afghanistan.""","Report: U.S. military pursuing 50 Afghan drug traffickers tied to Taliban .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Army ground commanders in Afghanistan say they need help, fast. That's not a request for more troops, but a request from commanders who say the current camouflage uniform is not blending well in the diverse countryside. U.S. Army commanders in Afghanistan say the current uniform does not blend well in the countryside. In response, the Army later this month will field-test two new camouflage color schemes and patterns on about 1,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, where the terrain is extremely varied. Commanders have had problems there because of the numerous changes in environments a soldier can move in and out of in a short period of time -- from woodland to desert to alpine, and to rocky and snowy mountain tops. The current uniform, known as the Army Combat Uniform or ACU, has lighter shades of green and tan, which some commanders have complained does not blend well if soldiers need to stay motionless on a mission, as snipers or reconnaissance troops must. The effort by the Army was recently accelerated, according to Army officials, after U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, told the Army he had a number of complaints from soldiers in Afghanistan who said the current camouflage pattern was not effective in the mountainous regions. Two yet-to-be-identified battalions -- a battalion has about 500 troops -- will test the two patterns, with initial results being turned into Army researchers by the end of October. While deployed, all 1,000 soldiers will have their regularly issued ACUs. In addition, one battalion will also get one of the new camouflage uniforms with a test pattern known as ""MultiCam."" The pattern is made up of numerous blobs of white, brown, tan, black and greens for a more woodland look, and is already being worn by snipers and special operations forces. The other brigade will test a similar pattern to the ACU, called the Universal Cammo Pattern-Delta or ""UCP-Delta."" While the pattern is the same, a series of ""digitized"" blocks of green and tan, the test uniform adds what he Army calls ""coyote brown"" and a slight color darkening all around to the greens and tans. The look is also designed to blend in the woods. Both battalions will be based in eastern Afghanistan where the terrain is the most rugged and diverse, Army officials said. The Army hopes to have the field input and a decision on what pattern is best by the end of January 2010 and the fielding of the new uniform as early as June 2010. Troops will still keep the existing ACU, and commanders will be able to decide mission by mission what the soldiers should wear, according to Army officials. The testing is part of the Army's long-term development of a permanent alternative to the current ACU, according to Army officials.","Commanders say current uniform doesn't blend well in Afghanistan's countryside .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As a journalist, as a human being, the stories of the people around you stick with you. Whether it is in passing memory or in daily wonderment, they are in your mind and many in your heart, engrained forever. CNN's Atia Abawi, center, with Banafsha (denim jacket) and her siblings and mother. The first story I worked on for CNN in Afghanistan back in November, just as we were opening our new bureau in Kabul, was on a girl who attended a school for street kids called Aschiana. Aschiana, which means ""nest"" in Dari, was a place for the nearly 60,000 street kids in the capital city to escape from their terrible reality and get an education. There, we met Banafsha, an 11-year-old girl who along with her two younger sisters would beg on the streets for bread, feeding their family of eight. Her mother would stay home and take care of her baby brothers and their father, she told us, was a heroin addict. Banafsha was young in age but her eyes told of experiences that have taken her far beyond childhood. In our conversations, she spoke with candor and honesty, not allowing emotions to creep in. Until when, she told me that she prayed everyday for a change in her life.  Watch Abawi's first story on Banafsha » . ""I say, 'God take me out of this poverty and have my father go work so I can go to school,'"" she said, wiping away one lonely tear. The story received a tremendous response from viewers and readers after it was posted on CNN.com. An organization from the U.S. began to sponsor Banafsha, promising to provide for her. This was great to hear, but it didn't stop me from worrying. Did I bring her more trouble or was she going to be okay? Every time we would drive around the neighborhood, I would look for her to see if she was among the other street beggars. Were they suffering in the winter cold? Did they have enough food? About a week ago, I went to the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force with our cameraman Charlie Miller. As we were leaving, we met three little street kids, a sweet girl among them with a beautiful smile -- which made me think of Banafsha and her sisters. The sight of kids begging always breaks my heart because I know that their childhoods are forever stolen by poverty. I am also always scared to give them money because I remembered a story Banafsha told me about her little sister. She was given two dollars by an American, and when the American walked away, an older boy came and punched her 7-year-old little sister in the face, knocking her out. When she woke up, her money was gone. As we were driving away from those children and the smile on the girl's face, I shared the story with our driver and told him that I wished I knew how Banafsha was doing now. On our way home we decided to stop at a DVD shop, part of our limited entertainment living in Kabul. After making my selection, I walked out and I heard a beggar girl with a familiar smile on her face exclaim, ""You came over to our house!"" There was a girl next to her in a yellow dress also beaming with the same indistinguishable smile, lugging a bag of leftover pieces of bread over her tiny back.  Watch Abawi reunite with Banafsha and her family » . It was Banafsha's little sisters: 10-year-old Samira and 7-year-old Tamina. I was so excited to see them and even happier that they recognized me. But I was at the same time dejected that they were still on the streets. They told me that they go to school but they still beg on the streets. However, Banafsha is at home and no longer begging. We went home with them because I wanted to see Banafsha and her mother. On the way to their house in the middle of a Kabul graveyard, Samira told me that her dad left again three days ago and they have no clue where he is. As Samira went to go get her mother, who was nearby at their grandmother's home, her little brother called Banafsha for us. She came out of a little room in the backyard, used for the wintertime. It holds what is called a ""sandalee,"" a table heated by coal that is used by the more impoverished in Afghanistan to stay warm in the torturously cold winter. Banafsha looked drained, her eyes heavy with burden. I heard a baby crying from the room she just left, which had to be her little brother Ajmal. If it was true that she was not begging anymore I knew she was still carrying the weight of her family on her tiny shoulders. She was wearing a denim jacket and new dress. The family told me that the organization that has promised to help has been there twice so far, bringing Banafsha clothes and some cooking supplies for the family. They said they were grateful for the help Banafsha was getting but there were still difficulties. Banafsha was quiet and didn't talk much, but she had her rare moments when a smile would creep out. Those moments were like a glimmer of light in a dark room to me. The entire family had that same smile, but it was Banafsha's and her mother's that were the most infrequent. As we were about to leave, I asked about their health and the mother said everything was fine except for something on Banafsha's arm. She pulled up her daughter's sleeve and showed us a thick forming rash. Banafsha told us it kept growing and it was itchy. Charlie pulled out his still camera and took a picture of it. He planned on showing it to a medical friend in the city for treatment. I did not want to say goodbye, but I also did not want to intrude anymore than we had. That day, seeing them, re-energized me in a way that I could not explain. In Afghanistan, you see a lot of misery, in the city of Kabul alone your heart sinks at every turn. The poverty, the destruction, the hopelessness and the loss of dignity for survival, is everywhere. You are grateful for what you have and how lucky you are, but you know it is not fair. Those feelings continue to weigh on your heart and mind, and they can add up. Some times you are strong about it, other times you feel weak. And as much as it pains you, you know you are lucky to see their lives, you know you have benefited from these people and from this place -- in ways you may never understand why.","Abawi meets Banafsha while doing a story about a school for street kids .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A German man is facing federal charges in the United States on suspicion of trying to extort money from supermodel Cindy Crawford and her husband, using a photograph of the couple's then-7-year-old daughter, court documents said. Edis Kayalar is charged with one count of extortion in a criminal complaint filed Thursday, according to Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. The photo, apparently taken as a prank by their former nanny, shows the couple's daughter bound to a chair, court documents said. Kayalar was deported to Germany from the United States in September after he had repeated contacts with Crawford and her husband, business mogul Rande Gerber. However, the complaint against him alleges, he continued to demand money from them. Federal prosecutors are in contact with German authorities on the matter, Mrozek told CNN, but as of Thursday night Kayalar was not in custody. If convicted, Kayalar faces a maximum penalty of two years in federal prison. Kayalar first contacted Crawford and Gerber in July, according to the criminal complaint. He told Crawford, who answered the phone, that he had a photograph of their daughter and wanted to help them out because he is a ""good person,"" the documents said. Crawford then handed the telephone to her husband. Identifying himself as ""Brian,"" Kayalar told Gerber he had a photograph of their daughter in ""revealing clothing, bound to a chair and gagged,"" according to the complaint. He said he had stolen the photograph from the former nanny and that he wanted to return it because it ""bothered"" him and he felt it ""just wasn't right,"" the complaint said. He told Gerber he wanted to give up the photograph so it would not end up in the tabloids, according to the documents. Kayalar told Gerber he had met the former nanny at a bar about three months before, when the woman still worked for the couple, and that he had been at her apartment and gotten Crawford's number from the nanny's cellular phone while the nanny was sleeping, the complaint said. The couple notified the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In the affidavit, an FBI agent states that she reviewed the photograph, which depicts the girl, who has since turned 8, bound and gagged in a chair and wearing shorts and a T-shirt. The girl told her parents -- who did not know it had been taken -- that the former nanny took it as part of a ""cops and robbers"" game. Kayalar called again, arranging to meet Gerber at a bar in Venice, California, to return the photograph, the court documents said. He did not ask directly for money, but hinted that he was ""broke"" and would like a monetary reward for the return, according to the complaint. Gerber brought a sheriff's deputy to the meeting. During the meeting, Kayalar told Gerber he did not have the original image with him, saying he had left it with friends for ""security purposes,"" but showed him a copy he had saved on his cellular phone, according to the complaint. He told Gerber stole the photograph from the nanny's apartment along with a handwritten note saying, ""The baby sitter went crazy and tied everyone up and they need your help! Please."" Gerber and the deputy then got Kayalar to call and arrange to meet the former nanny with them. When the former nanny -- who was not identified in court documents -- saw Gerber with Kayalar, she ""became extremely upset and began to cry,"" the court documents said. She apologized to Gerber and told him the photograph had been taken as a prank, and that she initially had planned to put the photograph and the note on the front door of the couple's home ""in order to pull a prank on Crawford"" but had not done so. On the way back to the bar, Kayalar repeatedly asked Gerber for money, the complaint said, saying that ""he could get a lot of money from the tabloids for the photograph."" He said he would deliver the photograph to Gerber the following day. Gerber went to meet with Kayalar the next day in Malibu, later telling police he obtained a hard copy of the photograph from him and gave him $1,000 ""for his trouble,"" according to the court documents. But two days later, Gerber called police again, saying Kayalar called and demanded more money, saying he still had a copy of the photograph. During the Venice meeting, Kayalar told the sheriff's deputy he was a German citizen and that his true name was Edis Kayalar, the complaint said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found he was in the United States illegally, and he was arrested and deported. In November, Kayalar began calling the couple from Germany, however, saying he had no choice but to demand more money since they had ""gotten him deported,"" court documents said. He said he wanted $100,000 for not releasing or selling the photograph to the media. ""Kayalar stated that before, he had not committed any crime, but that now he was committing extortion,"" the complaint said. He provided them with German bank account information. Gerber asked for proof that he still had the picture, and shortly afterward received an e-mail with a copy of it. Authorities traced the computer used to send the e-mail to Stuttgart, Germany, the complaint said. Since then, Kayalar has made another attempt to obtain money from the couple, according to court documents, and Gerber stalled, saying he needed more time to get the money.","Edis Kayalar, of Germany, charged in U.S. with extortion .

"(CNN) -- Nikolai Valuev will face Ruslan Chagaev in their much-anticipated rematch for the WBA heavyweight title in Finland on May 30. Ruslan Chagaev (left) lands a powerful left-hander during his win over Nikolai Valuev two years ago. The bout, at Helsinki's Hartwall-Arena, will be the first-ever heavyweight contest on Finnish soil, and will see a pumped-up Valuev going all out to ""settle the score"" against the only man to defeat him in a 51-bout career. Chagaev twice pulled out of scheduled rematches with Valuev last summer due to injury problems, prompting the WBA to vacate the title. Uzbeki southpaw Chagaev has been listed as 'champion in recess' ever since and -- as a result -- has to fight Valuev by the end of June in order to determine the undisputed champion. Valuev reclaimed the vacant belt by defeating American John Ruiz in August and defended his title against Evander Holyfield in December. ""The day has come to settle the score,"" Valuev told a news conference. ""I have been waiting for two years to make amends. Only a victory over Chagaev can put my mind at rest."" Valuev bounced back with four wins on the spin following his loss to Chagaev in April 2007 but the Russian admits the only scalp that matters is that of the Uzbeki. ""I know everything there is to know about Chagaev,"" said Valuev. ""This is the fourth time I am actually preparing for a fight with him,"" he added, referring to the two postponed fights last year. ""Now is the time to end all this confusion. There will only be one WBA heavyweight champion after May 30 -- and that will be me.""","Nikolai Valuev will face Ruslan Chagaev for WBA heavyweight title next month .

"(CNN) -- A jury sentenced an Arkansas man to life in prison without parole for killing a television anchor, officials said Thursday. The Pulaski County, Arkansas, jury on Wednesday convicted Curtis Lavelle Vance, 29, of capital murder, residential burglary, rape and theft of property in the October 2008 slaying of Anne Pressly, 26. Pressly, the morning news anchor for CNN affiliate KATV, was found beaten and unconscious in her home. She died five days later. Vance's sentencing phase began after he was convicted Wednesday of capital murder, rape and burglary. Jurors were tasked with deciding whether the aggravating circumstances in favor of the death penalty outweighed the mitigating circumstances. ""Tonight, they have come back with a sentence, a sentence that they believe, and we share with them, is the harshest possible sentence for this gentleman going forward, where he will now spend the rest of his natural life in a 6-by-9 cell with nothing to think about but what he has done,"" said Guy Cannady, stepfather of the victim. ""It's not until he's carried out of Tucker Max in a pine box will he really meet his true judgment,"" Cannady  added, referring to Arkansas' Tucker Maximum Security Prison. He said he was not disappointed that Vance did not receive the death penalty. Prosecutor Larry Jegley said the jury gave Vance ""everything they could give him except the death penalty."" Asked if there were too many mitigating circumstances, Jegley said, ""I don't know. I can't speak for the jury. Cases like this, all you can do is put 'em in front of 12 good people and ask them to follow the evidence and do what their conscience demands."" Attempts by CNN to reach members of Vance's defense team were unsuccessful Wednesday and Thursday. ""There really aren't any winners tonight,"" Cannady said. ""Nothing that's been done here will ever bring Anne back. We'll never see her smile, we'll never hear her laugh, we'll never know the joy of her presence with us until we see her again in heaven."" Among the defense witnesses presented Thursday was Vance's mother, Jacqueline Vance Burnett, CNN affiliate KARK reported. Burnett cried on the stand as she spoke about her battle with crack addiction and admitted abusing her son when he was a child, including an incident when he was 7 years old and she slammed his head into a brick wall, the station said. A doctor testified earlier Thursday that Vance had told him school was easy for him before that incident, but difficult afterward. Both doctors said they believe Vance has frontal lobe damage to his brain as well as cognitive impairment, according to KARK. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA, however, and police said at the time of his arrest last year they were ""110 percent"" sure he was guilty. He had given several statements to police, including one saying he was at Pressly's home and another admitting to her murder. Defense attorney Steve Morley told CNN affiliate WREG as Vance's trial began earlier this month that such evidence presented an obstacle for the defense, but said he hoped jurors could be persuaded to spare his client's life. KARK reported that jurors heard recordings in which Vance apparently confessed to beating Pressly with a piece of wood. Pressly's mother, Patti Cannady, told NBC last year her daughter fought hard for her life, breaking her left hand in the process. ""I found my daughter beyond recognition, with every bone in her face broken, her nose broken, her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it,"" Cannady said. ""I actually thought that her throat had possibly been cut. Her entire skull had numerous fractures from which she suffered a massive stroke."" DNA evidence has also tied Vance to a rape in April 2008 in Marianna, Arkansas, about 90 miles east of Little Rock, police said in December. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Curtis Lavelle Vance, convicted in slaying of Anne Pressly, faced death penalty .

"London, England (CNN) -- Reports that Iran has sentenced a British embassy employee to four years in prison are ""deeply concerning,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday. Hossein Rassam ""is a hardworking embassy official"" who was ""doing work that was wholly within the boundaries of diplomatic work,"" Miliband said at a news conference in Brussels, Belgium. The reported sentence is ""wholly unjustified and represents further harassment of embassy staff for going about their normal and legitimate duties,"" Miliband had said earlier, in a statement issued Wednesday. Rassam is one of several British embassy employees arrested in the wake of Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the official results declaring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner. Iran accused Britain and the United States of fomenting the unrest. Rassam was put on trial in August. The European Union, France and the United Kingdom denounced the proceeding. Rassam's lawyer has not officially been informed of the embassy worker's sentence, and he does not know where Rassam is, he told Iranian media. Abdolsamad Khorramshahi told the Fars News Agency that the terms of Rassam's bail did not prevent him from leaving the country. He said Rassam had been in Iran recently, but he did not know his current whereabouts. He said he could not express an opinion on the verdict before the court officially informs him of it, which he said normally happens after it is issued. The European Union condemned the reported verdict as ""unjustified and harsh,"" and urged ""the Iranian authorities to overturn it swiftly,"" the Swedish presidency of the 27-nation bloc said in a statement Thursday. ""Any action against one EU country (a citizen or member of embassy staff) is considered an action against the entire EU, and will be treated accordingly,"" the statement said. France also condemned the sentencing of Rassam. Miliband said he understood the sentence could be appealed and urged ""the authorities to conduct this quickly and overturn this harsh sentence."" ""This will be seen as an attack against the entire diplomatic community in Iran,"" he said in a statement late Wednesday. The Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador to London, and Britain's envoy in Tehran spoke to Iran's deputy foreign minister, Miliband said.","European Union, France and the UK denounced the trial of Rassam .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""My One and Only"" begins with Renee Zellweger, playing a woman based on George Hamilton's mother Anne, discovering her husband with another woman. Renee Zellweger plays a woman based on George Hamilton's mother in ""My One and Only."" Despite the initial heartbreak, Anne puts on a happy face, and Zellweger gives life to a character who's determined to make the rest of her years comfortable and adventurous. Her husband's indiscretion is the catalyst that sends Anne on a cross-country quest to find a new husband in 1953 America. She pulls her two sons out of school in New York City and the trio set off on an adventure by car. The tale has its roots in actor George Hamilton's young life. The film takes a look at gender roles of the time and how women were perceived. Much of the film gets colored in by the characters and their ever-present emotions (though Zellweger's fabulous frocks add plenty of color on their own). Zellweger, who won an Oscar for ""Cold Mountain,"" spoke with CNN about ""My One And Only,"" George Hamilton and the way she believes she is perceived.  Watch Zellweger talk about playing Hamilton's mother » . CNN: What do you think of George Hamilton as a person now, knowing what he went through in his youth? Renee Zellweger: I think it's so fascinating. It was probably my favorite part of this experience, discovering that this was actually his life story. I mean, who knew? You have an idea about who a person is based on their public persona and the work that they've done. He's a spectacular actor, and his collection of parts that he's played and work that he's done is unbelievable. ... But to get to know him, he's so interesting. He's so clever, and he's very kind. Very kind. CNN: You're playing Hamilton's mother. Did he fill you in on what she was like? Zellweger: No. You know, that's what's so interesting about it. [Despite] being such a personal ... project that he worked on so closely with Merv Griffin for over a decade ... he didn't. He had great faith and he just kind of let us go, which was sort of unbelievable when you look back on it. It was really clear to me from what was on the page who she was. CNN: Did you like her? Zellweger: Very much. She's kind of doing the best she can, and she thought, oh everything's kind of a lark ... and things work out without your having to put your hands on it and make it happen. But she learns a different way and a more satisfying way to be involved in her own life, which is wonderful. So she sort of discovered that she could and gave herself permission to be in charge of herself. It was kind of a wonderful journey to watch. CNN: She was judged on her looks many times in the film. Have you faced similar situations, being judged on your looks and people not taking you seriously? Zellweger: Not in such an overt way. I'm not an actress who made her way based on physicality -- I think quite the opposite, in fact. I sort of disappear a little bit, with respect to my looks. I'm lucky. I'm not a standout, kind of knockout kind of girl that, you know, it's all about my great hair or something. But, in subtle ways, maybe. I mean, people presume to know you for something and respond to you accordingly, I'm sure. CNN: How was it stepping into the era of old Hollywood? Did you enjoy wearing the clothes from the early '50s? Zellweger: I loved it. I loved it. I had such a great time with it, and I brought a lot of my own things, actually. Things that have been given to me, things that I just would find while I'm traveling on the road but have no opportunity to wear. You know, junk store finds that I think are spectacular. We brought them in, spruced them up and made them costumes. It was really exciting; it was fun. CNN: Do you think you would have liked to work in that era? Zellweger: Oh, yes and no. Yes because the glamour of it all or the -- it feels like play to me. It's like playing dress-up all the time. And no because of the responsibility of having to maintain that immaculate presentation all the time would be exhausting. I think back on Marilyn Monroe putting those lashes on everyday, and I can't imagine, as I tie up my sneakers to go for a run. I cannot imagine that you're supposed to simultaneously look beautiful while you're going out to buy groceries. I just don't know that it would fit well with my personality. I don't know that I would succeed (laughs).","Renee Zellweger plays character based on George Hamilton's mother in new film .

"New York (CNN) -- CNN's Lou Dobbs stepped down from his controversial role as an advocacy anchor at the network at the end of his show Wednesday night, saying he plans to seek a more activist role. ""Over the past six months, it has become increasingly clear that strong winds of change have begun buffeting this country and affecting all of us, and some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem-solving as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day and to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible,"" Dobbs said during his 7 p.m. broadcast. Dobbs, 64, said he had discussed the issue with CNN President Jonathan Klein, who had agreed to a release from his contract ""that will enable me to pursue new opportunities."" In a written statement, Klein called Dobbs ""a valued founding member of the CNN family."" ""For decades, Lou fearlessly and tirelessly pursued some of the most important and complex stories of our time, often well ahead of the pack,"" Klein said. ""All of us will miss his appetite for big ideas, the megawatt smile and larger-than-life presence he brought to our newsroom, and we're grateful to have known and worked with him over the years. ""With characteristic forthrightness, Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere. We respect his decision and wish him, Debi [Dobbs' wife], and his family the very best."" Dobbs, who is the last of the 29-year-old network's original anchors, said he was considering ""a number of options and directions."" He cited the growth of the middle class, the creation of jobs, health care, immigration policy, the environment, climate change and the U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as ""the major issues of our time."" But, he said, ""Each of those issues is, in my opinion, informed by our capacity to demonstrate strong resilience of our now weakened capitalist economy and demonstrate the political will to overcome the lack of true representation in Washington, D.C. I believe these to be profoundly, critically important issues and I will continue to strive to deal honestly and straightforwardly with those issues in the future."" Read Dobbs' full statement about his departure from CNN . Those issues, he added, are defined in the public arena ""by partisanship and ideology rather than by rigorous, empirical forethought, analysis and discussion,"" and he vowed to work to change that. In an e-mail to CNN staff members, Klein described the parting as ""extremely amicable,"" and said Dobbs' replacement would be announced soon. Dobbs was with Cable News Network from its initial broadcasts in 1980, acting as chief economics correspondent and host of the business program ""Moneyline."" His coverage of the 1987 stock market crash won him the George Foster Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. That was one of many awards he received while at CNN, including an Emmy for Lifetime Achievement that he received from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 2005. Dobbs left the network in 1999 to found SPACE.com, a Web site devoted to space-related subjects. He returned to the network in 2001 as anchor and managing editor of CNN's Moneyline News Hour, which became Lou Dobbs Tonight. He also acted as lead business news anchor for CNN/U.S. and CNNfn, the forerunner of CNNMoney. During his second stint at CNN, Dobbs positioned himself as ""tough, relentless, independent,"" lashing out at what he described as the deficiencies and ""partisan nonsense"" of both major political parties, and injecting advocacy journalism into his coverage of topics ranging from free trade to immigration. His no-holds-barred, sometimes acerbic style brought him a loyal following, but also attracted controversy both to him and to the network, especially over the subject of illegal immigrants. Dobbs will continue as anchor of The Lou Dobbs Show, a daily radio show that began in March 2008 and is distributed to more than 160 stations nationwide by United Stations Radio Networks Inc.","Dobbs, 64, said President Jonathan Klein agreed to release him from his contract .

"Washington (CNN) -- Army Secretary John McHugh ordered a new investigation into poor record keeping and other problems at Arlington National Cemetery even as a separate investigation ended without an absolute answer to who is buried in a grave marked ""Unknown."" ""As the final resting place of our nation's heroes, any questions about the integrity or accountability of its operations should be examined in a manner befitting their service and sacrifice,"" McHugh said in a statement after signing the order directing the Army's Inspector General to begin an investigation into allegations regarding cemetery operations. The Army IG is already in the middle of an investigation ordered by the previous secretary of the Army to review management of the cemetery. In recent years, the cemetery -- where President Kennedy and thousands of fallen U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are buried -- has had a number of embarrassing problems. In 2008, the cemetery discovered that workers inadvertently buried cremated remains at a grave site already in use. Those remains were moved to another grave site. In 2003, as workers were digging a grave for a new burial, they discovered a casket already buried there. There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who. Only recently, after a report by a journalist at Salon.com, did the Army take action on the problem. Over the summer, the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads ""Unknown."" As McHugh ordered the new investigation, the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery. That investigation focused on the discovery of the ""Unknown"" grave. A spokesman for the Military District of Washington, which conducted the review, said ""Cemetery records, the MDW investigation, and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife, who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site, were instead buried in adjacent graves."" A DNA test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened, but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed. The MDW said the Army will abide by the family's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife's grave. One of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery. Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials, up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years. During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent. Currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records. Arlington, which sits on a hill across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial, has been the final resting place for America's military heroes since the Civil War, when the Union seized the estate from the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. McHugh hopes this new investigation will ""ensure America's confidence in the operation of its most hallowed ground.""","Army Secretary John McHugh orders inquiry into poor record keeping .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles has converted his 38-year-old Aston Martin to run on biofuel made from surplus wine, his office revealed Tuesday. Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on a visit to a whiskey distillery in Northern Ireland last month. The car was a 21st birthday present from Queen Elizabeth, and the prince has converted it to run on 100 percent bioethanol as a way to reduce his carbon emissions, his office, Clarence House, said. The prince has also converted his other cars -- several Jaguars, an Audi and a Range Rover -- to run on 100 percent biodiesel fuel made from used cooking oil, his office added. Details of the prince's biofuel use were made public Monday in his household's 2008 Annual Review, which details the prince's income and activities over the past year. The report says Charles and his household reduced their carbon footprint by 18 percent last year after switching to green electricity supplies and reducing their travel-related emissions. Charles, 59, has a strong interest in environmental issues and rural affairs. He is active in environmental charities, and his food company, Duchy Originals, uses ingredients produced at his organic farm in Cornwall, southwestern England. The biofuels are converted and provided by Green Fuels Limited, a British company that previously provided biodiesel to power the royal train, Clarence House said. The wine used for the bioethanol comes from current vintage that remains after English wine producers reach the EU limit for annual wine production, a spokesman for Green Fuels said. The prince uses wine from a vineyard close to his Highgrove Estate, the spokesman said.","Prince Charles' office reveals his car runs on biofuel made from surplus wine .

"(CNN) -- Richard Blystone was CNN's senior correspondent in Europe throughout 1989, witnessing and reporting on the momentous events of that year from the first protests in the communist Eastern Bloc to the fall of the Berlin Wall and revolution in Romania. CNN's Richard Blystone reports from the former Iron Curtain in 1990. The following year Blystone traveled the length of the former Iron Curtain to report on the new Europe emerging from its shadow. Here he recalls how the the divided continent had simply become the only reality that most people knew. It was there. Like the stop sign on the street or the wastebasket in the corner of the living room. Like a long, long overcast day. Just there. Growing up in America the Cold War, the East-West confrontation and the prospect of Mutually Assured Destruction were so prosaic you never really thought much about them. You couldn't remember anything different. The situation seemed as immutable as the profile of the mountain tops or the patterns of stars in the night sky. And then, when I was 53, in the length of a football season, it was gone. If you're reading this online, chances are you don't remember and can't ever know what it was like in the days before the collapse of communism. There was ""Duck and Cover,"" a jingly film that showed little American children what to do in the event of nuclear attack. In later years, the black humor. Tom Lehrer's line about ""someone will set the spark off and we will all be blown away."" Nothing to get excited about. If you were male, the U.S. draft loomed ahead, promising to take anything from six months to four years from your civilian life. Maybe more than that if you were in the Korea or Vietnam age group. During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, I was flying back and forth over the North Atlantic in a Navy patrol plane for 15 hours a day, not knowing what the hell was going on, trying not to dwell on the orders that could send us on a one-way mining trip to Murmansk Harbor if the balloon went up. For Germans and others along the line that divided Europe, the symbols of the threat of war were still harder to ignore. In Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 Soviet troops had helped crush efforts to loosen Moscow's grip. But ignore them they did. ""We couldn't think about the wall, so we didn't,"" said the mayor of a West German village standing right on the border, when we talked to him in 1990. ""The bushes had eyes,"" West German border guard Ernst Wackernagel told us, describing the creepy job of patrolling a few yards from the binoculars and guns of their East German counterparts. Very few of the people we taxpayers paid to know about such things had any idea how close the collapse was. A couple of years before, the former West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt had advised me tartly to quit asking whether Germany would ever be reunited. Not in his lifetime or mine, he said. When it came, we were all surprised we hadn't seen it coming. The Poles and Hungarians had been levering into chinks in the wall for years. The rulers of the Eastern Bloc were largely aged, ossified, inflexible and corrupt, and those who served them were all that plus scared. Their system was beyond repair. Along came Mikhail Gorbachev, the first Soviet leader born after the Russian revolution, who saw things as they were and was tired of pouring money into a clapped-out old car. He became a hero to young people in the East. Near the end of August, activists from East and West had celebrated a ""Pan European Picnic"" on the now-neutered border between Hungary and Austria. A few weeks later, the rush was on. CNN poured resources into the story. I was there, and will always be glad that I was. Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria. And finally, at the end of the year, poor tortured, abused Romania threw off the system in what I found the most emotionally charged days of the whole upheaval. But I was never satisfied with the way the West received it all. We had become used to instant gratification, and this was an example. The drama was over, the commercials came on, and world was supposed to live happily ever after. And it didn't. The whole experience made me realize that liberty is not a thing. It is a way of life. If you don't practice it, you don't have it. A couple of months later, three of us made a journey along the line to check on what was happening. We called it the Iron Curtain Odyssey. But that's another story...","""Iron Curtain"" dividing Europe felt permanent to those who grew up after WWII .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Yue Minjun acknowledges that ""Execution,"" inspired by the bloody Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, is the most politically sensitive of his work. A section of Yue Minjun's ""Execution,"" which the artist shows how human conflict is worth laughing at . But while Tiananmen served as the catalyst, the oil painting should not be seen as depicting what happened at Tiananmen, the Beijing-based artist said this week through a translator in a phone interview. Billed by Sotheby's as ""among the most historically important paintings of the Chinese avant-garde ever to appear at auction,"" ""Execution"" had been tucked away from sight until now. Its owner bought it from a gallery in Hong Kong a decade ago under condition that the painting not be shown in public because of its subject matter, according to Sotheby's. On Friday, it went on auction in London, a highlight in a contemporary arts sale that also included Jean-Michel Basquiat's ""Untitled (Head),"" Mark Rothko's ""Untitled (Blue Divided by Blue)"", Andy Warhol's ""Jackie,"" Francis Bacon's ""Studies of Isabel Rawsthorne,"" and Damien Hirst's ""Adenosine."" ""Execution"" would become the most expensive work of Chinese contemporary art at auction, selling for 2.9 million British pounds ($5.9 million). It eclipsed Yue's previous record, set in June when his ""The Pope"" sold for nearly 2.15 million British pounds ($4.37 million). The sale of ""Execution"" also comes on the same week another Yue piece, ""The Massacre at Chios,"" sold for nearly $4.1 million at a Sotheby's auction of contemporary Chinese art in Hong Kong. Stretching across ""Execution"" is a long red building, suggesting Tiananmen's gate outside the Forbidden City. Is the painting of Tiananmen? ""I want the audience not to think of one thing or one place or one event,"" he said from his Beijing home. ""The whole world's the background."" The red building, he explains, is simply something that's familiar to him as a Chinese artist. ""As I said, the viewer should not link this painting to Tiananmen. But Tiananmen is the catalyst for conceiving of this painting."" The background may make people think of Tiananmen because he is a Chinese artist. ""But it should not be,"" he said. Yue painted ""Execution"" in a month -- in 1995. However, ""it took me quite a long time for me to put the idea together."" The big picture, he said, ""it's on the whole world's human conflict that is worth laughing about."" Drawing references to Francisco de Goya's ""The Third of May, 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid"" and Edouard Manet's ""The Execution of the Emperor Maximilien of Mexico,"" the painting depicts a mock execution. Manet, it must be pointed out, modeled his painting after Goya's; and Yue's ""Execution"" mirrors both of those -- but with his trademark grinning clones, all likenesses of Yue himself. And the men in the position of being shot are shown in their underwear. ""People feel freedom, most themselves, at home in their underpants,"" Yue said. And whereas in Goya's painting, the man's hands are up in resistance, the men's hands in ""Execution"" are down. ""They are not fearing death,"" Yue said. ""The laughs illustrate my deep feelings,"" he said. The viewer will feel happiness but also fear toward the future and the unknown, a universal sentiment, he said. ""One might be very happy now but always unsure of what's going to happen next. ""I think Chinese and the world have similar feelings in this respect,"" he said. As for the main figures that dominate the right-half of the painting, they assume the position of holding the guns, but without the guns themselves. ""In my painting, they're pretending to hold guns, as if playing a game."" The man on the far right, holding one hand to his chest and another by his waist, is a direct reference to the man on the far right-hand side of Manet's painting: In that, he is cocking a gun. Yue disagrees with the notion that his paintings are a veiled criticism of his government or of Chinese society, and he does not believe that this work will bring him trouble. ""I think the painting expresses my feelings. It's not a criticism,"" he said, describing himself as not having strong political leanings. ""I was trying to express my confusion over what I see."" The world has similar problems, he said. Yue said he does not agree with being tagged a ""Cynical Realist,"" a term coined by leading art critic Li Xianting to describe China's post-Tiananmen generation of disillusioned artists. At the same time, he doesn't concern himself about what people call him, he said. That his painting has political undertones is inevitable, he said. ""I cannot recall any event that has shaped my political views, but politics is everywhere in Chinese life, like the meal you eat every day,"" he said. Of China, he said, ""I think it is full of hope, but there are a lot of difficulties, too. China has a long cultural history and also faces a lot of problems right now. Right now, people are not satisfied, but we can find our way out."" Yue sold ""Execution"" to Hong Kong art dealer Manfred Schoeni shortly after painting it. ""It sold for about $5,000,"" Yue said. ""Probably not any cent would come back to me,"" he said of the millions his paintings now garner at auctions. Now 45, Yue said he learned about other artists through reading books after 1978, when China had begun to open itself up under new leader Deng Xiaoping's ""Open Door policy."" The decade-long Cultural Revolution that had preceded made reading books an impossibility. And what is the meaning behind the cloned figures that bear his likeness in all his paintings? ""Because I want to be famous.""","NEW: ""Execution"" sold for $5.9 million, a record for contemporary Chinese art .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In these cash-strapped times, you might well wonder why governments around the world continue to pour millions of dollars in to their respective space programs. Space exploration has produced a host of medical benefits including the ingestible thermometer pill. But one of the very important by-products of space exploration has been the adaptation and invention of medical equipment and technologies which are making individual lives better and in many cases saving them. Most people are familiar with temper foam -- perhaps the most famous of NASA's many medical spinoffs -- which started life protecting astronauts' posteriors in the 1960s and is now used in a host of products from mattresses to athletic shoes. It is surprising to note how many aspects of space exploration have played a part in helping scientists improve the health of nations. Who would have thought that analysing fluid flow around a Space Shuttle engine would help create a tiny heart pump? Or that a water purification device for astronauts could help patients suffering from kidney disease.

"(CNN) -- An explosion that critically injured the chairman of the Arkansas Medical Board on Wednesday was caused by a bomb, police said. Dr. Trent Pierce was injured outside his home Wednesday, authorities and local media say. Dr. Trent Pierce was wounded when the car blew up in front of his West Memphis, Arkansas, home, authorities said. Earlier, police told CNN affiliate WREG that they did not believe foul play was involved. Pierce, a family practitioner who specializes in asthma, was flown to a Memphis, Tennessee, hospital in extremely critical condition, the station reported, citing police. The blast occurred at about 8 a.m. as Pierce got into the car, affiliate WMC-TV reported. Aerial footage from the scene showed the white SUV with its hood blown up and its front end extensively damaged. Medical board spokeswoman Peggy Cryer said the board heard Pierce was flown to the hospital but had no definite information beyond that. ""We do not know enough to give any kind of statement,"" she said. Callers to Pierce's office received an answering machine message saying the office is closed, but the call repeatedly disconnected during the recording, preventing messages from being left. Doris Davis, who works in an eye doctor's office next door, said Pierce's office staff is swamped trying to deal with patients who arrived for their appointments. FBI spokesman Jason Pack said agents were en route to the scene, along with personnel from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The FBI is assisting local authorities in their investigation, he said. West Memphis, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, are separated by the Mississippi River. Pierce was described as a pillar of the community in West Memphis, a small town of about 30,000 people. Davis said Pierce is well-liked, active in his church and is married with two adult children. She said the FBI was at her office and interviewed her boss, Dr. Eddie Bryant. Bryant is a close friend of Pierce's and went to medical school with him, Davis said. CNN's Kathleen Shahriari contributed to this report.","NEW: Police say bomb placed in doctor's car .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal ended the Paris Masters run of defending champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Friday to help fellow-Spaniard Fernando Verdasco book his spot at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Tsonga needed to retain his title to deny Verdasco a place at the prestigious eight-man tournament later this month, but found Nadal far too consistent and fell to a 7-5 7-5 quarterfinal defeat. The world number two struggled in his first two matches, saving five match points against Nicolas Almagro before edging out Tommy Robredo, but his form was much improved on Friday. Tsonga dominated much of the first set with his blistering groundstrokes but could not take advantage of five break points and gradually Nadal took the sting out of his opponent before breaking in the 11th game. The second set took on a similar pattern, although the errors were more frequent from the home favorite and Nadal again broke at 5-5 thanks to a poor game from Tsonga. The 23-year-old confidently served out for victory and will now face third seed Novak Djokovic in a superb semifinal showdown on Saturday. Djokovic was a 6-4 1-6 6-3 winner against Robin Soderling, who would needed to reach the final in Bercy to have a chance of reaching the London finals. The Swede dominated the second set and created 14 break points on his opponent's serve during the match, but took only three of them. Serb Djokovic admitted he was not at his best and was relieved to reach the last four after a fifth successive victory over Soderling. He told Sky Sports: ""I'm very pleased to go through, it was a big struggle for me. Mostly I was fighting myself. In the second set I was not moving well and I was letting him control the match but in the end I managed to hold the nerves and focus."" Nadal and Djokovic have met 19 times, with the Spaniard holding a clear lead at 14-5. However, Djokovic won their last encounter in Cincinnati in August for the loss of only five games.","Rafael Nadal beats holder Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach Paris Masters semifinals .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao greeted U.S. President Barack Obama in China's capital on Tuesday, with trade and the thorny issue of North Korea expected to be on their agenda. The U.S. delegation was met by an honor guard at the Great Hall of the People, and Obama shook hands with Hu and other top Chinese officials before the two leaders went behind closed doors. It is their fifth meeting in the past year, and they made no public statements beforehand but are to issue a joint statement after their talks. The United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year, while China is a major purchaser of the U.S. Treasury bonds that finance America's budget deficit. Facing a global economic recession, Washington and Beijing are in ""a mutual hostage situation,"" former Bush administration China analyst Victor Cha said. ""China needs to purchase these Treasuries in order to maintain a strong dollar. Otherwise, the value of their foreign currency holdings goes down dramatically,"" Cha told CNN. ""We need China in order to finance a lot of the deficit spending we're doing now. It's very much intertwined in a way that two countries in the history of international relations have not been intertwined."" China is also an important player in the diplomatic showdowns over nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and holds one of five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. China is North Korea's closest ally and has played a key role in the six-party talks aimed at convincing Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday found 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the United States, with two-thirds considering it a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies. The survey also found 51 percent of the U.S. public consider China a military threat, with 47 percent disagreeing. That 4-point margin is within the poll's 4.5 percent sampling error. But Obama told students at a town hall-style meeting in Shanghai that the two nations don't have to be at odds with each other. ""Our relationship has not been without disagreement and difficulty, but the notion that we must be adversaries is not predestined,"" Obama said. But he said there are certain core principles that all people must share -- including equal rights for everyone, a government that reflects the will of the people, open commerce, free access to information, and the rule of law. ""We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation, but we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation,"" he told the gathering. The issue of human rights has often been a sticking point between Beijing and Washington. China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities, keeps tight reins on the media and censors the Internet. Obama told the students that he is against censorship and is a believer in the free flow of information, calling it a ""source of strength"" in a democracy, despite the sting that sometimes comes with it. He told the students he welcomes a strong China, saying there are very few global challenges -- specifically referring to climate change -- that can't be solved if the United States and China work together. The town hall meeting was shown locally on Shanghai's Phoenix TV, but it was not broadcast nationally on any of China's state-run networks. The Xinhua news agency posted a translated running transcript of the event on its Web site. The United States also streamed the forum live on WhiteHouse.gov. Chinese censors did not block the event to those with Internet access. The final stop of Obama's trek is Seoul, where he will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and deliver a speech to U.S. troops at Osan Air Base. Obama is on an eight-day journey that is taking him to Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea. He'll return to the United States on Friday. The president left for China from Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum. He met on the sidelines with world leaders, including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.","NEW: Obama to hold formal talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in U.S. custody, and urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed, according to court documents. Defense Secretary Robert Gates notified the high court late Friday that he was issuing an order to block the release. The photos have been at the center of a years-long lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. Congress last month gave the Obama administration specific authority to prevent any release of the 44 photos. Afterward, Gates signed a certificate of authorization, or order, to prevent the photos' release, saying their disclosure would endanger U.S. troops serving abroad. The order covers all photographs taken of people captured or detained in overseas military operations between September 11, 2001, the day of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and January 22, 2009, shortly after President Obama took office. The Pentagon initially was set to release the images of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU. But Obama and the Justice Department objected to the court-ordered release, reversing an earlier executive decision. Obama had initially agreed to the release, but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it. The ACLU criticized the administration's about-face, saying it ""makes a mockery"" of Obama's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability, and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners. A homeland security appropriations bill passed October 29 by Congress and signed by the president grants the Department of Defense authority to withhold the photographs. The images were gathered as part of a military investigation into allegations that detainees held in Afghanistan and Iraq were tortured and physically abused. According to the government legal brief filed with the high court, several of the photos show ""soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees."" Other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions. Military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images. The photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of Muslim men held at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2008 that the photos must be released. The president later said that doing so ""would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq."" Newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor had served on that appeals court until August, but was not involved in that particular case. The high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the ACLU appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military. The justices will now probably wait to hear from the ACLU over Gates' order before deciding whether to take the case. The Senate in May voted for the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act, which would limit the reach of the Freedom of Information Act request in this instance. The House adopted a similar provision in October. Other photos could be released under the earlier appeals court ruling. The case is Department of Defense v. ACLU (09-160). Separately, the administration also urged the high court to dismiss a pending lawsuit by several Guantanamo Bay detainees, over their claims of torture and religious discrimination. A brief was filed by the Justice Department late Friday, the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case. Four British men, all Muslims and former detainees at the military prison at the Navy base in Cuba, had sued onetime Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials, saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law. A federal appeals court had dismissed the lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims. But in June 2008, the Supreme Court allowed Guantanamo prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court, and the justices in December urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the British detainees. In the government filing, Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called ""new rights"" to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting. The high court, she noted, had previously told lower courts ""to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation."" The case is Rasul v. Myers (09-227).","Documents show Pentagon urging Supreme Court to dismiss ruling ordering photos' release .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Egyptians took part Monday in the funeral of Marwa Sherbini, an Egyptian woman who was stabbed to death last week in the German city of Dresden in a crime believed to be racially motivated. Egyptians take part in the funeral of Marwa Sherbini, who was murdered in Germany last week. Sherbini, 33, was stabbed to death Wednesday in a courtroom as she prepared to give testimony against a German man of Russian descent whom she had sued for insult and abuse. The man, identified in German media as Alex A., 28, was convicted of calling Sherbini, who wore a headscarf, ""terrorist,"" ""bitch"" and ""Islamist"" when she asked him him to leave a swing for her 3-year-old son Mustafa during an August 2008 visit to a children's park. He was fined and appealed the ruling. The two were in court Wednesday for that appeal when Alex A. attacked, pulling out a knife and stabbing Sherbini 18 times. He also stabbed her husband three times and attacked another person. According to Arab media, police officers tried to intervene to end the fight, and a number of shots were fired. One hit the husband, who fell unconscious and is currently in intensive care in the hospital of Dresden University. Sherbini was three months pregnant at the time of her death. Hundreds attended Sherbini's funeral in Alexandria, Egypt, her hometown, among them government officials, including Egyptian Manpower Minister Aisha Abdel Hadi and Telecommunications Minister Tariq Kamel, Egyptian media reported. Many shouted hostile slogans against Germany and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to take a firm stand on the incident. Egypt's grand mufti, Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, demanded the severest punishment to be issued against Alex A. Berlin witnessed angry protests on Saturday, when hundreds of Arabs and Muslims demonstrated after a funeral prayer that called her killing an outrageous racist murder against Muslims. In a phone call with Al Arabiya, Marwa's brother, Tariq Sherbini, said, ""Extremism has no religion. My sister was killed simply because she wore the veil. This incident clearly shows that extremism is not limited to one religion or another and it is not exclusively carried out by Muslims."" ""We are only asking for a fair punishment,"" he said, adding that his sister was not a radical. ""She was a religious woman who prayed and wore her headscarf, but she was killed because of her belief."" Anger about Sherbini's death smoldered online, as Twitterers and bloggers pushed the cause. ""She is a victim of hatred and racism,"" tweeted Ghada Essawy, among many other Arab twitters and bloggers. Essawy called Sherbini ""the martyr of the veil."" Various videos circulated on YouTube calling on Egypt to take action and urging Germany to address what their makers saw as a new wave of hatred against Arabs and Muslims in its community. One video showed various pictures of a young happy Marwa saying that ""The woman stood up for her rights and she was killed. May God bless her."" The English font in the video presentation asked ""when will Egypt cares for its citizens' rights inside Egypt and abroad."" Sherbini and her husband moved to Dresden in 2003, after the husband received a grant to study genetic engineering in the renowned Max Planck Institute. He was scheduled to present his Ph.D. thesis in the coming days. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Sherbini killed in courtroom as she prepared to give testimony against man .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- We were scheduled to speak with Steve Martin just after his sound check for a concert in Los Angeles to benefit the city's public libraries. We pulled into the parking structure 45 minutes early when my cell phone rang. It was Martin's publicist. Steve Martin has been playing the banjo for decades. His new album is a collection of bluegrass tunes. ""Hey, where are you?"" she asked urgently. ""We're in the garage,"" I replied. ""Can you get up here quickly? He's ready."" A musician ready early? There goes his street cred. Interviewing Martin can be like an awkward first date. Like many comedians, he's polite, but he sometimes struggles to make eye contact, gives monosyllabic answers and leaves the impression that he wants to be anywhere but talking to you. But when the subject is his new album, ""The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo,"" he's chatty, enthusiastic and engaged. On the CD, the comic/actor/novelist/playwright/musician shows off his picking skills as well as his ability to craft witty bluegrass songs with titles such as ""Hoedown at Alice's,"" ""Wally on the Run"" and ""Late for School."" It's been his passion for 45 of his 63 years. This past weekend, the ultimate Hollywood hyphenate made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry. ""The Crow"" has received more than respectable reviews, but that's not surprising, given Martin's uncanny ability to excel in whatever he does -- except maybe idle chitchat. The following is an edited version of the interview: . CNN: People know you as a versatile artist, but now it's about the banjo and your bluegrass album, ""The Crow: New Songs for the Five-String Banjo."" Steve Martin: I did a lot of things when I first started out. In order to be in show business, I juggled, I did magic tricks, cards tricks and I played the banjo. CNN: You've been playing it for 45 years, right? Martin: Yes, I have. It's a long time, and I remember when I was going through a particularly difficult time of learning, I'd go, ""Well, if I just stick with it, one day I'll be saying, 'I've been playing for 40 years.' "" CNN: Picking up the banjo might seem likely if you grew up in the Appalachians -- maybe Kentucky or somewhere down South. But you grew up in Garden Grove, California. This is the O.C. Martin: There was a lot of musical activity in Orange County in the 1960s. There were the Dillards, and Doc Watson would come by, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, all these different players. I also had this friend, John McEuen, in high school, and he played, and he actually produced this album now -- 45 years later. [McEuen is a founding member of country-bluegrass group, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.] . CNN: Isn't John the one who taught you how to do an ""Open D"" tuning on the banjo? Martin: Yes, he did. CNN: See, I read your CD liner notes. [Both laugh] There's a cute little story in there about taking a photo of the three things you love most -- your wife, your dog and the banjo. Martin: Well, we all love more things that that. I just happened to take a photo, and there was my wife, my dog and my banjo, all in the same shot -- and I thought, ""Oh, that's like a family portrait right there."" CNN: Sounds like your next Christmas card to me. ... You're playing a benefit for the Los Angeles Public Library. Martin: As you can see, it's sold out [gestures to an empty room]. ... You know, it's also a little bit sneaky, because doing a benefit takes the pressure off having to be so great. This is the first time I've really played banjo live as a concert -- ever. I mean, I've played a song or two, but I've never done a dozen songs, so I hope people will be forgiving. CNN: Are you nervous at all? Martin: I'm a little nervous. CNN: Really? A little butterfly or two? I'm surprised. Martin: No butterflies, but it's very different playing music onstage if you're not used to it. I mean, doing comedy is one thing. I used to get nervous on that, but I was very practiced. I'm as practiced as I can be. I'm performing with the Steep Canyon Rangers, a group I met in North Carolina. They're a renowned bluegrass group -- young men who play and sing really, really well. I'm lucky to have them. CNN: You've won three Grammys and an Emmy. You do all kinds of things -- a modern-day Renaissance man. Martin: Well, in a strange way, I don't have a job, so I have a lot of time on my hands. When I do work, it might be very concentrated, and it might be months where you're not really doing anything except maybe playing the banjo or writing something. You know, there's a lot of time in the day if you're not working 9 to 5. CNN: Writing books, writing plays, doing comedy, writing music? Martin: It's been a long life. CNN: So have you decided whether you're going to embark on a full-fledged tour? Martin: I'm kind of seeing if -- you know, I haven't really performed for a long, long time -- 30 years live onstage. You know, I've done things like host the Oscars and things like that. But it's a little different. You have to get comfortable, you really have to know what you're doing, and it has to be almost boring to you to be able to do it well. You have to be so confident. I need to get some shows under my belt just to feel really good about it. CNN: They always say comedians are the least confident people in the entertainment industry. Do you feel like you're not confident? Martin: No, I feel confident, but I know what they mean because when you tell a joke, it might last six seconds, and then you have to tell another joke. But a song lasts three minutes, and then you have another song for three minutes and you've killed six minutes. In that time, a comedian does 360 jokes. Might not be the right math but anyway. CNN: When you guest-hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in January, you performed one of the songs on your new album -- which you immediately made available on the Web. Martin: It was an exclusive release on Amazon because I knew I was doing ""SNL,"" and I wanted the record to be available, and the only way you could get it available that quickly was electronically. And now it's out on Rounder in a more normal release now. CNN: Are you a big iPod guy who downloads stuff constantly? Martin: I do, a lot. I find a lot of songs that way. I use the Internet a lot to find music. I always download it legally -- especially my own songs. [Laughs] I think it's very important to keep that honor among yourselves. CNN: Who do you find a lot of your fans are musically? Are they people who have followed your career from the early days of ""SNL""? Martin: I honestly don't know. It's too new. I don't know if there are any fans. I know that the record sold really well on Amazon, but you know there's a bluegrass audience for bluegrass music, and there's probably an audience that wants to see, ""OK, let's see if this idiot can play."" CNN: Can you? Martin: We'll see tonight. [Laughs] I do have a record out.","Steve Martin's new album is not comedy but features bluegrass music .

"(CNN) -- A proposal to house federal prisoners, including some detainees from Guantanamo Bay, in a largely vacant maximum-security prison would be an economic boost to struggling northern Illinois, state officials said Sunday. ""This is something that is very good for our state, it's good for our economy, it's good for public safety,"" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn told reporters. Officials from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Prisons will visit the Thomson Correctional Center on Monday, the officials said. Quinn's office on Saturday said the officials would see whether the ""virtually vacant, state-of-the-art facility"" in Thomson, about 150 miles west of Chicago, could be of use to the Bureau of Prisons. If it is, the governor and other officials said Sunday, it could provide up to 2,000 jobs and up to $1 billion in federal money to the area. And Dick Durbin, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said he believes the proposal provides a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" for his state's residents. ""There are other states that want to take these jobs,"" Sen. Durbin said. ""We've got to win this competition."" Under the proposal, he said, federal officials have said fewer than 100 detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba would be housed in the 1,600-bed facility. They would be in a wing under the control of the Department of Defense, while the Bureau of Prisons would assume responsibility for the rest of the facility. The United States is asking other countries to house some of the Guantanamo detainees when the prison is closed, said Durbin, the Senate majority whip. But those countries are asking why America is not housing some of the inmates itself, he said, and use of the Thomson facility would demonstrate to them that the United States is willing to shoulder some of the responsibility. An Obama administration official said Saturday that as part of the conversion at Thomson, the Bureau of Prisons and Defense Department would enhance security to exceed those of the nation's only supermax prison -- the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. No person has ever escaped from the prison. The Thomson proposal, first reported Saturday by the Chicago Tribune, triggered immediate concern from critics. U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, whose district covers suburban Chicago, circulated a letter addressed to President Obama to Illinois leaders Saturday, opposing the possible transfer of detainees and saying that housing them in Thomson would turn metropolitan Chicago into ""ground zero for Jihadist terrorist plots, recruitment and radicalization."" As home to Chicago's Willis (formerly Sears) Tower -- the nation's tallest building -- ""we should not invite al Qaeda to make Illinois its number one target,"" says Kirk, who is running for the same Senate seat once held by Obama. Durbin on Sunday pointed to the federal maximum-security prison in Marion, Illinois, which he said already houses 35 people convicted of terrorism, along with members of Colombian drug gangs and Mexican drug cartels -- ""some of the most dangerous people in America."" ""They're all in our prisons, and they're all held safely,"" he said. And ""things haven't changed in Marion, Illinois."" Those housed in the Marion penitentiary include Ali al-Marri, who is serving a sentence of eight years and four months after pleading guilty in federal court to conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda. The Thomson prison was built in 2001 and sat empty for five years because the state lacked the resources to open it. Despite being built as a maximum-security facility, it houses 144 minimum-security male inmates, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections Web site. ""After living in limbo for eight years, we're open to any and all alternatives for Thomson,"" said Jerry ""Duke"" Hebeler, Thomson village mayor. He estimated that the move would cut the county's unemployment in half. ""I'd never chase jobs if I thought it would jeopardize the security and safety of my neighbors and friends,"" Hebeler said. Quinn said that during the inspection Monday, ""We want to answer any and all questions that the federal authorities have."" The Obama administration has vowed to close the Guantanamo facility, but acknowledges it is unlikely to happen by its self-imposed January 22, 2010, deadline. About 215 men are held there. They include alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who officials said Friday will be transferred to New York to go on trial in civilian court. The federal prison system houses approximately 340 inmates linked to international terrorism, including more than 200 tied to international incidents, another Obama official said. CNN's Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Proposal calls for using maximum-security prison in struggling northern Illinois .

"(CNN) -- A suspect was arrested Wednesday night in connection with the death of Little Rock, Arkansas, television news anchor Anne Pressly, police said. Anne Pressly, 26, was a popular morning news anchor at KATV-TV in Little Rock, Arkansas. Curtis Lavell Vance, 28, was arrested at a Little Rock home soon after investigators named him as a suspect. CNN affiliate KATV-TV in Little Rock reported that police were tipped off to Vance's location after investigators publicly identified him as a suspect at a news conference. ""We went there and he's in custody,"" said Lt. Terry Hastings, a police spokesman. Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas did not say what led investigators to name Vance as a suspect, but he said it was ""a very, very solid case due to solid detective work."" Pressly, 26, was found beaten at her home in October. The KATV anchor had been beaten around her face and upper body. She died days later in a hospital. She had been sedated and unable to speak to police or family members, and suffered massive brain swelling, her family said. Her condition had seemed to be improving shortly before her death. Police earlier said Pressly might have been the victim of a burglary because her purse was missing. Her credit card was used at a gas station sometime this week, police said. Pressly's left hand was broken, possibly as she tried to fight off her attacker. During the investigation, detectives combed the area around Pressly's home in the Heights neighborhood, a mix of bungalows and mansions near the Little Rock Country Club. A $30,000 reward, established by KATV, was offered to anyone providing information leading to the arrest of Pressly's attacker.","NEW: Little Rock, Arkansas, police chief says he has ""solid case"" against suspect .

"(CNN) -- A militia killed a ranger in a Democratic Republic of Congo park where authorities are trying to protect endangered gorillas threatened by civil war, the park said. Safari Kakule, a ranger at Virunga National Park, was killed Thursday in an attack by a militia, the park says. A Mai Mai militia attacked a ranger station in the Virunga National Park on Thursday night and killed ranger Safari Kakule, according to a news release from the park. Another ranger was wounded in the attack, and one of the rebels was captured, the statement said. The Mai Mai are community-based militias without specific political objectives, often involved in banditry and looting, the park statement said. ""It is not clear why the group attacked [the ranger station] but the attack went on for several hours during Thursday night and the rangers were heavily outnumbered,"" the statement said. Seven rangers were at the station when the attack happened, according to the statement. That area of the park is home to an isolated population of 18 endangered Eastern Lowland gorillas. The park also is home to about 200 of the world's estimated 700 mountain gorillas, the park has said. The Virunga park's Web site said 15 additional rangers have been sent to the park, where they will be ""strengthening the position, which we cannot abandon."" ""Because of the arrest that the rangers were able to make, we have several leads on the perpetrators of the attack, who will be brought to justice,"" a statement on the Web site said. More than 100 rangers returned to the park's gorilla sector late last year after hundreds of rangers fled the area in 2007 because of fighting involving ethnic Tutsi rebels, the Congolese army and militias. Rangers and scientists were out of contact with the park's endangered gorillas for more than a year until rangers returned late last year, the park said.","One ranger killed, another injured in attack by militia, park says .

"(Wired)  -- Google is set to become your new phone company, perhaps reducing your phone bill to zilch in the process. Seriously. Google has bought Gizmo5, an online phone company that is akin to Skype  but based on open protocols and with a lot fewer users. TechCrunch, which broke the news on Monday, reported that Google spent $30 million on the company. Google announced the Gizmo acquisition on Thursday afternoon Pacific Time. Gizmo5's founder Michael Robertson, a brash serial entrepreneur, will become an Adviser to Google Voice. It's a potent recipe -- take Gizmo5's open standards-based online calling system. Add to it the new ability to route calls on Google's massive network of cheap fiber. Toss in Google Voice's free phone number, which will ring your mobile phone, your home phone and your Gizmo5 client on your laptop. ÿþ . Meanwhile you can use Gizmo5 to make ultracheap outgoing calls to domestic and international phone numbers, and free calls to Skype, Google Talk, Yahoo and AIM users. You could make and receive calls that bypass the per-minute billing on your smartphone. Then layer on deluxe phone services like free SMS, voicemail transcription, customized call routing, free conference calls and voicemails sent as recordings to your e-mail account, and you have a phone service that competes with Skype, landlines and the Internet telephone offerings from Vonage and cable companies. That's not just pie in-the-sky dreaming. Ask longtime VOIP watcher and consultant Andy Abramson, who introduced the idea of integrating Gizmo5 and Grand Central (now Google Voice), long before Google bought either. ""Google is now the the uncommon carrier,"" Abramson said, punning on the iconic 7-UP commercials and the phrase ""common carrier."" That refers to phone companies that operate on the traditional publicly switched network -- a status that gives them benefits and obligations. ""If AT&T is Coca-Cola, Google is now 7-UP,"" Abramson added. ""All of a sudden you have something that offers more than Skype,"" Abramson said, saying the combo could now put Google in competition with phone and cable companies, IP ""telephony"" (VOIP) companies and Vonage. ""But now you can do everything with Google and pay nothing and have a platform where engineers can build new things."" In fact, Gizmo5 offered a rogue version of that service for $6 a month until last week. On November 2, Gizmo5 abruptly canceled the two-month old ""residential service,"" which paired the free phone number available through Google Voice with Gizmo's Internet calling service to provide the equivalent of a home-phone replacement like Vonage. Now, that service has been wiped off the Internet and, more intriguingly, Google's cache of the page disappeared the day after the acquisition was reported. For $6 a month, Gizmo5 residential users got 300 minutes a month of outbound calling anywhere in the United States, unlimited incoming calls on their home computers or even home phones (using a broadband-to-phone network conversion box) and E911 service (which means 911 calls work like landlines calls do, once you register your home address). It's not too surprising that offer got taken down. For one Google is already trying to steer clear of U.S. regulators by making it clear that Google Voice isn't a replacement for a home phone since you have to have phone service from some other company to use it. You can forward calls from a Google Voice number to your Gizmo5 number, but you must have a mobile or landline number as well. Google doesn't say it, but clearly it hopes that restriction will keep the service from incurring the common carrier obligations attached to the regular phone system (PSTN), and the 911 and wiretapping requirements that apply to Internet telephony and to traditional copper wire phones. AT&T has already tried to sic federal regulators on Google Voice because Google is blocking outgoing calls to a handful of shady calling services  mostly free conference-calling services that exploit federal rules that let rural phone companies charge high fees to connect calls to rural areas.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Peru will turn over to Chilean authorities all evidence into allegations that a Peruvian air force officer was spying for the neighboring country, Peruvian President Alan Garcia said Monday. Garcia ordered his foreign minister and justice department to hand over all details of the investigation so Chile could ""give the corresponding explanations,"" he said in a televised address. The alleged spying by Chile, Garcia declared, was the result of fear and an inferiority complex by the Chileans. He added that Peru will not let the incident become a full-blown crisis between the two nations. The suspect, Victor Ariza Mendoza, remained imprisoned at a maximum security facility north of Lima, authorities said. Two other Peruvian air force officers, accused of being collaborators, also were detained, as were two Chilean military officers who were alleged accomplices, CNN en Español reported. Mendoza could face charges of treason, which carry a minimum sentence of 25 years. News of the spy case caused Garcia to prematurely end a trip to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Garcia and his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, had planned to attend a workshop Saturday with other world leaders, but the Peruvian leader canceled his agenda to return to Lima. Chile has dismissed the espionage allegations. ""Chile has nothing to do with this case,"" Chilean Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez told reporters after a meeting with his nation's ambassador to Peru. According to local media, the suspected spy once worked at the Peruvian Embassy in Chile and sold secrets to the Chileans since 2002, CNN en Español reported. Chile and Peru have a history of animosity, having fought in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883. Hard feelings linger to this day. The two nations nearly came to war in 1975, when left-wing Peruvian leader Juan Velasco, who was backed by Cuba, wanted to invade Chile, which was led by right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The invasion was called off, and Velasco was deposed in a coup a short while later. Tensions rose again when Peru discovered a Chilean spy mission, but war was averted. More recently, tensions between the two South American nations flared in December after the revelation that Peru's top army general said at a party that Chileans in Peru would be sent back in coffins or body bags. Both countries said they would work to heal relations after the general's comments. Journalist Gisu Guerra contributed to this report.","Peruvian president says Chile spied on neighbor because of inferiority complex .

"(CNN) -- Two Pennsylvania teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a Mexican immigrant dead last July. Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak's joint trial began in late April in Schuykill County, Pennsylvania. Brandon Piekarsky, 17, was sentenced to 6 to 23 months, and Derrick Donchak, 19, received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25-year-old Luis Ramirez. Judge William Baldwin ordered the two to report to Schuylkill County jail on July 19 to begin serving their sentences. An all-white jury convicted the two former high school football players of misdemeanor simple assault at trial last month and acquitted them of felony counts, including aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension -- charges that carried lengthier sentences. In fashioning his sentence, Baldwin acknowledged the severity of the attack, which left Ramirez on life support for two days before he died, but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury's verdict. ""This wasn't any fight, this was a group of young athletes ganging up on one person. That's not a street fight,"" Baldwin said, referring to the defense team's characterization of the confrontation as a ""street fight."" ""You picked out a guy who wasn't one of you and beat the pulp out of him,"" Baldwin said. The incident divided the small, rural mining town of Shenandoah into camps for and against the boys as it became a flashpoint for racial tensions across the country. After the verdict, Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending that the Department of Justice pursue civil rights charges. ""The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted, beaten and killed because he was Mexican,"" Rendell said. ""Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance."" During Wednesday's sentencing, Baldwin said he was surprised that Rendell had chosen to speak out on the case and told the court that his sentence was not affected by the governor's letter. Fred Fanelli, Piekarsky's lawyer, said he felt the sentence was harsh, given the circumstances. The judge could have sentenced the teens to probation under Pennsylvania's sentencing guidelines. ""I'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months. Having said that, I'm glad we finally have some finality with this case,"" Fanelli told CNN affiliate WBRE after the sentencing. Baldwin heard from several teachers, coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation. They urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults. Ramirez's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants' supporters. ""He was my one and only love, and they took him away from me, and they took my children's father,"" Crystal Dillman said. ""Now I have to live without my best friend and love of my life."" The court also heard a prepared statement from Ramirez's mother, Elisa Zavala, who lives in Guanajuato, Mexico. ""I'm not the same person as before, now I feel a great emptiness within my heart,"" she wrote. ""There are moments in which I'm alone and I ask myself: What do I do now that I don't have my son? I feel that without him, I am no one."" The judge also tacked on extra days to each boy's sentence for consuming alcohol earlier in the evening. For providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight, Donchak was also convicted of corrupting minors. Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third-degree murder. Prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol-fueled brawl, which occurred on a residential street in Shenandoah the evening of July 12. Prosecutors alleged that a group of teens, which included Piekarsky and Donchak, baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking, hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant. After the fight broke up, witnesses said Ramirez came back at the teens, who beat him so severely that, according to a medical testimony, brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital. Jurors heard from several teens who witnessed the incident but did not participate, as well as one teen who pleaded guilty in juvenile court and another whose case is being handled in federal court. The testimony painted a picture of confusion, with several inconsistencies as to who did what. Defense lawyers argued that Ramirez's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias. They also suggested that Ramirez was responsible for triggering the second confrontation. Advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences, and called on the Department of Justice to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants. ""The meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress,"" said Gladys Limon, staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Citing FBI statistics, Limon said that hate crimes against Latinos have risen 40 percent in the last five years and called on Congress to strengthen hate crime laws. ""The failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the Ramirez family, but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future,"" she said. Richard Cohen, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the case had troubling implications in the wider context of race relations nationwide. ""Since the year 2000, we've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country, to a record 926 by our latest count,"" he said. ""The increase has been fueled by the same factor responsible for the rise in the anti-Latino hate crimes -- a backlash against the changing demographics of our country, a backlash fueled by politicians trolling for votes and pundits looking for ratings.""

"(CNN) -- The media has been abuzz since former Sen. and Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards admitted to an extramarital affair. Cubby Squires met John Edwards in 2007. He said news of the affair makes Edwards' political career ""nonexistent."" Edwards told ABC News' ""Nightline"" on Friday that he had an affair with 42-year-old Rielle Hunter. The affair began in 2006 after Hunter was hired to make documentary videos for Edwards' presidential campaign. The scandal was a hot topic in the news, including among iReport contributors. ""I took it really personally,"" said Cubby Squires of Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I always thought John Edwards was different from the typical politician."" Squires said there has been nonstop coverage of Edwards' affair in Charlotte. ""It just makes his political career nonexistent,"" he said. ""I really don't think he can get into politics again."" Mike Daly of Santa Barbara, California, said he sympathizes with Edwards. Daly, who lost his wife to breast cancer six years ago, noted that Edwards had been facing a great deal: the loss of his child, a failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and wife Elizabeth's diagnosis with cancer. ""These are real hard hits and perhaps he's crumbling,"" Daly said. iReport.com: Read Daly's opinions . Many iReporters questioned why the Edwards scandal deserves so much media attention. Carroll Byrd of Richmond, Virginia, described it as a ""nonstory,"" adding that Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain deserves the same level of scrutiny of his sexual relations. ""[Edwards] is not a candidate for office now,"" said Byrd, a supporter of the former senator from North Carolina. ""I think something that happened two years ago should be a private matter between him and his wife."" Read below to see a sampling of responses from iReport.com users, some of which have been edited for length and clarity: . iReporter jd1rymal: Good grief. ... He has an affair. Terrible. The shame, the agony of it all. I'm not talking about his moment(s) of weakness, but the blood in the water that the media are feeding on as if they were sharks. Get over it! Shellyta: No, I am not surprised by a powerful man having an affair. At least twice a year we hear about one of those. What amazes me is how in the world someone thinks that they can get away with something like this without thinking about the consequences. kardolfin: It is disappointing to hear that Edwards had an affair, but it's not the end of the world. He isn't the first person to do it and I'm sure he won't be the last. It is just a big deal because he was in the presidential race and that it is obviously a negative thing. I am disappointed in Edwards, but I don't think he is a bad person and I don't think it will destroy him. captain1944: Obama is in Hawaii, McCain is, as usual, taking the weekend off, and the Olympics are on. The media needs something to fill up airtime. Now CNN, please, this does not really need to be a 24/7 story. cgigante: I still believe in John Edwards' message. He was a true progressive candidate with a shot at winning, and it's a shame he'll now be sidelined over an indiscretion like this. Sure, it's no good that he was dishonest in his personal life, but I don't see how it has any bearing on his plans for economic equality and justice in the United States. JanaSagan: This affair in no way affects or concerns anyone other than the three adults involved. This should not even be in the news. We have no right to judge him or anyone else in matters of love. It is not a crime to fall out of love with one person and into love with another. Love is beyond our control. No one knows what causes love to begin or end. If we are trying to crucify him for this because of our moral Christian values, then we should also not cast stones on him or judge him. Leave him and his family alone so they can sort this out in peace and dignity. thebridge: From my perspective, John Edwards' affair does not diminish his capabilities or enhance his lack of capabilities as a leader or public representative or any other job other than being a husband. However wrong or immoral we may find cheating (and lying about cheating), the truth is that it does not necessarily reflect the other roles individuals have to fill. A great mother could also be a cheater or a great judge could lust after women 50 years his junior. That said, I think John Edwards is the same John Edwards -- politically -- that we knew before his affair hit the news.","Former Sen. John Edwards admits to an extramarital affair .

"(Sunset) -- '""I had such a crush on him when I was a kid,"" says my friend Didi Linburn, pigtails peeking out from beneath her pink ski helmet rather than the wool pompom hat she wore as a kid. I peer into the tiny ski shop at the Alta Peruvian Lodge and catch a glimpse of a cute guy in glasses behind the counter. ""No idea how old he is,"" she says, ""but I've seen him here every winter since I was 15."" Didi and Jeff Linburn on the slopes . Twenty-two years later, and Didi and her teenage crush are still here? I've yet to even take a run down the powder white slopes, but I already sense that Alta, Utah, just might be as special as everyone says it is -- including my self-proclaimed ""Altaholic"" husband. Tired of not getting an invite to his annual ""guys' trip,"" and admittedly jealous about the other love in his life, I decided to tag along on Didi's annual father-daughter jaunt. And finally experience for myself this almighty Alta -- with just seven lifts (and not much else) spread across 2,200 acres of heart-pumping hikes and narrow chutes, chest-deep powder, and total lack of pretension. Skis slung over our shoulders, we walk out the weathered wooden door of the lodge, taking in a deep breath of fresh -- albeit thin -- mountain air. I'm instantly happy to be here at 10,550 feet, on leased U.S. Forest Service land at the resolutely un-corporate resort, where faded one-pieces outnumber Bogner jackets, chairlifts seat at most four across, and five no-frills lodges, scattered up Little Cottonwood Canyon, sleep 1,200 skiers, tops. Skiers. Not shoppers. Not ski bunnies. Sunset.com: Plan your trip to Alta . And, above all, not snowboarders. As the mountain motto goes, Alta is for skiers. During my stay, I see it flaunted on banners, baseball caps, bumper stickers. Alta is, after all, one of just three resorts left in the country that ban boarders, since Taos Ski Valley opened its slopes to all in March. Geared up, Didi, her dad, and I creep along in a bar-less triple chair, surrounded by nothing save blue sky and the towering peaks of the Wasatch Range. ""Same as it was in the '60s,"" says Geoff Linburn, who first came to Alta from California in search of what he'd heard was the best snow in the West. Back then, lift tickets cost $8, and there were only five slowly moving chairlifts, but apart from building a couple more and raising ticket prices to a reasonable $64, Alta remains Alta. Didi's dad smiles. ""Still the best snow in the West."" A whopping 500 inches annually of light-as-a-feather powder -- and I can't wait to try it. But that will take some effort. Without a convenient tram to Alta's best terrain, the limited number of skiers allowed uphill work for every turn with an almost perverse pleasure. As a typically lazy, play-it-safe sort of skier, I'm intimidated. Is this really worth it? We hop off the Sugarloaf chair and onto a big ""dump"" (a record-setting blessing of snow) and join the parade of people inching their way, single file, up, up, up, and gliding precariously, over, over, over, only to climb again. Is this really worth it? I think to myself, sweating in the snow. I contemplate taking off my skis, but then I look up. ""Aw, it's a bootpacker!"" one guy yells at another fellow who's stomping with his skis on his shoulders rather than suffering the steep sidestep with everyone else. I press on, inspired by the unspoken camaraderie on the traverse toward Devil's Castle -- a wide-open bowl and depository of powder -- and the shared anticipation among strangers bound by a passion for Alta's almost guaranteed fresh tracks. Still, exhausted -- okay, panting really -- I stop and watch as the hard-core hikers keep stomping; my heart is pounding. I look downhill at the almost untouched powder and decide I've had enough hiking. Who needs the untouched stuff? Time to ski. After a blissful day on the slopes, the return to the Peruvian lodge is a comedown. The guest rooms remind me of my college dorm. There are shared bathrooms and a Ping-Pong table but no TVs. Still, the Peruvian, like all of Alta's lodges, has a 75 percent return rate. Sunset.com: Top 10 ski resorts . I'm honestly baffled, but by the end of dinner -- a slippers-acceptable, family-style affair, where a wine collector wearing turquoise sweatpants shares rare bottles he brought from home and our table swaps stories like old friend -- I start to understand. But, unlike most of the longtime guests, who remain fiercely loyal to ""their"" lodge, never venturing steps away to check out another, I'm curious and leave Didi a few nights later for Alta's Rustler Lodge, where things are a tad more civilized (read: pricey). Now I have a television and my own bathroom, and reservations are taken for the window-walled dining room, where the next morning, I overhear a waiter bellow ""Welcome back!"" to guest Roger Urban, who has been staying here since his bachelor days. He and his wife -- looking very '80s (like the lodge) in their matching rainbow-striped rugbys -- fuel up at the breakfast buffet, while their teenage daughter, Alexandra, heads out for a lesson with the same instructor she's always had. Meanwhile, I finish my eggs alone and realize that I miss the chaos of the Peruvian's hostel-like atmosphere. I slip on my skis and hop the rope tow to meet Didi for another day on the slopes. Alta never changes . From the chatter around the lift line, it's clear that it's not just the powder that draws people to Alta -- it's also the people themselves. Old college buddies, moms and sons, widows who used to come with their husbands ... everyone returns without question. Likewise, all the locals I meet say they'd intended to come out for a season and do the ski-bum thing. But before they knew it, 10, 20, 30 years had passed -- and they're still here. ""Alta just swallows you up,"" says Craig Dillon, Didi's ski shop crush, who, it turns out, is 41 and has lived here half his life. And so, because people never leave Alta, it's only natural that they grow old here. Not in the typical, canasta-by-the-pool way of growing old. Rather, Alta is like a real-life ""Cocoon,"" where the mountain is the fountain of youth. Senior passes start at age 80. Didi and I return to the Sugarloaf chair and ride up with an 86-year-old couple. ""Skiing is only getting easier!"" the husband says, beaming. ""Free tickets!"" says his wife. Inspired, I make a mental note to be just like them in 50 years. As we climb, once again, toward Devil's Castle, a father whizzes by with a tiny skier bouncing on his shoulders. ""Daddy? Are we at Devil's Castle yet?"" He hikes as far as possible, plops his daughter in knee-deep powder, and off she goes: a 4-year-old making fresh tracks. I watch, dumbfounded. And determined. I decide to hike out as far as I can. I want those fresh tracks, and this time I'm willing to work for them. Heart racing, legs aching, I reach the end of the ridge. I rest for a moment and then dip in. Flying solo through feet of untouched powder, carving near-perfect turns, snow spraying like the pros, I realize that I'm floating. This is it. This is why I've come to Alta. Sunset.com: Top 10 hotels for nature lovers . Later that evening, lounging around the Peruvian lobby after dinner -- with Scrabble, impromptu sing-alongs, nothing to face tomorrow but more fresh snow -- I get the feeling I'm continuing a tradition at risk of being lost forever to the fast-paced, froufrou world beyond Little Cottonwood Canyon. ""Everything changes in your life ... so much,"" reflects Leslie Johnson, who's been coming here every winter since 1982.

"New York (CNN) -- When US Airways Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River and all of its 150 passengers and five crew members were safely rescued in January, the landing of the airplane by pilot Chesley Sullenberger was quickly proclaimed the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" and dominated national news for days. A pilot who virtually grew up in airplane cockpits, writer William Langewiesche set out to analyze what happened in the five-minute flight of US Airways 1549, which lost power in both engines when it collided with a flock of Canada geese. His conclusion after writing a new book ""Fly by Wire"" -- there was no miracle. ""I'm sure Mr. Sullenberger himself wouldn't have used that word,"" Langewiesche said in an interview with CNN. ""There was no miracle. There was extremely skillful flying going on and skillful engineering in the background. You can include the flight attendants and the passengers. ... There was a lot of altruism, kind of a bravery, soberness. They were not hysterical, and there was no stampeding. ""Many good things happened, but they all related to the individual strength of the people involved. That includes [Bernard] Ziegler [the designer of the aircraft], Sullenberger, [co-pilot Jeffrey] Skiles and Patrick Harten, the air traffic controller -- he was as good as it gets, offering alternatives, the backing off of alternatives, staying cool."" Langewiesche, international editor for Vanity Fair and author of six other books, was drawn to the story because it allowed him to use it as a window to tell the tale of the aircraft, the Airbus A320, a controversial plane built with digital controls that rein in pilots who exceed safe flying limits. ""Within the limits of physics and structural science,"" Langewiesche writes, ""Ziegler and his colleagues identified the wrinkles of conventional handling and mostly ironed them out. The result in the A320 is the product of a genius -- an airplane that is ... exquisitely wrought, a delight to handle, and extraordinarily easy to fly."" It also allowed Langewiesche to describe the economic squeeze that has affected pilots as airlines have come under tremendous pressure to lower fares and reduce costs. Just one example described in the book -- Sullenberger had seen his salary cut 40 percent and his retirement pension destroyed through airline bankruptcies and cutbacks. Sullenberger, for his part, has been critical of Langewiesche's book, saying it makes too much of the aircraft's automation. In an interview with The New York Times, Sullenberger said, ""There are some situations where the automation will protect a pilot, but at the same time a highly automated airplane makes possible other types of errors, so it's a mixed blessing. And greater knowledge is required to fly a highly automated aircraft."" CNN spoke with Langewiesche this week. CNN: What got you interested in the story? William Langewiesche: I realized that because this airplane is the A320, which is a revolutionary plane, not just any airplane, the story of the A320 is in many ways the story of the modern airline industry of the last 20, 30 or 40 years. CNN: How did you become a pilot? Langewiesche: My father was a well-known aviator and writer. I got my first flying job when I was 18; I worked my way through college flying airplanes. My father was a German immigrant, an anti-Nazi who came here before the beginning of the war ... who became a test pilot for the U.S. Navy. CNN: What's it like to fly an A320? Langewiesche: It all relates to flight control characteristics and how the stick feels in your hand. ... The attitude or the pitch of the airplane stays where you put it, it's an airplane that responds in an extremely docile manner to the control stick when it's flown by hand. ... The airplane was very controversial in the early 1980s, especially in France. The unions really resented it; it was because of flight envelope protections that kick in when the plane goes where a normal airline pilot will never go. ... The airplane will take over, and it will override the pilot, and philosophically that's a really provocative thing to do. CNN: Did the flight envelope protection kick in during the landing in the Hudson? Langewiesche: It was sort of a normal flight until the challenge of the flare itself, when the nose rises just before touchdown, that was a different flare for various reasons. For one thing it was done with no power, no thrust. ... Also the landing gear was up. So at the very end in the flare, in the last two seconds or three seconds, it went into alpha protection, it got into the protection zone. The airplane lowered its own nose. It happened so late in the flare that my gut feeling is that it was kind of irrelevant, that the inertia of the airplane was going to dominate the landing and so it probably doesn't matter. CNN: Sullenberger's flying ability was widely praised. Was that justified? Langewiesche: Of course, it's justified. The thing that was most important about it was the concentration he brought -- the intense concentration on what was important. Other people could have been distracted. It didn't happen in this case. He was intensely focused on making the right decision. CNN: What was the most important decision he made? Langewiesche: The decision he made to go into the water as opposed to trying to return to LaGuardia [Airport]. While in most simulations conducted after the fact, pilots were able to get back to the airport safely, he made the right decision. In the real world, that would have been an unacceptable crapshoot. Obviously, calling it a miracle is silly. In a way to use the word miracle is to insult what they did -- skilled flying in an extremely competent airplane. CNN: Why was the A320 so controversial? Langewiesche: The role of the pilot had been downsized. And with deregulation, the salary of the pilot had been downsized. So when this technology came in it was kind of coming in in that context. That's why the French saw it as such an attack on their professional future. There had also been a global shift in the industry to two-pilot crews. The flight engineer position had been eliminated through automation. The emotions that this airplane produced still linger. No one's going to be flying pilotless airliners anytime soon. It's technically possible, and the U.S. flies drones in Afghanistan ... but obviously that's not the future of airlines in a dense traffic world with the public aboard. CNN: Is automation the reason for the downsizing of pilots? Langewiesche: We're not looking at technology as the reason for the decline of pilots. It's because of deregulation. The public demands cheap tickets. There was a time, a glorious interval, when airline pilots were paid a lot of money and there was still prestige associated with the job ... but after deregulation everything changed. CNN: How important is the pilot to safety? Langewiesche: Pilots, of course, are central. Without the pilot, forget about it. The aircraft's not going to land itself on the Hudson River. In day-to-day operations the pilot is central to flight safety -- the relationship between that and salary is a whole different question. CNN: Should people be concerned about the effect of the lower salaries? Langewiesche: If you look at new pilots coming in now, these guys are as competent as the older guys, and they're being paid a lot less money. The standard correlation between how much you're paid and how good you are, I would question that. CNN: The book quotes a National Transportation Study Board study of the most lethal 50 percent of U.S. airline accidents from 1983 through 2000. It found that 86 percent of the occupants survived. Wouldn't most people find that surprising? Langewiesche: The problem is that the accidents that get the most attention are the ones that kill the most people -- with this one being an exception. CNN: What advice do you have for maximizing your chances of survival? Langewiesche: This thing we hear so repetitively -- it's actually the safety briefing on a plane, which is probably a pretty good guide to it. Where are the exits, how do the life rafts work; it's probably all a passenger needs to know. And by the way, airline accidents are very, very rare. Let's face it, airlines are extremely safe, specifically because of the contributions of the people involved in this success story -- the pilots, the engineers, the flight controllers, the flight attendants. These are the agents of the public's safety at work. CNN: Sullenberger has criticized your book, saying it places too much emphasis on the plane's automated systems. Langewiesche: There's no quarrel at all. The book elevates legitimately and correctly what Mr. Sullenberger and Mr. Skiles did as pilots. ... Without those two pilots in the cockpit, doing the job they did, people would not have survived. Clearly, they were flying a fly-by-wire airplane, and that's part of the story. I never imply that, had they been flying a 737, things would have been worse. That would be highly speculative and silly. I'm writing about what did happen. There's no argument here from my side.","The safe landing of Flight 1549 was hailed as the ""Miracle on the Hudson""

"SHENZHEN, China (CNN) -- The white BMW Mr. Liu drives around this humid coastal city in southern China may be real, but the spiffy little black smart phone he carries with him is definitely fake. Phone clones: China's ""bandit"" mobile phone market is huge. ""But it has Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, FM radio, a digital video camera, hundreds of games, even a voice recorder,"" says Liu. ""And I invested over $500,000 to make it."" Liu, a 31-year-old who studied fine arts in college and designs cigarette cartons on the side, is one of countless thousands here who've earned big bucks manufacturing ""gray market"" mobile phones, millions of which are not only being sold across China but also exported to dozens of developing countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and other regions around the world. ""They are everywhere,"" said Karl Weaver, a wireless evangelist and mobile device specialist for the Chinese handset ecosystem. ""You can find them in major department stores and malls, in back alleys and in underground markets. Everyone is selling them. It is really very entrepreneurial."" In 2008, an estimated 150 million, or 20 percent, of the 750 million handsets produced in China were either counterfeit or off-brand phones, according to CCID Consulting, a market research firm based in Beijing. Of those, over 51 million were sold in China while the remainder were sent to foreign markets. Known here as ""shanzhai ji"", or bandit phones, China's gray market handset industry was virtually non-existent just a few years ago. While a handful of illegal companies produced black market mobiles, they often were of poor quality mainly because the technology needed to make them was hard to come by and even harder to master. This all changed in 2005 when Mediatek, a microchip design company from Taiwan, developed what experts call a turnkey solution -- a platform that integrated many complex mobile phone software systems onto a single chip. This made it much easier and cheaper to build handsets and churn out new models at astounding speeds. ""[Mediatek] basically commoditized the entire market,"" said Jonathan Li, founder of Shanghai-based technology design studio Asentio Design. ""They made it really simple and really cheap to make your own phone. Almost anybody could do it."" The shanzhai business got another boost a couple of years later when the Chinese government relaxed regulations limiting the number of companies that could manufacture handsets, lowering the entry barrier for hundreds of entrepreneurs eager to have a piece of the world's biggest mobile phone market. ""It is so easy to do because this whole ecosystem is in China,"" said Weaver. ""It isn't so complex for a guy to figure out by watching how the global supply chain works in the mobile handset space to do his own thing."" Small operations, big rewards . By 2008, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 shanzhai businesses had emerged, many with fewer than a dozen employees operating in offices sometimes comprised only of a back bedroom in a small apartment or basement of a private home. Some blatantly copy major brands, producing knock-offs with slight twists in their names, others come up with special makes of their own. Either way, the shanzhai phenomenon has not gone unnoticed by legitimate handset manufacturers. The gray market phones, which typically sell for around $100, have already driven down the prices of brand name mobiles and are beginning to take away their market share, too. ""You cannot compete with them. You can't,"" said an employee of Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""It is almost impossible to make a profit [from handsets] now because of shanzhai."" Some manufacturers, like Nokia, say they are working with the Chinese government to crackdown on the counterfeiting companies as well as raise awareness about the potential dangers of the fake phones, some of which have had exploding batteries or expose consumers to abnormal amounts of radiation. ""We have a very good working relationship with the Chinese authorities,"" Lucy Nichols, Nokia's global director of intellectual property rights and brand protection, told CNN. ""They recognize this is an issue that needs to be addressed."" Aside from also trying to highlight the risks of using shanzhai mobile phones, Beijing has yet to take serious steps to curtail the proliferation of the underground mobile phone industry. Some experts say this is because the companies involved in it blur the boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises. Even though they may still partake in shady practices, such as evading taxes, avoiding safety checks and using pirated software, a growing number of bandit phone firms are becoming licensed, creating brands with nearly as much recognition as established domestic ones. And whether licensed or not, nearly all the grey market firms place orders with mobile phone component companies that work with major manufacturers as well, which keeps factories up and running especially as handset sales plummet amidst the economic downturn. Not just faking it . Many shanzhai companies have begun to move beyond mere copying and into the realm of creativity. Some have been developed to suit the needs of the local market, with two slots for SIM cards for businesspeople traveling between Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland.  View the gallery of the phones » . Some have gimmicky appearances, like cigarettes boxes or watches, but others have special lights that can be used to identify fake money, large screens and keypads for the elderly or extra loud speakers for farmers who may not be able to hear their phones while working outside. ""This is an important way to cultivate grassroots innovation,"" said Jack Linchuan Qiu, a communications professor at Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the shanzhai industry. ""There is a lot of raw power in the development of these bandit phones that could be channeled into normal, productive creativity from the bottom up."" Fierce competition among bandit phone firms continues to drive prices down while prices for more advanced technology continues to go up, causing many of the companies to close simply because they can't make the margins they did a couple of years ago. Thousands of shanzhai companies have disappeared in recent months or have moved into new areas of opportunity, making shanzhai laptops and digital cameras. Mr. Liu is now planning his exit strategy, too. He says he is not sure what he'll do next, but whatever it is, he hopes it will involve making lots of money. ""I am trying to realize a big dream,"" he said. ""But every success has a shortcut.""","One fifth of 750 million mobile phones produced in China thought to be 'fake'

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. SUMAYA AHSAN, PAKISTANI STUDENT: He's like a legend to us because he saved our lives, our friends' lives. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We've got that incredible story coming up in just a minute. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Executive Agenda . AZUZ: First up, a look at President Obama's executive agenda. Today, he's taking off for Asia, making a nine-day trip to the region to meet with world leaders and to take part in an economic conference. Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea. All of them are stopping points along the way. The president plans to talk about the importance of the U.S. and Asian countries working together on things like economic growth, climate change and the war in Afghanistan. That last subject, the war, is something he discussed with his war council yesterday. It was the latest in a series of meetings to review the U.S. approach to the conflict in Afghanistan. President Obama is said to be considering four options, some of which may include sending additional troops to the country. That's something that military leaders have requested and some Republican lawmakers have urged the president to do. In a recent CNN poll, 56 percent of people were against sending more troops, while 42 percent were in favor of it. Earlier in the day, President Obama took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. Just one of the Veterans Day events held around the country. He and first lady Michelle Obama walked through the cemetery's Section 60, where service members from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been laid to rest. During a speech yesterday, the president said ""to all who served in every battle in every war, it's never too late to say thank you."" Is this Legit? RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Brazil is the biggest country in South America. Legit! In fact, Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world, and it's home to nearly 200 million people. Blackout in Brazil . AZUZ: About 60 million of those people were left in the dark Tuesday night by a massive power outage. Officials say it affected 18 of Brazil's 26 states, including some of the country's largest cities. There's some uncertainty about what actually caused the power outage, but it's been linked to a hydroelectric dam. The power was back on in most areas by Wednesday morning. Unsung Hero . AZUZ: Pakistan is a country that's seen a lot of violence this year. Three weeks ago, suicide attacks at a university claimed seven lives. One of them was a janitor who had only started working at the school a week earlier. But his reported actions on that day have many people in Pakistan calling him a hero. Ivan Watson shares his story. (BEGIN VIDEO) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, ISLAMABAD: 70-year-old Kurshaid Siddique makes this walk every day, clutching a photo of her son. Pervaiz Mahsi was killed on October 20th when a suicide bomber attacked the university cafeteria where he worked. Pervaiz was a janitor. He barely earned enough money to feed his family. Now, some people are calling him a hero. SUMAYA AHSAN, STUDENT: Now, he's like a legend to us because he saved our lives, our friends' lives. WATSON: 20-year-old Sumaya Ahsan and her classmates are also in mourning. The suicide bomber killed three of their friends in the women's cafeteria of Islamabad's International Islamic University. But if it wasn't for the janitor named Pervaiz, they say many more of their classmates could have been killed. AFSHEEN ZAFAR, STUDENT: If he couldn't stop that suicide attacker, there could have been great, great destruction. WATSON: On October 20th, a suicide bomber disguised in women's clothes shot and wounded the guard on duty and then approached this cafeteria, which was packed full of hundreds of female students. The café where this deadly attack took place is back open. This is the doorway where, by some accounts, Pervaiz Mahsi helped stop the suicide bomber from coming in and doing more damage. The explosion instantly killed Pervaiz. Who knows how many young women would have died if the bomber had gotten got into this room? Pervaiz's family lives here, in a house crowded with three other families. The family of eight people lives in this single room, sleeping on three beds. You all are Christians? MAHSI'S SISTER: Yeah . WATSON: They are members of Pakistan's Christian minority, one of the poorest communities in Pakistan. They had to borrow money for Pervaiz's coffiin, and now they're behind on the rent. Pervaiz's mother is inconsolable. From what we've heard, your son really helped save a lot of people and he's a hero. KURSHAID SIDDIQUE, MOTHER OF PERVAIZ MAHSI [TRANSLATED]: ""But my hero is dead now,"" she says. WATSON: The illiterate Christian man who saved the lives of so many Muslim girls is buried here, just a few feet from a muddy road in a garbage-strewn grave.

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... segregation (noun) the separation of people or groups, especially by race . source: www.dictionary.com . Together at Last . AZUZ: Segregation was a policy that was practiced in many schools across America before a Supreme Court ruling declared it unconstitutional. In Macon, Georgia, many students from the class of 1959 recently attended their 50th reunion. And they decided that while their schools were segregated then, they wanted to come together now. Brooke Baldwin takes us there. (BEGIN VIDEO) BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There are the nametags, the nerves, the hugs of recognition. But a typical 50th high school reunion this is not. Instead, this luncheon marks the first time Macon, Georgia's classes of 1959 have sat side by side ever. BETTY WEBB-HAYES, 1959 GRADUATE, BALLARD-HUDSON HIGH SCHOOL: I grew up in a town for 50 years with all those people around and never knew who they were. BALDWIN: Betty Webb-Hayes knows. In 1959, the southern city's three public high schools -- Ballard-Hudson, Lanier and Miller -- were segregated. In the 1950s, Jim Crow laws ruled, and separate was supposedly equal. But as a Ballard Hudson alumna, as a young child, she says segregation was simply a way of life. WEBB-HAYES: We didn't find out that we were being discriminated against until we were in high school, until that high school teacher told us that we were living in a segregated society. We didn't know it. BALDWIN: Fifty years later, Lanier alumnus Tom Johnson, former CNN president and publisher of the ""L.A. Times,"" had an idea to close the five-decade gap. In a letter to Macon's three classes of 1959, Johnson wrote, ""It was a different world then. We were divided by policies, politics, and tradition. It is a different world today. We no longer are separated except by personal choice."" That letter and several months of planning later, 210 members of the class of 1959 sat together at last. RUBY DEAN DUPREE, 1959 GRADUATE, BALLARD-HUDSON HIGH SCHOOL: Well, the old saying is better late than never. I could not sleep last night. So, it just means the world to me. It was just like waiting for Santa Claus to come. LINDA CARSTOFFEN GUGEN, 1959 GRADUATE, A.L. MILLER HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS: I realized how much we actually missed, people that we could have known. BALDWIN: For this former class president, the gathering of old and new friends brings tears to her eyes, not just because of the symbolism, but for the empty seats, classmates whose attitudes on race 50 years later haven't changed. GUGEN: There are some people that still feel resistant to the idea and think that what we're pushing for is not a good thing. And I think we have to focus on the ones that were here today. I think those people went away with a changed heart. BALDWIN: It may have taken those people 50 years to come together.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Are you one of the seemingly few Americans in the market for a car? There are more of you out there than you might think. Clark Howard: Before jumping at all the new car deals, think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. CNW Marketing Research, a respected automotive marketing research firm, reports that 4 million used cars were purchased in the United States during the month of May alone. That's amazing when you consider that the market for new cars is 9 million in the United States over the course of an entire 12 months. Yet don't overlook the new car as a potential purchase just yet. New data from Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they've been since records started being kept in 1979. In fact, the average new car is now $1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008. And we've got more price cuts coming because of oversupply. As you probably know, I'm a used car guy, the self-proclaimed champion of driving a car until the wheels fall off. So I can't believe the advice that I am about to give ... but it's now possible to get a better deal on a brand new car than on a relatively new used car. Watch Clark Howard talk to a woman who learned what not to do when buying a used car » . It's really just a classic case of supply and demand. The used car market is up about 23 percent, and new car sales are down 34 percent, according to CNW. More new cars on dealer lots mean more deals for you. But realize this: It's just a temporary phenomenon. Do not take this blip on the radar as gospel for the future; in most instances, a used car will almost always be a better buy. Just not right now. When buying a new vehicle, you want to start by arranging your financing first. Go to your bank or credit union and prequalify for a car loan or apply online. This will tell you how much car you can afford and what type of monthly payment you will have to budget. Next, you want to get a price for the car you have in mind. In the past, I've talked about using CarsDirect.com to get a guaranteed quote. A car dealer then can do his or her best to beat that online quote and win your business. In some cases, the price from CarsDirect.com winds up being the best a consumer can get. But now there's a new kid on the block known as Zag.com. This service gives buyers instant guaranteed upfront prices from a network of certified dealers. It also offers an easy delivery process that helps you avoid ""the grind"" at a dealership. Do you know what ""the grind"" is? That's when you're at a dealer lot, and the sales representative says he or she will go talk to the manager about getting you the best deal. Instead they go watch TV for five minutes, and then come back and tell you that the manager couldn't help out with a good price -- despite their best efforts on your behalf. That's why sites such as Zag and CarsDirect are so appealing; they take you out of the car dealers' ballpark and put you on level playing ground. But before you jump at all the new car deals, take a moment to think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. It's more than just the sticker price and the expense of gas. AAA reports that the true annual cost of owning and operating a car is $9,369. Ouch. That $9,369 takes into account somewhat hidden costs such as insurance, maintenance, interest on a car note, depreciation and other factors. Hey, maybe driving your current car until the wheels fall off is still a great idea.","Four million used cars reportedly purchased in the U.S. during May .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Do you need to borrow to fund a college education for yourself or your child? Be sure you're taking my ""Clark Smart"" approach to borrowing. Clark Howard: If a four-year college is too cost prohibitive, try a two-year institution at a fraction of the cost . Subsidized Stafford loans are the single best source of money you can borrow. The interest is picked up by the federal government -- courtesy of your fellow taxpayers -- while you're in school and for a six-month grace period following graduation. Once the loans go into repayment, subsidized Stafford loans taken out during the 2009-10 school year carry a fixed interest rate of 5.6 percent. The rate will be lower still at 4.5 percent for loans originating during the next school year, and all the way down to 3.4 percent the following year. There are, however, limits to the amount you can borrow. Freshman can get up to $3,500 annually; sophomores can borrow $4,500 each year; and juniors and seniors cap out at $5,500. Once you exhaust your subsidized Stafford stockpile, you want to move on to unsubsidized Stafford loans, which are now offered at 6.8 percent. Remember, though, to borrow as little as possible because the interest on these unsubsidized loans accumulates while you're in school.  Watch smart choices when paying back the loans » . As a third option, parents can take out PLUS loans, which are issued at a fixed rate of 8.25 percent. Visit FAFSA.ed.gov to determine your eligibility for all these loan options. What's one type of loan you do not want to take out? Private student loans. Back in 2005, the private student loan industry used its political influence to gain the right to use any and all tactics (short of threatening bodily harm or actually causing it) in their efforts to collect money. In fact, private student loans typically can't even be dismissed in bankruptcy. Remember my rule of thumb when it comes to determining what level of borrowing you can comfortably handle: Do not take on a total loan amount that exceeds the likely first-year earnings in your field. If college is still too cost-prohibitive after you've gotten all the financial aid and loans you can, I'd love for you to think about starting your degree at a two-year community college. The cost of a community college can be as little as one-tenth to one-twentieth that of a private college, as I discovered when I researched schools with my eldest daughter. Let's say you decide to do your first two years at a community college. People often worry about the lack of prestige associated with these kinds of schools. But most employers only look at the name of the traditional college that issues your degree after you've put in your time at a community school. In fact, an employer might even prefer someone who worked their way through a community college and had to struggle financially. Doesn't that show more fortitude in a job candidate than the person who cruised through a 4-year college on the silver-spoon plan? And for those of you already dealing with paying off student loan debt, there's a radical change coming that I want you to know about. Effective July 1, an income-based repayment plan (IBR) became available to borrowers with Stafford loans and Grad PLUS loans. Under the new program, your payment will be based on your current income and family size. That means your monthly payment could be an unprecedented zero dollars if you qualify! Contact your lender to see if you qualify and to apply for the IBR. In addition to the IBR, other new provisions that went into effect July 1 include loan forgiveness options for certain workers. Nonprofit workers and some government employees are eligible for loan forgiveness after making on-time monthly payments for 10 years. If you work in the traditional for-profit sector, it will take 25 years of on-time payments before you're eligible for loan forgiveness. Visit LoanConsolidation.ed.gov for more information.","Interest on subsidized Stafford loans picked up by government while in school .

"(CNN) -- As part of the investigation into the remains of 11 women found inside and outside the Cleveland, Ohio, home of a registered sex offender, police have turned to the self-described ""bug guy."" Joe Keiper, curator of invertebrate zoology from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, started consulting with law enforcement in 2001. His job is to identify the bugs found on bodies and determine their age, to help police determine the ""post-mortem interval"": the time between death and body discovery. It's a grisly task but a useful one, as it can help police determine a timeline for deaths. Bugs ""can be the most important evidence when it comes to pinpointing a timeline,"" Keiper said, adding that bugs' sense of smell ""puts bloodhounds to shame."" And in this case, with 11 deaths -- each with their own mystery -- bugs could play a huge role in helping investigators figure out how and when each of these bodies ended up at the home of Anthony Sowell, 50. From the beginning, Keiper was involved in the case of the remains found at Sowell's home. All the remains are of African-American women, police said. All that remains of one victim is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement. Police conducted an additional search at Sowell's home and an adjacent property Wednesday, Cleveland police Lt. Thomas Stacho said. Although ""various items"" were removed, no more remains were found, he said. Police had used ground-penetrating radar to analyze the properties. Sowell, who served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape, now faces five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. Typically, Keiper said, he requires three weeks to a month to complete a report on one body, but in the Sowell case, he hopes to have an initial report completed ""before Christmas. ... It isn't going to be a three-week process."" The difference between one bug and another can be ""minute,"" with some of them looking ""very similar,"" he said. But the minute difference can be huge in terms of bug species, as different species can tell very different stories about the time of death. For instance, there are only a few dozen species of flies in his part of Ohio, he said, but the presence or absence of each one can tell a story, since each has a different rate of growth in varying temperatures. Temperature will be a factor in this case, he said, because some of the bodies were found inside and others outside. Keiper said he'll need to determine what effect the bodies being ""hidden"" will have on the bugs he finds, as well. In research done with dead pigs, he said, bugs will cover the pig's face within an hour. Keiper said his job is to be ""meticulous,"" as any mistakes can disrupt an investigation. Preliminary information is generally not useful, he said, so he has not spoken to police or the coroner regarding any of his findings. Asked how exact his findings will be concerning time of death, he declined to answer, saying that would mean giving specifics on the conditions of the bodies when they were found. He said only that he believes he can do ""better than years"" in trying to pinpoint a time of death for each victim. ""This is a singular situation that I hope is once in a lifetime,"" he said of the Sowell case. ""This is something, for the sake of our society, I hope I never have to do again.""

"Kennett, Missouri (CNN) --  A woman accused of cutting in line at a Wal-Mart, shoving merchandise and assaulting police officers will plead guilty to disturbing the peace and resisting arrest, both misdemeanors. Under the agreement -- reached after the jury received the case for deliberations -- Heather Ellis will plead guilty to disturbing the peace and resisting arrest. She will serve a year of unsupervised probation, attend an anger management course and serve four days in jail before the end of the year. The sentence stipulates that if Ellis stays out of trouble for a year, the charges will be sealed and the arrest won't be on her permanent record. Ellis said after court was adjourned that she was ""taking responsibility for her actions and [hopes] that everyone else involved in the case will take responsibility for theirs."" Earlier Friday, Ellis, 24, took the stand and denied all charges in the racially charged case. Witnesses and police say Ellis cut in front of customers at a Wal-Mart in January 2007, pushed aside merchandise belonging to another customer to make room for hers on the conveyor belt and, after police were called to the scene, kicked one officer in the shin and split another's lip. The prosecution has also alleged the Ellis went ""ballistic in a profane tirade"" that continued when police officers arrived. Ellis, now a schoolteacher, denied all accusations against her, although she acknowledged in her Friday testimony that she touched another shopper's items on the conveyor belt. She was initially charged with assaulting police officers, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace. Had she been convicted of those charges, she could have been sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Ellis, then a college student with no criminal history, has said that some white patrons shoved and hurled racial slurs at her when she switched checkout lines. Store employees refused to give her her change and called police, she said. She said Friday that the incident began when she joined her cousin in the checkout line and was ignored by the clerk. She did not not cut in line and did not yell or use profanity, said Ellis, who has not spoken about the case outside of court. As she left the store, Ellis told the Dunklin County Circuit Court, a police officer told her, ""Look at this stupid bitch. Take your ass back to the ghetto."" She alleged that an officer behind her forcefully grabbed her shoulder without telling her she was being arrested. She did not resist, but said her body was ""flung around"" by officers. She screamed loudly for help as officers ""choked"" her and pulled her hair, but she did not hit or kick them, she testified. Testimony from Ellis' cousin, who was with her at the Wal-Mart, and from her aunt, whom the cousin called as Ellis was arrested, backed up the young woman's account. Ellis said she saw a doctor after the incident because tight handcuffs had cut her and made her bleed. She said she also had a headache and neck pain from the incident. An emergency room doctor testified that he had seen bruises on one of Ellis' wrists, but did not see cuts or bleeding. He also said he did not see any neck or head injuries. Surveillance tapes from the store were shown in court Thursday and released publicly, but the tapes don't show much of the alleged confrontation. A camera from above the cash register appeared to show Ellis' arm shoving merchandise to the side on the register's conveyor belt. Another camera showed her being led out of the store by police, with her arm in the air. A third, from the parking lot, showed her being handcuffed and put into a police car. It appeared to show Ellis kicking backward at police, as authorities allege. Her defense maintains she did so after police had assaulted her. Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference have said the case is indicative of racial bias in the town, where 13 percent of the population is African-American. Black and Hispanic residents have long complained of being unfairly profiled during traffic stops by the predominantly white police department. When Ellis' supporters held a peaceful rally in June, officers found business cards scattered along the route that read: ""You have been paid a social visit by the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The next visit will not be social."" During another rally on Monday, a handful of opponents stood on the sidelines waving Confederate flags. Her lawyers have not brought up race as a contributing factor in the incident. Two years ago, prosecutors offered a plea deal under which Ellis would have received probation if she dropped her complaint against the police. ""She decided not to sign it, because she was taught to never admit guilt when you're innocent,"" her father has said. CNN's David Mattingly and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Ellis' permanent record will be cleared if she stays out of trouble for a year .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida teenager attacked and set on fire last month, allegedly by five teenage friends, was undergoing skin graft surgery Friday, the first procedure in his recovery, a hospital spokeswoman said. Michael Brewer, who suffered burns over 65 percent of his body, will have his own skin transplanted onto the burned areas of his back and buttocks, said Lorraine Nelson, a spokeswoman at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. Brewer will return to the intensive care unit after the surgery. He has been heavily sedated since the October 12 incident and on a ventilator until last week to keep him alive. He is listed in guarded condition. On Thursday, three teens accused of setting Brewer on fire pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said. Each of the three -- Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16 -- is charged as an adult with one count of attempted murder in the second degree in the attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. They were arraigned in Broward County Circuit Court before Judge Dale Cohen, and are being held without bond. Prosecutors say the three boys were in a gang that poured alcohol over Brewer, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. Gordon Weekes, Bent's attorney, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults. ""It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions,"" he said. ""But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared towards rehabilitation,"" Weekes added. The attorney said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. They said Bent allegedly encouraged the attack. Authorities say that Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. Two other boys who were allegedly involved -- a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old -- have been charged as juveniles. Witnesses say Brewer jumped into the swimming pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer. ""We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week,"" sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said. ""Detectives have been waiting for him to recover to the point where he's strong enough to give us a complete statement."" Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections. Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks; his face and hands were largely spared, doctors say. Brewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital, and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries. ""They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time,"" Nelson said. ""I don't tell him what happened,"" Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. ""I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better. ""And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?' And I say 'Yes, Michael. You're going to be fine. You're going to be just fine,' "" she said. Investigators believe Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle. Brewer reported him to police and Bent was arrested, police say. The next day, the group surrounded Brewer. According to witnesses, the five boys called Brewer ""a snitch"" and set him on fire. The Brewer family told WFOR that none of the families of the accused boys have tried to contact them, but that it doesn't matter. ""We can't focus on it. They'll get theirs is all we can say. I don't focus on it,"" Brewer's father, also named Michael, told WFOR. If convicted, each of the three teen suspects could face up to 30 years in prison. A court-appointed psychologist who has examined two of the five boys allegedly involved in the attack told CNN they are competent to take part in legal proceedings and assist their attorney. ""I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful,"" said Michael Brannon, a forensic psychologist, without identifying the boys. ""I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim."" Psychologists are often brought into cases involving teenagers and young adults to judge their mental capabilities to determine their competency to proceed. They must determine whether the alleged attackers understand the charges against them, the court proceedings and potential sentences. Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys. ""I don't think they expected to have happened, what happened,"" Brannon said. ""It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen.""","Hospital spokeswoman says Michael Brewer having own skin put onto burned areas .

"(CNN) -- Forget Hollywood special effects or Impressionist paintings -- some of the most stunning images are created by the mysterious and often violent forces in the universe. The Butterfly Nebula is about 3,800 light-years away in the constellation Scorpius. Witness the handful of new snapshots taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which was equipped with a new imaging camera during a space shuttle servicing mission in May. It's back in business and there's lots to ooh and aah over. ""Let there be no doubt, this is truly Hubble's new beginning,"" said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator, during a news conference Wednesday. Take the image on the left of planetary nebula NGC 6302, also known as the Bug Nebula or the Butterfly Nebula. Its ""wings"" are made of gas heated to more than 36,000 degrees Fahrenheit and there is a dying star at its center. ""The gas is tearing across space at more than 600,000 miles an hour -- fast enough to travel from Earth to the moon in 24 minutes,"" NASA's Web site says. The ""butterfly"" is more than 2 light-years across. NASA took advantage of the special filters on Hubble's camera to isolate the light of different elements, said Bob O'Connell, chair of the science oversight committee for Wide Field Camera 3. The red in the image is nitrogen gas, for example, and the blue is oxygen. See some of the previous amazing images taken by Hubble . Colors are also prominent in the image of globular star cluster Omega Centauri, which contains almost 10 million stars, but the color contrast here is real. The gold dots are stars like our sun, but the blue ones are extremely hot, while the red ones are cool, O'Connell said. ""Just by looking at the color of the stars in the picture, you can sort them by temperature and evolutionary state because the temperature differences here are caused by differences in the internal structure of these stars and in the kinds of fuels they're burning deep inside of them,"" O'Connell said. Another image shows Stephan's Quintet, a group of five galaxies -- some of which are 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Over time, those galaxies will eventually merge into a single big galaxy, O'Connell said. Finally, images of a stellar nursery as seen in visible and infrared light reveal the secrets inside the Carina Nebula, located 7,500 light-years away. ""This is a cloud of dense material which is being bombarded by intense radiation from surrounding stars,"" O'Connell said. ""But dissolve to infrared and the cloud disappears. ... An energetic infant star is being formed inside this cloud."" Hubble is expected to continue its mission for at least five more years.","Hubble Space Telescope was equipped with a new imaging camera in May .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The Iranian government has blocked access to the social networking site Facebook amid political jockeying for the June 12 presidential elections, according to the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency. Opponents of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad like Mir Hossein Mousavi are using technology to reach voters. Reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi -- a former prime minister considered a threat to current hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- created a Facebook page for his campaign that has more than 5,000 supporters on the site. Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying, ""Access to this site is not possible,"" according to CNN personnel in Tehran. ILNA reported the Masadiq Committee, made up of representatives from Iran's intelligence ministry, judiciary and others had ordered the action. After a few hours, the blockage was lifted, but was then reinstated, ILNA said. No reason was given for the block. ""We are disappointed to learn of reports that users in Iran may not have access to Facebook, especially at a time when voters are turning to the Internet as a source of information about election candidates and their positions,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. ""We believe that people around the world should be able to use Facebook to communicate and share information with their friends, family and co-workers. It is always a shame when a country's cultural and political concerns lead to limits being placed on the opportunity for sharing and expression that the Internet provides."" Ahmadinejad's challengers are increasingly turning to new technology to spread their message, according to a May 13 article in the Financial Times newspaper. Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million by July 2009, according to the CIA World Factbook -- has a median age of 27. The Financial Times, which put the country's population at 70 million, said 47 million Iranians have cell phones and 21 million have Internet access. ""We are using new technologies because they have the capacity to be multiplied by people themselves who can forward Bluetooth, e-mails and text messages and invite more supporters on Facebook,"" Behzad Mortazavi, head of Mousavi's campaign committee, told the Financial Times. At a Mousavi rally at a stadium Saturday, the Facebook blockage was a topic of conversation among reporters. Many said they had accessed Facebook on Friday night and believe the site was blocked Saturday morning.","Facebook visitors see message in Farsi saying, ""Access to this site is not possible""

"The state you live in may affect your state of mind, according to new report that shows that rates of stress, depression, and emotional problems vary by geographic region. Where you live may affect your state of mind, according to a new mental health report. That's good news if you live in Hawaii, where only 6.6 percent of people report frequent mental distress. Not-so-good news for those in Kentucky: In the Bluegrass State, 14.4 percent of people said they frequently experienced mental distress -- the highest prevalence in the country. Frequent mental distress is defined as having 14 or more mentally unhealthy days during the previous 30-day period. The researchers were surprised that the study, which will be published in the June 2009 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, showed such a broad range in mental distress depending on geographic location. ""The occurrence of frequent mental distress in adults differs much more than expected among the residents of U.S. states and counties,"" said lead researcher Dr. Matthew M. Zack, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. People who have frequent mental distress may have treatable and preventable mental illnesses or problems, and social programs or interventions may help, Zack said.  Health.com: How stress may affect psoriasis . In the study, the researchers looked at rates of mental distress by state among 2.4 million adults across two time periods -- 1993 through 2001 and 2003 through 2006 -- as part of the ongoing Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System study. Overall, the prevalence for frequent mental distress across both time periods was 9.4 percent, with the lowest rate in Hawaii and the highest rate in Kentucky. Why the difference? It may be because residents in some areas of the country are more likely than others to have health conditions such as disability or diabetes, untreated mental conditions like anxiety or depression, high unemployment rates, risky behaviors including cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, and/or social circumstances such as lower incomes. Health.com: Manic spending puts bipolar patients at risk for financial woes .

The rate of frequent mental distress increased by at least 1 percentage point in 27 states, and by more than 4 percentage points in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia from the first time period to the second time period. ""In some areas, normal or low frequent-mental-distress levels increased over time, implying the introduction of influences that increased levels of frequent mental distress,"" Zack said.

""From a public health standpoint, it's great to be aware of places with high rates of frequent mental distress so we can help make sure that access to care is increasing in those areas,"" he said. Many of the states with high rates of frequent mental distress are struggling economically, as are their residents. As a result, they may not be able to afford health insurance that includes mental health services. ""The big message is that you need to monitor the health and mental health of the country because it will lead to greater equity in mental health services,"" Holzer said. And Zack said, ""Community mental health agencies, social service agencies, and public health agencies in counties where frequent mental distress is increased should recognize that such increases may indicate unmet health and social service needs.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $848 billion bill. The 60-39 vote to prevent a Republican filibuster against the start of debate on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's legislation broke down along strict party lines. All 58 Senate Democrats -- along with independent Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- supported bringing the measure to the floor. Thirty-nine of the 40 Senate Republicans opposed the motion. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, didn't vote. ""Tonight's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses, reining in spiraling health care costs, providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement. The polarized vote set the table for a holiday season now virtually certain to be marked by acrimonious deliberations on President Obama's top domestic priority. Top Senate Democrats, who are trying to pass a bill before the end of the year, spent much of the day tarring their Republican colleagues as defenders of a broken status quo benefitting rich insurance companies at the expense of ordinary American families. Republicans, in turn, slammed Democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of Americans to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums, raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care. Read the health care bill (PDF) ""Today we [decide] whether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation,"" Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said shortly before the vote. ""Whether this nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free from fear of illness and death, which can be prevented by decent health care for all."" The Republicans ""are frightening people,"" said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ""Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees. Now is the time to stand strong ... and move this country forward."" ""This bill... is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending,"" replied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. It ""imposes punishing taxes on almost everyone. ... A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst of double digit unemployment."" The bill ""does worse than nothing,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. It ""threatens the economic recovery. ... Changes to the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs of the taxpayers."" The procedural vote represented another milestone in what has become an epic battle over the future of America's health care system. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a more than $1 trillion bill this month. If the Senate also manages to pass a bill, a congressional conference committee will then need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to Obama's desk to be signed into law. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid's 2,074-page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans. The agency estimates that the proposal would reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion over the next 10 years, through 2019. Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be ""subject to substantial uncertainty,"" but probably would result in ""small reductions in federal budget deficits,"" according to budget office analysts. A minimum of 60 votes is required to break a filibuster in the 100-member Senate. The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon, when Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Arkansas, announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure. Lincoln, a key moderate probably facing a tough re-election campaign in 2010, said the issue deserved further debate and consideration. She made clear, however, that she opposes several aspects of Reid's bill, including a controversial government-run public option. ""Although I don't agree with everything in this bill, I believe it is important to begin debate,"" Lincoln said. ""The issue is very complex. There is no easy fix."" Republicans wasted no time tearing into Lincoln's vote, issuing a news release while she was still announcing her decision, proclaiming that she had caved to ""pressure from the left wing of her party."" ""There's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen. Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid,"" said Amber Wilkerson Marchand, a GOP spokeswoman. ""The people of Arkansas will have an opportunity to hold her accountable when they cast their ballots next November."" Two other Democratic moderates whose support was considered to be in doubt -- Nebraska's Ben Nelson and Louisiana's Mary Landrieu -- also announced their decision to back a full debate shortly before the vote. Reid's bill, projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans, includes a range of tax increases and new fees. The Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning $200,000 a year and couples earning $250,000 a year would increase by half a percentage point, from the current 1.45 percent to 1.95 percent. In addition, insurers providing costly health coverage -- known as Cadillac plans -- would face a 40 percent tax on policies worth more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. The bill also includes a 5 percent tax on the cost of elective cosmetic surgery, as well as new fees for insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The total projected revenue raised by all the taxes and fees would exceed $200 billion. The bill would require individuals to buy health insurance, with a fine for non-compliance of $95 in the first year that would escalate to $750 by 2016. Unlike the plan recently passed by the House, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care. Businesses with more than 50 workers, where at least one employee qualifies for government subsidies, would face a penalty of $750 for every full-time employee if it does not offer health care coverage. Reid's bill also would expand government-run Medicaid coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level. Democratic leaders in both chambers have been wrestling with the most contentious issues, including abortion and immigration, as well as how to pay for reform. The House bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million. Both bills include a government-run public option, but the Senate version allows states to opt out before the national program would go into effect in 2014. The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes, including creating health insurance exchanges, expanding Medicaid, subsidizing insurance for low- and some middle-income families, and capping out-of-pocket medical expenses while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history.","""Tonight's historic vote brings us one step closer,"" White House press secretary says .

"New York (CNN) -- There are dozens of get-well cards on his wall. On his bed, there's another pile from family, friends, high school pals. The patient must be 19 or 20 -- a kid -- and his smile is magnetic. His mother hugs every visitor, strangers like us included. ""I'm a hugger,"" she explains. His girlfriend is by his bedside too, wearing a sweatshirt from her college in upstate New York, her studies interrupted. ""My leg will never be a hundred percent,"" he says, ""which means I just have to get a new hundred percent."" It helps that we were visiting this wounded soldier at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, a few weeks ago, with the actor Woody Harrelson, instantly recognizable from TV and movies. Woody is profoundly good-natured and can make anyone smile, even the maimed young men and women, just back from a combat zone they carried home with them. But this particular soldier/kid is happy anyway. Happy to be alive, mature enough to be grateful. A few weeks earlier, an Afghan soldier he had known for eight months -- a man who fought by his side -- turned his rifle on his American ""allies"" and killed two of this soldier's buddies, wounding three, including him. This kid knows he's among the lucky ones. ""I have no idea why he did it,"" he says. ""It's the Middle East,"" I reply. ""I guess so,"" he says with a sigh. In room after room, our delegation encounters stories of war that are just not a part of the national conversation. I keep thinking: Whatever happened to the telling of these stories in America? Do we need a Washington lobbyist to push the soldier's-story agenda? Individual tales make up the reality of war; anecdote by anecdote, they become the truth of combat. But in the U.S. mainstream media, they have too little presence. How did we get to a place where sharing a soldier's narrative or reading soldiers' names on television or meeting their coffins when they are brought back to their country becomes a political or disloyal act? Why can't we share the truth about war? When I was growing up in Israel, we saw scenes from military funerals on the news: screaming, crying mothers and all. Wounded soldiers would be interviewed, sometimes with burned bodies or missing limbs. It was not political; it was just the subjective, human reality of the soldier. There was a need to know. It gave our warriors a public stage from which to reconnect. I remember coming back from Lebanon when I was a soldier in the '80s, feeling like I've just been to another planet. Filmmaking, storytelling, was my therapy. We made an earlier trip to Walter Reed, along with our lead Ben Foster, to immerse ourselves in the lives of returning soldiers in preparation for making a movie about casualty notification officers, the soldiers who knock on the door to bring the grim news of a loved one's death while on military duty. We think of it as an uplifting movie about getting back to life. When we tell these troops about our movie, most smile bitterly; they know their families were spared that awful encounter -- they got a phone call -- but they imagine their friends' families having their hearts ripped out by two soldiers in Class A uniforms at the door. ""The secretary of the Army regrets to inform you ..."" Visiting a military hospital is always an inspiring, shocking, beautiful, complicated experience. I highly recommend it. It's a gift to the soldier, and it's a blessing for the visitor. Those who are in good enough shape to talk take us to the front lines of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in vivid, visceral detail. We feel privileged to hear their voices crack, to see their eyes fill with tears. Firefights. IEDs. Accidents. Friendly fire. Boredom. Porn. Burn pits. Torn up buddies. Locals. Shifting alliances. Lives lost in translation. The stuff of war. Nothing pretty about it. And that's OK. If these guys can live through it, we can listen. It doesn't take much before you're reminded that wars are about human beings -- on both sides. With more than 5,000 dead; more than 35,000 soldiers coming back with injuries, many that will last a lifetime; with one in six returning soldiers afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder; and with families torn apart by multiple deployments, domestic violence, substance abuse, divorces, suicides, homelessness, etc., we are slowly transitioning into the longest part of the war: the aftermath. There are many dedicated professionals and volunteers who are dealing with these issues. They're the ones who will be learning the soldier-stories that we all must know, the individual accounts that should allow us to address, head-on, our collective responsibility as a society toward those who fight in our name. But we won't hear these stories unless we insist. Instead, we'll get more statistics, political punditry, screamers trying to pull us left or right. We say goodbye to this kid in his military hospital bed. He waves and says, ""No need to worry about me."" Which is the only thing I think he got wrong. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Oren Moverman.","Oren Moverman says soldiers' stories tell war's truth, but media often avoid them .

"(CNN) -- Chilean inspectors stumbled upon hundreds of exotic animals from Peru destined for illegal trade while conducting what they thought was going to be a routine inspection of a fishing boat, the government said Tuesday. A family of Scarlet macaws in Costa Rica in June 2008 at a zoo aimed at conserving the species. The Chilean boat, the Rosa Isabel, was carrying macaws, toucans, parrots, turtles, squirrels and crocodiles, most of them protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which prohibits the sale of these species, the government said in a statement. In all, officials counted more than 400 exotic animals from Peru, the statement said. The incident began before dawn, when inspectors from Chile's Maritime Administration boarded the boat and found the live cargo stuffed inside dozens of cardboard boxes lined with chicken wire and with holes cut on the sides for ventilation. The animals were handed over to the Farm and Cattle Service of Arica, Chile's northernmost city, for return to Peru, the minister of agriculture said Monday in a statement. The captain of the ship, Moises Segundo Diaz Verdugo, a Chilean national, faces a possible fine of between $188,000 and $940,000, to be determined by an Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) court. Under an agreement between SAG and the National Institute of Natural Resources of the Republic of Peru, signed in 2007, the animals will be returned to Peru, SAG said. The national director of SAG, Francisco Bahamonde, credited coordination among various state bodies with impeding the illegal entry of protected species and products that can transmit pests or illnesses and said they would ""redouble"" their efforts.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- A century and a half ago, Athens was a humble, forgotten city of about 8,000 people. Today, one out of every three Greeks packs into this city of about 4 million. To avoid the Parthenon crowds, go in the early evening when the marble turns golden as the sun sets. Athens has been famous for its sprawl, noise and pollution. My advice has long been to see the big sights, then get out. But visiting it recently to research a new guidebook, I've seen a dramatic change. The city has made a concerted effort to curb pollution, clean up and pedestrianize the streets, spiff up the museums, build a new airport and invest in one of Europe's better public-transit systems. Even with its new look, the Greek capital still has its ""big three"" sights: the stunning Acropolis, the Ancient Agora just below and the remarkable National Archaeological Museum. But coming in June is the opening of a fourth big sight -- one that will stoke a battle over Greece losing her marbles more than 200 years ago (more on that later). To many, the most important ancient site in the Western world is the Acropolis, rising gleaming like a beacon above the gray concrete drudgery of modern Athens. This is where the Greeks built the mighty Parthenon -- the most famous temple on the planet, and an enduring symbol of ancient Athens' glorious Golden Age from nearly 2,500 years ago. The major monuments of the Acropolis survive in remarkably good condition. While the Persians, Ottomans, and British were cruel to the site in the past, the greatest dangers it faces now are acid rain and pollution. Ongoing restoration means that you might see some scaffolding -- but even that can't take away from its greatness. I like to come late in the day, as the sun goes down, when the white Parthenon stone gleams a creamy golden brown. While the Acropolis was the city's ceremonial showpiece, it was the Ancient Agora that was the real heart of classical Athens. For some 800 years, it was the hub of all commercial, political, and social life and home to many of the city's religious rites. Little survives in the Agora from the classical period. Other than one very well-preserved temple and a rebuilt portico, it's a field of humble ruins nestled in the shadow of the Acropolis. But that makes it a quiet, uncrowded spot to wander and get a feel for the ancients. Romantics can't help but get goose bumps as they kick around the same pebbles that once stuck in Socrates' sandals, with the floodlit Parthenon forever floating ethereally overhead. North of the city center is the world's best collection of ancient Greek art, the National Archaeological Museum. It takes you from 7000 B.C. to A.D. 500 on a beautifully displayed and well-described sweep through Greek history, from prehistoric and Mycenaean artifacts through the evolution of classical Greek statuary. This museum now has a worthy competitor -- the New Acropolis Museum, slated to open in June. It's a world-class space, custom-built to showcase the Parthenon sculptures, along with truckloads of other artifacts, all complemented by modern exhibits. And the state-of-the-art building itself is worth a look, as the boldest symbol yet of the post-Olympics vision for Athens. The new museum also serves as a sort of 21st-century Trojan horse, intended to lure the famous Elgin Marbles (the Parthenon sculptures) away from London's British Museum. In the early 19th century, the British ambassador to the Ottomans, Lord Elgin, got permission to strip marble panels from the Parthenon and take them to England. For years, the Greeks have asked for the marbles back, and for years, the Brits have responded with claims that Greece can't give them a suitable home. And yet, now that this state-of-the-art facility is ready and waiting, it still seems unlikely that the marbles will be returned anytime soon. Britain is reluctant to give in, for fear of setting a precedent ... and getting ""me, too"" notices from Italy, Egypt, Iran, Iraq and all the other nations who'd like the missing pieces of their cultural heritage back. But even without the Elgin Marbles, this new museum will be worth the wait, capturing the timeless splendor of ancient Athens in an ultra-modern building. Athens is more than a showcase for its past. Take some time to smell the souvlaki, whether by wandering through the touristy Plaka district, browsing through the Monastiraki flea market, or exploring the Psyrri neighborhood, the cutting-edge place to go for nightlife and dining. The narrow winding streets can be confusing, but you can't get too lost with a monument the size of the Acropolis looming overhead to keep you oriented. And after you visit Athens, get out -- to the wild, mountainous landscape of Greece's Peloponnese, covered in my next column.

"(CNN) -- ""The LHC is back,"" the European Organization for Nuclear Research announced triumphantly Friday, as the world's largest particle accelerator resumed operation more than a year after an electrical failure shut it down. Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been ""a herculean effort,"" CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success. Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see. Physicists established a circulating proton beam in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel at 10 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, CERN said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator. ""It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,"" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. ""We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way."" Located underground on the border of Switzerland and France, the LHC has been inching towards operation since the summer. It reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero Celsius -- on October 8 and particles were injected on October 23. Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said. High-energy collisions will follow next year. The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a ""bit of baguette"" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said. The collider achieved its first full-circle beam last year on September 10 amid much celebration. But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch. ""There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident,"" he said. Now, ""people are feeling a lot better because we know we've done so much work in the last year."" Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event. Wise noted that Tevatron, the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine. ""It's a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it's not like there's not going to be problems along the way,"" he said. ""They will surmount those problems."" The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said. But it won't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called ""the God particle"" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a ""super partner"" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010. For some theoretical physicists such as Wise, finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome. He wants the LHC to deliver surprises, even if that means no Higgs. ""When push comes to shove, the name of the game is 'what is nature,' and we're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,"" Wise said. ATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before. ALICE, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, said John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE-USA. At that time, there was a ""hot soup"" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","LHC restarted more than a year after being shut down by electrical fault .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI is expected to meet the Archbishop of Canterbury on Saturday, the first meeting between the religious leaders since a Catholic overture to disaffected Anglicans that some commentators compared to a hostile takeover on Wall Street. Rowan Williams, the nominal head of the world Anglican Communion, threw down a theological gauntlet to the pope in a highly challenging speech in Rome in the run-up to their meeting. He laid out a series of questions suggesting that decades of hard-won apparent reconciliation between the Catholic Church and other Christian denominations might have weak foundations. He also proposed that a truly universal Christian church might have to be structured more like the Anglican Communion -- with no central authority laying down the law -- than like the Catholic Church, with the pope on his throne. ""Is there a mechanism in the church that has the clear right to determine for all where the limits of Christian identity might be found?"" Williams asked. ""Is the integrity of the church ultimately dependent on a single identifiable ministry of unity to which all local ministries are accountable?"" The meeting comes in the wake of a Vatican move that some say will shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the Catholic and Anglican churches. The Vatican announced in October that it had worked out a way for Anglicans who are dissatisfied with their church to switch allegiance en masse to Rome. The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion. The number of Anglicans wishing to join the Catholic Church has increased in recent years as the Anglican Church has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy, said Cardinal William Joseph Levada, the head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in announcing the move in October. Williams was said to have been taken by surprise by the move, which critics described as an end run around a long-established Catholic-Anglican dialogue. ""The Catholic Church is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the Holy See from groups of Anglican clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion,"" Levada said. Levada said ""hundreds"" of Anglicans around the world have expressed their desire to join the Catholic Church. Among them are 50 Anglican bishops, said Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia of the Congregation for Divine Worship. Catholic and Anglican theology and rites are broadly similar, but Anglicans have long allowed priests to marry and have children. In recent decades, the Anglican Communion has allowed women to become priests. The Episcopal Church, the United States branch of the Anglican Communion, has ordained an openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, and appears to be on the verge of ordaining more. Those developments have caused controversy within the communion, with more conservative parishes setting up alternative structures of authority. Pope Benedict hinted clearly when he last met Williams in Rome almost exactly three years ago to the day that Rome did not look kindly on the Anglican moves. ""Recent developments, especially concerning the ordained ministry and certain moral teachings, have affected not only internal relations within the Anglican Communion but also relations between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church,"" the pope said in November 2006. ""We believe that these matters, which are presently under discussion within the Anglican Communion, are of vital importance to the preaching of the gospel in its integrity, and that your current discussions will shape the future of our relations,"" he added. There are about 77 million Anglicans worldwide, and about 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.","Pope Benedict XVI, Anglican head to meet, discuss ideologies .

"(CNN)  -- A Jersey City, New Jersey, police officer shot in the line of duty last week died of his injuries Tuesday, a day before his 38th birthday, a spokeswoman for the city's mayor announced. Police officers gather at the site of a shootout in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Thursday. Jennifer Morrill said Officer Marc DiNardo, who was wounded last Thursday in a shootout, passed away Tuesday morning. Jersey City Police Chief Thomas Comey told reporters Monday night that DiNardo was not expected to live. DiNardo was one of five officers injured early Thursday as they moved in for a tactical entry into an apartment where a shooting suspect and another person were holed up. Officials say the officers were met with gunfire, and a shootout ensued. Both suspects were killed, and DiNardo suffered two gunshot wounds to the face. Melissa Bartholomew, a family friend and fellow police officer, read a statement Monday from DiNardo's family, which includes his wife Mary, three young children and his parents. She said DiNardo, whose 38th birthday is Wednesday, had a personality that no one could forget. ""Marc was not a selfish man. He was a moral man; a man who gave himself for those who couldn't care for themselves,"" she said. DiNardo's family plans to donate his organs, said Joe Scott, president of LibertyHealth and its Jersey City Medical Center. ""This unselfish act will live on in the lives that Marc will impact through organ donation."" Officer Michael Camacho, who was also wounded in the shootout, was upgraded from critical to serious condition and moved out of the intensive care unit, Scott said Monday. Camacho was shot in the neck during the gun battle. The other three officers were treated at a hospital and released.","Marc DiNardo was one of five officers injured in New Jersey shootout last week .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Two Pakistani men accused of providing logistical support for last year's deadly terror attacks in Mumbai, India,  were arrested Saturday in Italy, police said. They were arrested in the northern Italian city of Brescia, said Stefano Fonzi, head of Italy's Division of General Investigations and Special Operations. The attacks on India's largest city lasted four days. The attackers targeted several sites in Mumbai, taking over several hotels and a Jewish center. The attacks left 160 people dead. On November 25, 2008, the day before the attacks in Mumbai, the two men arrested allegedly transferred $229 that was used to activate Internet phone lines used by the suspects. Two others connected with the longstanding money transfer agency in Brescia also were arrested for other illegal activity, Fonzi told CNN. Police are looking for a fifth man. Italian police started their investigation the following month after being alerted by Indian authorities and the FBI that funds had been transferred from Italy, Fonzi said. Authorities suspected the agency after money was transferred under the Muslim name of a man who had never entered Italy, a police statement said. Indian police have said 10 Pakistanis were involved in the deadly assault, nine of whom were killed in the carnage. The lone surviving suspect has linked the coordinated shooting and bombing incidents to the leader of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a militant group that is banned in India. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Two men arrested in Italy in connection with November 2008 Mumbai, India, terror attacks .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Carrie Prejean has filed a lawsuit against Miss California USA officials who stripped her of her title, accusing them of libel and religious discrimination for her views on same-sex marriage. Carrie Prejean was stripped of her Miss California USA title earlier this year. ""We will make the case that her title was taken from her solely because of her support of traditional marriage,"" her attorney, Charles LiMandri, said in a news release. Prejean stepped into controversy at the Miss USA pageant in April when, in response to a question from a judge, she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage. Prejean finished as first runner-up. The complaint was filed in Superior Court of California against Miss California USA officials Keith Lewis and Shanna Moakler, as well as publicist Roger Neal. It alleges that Prejean suffered because of ""libel, public disclosure of private facts, religious discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress."" LiMandri had threatened to file a defamation lawsuit if Lewis did not retract statements he made about the former beauty queen. LiMandri's letter to Lewis' attorney also accused Lewis of setting Prejean up to be fired because of her statements opposing same-sex marriage. When Prejean, 22, was dethroned in June, Lewis said it was for ""contract violations,"" including missed public appearances. He said then it wasn't one thing Prejean did, but ""many, many, many things."" ""She came to us and said I'm not interested in your input; I'll make my own decision what I'm going to do,"" Lewis told CNN's Larry King in June. ""You know, when you have a contract, when you're working for someone, you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is."" Lewis said it was clear ""she was not interesting in upholding the title or the responsibilities."" After that interview, LiMandri penned a letter to Lewis' attorney saying, ""Carrie Prejean's good name has been tarnished by your client's false and defamatory accusations."" ""Please view this letter as a last opportunity for Mr. Lewis to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name,"" LiMandri wrote. He denied any contract violations by Prejean, calling those claims a ""complete and utter pretext"" for her firing. The list Lewis gave to reporters of Prejean's missed appearances was ""an outright fraud,"" he said. ""She did not think it was appropriate for her to accept Mr. Lewis' invitation to attend a gay documentary in Hollywood promoting same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""It was not my client's job, as Miss California, simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a Hollywood agent and producer, or gay activist."" Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump announced in May that Prejean could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. Trump later reversed himself. ""I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization, and I gave her the opportunity to do so,"" Trump said. ""Unfortunately, it just doesn't look like it is going to happen, and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision.""","Carrie Prejean was stripped of Miss California USA title earlier this year .

"Washington (CNN) -- A dispute over abortion between the only remaining Kennedy in Congress and his Roman Catholic bishop has highlighted the political volatility of the issue and the challenge it presents to the nation's Catholics. ""How can you claim to be a Catholic and also support abortion?"" Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, asked Monday, discussing his request that Rep. Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, stop receiving Holy Communion because of his pro-choice politics. Kennedy went public Sunday about Tobin's request, originally made in a private letter to Kennedy in 2007. Tobin responded with a statement Sunday followed by his television appearance Monday, in which he acknowledged holding Kennedy to a higher standard than an ordinary parishioner because of the congressman's position as a legislator who can shape abortion laws and policy. The issue is considered much broader than a public rift between the two men. A sweeping health care bill in Congress could get derailed by conflicts over abortion language, with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops last week criticizing a Senate version of the measure for lacking the tougher language adopted earlier by the House. Kennedy, a member of the most influential Catholic family in U.S. history, is the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and nephew of the late John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Catholic president. When running for president in 1960, John Kennedy famously said he was ""not the Catholic candidate for president,"" but ""the Democratic Party's candidate for president who also happens to be be a Catholic."" Edward Kennedy was known for his liberal policies, including support for a woman's right to choose an abortion. When he died earlier this year, a Roman Catholic funeral Mass was held in Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica. Patrick Kennedy holds similar views to his late father, and the dispute with Tobin festered anew when Kennedy publicly criticized the Catholic Church for opposing health care reform that lacked stringent anti-abortion language. Requests to Kennedy's offices in Washington and Rhode Island for comment Monday went unanswered. Tobin, appearing on CNN, called Kennedy's support of abortion ""a scandal."" Asked why he was singling out Kennedy, Tobin said the congressman started the dispute by attacking the church's opposition to a health care bill that lacks tough abortion restrictions. He acknowledged ""a difference between someone who is the average Catholic in the pew ... and someone like the congressman who is in a high-profile position and is in a position to affect legislation on allowing access to abortion."" Other Catholics questioned Tobin's stance. ""The simple fact is that most bishops don't want to deny communion to politicians, and we know for a fact that Pope John Paul II gave communion to pro-choice Italian politicians,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University. ""So the question is, is Bishop Tobin more Catholic than the pope on this?"" Politicians have previously run afoul of Catholic bishops on the abortion issue. Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to stop receiving communion when she was a pro-choice governor of Kansas, and former St. Louis Archbishop Raymond Burke said in 2004 he would deny communion to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for being pro-choice. Brian McLaren, a longtime Christian pastor who has written a book coming out next year called ""A New Kind of Christianity,"" said politicizing religious views limits the perception and, eventually, the impact of a church's teachings. ""Both Catholics and Protestants have allowed themselves to be pushed into this kind of binary, either-or thinking"" on abortion and homosexuality, McLaren said. ""It's disturbing for me as a non-Catholic to see the Catholic Church possibly risking its moral authority on a number of other issues by only focusing on abortion."" The Roman Catholic church strongly opposes abortion, which has been legal across the United States since 1973. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops lobbied for tight restrictions on federal funding of abortion in the health care bill the House passed earlier this month. In an October interview, Kennedy criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the health care bill if it lacked the tough restrictions. In the House debate on the measure, Kennedy opposed a provision with the church-backed restrictions on federal money for abortions, but voted in favor of final passage of the bill that included that language. He repeated that criticism and revealed Tobin's earlier admonition in an interview published Sunday, the 46th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Tobin responded by calling Kennedy's position ""unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members."" Most bishops and priests oppose using communion as a ""political weapon,"" and Kennedy's disclosure of Tobin's admonition may be an attempt to push back against the bishops' support for the abortion restrictions in the House bill, CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen said. ""The Catholic bishops have been fairly successful, at least to date, at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform, and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who don't share their views,"" Allen said. Kennedy's decision to come forward ""in effect puts the Catholic  bishops in a negative light, because it ends up making them look intolerant."" To McLaren, the admonishment by Tobin displays an inconsistency. ""The bishops have taken I think a wise stand against the proliferation of nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""Would they apply withholding of the Eucharist to someone who supports increasing nuclear stockpiles?"" The health care debate reveals the depth of division on the issue, according to McLaren. Both sides apparently believe they are advocating language that makes the legislation effectively ""abortion neutral,"" meaning it doesn't change existing abortion law. ""What we discovered is 'abortion neutral' is a matter of interpretation,"" McLaren said, adding: ""This is what happens in the politics of polarization. Each side plays to its more extreme base. It makes common ground and respectful dialogue harder to achieve. The idea that we're playing a win-lose game, that you're saying if you don't agree with us, we're not even going to have a conversation with you, that attitude chills civil discourse.""","Rep.

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Obama sent a direct message to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weeks before this month's disputed election, Iranian sources said Wednesday. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls for an end to protests last week at Tehran University. The letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations, the sources said. The sources said that Khamenei has yet to reply to the letter but that nonetheless it ""had set the negotiating table in order for both sides to sit around it after the election."" The White House refused to ""get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating,"" a senior Obama administration official said. ""We have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the Iranians in a variety of ways,"" the official said. Khamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on Friday at Tehran University. ""The U.S. president said that we were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street,"" the Iranian leader said. ""Some people attributed these remarks to Obama, and then they write letters to say we're ready to have ties, that we respect the Islamic Republic, and on the other hand, they make such comments. Which one should we believe?"" One Iranian source said, ""We thought President Obama would send congratulations to President Ahmadinejad,"" and before the election, his senior advisers prepared a response to the anticipated note, which never came. The Iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting U.S.-Iranian negotiations.  Watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement » . ""The longer it is delayed,"" the source said, ""the less likely [U.S.-Iranian talks] will happen."" Another Iranian government official said there is still ""no trust"" between Iran and the United States. The source said he is waiting for ""real change"" even though the Iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the Obama administration before the current election turmoil in Iran. The official went on to cite a recent gesture by Iran toward Obama: the release of journalist Roxana Saberi. The official said Iran accepted Obama's assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the Iranian citizen to leave the country. Since, under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over Tehran's violent crackdown on street protests, Obama has sharpened his language on Iran. ""The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days,"" Obama said Tuesday, adding that he strongly condemns ""these unjust actions."" He has not spoken in support of Ahmadinejad or his main rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose supporters have taken to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 election that gave Ahmadinejad a second term. Obama's letter to Khamenei is in keeping with his publicly stated aim of engagement with Iran and his New Year's message in which he described a new way forward. The Obama administration has ""made it clear that any real dialogue -- multilateral or bilateral -- needed to be authoritative,"" according to the senior administration official. The official noted that the Iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on Iran's nuclear program April 8. At that time, the administration asked the European Union's international policy chief, Javier Solana, to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany. But the administration's tack toward Iran may be changing, as senior officials in Washington said the Obama administration is seriously considering not extending further invitations to Iranian diplomats for July 4 celebrations overseas. Some invitations had been sent and will not be rescinded, senior administration officials said. The officials said intense discussions on the issue were taking place, but the final decision had not been made. The Obama administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of Obama's policy of engaging the Iranian regime. As part of that engagement, Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year, and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government. CNN's Elise Labott and Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","White House refuses to ""get into the specifics,"" administration official says .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- The importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. So, what's the deal? Do references matter? Do employers even check them anymore? What's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer? Who are the best people to include as references? And, if an employer doesn't call any of your references, is it a bad sign? While the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer, overall, yes, references do still matter. The process has just changed. ""References play a huge role in the hiring process, perhaps now more than ever,"" said Heather R. Huhman, founder and president of Come Recommended, an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers."" Oftentimes, hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview, only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again. By checking a candidate's references, hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company. In this economy, where hiring budgets are slim, every hire must be a great fit."" Provided references are no guarantee . Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. ""[Hiring] decisions cannot be based on information that is discriminatory in nature, so to avoid any liability, the checks are forgone,"" Harsh said. ""Sadly, the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun."" Steve Langerud, director of career development at Depauw University, adds that sometimes, the quality of references is benign. ""Everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees, but in the end, they offer little substance to a new employer,"" he says. ""Legally, they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields."" Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. ""Employers are more likely to check the informal, but tangible, behavioral reference sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, credit history [or] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates,"" he said. ""Candidates should be much more intentional about crafting a professional identity that serves the role of a 'reference' but within the context of the work, profession and colleagues you seek to engage. It eliminates the weaknesses inherent in the old style of references that become so watered down they are useless."" Making the right choices . The last thing you want to do is give an employer useless references, but many job seekers make the mistake of not taking the time to thoughtfully choose the right people to speak on their behalf, said Elaine Varelas, managing partner for Keystone Partners, an outplacement and talent management consulting firm. ""You want people who can speak to your role as a professional, not as a nice neighbor,"" Varelas said. ""Candidates can make their references count by prepping them to discuss their specific skills as they relate to the job and the impact they brought to the job, which can be just the differentiation needed in this highly competitive market."" Harsh agrees that when he receives a résumé with references attached, he gives them virtually no weight. ""They seldom are specific to the role my company seeks and are not meaningful in considering qualifications or traits of successful candidate,"" he said. Finally, when it comes to protocol for submitting references, the process has changed as well. It used to be that applicants sent them in with their other application materials, but now, Varelas says, you should wait to provide references until you are asked. ""Most companies do not want your references until the end of the process and they will let you know when to provide a list of names and contact information. Do not send written references,"" she said. ""These do not offer the highest impact as they are not specific on how you will fit into the job you are pursuing. It is better to spend your time preparing your references for the kinds of questions they will be asked, and what they can do to help you close an offer."" Helpful hints . Harsh, Varelas and Langerud offer these 10 tips to ensure you do everything right when it comes to providing references: . 1. Include references only when requested by an employer. 2. Carefully consider whom to provide after discussion with the prospective employer. The time to check references is before an offer is made, but after the candidate is either the final candidate or among the final few for the job. 3. Seek references from people who actually know you and your work. Ask for permission to list them as a reference. 4. Ask directly if they can provide you with a positive reference for the position(s) you are seeking. If they hesitate, move on! 5. Prepare your references about who will be calling them and what to focus on when talking about you. Always ask them to call you after they have been called. 6. Prepare your references to speak consistently about your skills, but not identically. Suggest a different highlight for each person. Have 100 percent confidence in what they will say and how they speak about you, or cross them off the list. 7. Provide accurate contact information about your references, and ask your references how they prefer to be contacted (e-mail, phone, etc.). 8. Let your references know what happens to you and the position(s) you applied for. Thank your references. 9. Prepare a LinkedIn site to demonstrate your skills and interests. 10. Participate in professional blogs to create a history of professional involvement in your field that is independent of your work history.","Refrences still matter these days, but the process has changed on how they are used .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- When Amanda Knox's parents head to Italy for closing arguments in their daughter's murder trial they'll be carrying a present they hope desperately she can use soon: a plane ticket home. In that purchase lies one family's entire hope. Curt Knox and Edda Mellas say their daughter is nothing like the person they've seen depicted before and during her trial. They grimace at the description prosecutors have used in court: that Amanda Knox was a resentful American so angry with her British roommate Meredith Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago. Prosecutors say Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. ""She is totally nonviolent, almost a passive person,"" Mellas told CNN in a joint interview with her former husband. So passive was Knox, the parents said, that she couldn't even continue a kickboxing class because she felt it was too violent. She was so caring, they said, that she would make her friends stop a car to let a spider out rather than kill it. Knox was an easy child to raise in Seattle, Washington, along with her younger sisters Deanna and Ashley, her parents said. She took to soccer early on but hit the books as hard as she played. It was on the field that she earned the nickname Foxy Knoxy, though they say it was rarely used and taken out of context when Kercher was found killed to portray their daughter as a sex-hungry party animal. ""It was totally associated to soccer and how she prepared herself as a defender, waiting to take on a striker going down,"" Curt Knox said. ""So how people read this nickname is totally wrong."" Eventually, though a star player at college, Knox gave up the sport to focus on her education. She knew she wanted to study in Italy and wouldn't be able to leave the team to go abroad. Her mother said she threw herself into jobs to help the family save for the trip, working as a soccer coach, a barista and in a gallery. They recall a young woman far different from the wild party girl depicted by prosecutors, one they said found more enjoyment in going to a coffee house and reading a book than going out to a club. They say she met her former boyfriend and co-accused Sollecito at a classical concert. Yes, they concede, Knox, now 22, and Sollecito say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night Kercher was killed, but that was as wild as it got. They reject the idea of revenge as a motive for Knox to kill Kercher. Mellas said her daughter e-mailed and called to tell her about her new roommate regularly. Knox told her they got along great and spent time together, going to libraries and a chocolate festival. What has happened in Perugia, Italy, is unfathomable to them. On November 2, 2007, at 4 a.m. in Seattle, Mellas was awakened by the phone. ""Amanda called [and said] 'I hate to wake you up, but something's not right here, I think someone's been in my house,' "" Mellas recalled. The door to the home she shared with Kercher had been ajar when she came home that morning, and when Knox got out of a quick shower, she noticed drops of blood. Kercher's door was locked, and Knox couldn't reach her, she told her mother, adding that Sollecito was calling the police. Later, when officers broke down the door to Kercher's room, Mellas said her daughter struggled to understand what was going on, hanging on the few words of Italian she understood at the time. ""They were screaming 'A foot, a foot,' that's what they could see,"" Mellas recalled Amanda Knox saying. When she learned Kercher was dead in the room, a hysterical Knox called her mother, Mellas remembered. ""We were constantly on the phone,"" she said. ""She was tired, scared, there was a murderer out running around and she was afraid to be alone."" On the day Knox was arrested, Mellas was flying to Italy to be with her daughter, to comfort her and help her find a new place to live since her home was still a crime scene. But Mellas' plane was diverted to Switzerland, where she switched on her phone and learned that Knox had been charged with murder. ""I felt physically ill, I went to the bathroom to throw up. I was stuck [in Switzerland] for five hours,"" Mellas recalled, beginning to cry. By the time she reached Italy and was allowed to see her daughter, Mellas had already heard news reports that Knox had confessed. She was flabbergasted and confused. See the evidence against Amanda Knox . ""It was horrible. We cried most of the time,"" Mellas recalled of the first meeting. ""But we held each other and it all made sense. She told me what happened in the interrogation, how they asked her to imagine the possibilities. She talked about being hit, screamed at, threatened; it was the most horrible thing she had ever been through in her entire life."" But even with the way Knox has been treated and portrayed, her parents know they are the lucky parents in this case. ""As parents, the Kercher family received the worst phone call they could get,"" Curt Knox said, adding he believes Kercher has gotten lost in the sensational coverage. ""At least our daughter called us."" After the arrest, Mellas was sure there was a mix-up or problems with translation that would soon be cleared up. But they weren't. When Guede was later arrested in Germany, police said he had been speaking to a friend on a Skype call monitored by police and had been talking about being at Kercher's house. Mellas and Curt Knox were sure again that everything would be fixed. During the conversation, despite saying that he knew who Amanda Knox was, he never indicated she was at the home the night of the murder. But after being jailed, his story changed, and he pointed the finger at Knox and her then-boyfriend, Sollecito. Her family said they've tried to shield Knox from knowing how high-profile the case has gotten and how people are talking about her, discussing what she wears to court and what kind of person she is. But she does know she may be going to jail for a very long time. During closing arguments, prosecutors asked for her to be sentenced to life in prison, shocking her family who had expected a demand for 30 years. Read about the case against Amanda Knox . Still, at occasional prison visits, Curt Knox and Mellas try to give Knox a light at the end of the tunnel. ""We have to try and put on a face that it is going to work out,"" Mellas said, beginning to cry. ""We keep telling her it's taking way longer than expected but she will get out of there. They will not put an innocent 20-year-old in jail, they just can't."" They take solace and hold onto the moments the court allows Knox to share with her parents after the trial has recessed each day. ""They allowed us to go into the back room and say goodbye and hug her, tell her we love her,"" Curt Knox said choking up. ""Just those few seconds are worth a lot.""","Parents of Amanda Knox say they still hope murder trial will acquit their daughter .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war, a defense official said Tuesday. Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday. A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president's decision. But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving, the official said. Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001. The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested. McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday's conference with Obama and other top advisers, which broke up at 10 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, were among the other senior officials in the meeting. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been ""comprehensive and extremely useful."" ""It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there, you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The military has planning under way to send these units: three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations. CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. ""Clearly, if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan, there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces,"" Morrell said. U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision, with 49 percent opposed. The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly, up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March. Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent, with 52 percent opposed. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday. Singh said the international community needs ""to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan, to help it emerge as a modern state."" ""The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,"" he said. ""President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism."" India is one Afghanistan's biggest international donors, contributing $1.2 billion in aid. That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, India's nuclear rival in South Asia. But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support. In addition, several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders, giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier. ""I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week,"" Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly ""on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups."" ""The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India, but we can quietly, behind the scenes, push them to reduce their problems,"" Burns said. CNN's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO allies will also be asked to send more troops, officials say .

"(CNN) -- After the fire, all that was left of Jonathan Reyes' massive Hot Wheels collection was a piece of metal that once was part of a toy car. Jonathan Reyes shows off his new Hot Wheels cars sent by Mattel after they heard his own toys were lost in a fire. But on Wednesday, the arrival of two cardboard boxes at his grandparents' house sent 7-year-old Jonathan flying to the door, said his mother, Jan Reyes. Mattel, the company that makes Hot Wheels, sent racetracks, play sets, stickers, folders, T-shirts, hats and hundreds of toy cars. ""He was speechless,"" Reyes said. ""He didn't say anything. He just smiled. He opened it up. It was like Christmas. All of us were bawling, crying. He was so happy."" Jonathan, who has autism, meticulously collected more than 500 Hot Wheels. But all that was destroyed when his Sylmar home, along with hundreds of other structures, were burned down by wildfires in Los Angeles County. Toys are like anchors for children with autism, psychologists say. They like to play with the same toys, eat familiar foods and be in a consistent environment. When faced with unpredictable changes, they can feel frustrated or anxious and become disruptive, according to experts. On Tuesday, Jonathan and his parents searched for his toys among piles of debris, but they found only a piece of a Hot Wheels car and a rusty tricycle. The rest of Jonathan's toys were reduced to ashes.  Watch the Reyes family return to their home. » . Mattel, with headquarters in El Segundo, California, wanted to get involved after hearing on CNN that Jonathan, who had been collecting Hot Wheels since he was 2, had lost everything. Looking for hope in the ashes. ""We wanted to send as many as possible,"" said Deborah Dicochea, associate manager of the Mattel Children's Foundation, which sends toys globally to children affected by crisis. ""With autistic children, they like sorting them, arranging them."" Offers of toys, a computer, resources to connect to other families dealing with autism and financial donations have been pouring into the family. ""It's wonderful, because he literally lost every toy he had,"" Reyes said. ""He had a personal attachment to all of his toys. Part of autism is they have a little connection to everything and his biggest thing was to his cars. For Mattel to send him the cars and tracks, it's just incredible. He is so happy."" The toll of the disruption to Jonathan's life is starting to become evident. He has been throwing more frequent tantrums as his parents are trying to establish a new routine.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- South American nations have always played a major part in the world of football, and when it comes to the World Cup they are considered among the main contenders every time. But this time around there may be a new threat from the continent making its mark internationally. Nelson Valdez (left) celebrates his goal against Venezuela, Tuesday, to keep Paraguay top in qualifying. Out of 18 World Cup Finals to date, a South American team has won the competition nine times, demonstrating that although Europe may be where the money is, the other side of the Atlantic has the raw talent. Generally speaking, however, the continent's dominance has been largely down to two countries: Brazil, who have won the title an astonishing five times; and Argentina, who have made it to the tournament's final match four times and taken the trophy home twice. The rest of the continent has rarely played a major part in the proceedings. Now, though, as the qualifying stages for the 2010 World Cup Finals gather speed, the two giants are being put to shame by a footballing nation that has, until now, had very limited success at international events: Paraguay. Having only qualified for the finals seven times, and never made it further than the second round of the competition, Paraguay aren't usually seen as a serious threat to the big international teams, but this year the bookmakers may have to take a serious look at the small country from the center of the continent, with a population of just 6.1 million. Following Tuesday night's 2-0 victory over Venezuela, Paraguay cemented their position at the top of the South American qualifying group, with 17 points from eight matches -- four points clear of the faltering Argentina and Brazil, who share second place. So far in the group, the Paraguayans have recorded a 2-0 home win over Brazil and managed to secure a 1-1 draw away to the recent Olympic champions Argentina, proving they can keep up with the best in the world, even without one of their star players, striker Roque Santa Cruz, who was injured for the Buenos Aires fixture. So, how are they managing it? And can they continue this form through the qualifiers and into the finals themselves? Since 2006, the team has undergone some radical changes. A lot of big names in the squad and behind the scenes left the team following Paraguay's relatively poor performance in the World Cup Finals in Germany. So it was goodbye to the old, including Paraguay's most capped player, Carlos Gamarra and coach, Anibal Ruiz, who has been replaced by Argentine Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino. But this left the door open for a whole new face for the nation's team. And the new breed of players clearly have a lot of skill, impressing people all over the world. Players like Santa Cruz, for the English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers, and Edgar Barreto, an integral part of the Reggina Calcio squad in Italy's Serie A, represent Paraguay's swelling talent in the major European leagues. The Paraguayan presence in the world's top leagues, shows the depth of their squad, and it also means players will be given the benefit of experiencing top level football on a regular basis; something that can only aid the development of an already talented player. The style the team plays -- emphasizing a strength in attack, boosted by Santa Cruz and his gifted strike partners, Club America's Salvador Cabanas and Borussia Dortmund's Nelson Valdez -- hints at a tactical change, as well. In the past, the Paraguayans have relied heavily on a solid defense to secure results, and not always had the goals to back that up. Now, although the defense is still strong -- featuring Boca Juniors regular Claudio Morel Rodriguez, and the powerful partnership of Paulo Da Silva and Julio Cesar Caceres -- there is some flair up front, which the manager is capitalizing on. So, with an influx of good players, who are getting the necessary top level experience and a manager who knows how to get the most out of his team, this may be an opportunity for a new country to step to the foreground from South America and end the dominance of Brazil and Argentina. As the table stands now, Paraguay are looking good to qualify, and if they can exercise the same level of skill they have shown in the opening eight matches, they could top the group and head to South Africa as the team to watch in the finals.","In the past Brazil and Argentina have dominated South American football .
Paraguay are challenging, beating Brazil and topping World Cup qualifying group .

"(CNN) -- Doctors chose a woman who survived a shotgun wound to her face as the first recipient of a face transplant after treating her for nearly four years. This image projects what Connie Culp, 46, may look like two years after the face transplant. Connie Culp knew of the Cleveland Clinic's interest in face transplants and approached the medical staff, doctors said at a news conference Tuesday. Dr. Maria Siemionow, the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital's director of plastic surgery research and head of microsurgery training, had more than 20 years of experience in complex transplants. By 2004, Siemionow was looking for the right candidate for a face transplant who wasn't doing it for vanity. ""They are not looking to go out on the street and be beautiful,"" Siemionow told CNN in a 2006 interview. ""Some of these patients, when they were interviewed just said 'I want to walk on the street and just make sure I am not sticking out.' They just want to have a normal face."" The doctors examined the patient's history, motivation and ability to understand the risks of the transplant. And they found Culp to be an ideal candidate. Five years after a gun blast shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip, she had a band of scar tissue extending across her face. ""The most devastating of all was the fact that society had rejected her and children were afraid of her,"" said Siemionow, who led the December 10 transplant operation.  See before and after photos of Culp » . Culp, a mother of two and a grandmother, told her doctors she could understand that some adults would shun her. ""But what really bothered her the most were children -- the children that shied away from her,"" said Dr. Frank Papay, the chairman of Institute of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. ""That sense of innocence, and her not being able to see that innocence really, really affected her."" The shooting . In September 2004, Culp's estranged husband shot her in the face in an attempted murder-suicide outside a restaurant in Hopedale, Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio. Culp was 8 feet away from her husband, Thomas Culp, when he pulled the shotgun's trigger. He then turned the weapon on himself, according to local news reports. They both survived. Thomas Culp was sent to prison. Despite her wounds, she told WTOV in 2008, ""I'll always love him. He was my first love."" At the same time, Culp said, she felt angry. ""I wouldn't be human if I didn't. I forgive him, but I have to go on, you know?"" After the shooting, Culp recuperated in a hospital and in a personal care home for two years. Culp told WTOV she had vision problems and was learning Braille. Her approach to life was to ""keep motivated. Don't sleep your life away -- that could have happened. I could be depressed. I'm not."" As she spoke, her breaths emitted a small whistle from her tracheotomy tube, which protruded from a surgical opening in her neck. ""I cannot smell. I will never be able to smell,"" she said in the interview. Culp was wrong. How doctors transplanted a face . The doctors at the Cleveland Clinic analyzed Culp's injuries using CAT scans and developed plastic models of her skull. They practiced face transplant operation on cadavers several times. Culp met with the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members and psychiatry and psychology specialists who determined that she was an ideal candidate for the surgery. Then, the wait for the right donor began in 2008. ""We thought we were going to wait a long time because we had to find a Caucasian female in her mid 40s to match Connie, so we expected a year before we were able to find a donor,"" said Papay, who is also head of craniofacial surgery. ""Well, three to four months later, I got a call at around midnight from Dr. Siemionow saying 'I think we have a donor.'"" The family of a brain dead woman granted permission to use her face. He likened the preparation for the December transplant to a rocket launch, saying, ""Everything was prepared beforehand very, very, very carefully."" Surgeons sheared out the donor's mid-facial area including the lower eyelids, cheekbones, the nose, some of the sinus and the whole upper jaw, with the blood vessels.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the face transplant » . When it came time to move the donor's parts to Culp, they had to see that the donor and recipient parts aligned. ""One of the ways you can tell that is how your upper teeth fit to the lower teeth,"" Papay said. ""We knew it was like a hand in a glove, exactly where we needed to be."" They secured the bones into Culp's face using titanium plates and screws. Then the microvascular surgeons attached the vessels. They tucked the scars around Culp's ears or underneath her eyelid, where they would not be visible.  How the doctors operated » . Doctors added more skin than needed in case of tissue rejection. After monitoring Culp's progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries. Contrary to science fiction and movies, the surgery did not make Culp look like the donor. ""If you just took the skin and transplanted it to the other patient, the bony structure is different,"" Papay said. ""If you took the bony structure and transplanted it on the other side, it ends up being a composite. So, it doesn't look like the donor. It doesn't look like the recipient. It ends up looking like someone new."" Recovery . At this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp's face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month. Doctors anticipate Culp will be able to have full facial function -- and more expression --  by this winter. In physical therapy, she learns to train her nerves, make facial expressions, smile and purse her lips, doctors said. ""If you cry or you laugh or you smile, it's not like you think about it. You just emotionally do it. So that's a wait and see for us,"" Papay said. ""As far as the emotional one, that's really the key issue. A far as when she laughs, cries and grimaces and gets angry at you...what's her face going to look like? That's the exciting part about it."" Five months after the first face transplant in the United States, Culp lives at home. She has checkups with the medical staff once or twice a month and will do so for the next year, her doctors said. Initially, Culp used immunosuppressants that transplanted kidney, liver or heart patients would normally take. Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. But she showed improvements that enabled the doctors to reduce her regimen to one medication, doctors said. ""She's taking her medications,"" Siemionow said. ""We know she is compliant. She cares about how she looks. She has her hair done in a new color...She is full of life. She does her push-ups. She's on the treadmill. What else can I say?""","Face transplant recipient was shot in 2004 by her husband .

"(CNN) -- Two people were executed Tuesday in China for their part in a tainted milk scandal that killed at least six babies and sickened about 300,000 others, state-run media reported. Zhang Yujun was executed for endangering public safety and Geng Jinping was executed for producing and selling toxic food, the Xinhua news agency said. The tainted formula came to light in September 2008, after several babies fell ill from drinking formula that contained melamine. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants added the chemical to milk products so they would appear to have a higher protein level. The tainted milk caused kidney stones and urinary tract problems in hundreds of thousands of children. The 22 Chinese dairy producers that made the formula have offered compensation to victims' families. In all, 21 people were tried and sentenced in January for their roles in the scandal, Xinhua reported. Among them, Zhang and Geng were sentenced to death, and most others received at least 15 years in prison.","Zhang Yujun and Geng Jinping executed for their roles in toxic milk scandal .

"(CNN) -- The American Psychological Association concluded Wednesday that there is little evidence that efforts to change a person's sexual orientation from gay or lesbian to heterosexual are effective. The report looks at 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007. In addition, the 138-page report -- covering 87 peer-reviewed studies -- said that such efforts may cause harm. ""Contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation,"" said Judith M. Glassgold, chairwoman of the task force that presented the report at the group's annual meeting in Toronto, Canada. The Washington-based association represents more than 150,000 members. ""At most, certain studies suggested that some individuals learned how to ignore or not act on their homosexual attractions. Yet, these studies did not indicate for whom this was possible, how long it lasted or its long-term mental health effects. Also, this result was much less likely to be true for people who started out only attracted to people of the same sex."" In response, the group's governing Council of Representatives passed a resolution Wednesday urging mental health professionals not to recommend to their clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or any other methods. The group's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation reached its conclusion after its review of 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 and finding ""serious methodological problems"" in the vast majority of them. Those few studies that did have ""high-quality"" evidence ""show that enduring change to an individual's sexual orientation is uncommon,"" it said. In addition, the report cited evidence that efforts to switch a person's sexual orientation through aversive treatments might cause harm, including loss of sexual feeling, suicidality, depression and anxiety. Many who tried to change and failed ""described their experiences as a significant cause of emotional and spiritual distress and negative self-image,"" it said. The six-member task force was appointed two years ago to address concerns about ""efforts to promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed through psychotherapy or approaches that mischaracterize homosexuality as a mental disorder."" The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1975. The task force noted that some people attempt to change their sexual orientation because it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and recommended that their mental health care providers help them ""explore possible life paths that address the reality of their sexual orientation, reduce the stigma associated with homosexuality, respect the client's religious beliefs, and consider possibilities for a religiously and spiritually meaningful and rewarding life."" ""In other words,"" said Glassgold, ""we recommend that psychologists be completely honest about the likelihood of sexual orientation change, and that they help clients explore their assumptions and goals with respect to both religion and sexuality."" Alan Chambers, president of Exodus International, a network of more than 250 ministries that he said ""reach out to men and women and families that are affected by what we call 'unwanted same-sex attraction'"" disagrees. He offered himself as proof that such efforts can work. ""The fact is that there are tens of thousands of men and women just like me who once identified as gay,"" Chambers said in a telephone interview. ""For me and for these people, the truth is change is possible."" Chambers said his transformation from gay man began more than 18 years ago, when he attended a support group at the organization he now leads. Chambers, who said he married a woman nearly 12 years ago, has written a book, ""Leaving Homosexuality,"" which was published last month. ""You can't refute a personal story,"" he said, adding that about a third of those who try to switch their sexual orientation through the group's ministries wind up doing so. ""We're not talking a light switch that you turn on and off, we're talking about very deep and complex issues that, I think, take years to resolve."" Though all mainstream health and mental health organizations concluded years ago that homosexuality is not a mental disorder, the American Psychological Association formed the task force to work on the report two years ago after noting a resurgence of groups that identified homosexuality as a defect or spiritual or moral failing.","American Psychological Association: Trying to change orientation can be harmful .

"(CNN) -- Presidential candidates Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are detailing their plans for solving the country's energy crisis and criticizing each other's proposals this week as they campaign in battleground states. Here's a look at the candidates' energy proposals: . Overall strategy . McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, has proposed a national energy strategy that would rely on the technological prowess of American industry and science. McCain has said he would work to reduce carbon emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. He has said he would commit $2 billion annually for 15 years to advance clean coal technology. He also has pledged to oppose a windfall profits tax on oil companies that, according to his campaign Web site, ""will ultimately result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration."" McCain also believes the U.S. needs to deploy SmartMeter technologies, which collect real-time data on the electricity use of individual homes and businesses. Meanwhile, Obama laid out his comprehensive energy plan Monday in Lansing, Michigan. ""If I am president, I will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single, overarching goal -- in 10 years, we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire Middle East and Venezuela,"" the presumptive Democratic nominee told a crowd. Obama's plan also would invest $150 billion over the next 10 years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that he said would harness American energy and create 5 million new jobs. He also called on businesses, government and the American people to meet the goal of reducing U.S. demand for electricity by 15 percent by the end of the next decade and said he would modernize the national utility grid. Another prominent feature in the plan: Immediately give every working family in America a $1,000 energy rebate and pay for it from oil company profits. Offshore drilling . McCain: Proposed lifting the ban on offshore drilling as part of his plan to reduce dependence on foreign oil and help combat rising gas prices. Would let individual states decide whether to explore drilling possibilities. Opposes drilling in some wilderness areas -- including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- and said those places must be left undisturbed. Obama: Opposed new offshore drilling, but later shifted to say that he would consider it if it were part of a larger strategy to lower energy costs. Supports bipartisan energy plan from the Senate that combines alternative energy innovation, financial, nuclear energy and drilling proposals. Effort by five Democrats and five Republicans to break Congress' energy impasse would allow expanded offshore oil exploration and embrace ambitious energy efficiency and efforts to develop alternative fuels. Believes oil companies should drill on the 68 million acres they have access to but haven't used and would require oil companies that will not drill to give up their leases. Strategic oil reserves . McCain advocates suspending the purchase of foreign oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during periods of high prices to reduce demand. Obama called for tapping into strategic oil reserves as part of his plan to provide relief from high gas prices. (He previously said he was opposed to using the strategic reserves, but on Monday he proposed selling 70 million barrels of oil from the reserves to lower gas prices). Cars and driving . McCain: Proposed a $300 million award for ""the development of a battery package that has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars."" Called for the suspension of the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax and 24.4-cent-a-gallon diesel tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Says the lost revenue would be paid for by money from the general fund. Obama: Would provide $4 billion in loans and tax credits to American auto plants and manufacturers so that they can retool factories and build fuel-efficient cars; would put 1 million 150-mpg, plug-in hybrids on U.S. roads within six years and would give consumers a $7,000 tax credit to buy fuel-efficient cars. Nuclear energy . McCain: Calls for building new nuclear reactors, saying barriers to nuclear energy are political, not technological. Would put a plan in place to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 -- with the ultimate goal of 100 new plants. Would provide for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and give host states or localities a proprietary interest so when advanced recycling technologies turn used fuel into a valuable commodity, the public would share in the economic benefits. Obama: Says he'll find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste. In Democratic debate earlier this year, he said, ""We should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix."" Renewable energy . McCain: Would commit $2 billion annually to advance clean coal technologies. Calls for a permanent tax credit, which he says will ""simplify the tax code, reward activity in the U.S., and make us more competitive with other countries,"" according to his campaign Web site. Encourages development of low-carbon fuels -- wind, hydro and solar power. Obama: Would require 10 percent of U.S. energy come from renewable sources by the end of his first presidential term. The plan would extend the Production Tax Credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy. Create five first-of-a-kind, coal-fired demonstration plants that would capture and store carbon dioxide emissions and invest in technology that will allow for more coal use. Climate change . McCain: Proposes a bipartisan plan to address the problem of climate change and stimulate the development and use of advanced technologies. It is a market-based approach that would set caps on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and provide industries with tradable credits. Obama: Calls for a reduction of carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 by using a market-based cap-and-trade system. Would create what his campaign calls a  ""Global Energy Forum"" and re-engage with the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.

"SHENANDOAH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Crystal Dillman says she will never understand why a group of teenage boys beat her fiancé to death. She says she will spend the rest of her life seeking answers -- and justice -- for the man she has lost as she struggles alone to raise her three young children. ""My life is forever destroyed,"" said Dillman, who was 24 at the time of her fiancé's death. ""My family is forever destroyed."" Her fiancé, Luis Ramirez, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, was walking down the street in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, on July 12, 2008, with Dillman's half-sister, who is white. A fight broke out between him and a group of white high school football players. He died from his injuries two days later, leaving a small community stunned at the brutality of the crime. A central issue in the case is race in a town with a reputation for being an ethnic melting pot. Witness Eileen Burke said she heard the group call Ramirez a ""spic."" One of the boys who was charged as a juvenile, Brian Scully, admitted telling Ramirez to ""go home, you Mexican motherf---er."" Residents speak out about the crime, racial overtones . Scully was charged with ethnic intimidation. Another teen pleaded guilty to federal civil rights violations in a plea deal. But two teens who faced a local jury were acquitted of charges of ethnic intimidation. Dillman doesn't doubt that the attack was racially motivated. ""They said some racist remarks to him,"" Dillman said of the teens. ""Truly, in my heart, I believe they beat him up because he was Latino."" Many in Shenandoah deny that race played a role and say it was just a street fight gone wrong. The young men involved were ordinary high school students -- good kids, according to their families, friends and coaches. Shenandoah resident interrupts CNN interview . It took almost two weeks for arrests to be made. But on July 25, Colin J. Walsh, 17, and Brandon J. Piekarsky, 16, were charged as adults with homicide and ethnic intimidation. Derrick M. Donchak, 18, was charged as an adult with aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation. Walsh, who admitted throwing a punch that left Ramirez unconscious, got straight A's in school and ran track. His father says he was never a troublemaker. See photos of key figures in the case . But how do ordinary kids get caught up in such a brutal incident? Experts say everyone has biases, and violent instincts are common, especially in young adults. Young offenders . ""Hate is part of our culture,"" said Jack Levin of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern University. ""It transcends generations, it's widely shared, and it's learned from an early age,"" Levin said. ""Even otherwise decent, honorable people can be pulled into it."" Jack McDevitt of Northeastern University's Institute on Race and Justice said, ""We all carry around biases with us, and it's not the extraordinary monster that decides to act on it. Generally speaking, it's someone more like us and our children than a member of the [Ku Klux] Klan."" Research conducted by both Levin and McDevitt shows that there are three major types of hate crime offenders: . • ""Thrill seekers"" who look for excitement and power in attacking a person they perceive as different. • ""Retaliators"" who seek revenge for a real or perceived crime against someone similar to the attacker. • ""Defenders"" who are trying to protect their neighborhood or way of life. Perhaps the most expected type is also the rarest: an offender who may be a member of a group like the KKK and has a deep-seated hatred of a specific ethnic group. ""Hate criminals, most of them young men, believe they are carrying out the fervent, unspoken wishes of their communities,"" said Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report. McDevitt says offenders often ""believe other people share their biases ... everybody feels the way they do, or at least the majority."" By taking action, he says, they think ""they're being heroic while others are scared."" Communities most likely to experience a hate crime have a ""special combination of ethnic homogeneity and a rapid in-migration of groups perceived to be outsiders,"" according to Donald Green, a professor at Yale University. He says a ""flashpoint"" can occur ""when there's a boundary-crossing."" For example, ""an inter-ethnic, inter-sex relationship on public display."" Offenders sense that an outside group is crossing a boundary, and when women are involved, it can trigger a defensive reaction, especially among young men. Shenandoah's rich immigrant heritage has long been a source of pride in the former coal-mining town, and families have held tight to their cultural traditions for generations. But an influx of Latinos in the late 1990s brought some discomfort. Cheap housing and jobs in agriculture and construction drew undocumented immigrants -- among legal Latino residents and citizens -- to a community that was struggling economically. Crimes against Latinos rising . FBI statistics show that anti-Latino crimes are on the rise. There were 595 anti-Latino crimes in 2007, up almost 40 percent from the 426 crimes in 2003; the Latino population in America grew only 14 percent during that time. In December, Ecuadorean Jose Osvaldo Sucuzhañay died after he was beaten with a baseball bat in Brooklyn, New York. One month earlier, a group of seven teenagers with a history of harassing Latinos went out looking for ""Mexicans to f--- up"" and fatally stabbed Ecuadorean immigrant Marcelo Lucero in Patchogue, New York. FBI figures from 2007 show that anti-Latino attacks account for about 8 percent of all hate crimes. About 35 percent of hate crimes were directed at blacks, 16 percent at homosexuals and 13 percent at Jews. But experts say hate crimes in general are underreported. States are not required to report those figures to the FBI. And it can also be hard for law enforcement and prosecutors to prove that a perpetrator's motive was hate, especially if a robbery occurs or the attacker had a prior relationship with the victim. Often, the victims themselves -- especially Latinos who may not be in the United States legally -- don't report the crimes and may mistrust the police. McDevitt says many victims may not realize or want to acknowledge that they have been the target of a hate crime. Experts say communities can heal after hate crimes occur, and even prevent them from happening altogether, if local leaders take certain steps. ""Different people need to be welcomed,"" McDevitt said. Donald Green says a community can portray change as positive, ""saying, 'we've got more great restaurants, more people who work hard, more people who are family-oriented,' "" for example. Still struggling . Eventually, Piekarsky was convicted of simple assault and consumption of alcohol, and Donchak was convicted of simple assault, and three counts of corruption of a minor, providing alcohol to minors and consumption of alcohol. The jury acquitted Piekarsky and Donchak of ethnic intimidation charges. Piekarsky was sentenced to between six and 23 months in prison and Donchak from seven to 23 months. Walsh pleaded guilty to violating Ramirez's civil rights. More than a year after Ramirez's death, Shenandoah is still struggling. Civil rights officials at the Department of Justice are investigating the death and the actions of the Shenandoah police officers who urged the boys to get their stories straight before talking to investigators. But there is no closure for Crystal Dillman. ""It's not done for me,"" she said, ""not by a long shot. That's not justice at all. Not even close.""","Small town stunned by death of Mexican immigrant after fight with white teens .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Shoes tell a lot about a person. If you stumbled into my closet, you would probably think I was a security guard, a construction worker or a Nurse Ratched wannabe. My taste in shoes tends to be boxy, low-heeled and sturdy. If the equipment isn't cleaned properly, you could be at risk for infection when you get a pedicure. So it probably doesn't surprise you to learn that when it comes to pedicures, I am hardly a nail salon enabler. Unfortunately, in some sort of twisted cosmic comedy, both my teen and my tween daughters are pedicure addicts. To pedicure addicts, there is nothing better than being seated in those massive padded massage chairs, chin deep in fashion magazines, while some woman bathes, chisels, files and paints their toes. And up until now, the only thing I worried about was how much the extra flower motif on her big toe was going to cost me. Now, I have plenty of other stuff to worry about. Dr. Dina Tsentserensky, a podiatrist in New York, made it clear. ""I definitely see patients that have had problems as a result of getting a pedicure,"" she said. ""I guess the most common is fungal nails."" Fungal nails!!! I really don't want to pay for that. The National Institutes of Health, unfortunately, describes fungal nail in less-than-clear terms: Fungal nail infection is an infection of the nails by a fungus. Prescription treatments are only about 50 percent effective, and most of these infections usually require the loss of the infected nail itself, the NIH Web site says. Cuts, scrapes and some other infections are also common results of seemingly soothing foot romps. Tsentserensky thinks it's nothing new. ""I think it's a chronic problem that has been going on for a while,"" she said. ""People just maybe chose to ignore it or don't pay attention as much as they should."" Anyone who did pay attention could have known about some of those risks eight years ago. That's when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported finding a nasty infection that hit more than 100 pedicure patients. The culprit: a less-than-sterile footbath screen. The result: an infection called mycobacterium fortuitum. That mouthful of a malady left these customers, most of them women, with prolonged boils on their lower legs and some long-term scars. Although that report prompted nail salons to clean the screens on those foot baths more often, it doesn't mean that in the land of pedicure pampering, you can just relax and enjoy the polishing. Tsentserensky's chief advice is to be on high cleanliness alert. ""I tell patients to make sure that the bathtubs are being cleaned properly, that they are using enough time in between so the disinfectant has time to work,"" she said. And the magic timeframe, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, is about 10 minutes between clients. The EPA also stresses that to ensure the safest conditions, the tubs need to be cleaned with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant, which means the bottle itself will have a EPA registration number listed somewhere on the label. But it's not just the tubs that need to be clean. So do those instruments. ""Make sure that instruments are getting sterilized properly,"" Tsentserensky cautions, ""that they are using a sterilizer or an autoclave to properly sanitize the instruments or using the liquids for the proper periods of time."" Timing is also important, but that's a condition that's on your side. Don't get a pedicure right after you've shaved your legs, had laser hair removal or have any cuts or bites on your legs. Any opening in the skin is an invitation that you might not want to be extending. And finally, make sure you can communicate with your nail technician to ensure he or she is taking the proper precautions to make your pedicure a stress-free experience and, more important, to ensure that the only thing you're taking with you when you leave that salon is the pretty polish.","Some people get fungal nails or infections from pedicures .

"One doctor says the study ""very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine."" A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder. Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007. The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups, who have long blamed mercury, a neurotoxin, for the disorder. For years, parents have been concerned that a mercury-containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism. But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines. The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism, although advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected. Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent: Let me explain. In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines. Some people believed autism would decrease as a result, because they thought the two were connected. A new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry says this just didn't happen. Researchers looked at cases of autism in California after 1999. They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed. Just the opposite happened. From 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3- to 5-year-olds, the autism rate continued to go up, from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California. A child psychiatrist who supported the study said it ""very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine."" But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines. The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn't include children under the age of 3, which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines. It says thimerosal wasn't completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003. Their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin, so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines? What do scientists think causes autism? As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism, and doctors still don't know why. Doctors point to genetics and environment as culprits, but it could be more complicated than that. The latest research shows these children are not necessarily born with autism but with the potential to develop it. What exactly are these outside factors? It's hard to pinpoint. What we eat, what we breathe, what we drink -- all these things could play a role. Some doctors say the increase is due to a change in the way the condition is diagnosed  kids who were once labeled mentally retarded are now being labeled as autistic. What are possible signs of autism in your child? Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months. Some red flags that indicate your child may have autism: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, no brief phrases by 24 months, loss of language or social skills. If you see any of these signs, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends seeing a pediatric neurologist, developmental pediatrician or child psychologist. What led companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines to begin with? Several things pushed companies in this direction. Over the past decade, more and more attention was given to the health effects of mercury on humans. And then in the '90s, the CDC added new vaccines to the list of routine shots that children should get. Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative. This was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury. So the FDA began looking into the issue. In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.",Removal of thimerosal from most vaccines hasn't reduced the number of autism cases diagnosed in the state of California.
"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) --   An advisory panel is recommending a major step up in protection for health workers dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have H1N1 influenza. One expert says that based on current knowledge, N95 respirators offer health workers the best protection. The Institute of Medicine said Thursday, in recommendations requested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that loose paper masks are inadequate because the workers could still breathe in the virus. Instead, health workers should switch to N95 respirators that form an airtight seal around the nose and mouth. If properly fitted and worn correctly, N95 respirators filter out at least 95 percent of particles as small as 0.3 micrometers, which is smaller than influenza viruses, the report notes. The institute provides independent, evidence-based advice to policymakers, health professionals, private entities and the public. It is one of four groups that make up the National Academies. The study released Thursday was requested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. ""Scientists do not know to what extent flu viruses spread through the air or whether infection requires physical contact with contaminated fluids or surfaces,"" a summary of the report says. It calls for ""a boost in research to answer these questions and to design and develop better protective equipment that would enhance workers' comfort, safety and ability to do their jobs."" ""Based on what we currently know about influenza, well-fitted N95 respirators offer health care workers the best protection against inhalation of viral particles,"" said committee chairman Kenneth Shine, executive vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Texas in Austin. He is a former president of the institute. ""But there is a lot we still don't know about these viruses, and it would be a mistake for anyone to rely on respirators alone as some sort of magic shield."" Health care workers should use several strategies to guard against infection, such as innovative triage processes, washing hands, disinfecting, wearing gloves, getting vaccinated and using antiviral drugs, Shine said. The institute was asked specifically to evaluate personal protective equipment designed to guard against respiratory infection, and therefore the committee focused on the efficacy of medical masks and respirators.","Panel recommends health care workers wear N95 respirators for H1N1 patients .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama toasted a growing U.S. friendship with India at the first state dinner of his administration Tuesday, an evening of regal pageantry and symbolic politics in a tent on the White House South Lawn. ""To the future that beckons all of us,"" Obama said with glass raised toward his guest of honor, visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""Let us answer its call. And let our two great nations realize all the triumphs and achievements that await us."" A tradition dating back to 1874, state dinners are the most treasured and formal honor a U.S. president can offer a foreign dignitary, and the most coveted invitation in Washington. The Tuesday night dinner showed Obama's intention to signal strong ties with the world's largest democracy and go his own way in navigating the pomp and tradition of White House customs. Traditionally, a new administration's first invitation goes to the leader of neighboring Canada or Mexico, though recent presidents also haven't followed that precedent. The event planned by first lady Michelle Obama emphasized eco-friendly themes such as White House-grown herbs and lettuce served to guests and sustainably harvested magnolia branches -- from species native to both India and the United States -- in arrangements adorning the tent where more than 300 guests wearing tuxedos and gowns were wined, dined and entertained. A White House document said common themes of state and official visits are ""forging friendships, exchanging knowledge and building bridges that last for years."" In a toast that followed Obama's, Singh praised his host's leadership and prompted applause by citing the charm of the U.S. first lady. Obama's election was ""an inspiration to all those who cherish the values of diversity, democracy and equal opportunity,"" Singh said, adding that India ""warmly applauded"" the Nobel Peace Prize awarded Obama this year for ""the healing touch you have provided and the power of your idealism and your vision."" ""We need to find new pathways of international cooperation that respond more effectively to the grave challenges caused by the growing interdependence of nations,"" Singh said. ""As two leading democracies, India and the United States must play a leading role in building a shared destiny for all humankind."" Obama, in a black tuxedo, and the first lady, in a dazzling cream gown with silver accents, greeted Singh and his wife, Gursharan Kaur, as they arrived, shaking hands on the White House steps and posing for pictures before leading their guests inside. Guests in tuxedos and evening gowns streamed into the White House for the historic social event, passing a line of journalists. In one humorous mishap, the cummerbund of Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, fell off as he and his wife walked in. The guest list included political allies, a few opponents, celebrities and members of the Indian diplomatic community. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the list, but not her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Democratic colleagues of the president including other Cabinet ministers, several senators and top aides made the list, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts (but not his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and White House Budget Director Peter Orszag. Ticker: See the list of expected attendees . A couple of Republicans also made it, notably Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. Celebrities included Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, actors Alfre Woodard and Blair Underwood, CBS News anchor Katie Couric and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman. However, one name rumored to be included, but not appearing on the list, was Oprah Winfrey. The dinner, in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn with a view of the Washington Monument, featured round tables for 10 set in resplendent colors -- apple green, ruby, gold -- with floral arrangements of roses, hydrangeas and sweet peas in plum, purple and fuchsia. Place settings in fine china from three previous administrations -- Eisenhower, Clinton and George W. Bush -- were flanked by five pieces of silverware and crystal glasses. Place cards were in script -- ""The President"" and ""Mrs. Obama"" read two. A seasonal menu reflecting both American and Indian flavors started with a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion seed vinaigrette, according to the White House. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese followed, and then a choice of entrees -- roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chick peas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns, caramelized salsify and smoked collard greens. Dessert was pumpkin pie tart and pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course was paired with a different wine, all of American vintage. The herbs and lettuces were harvested from the White House Kitchen Garden started by Michelle Obama, with honey from the White House beehive used to poach the dessert pears. Entertainment was by jazz vocalist Kurt Elling, Grammy and Academy Award-winner Jennifer Hudson, the National Symphony Orchestra directed by award-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch, Academy Award-winning Indian musician and composer A.R. Rahman, and The President's Own United States Marine Band. ""It's not every day you get to sing at the White House or even get invited to the White House,"" said Hudson, who said she would dress in a purple and black gown ""with the longest train I've ever worn"" and sing standards including ""The Very Thought of You,"" ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" and ""Somewhere."" Veterans of state dinners said the planning for such a trend-setting event is meticulous. ""It's stressful, it's very stressful,"" said Lisa Caputo, a press secretary for Hillary Clinton when she was first lady. ""What is the first lady going to wear? What will be served? How are the flower arrangements being done? There's a lot of protocol in terms of the serving line."" Every unit in the White House weighs in on the dinner's guest list, Caputo said, with a lot of thought going into who sits where. ""There's particular protocol in terms of who is seated at the president's table and the prime minister's table,"" Caputo said. ""But don't forget that an enormous amount of thought goes into that with the White House social office and the president and first lady in terms of who will round out the appropriate table, who will get along with who, what will be the dynamics of each table. ""Yes, of course it's social, but, of course, there's business done,"" Caputo said. The final list is ultimately decided by the president and the first lady, said Anita McBride, who was chief of staff for first lady Laura Bush. ""Of course, having friends and supporters is really important to share that kind of event, and it's also important for all the other guests that are there and the Indian members of the delegation to meet these people that are a cross-section of America,"" McBride said. Amy Zantzinger, who was a social secretary for President George W. Bush, said all state dinners are different, and an administration's first one is a big one. ""First they'll bring the newness -- the newness of the whole day because it's their first big dinner,"" she said. What makes a successful dinner? It's what you don't plan, Zantzinger said. During a Reagan state dinner, Princess Diana and actor John Travolta took to the dance floor. ""What made it so special was that it was so absolutely spontaneous,"" she said. ""You had one of the most beautiful women in the world and one of the best dancers in the world come together in this incredible place, and I think the spontaneity of it and the combination of the two of them was perfection.""

"Editor's note: Tananarive Due is an American Book Award-winning and NAACP Image Award-winning novelist. She is based in Los Angeles. Her Web site is http://www.tananarivedue.com/. The Due sisters -- Johnita, left, Tananarive, center, and Lydia -- prepare for a Jackson concert in 1984. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson died Thursday, and my family gathered by telephone from Florida, Texas, California and Georgia to mourn and remember. But we began mourning long ago. I was 17 when the ""Motown 25th Anniversary Special"" aired in 1983, and my parents, sisters and I first saw Michael Jackson moonwalk to ""Billie Jean."" He sent a lightning bolt through our living room, and all of us leaped to our feet with shouts. He may have been the best entertainer I live to see. His music asked us to transcend race and geography, hate and bigotry, and made us feel like we were the world. In recent months, I showed my 5-year-old son, Jason, that Motown performance on YouTube. ""Billie Jean"" made Jason want to moonwalk and wear a glove. ""Beat It"" inspired Jason to kick his leg and fling his head from side to side like Michael. But it has been a long time since I could watch Michael Jackson videos without feeling sad. His death is only the next stage of the loss. Michael Jackson left the music world to mourn -- but many of us, especially black Americans, felt like we lost a family member on Thursday. He pained and puzzled us, but we still loved him. Until Thursday, some of us had forgotten how much. Michael was not always easy to love. He tested us, sometimes asking us to ignore what we could see with our own eyes. We may never know fully what Michael did or didn't do, but he was like the lost relative we wished we could bring back to shore. When Jason asked questions about Michael's changing face in the videos, I showed him the beautiful brown-skinned, bright-eyed little boy who grew up in my family's living room. There is supreme irony in the death of Michael Jackson the same year as the inauguration of the first black president. Michael, who would ascend higher than any black artist in music history, learned a bitter lesson: Even at the top of the mountain, there is only the man in the mirror. Jason isn't old enough to fully understand black and white, why his grandmother was sent to jail for ordering a hamburger at a Woolworth lunch counter in 1960, or how an ill-used child's soul might never find its way back home. So I told Jason about the time Mommy, Grandma, Grandpa, Aunt Lydia and Aunt Johnita [now an assistant general counsel at CNN] drove from Miami to Jacksonville to see the Jacksons' Victory Tour in 1984, when Michael Jackson ruled the world. How his aunties and I dressed up for the concert in our own gloves. After the concert, still floating from the surreal experience, we approached a stretch limousine on the highway. As my father sidled our car closer and my sisters and I pressed our noses to the window to try to see, the limo's tinted electric window slid down. A sparkling silver glove waved out to us. When we saw that glove, the whole car screamed -- even my father, who was driving. My sisters and I begged my father to follow the limousine...and it finally came to a stop in front of our budget hotel. When the rear door opened, a white blond-haired decoy stepped out -- wearing a silver Michael Jackson glove. If only we'd never seen past the tinted window. If only we had a perfect memory of Michael waving goodbye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tananarive Due.","Tananarive Due: My family mourned the loss of Michael Jackson last week .

"(CNN) -- Health officials say the H1N1 virus, commonly known as the swine flu, is likely to cause more illnesses and deaths in the United States, even though much of the initial anxiety has eased. A researcher investigates swine flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported higher levels of flu activity than the average for mid-May and an unusual number of outbreaks in schools. Some clinics reported high numbers of respiratory diseases more commonly seen during the peak of flu season. ""We do think that the way the virus is spreading in the U.S., we are not out of the woods, and the disease is continuing,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director for science and public health program at the CDC in a news conference this week. In the United States, six deaths have been linked to the swine flu, although it's unclear whether these were caused by the virus or pre-existing conditions. Nationwide, at least 5,123 cases of H1N1 flu have been reported, although the actual number of people affected may be higher. New data released by the CDC Tuesday showed that the majority of the 30 patients who were hospitalized with H1N1 in California had other medical conditions, such as chronic heart and lung disease, suppressed immune system, diabetes, and obesity. None of the patients died. They had fevers, coughs, vomiting and shortness of breath, according to the CDC report that examined the patients. Six of them were admitted to the intensive care unit and four required mechanical ventilation.  See an explanation of H1N1 flu » . Five of them were pregnant -- two of the fetuses did not survive. Earlier this month, Judy Dominguez Trunnell became the first U.S. resident to die from complications of the H1N1 flu. Her daughter was delivered via emergency Caesarean section. Dominguez Trunnell felt body aches and numbing in the left side of her face and went to the hospital, her husband, Steven Trunnell, told CNN's Larry King.  Watch the interview. » . Trunnell has filed a wrongful death claim against Smithfield Foods, a pork and meat producer, alleging that the company's actions may have contributed to the virus' creation. ""She was a healthy, pregnant woman who was eight months pregnant until she contracted the virus,"" he said. ""She became acutely ill, but she was never diagnosed with any major medical complications of any kind."" Health officials have said repeatedly since the outbreak's beginning that the virus cannot be contracted from eating pork. Pregnancy increases the risk of certain medical problems and creating complications from the flu, Schuchat said. ""There is some immunosuppression that occurs during pregnancy,"" she said. ""There maybe also a role of the mechanical effect of pregnancy in decreasing the lung capacity that maybe you're not easily able to handle lung infection or respiratory problems."" Early steps toward an H1N1 vaccine are being taken. The process could take between five and six months from the time the virus appeared to when the vaccine would be available to the public, officials have said. Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman, said the agency has sent H1N1 strains to roughly seven labs around the world to use in the first steps of  vaccine development. The CDC expects to get the viruses back from the institutions by the end of the month and ""if we do go in the direction of producing a vaccine, we could see the production of pilot lots, and clinical trials, beginning as soon as late June."" Though the initial surveillance of the California cases indicates that most healthy patients recovered and were discharged after short hospital stays,  those with other medical conditions had greater complications. ""Our best estimate right now is that the fatality [with the H1N1] is likely a little bit higher than seasonal influenza, but not necessarily substantially higher,"" Schuchat said. The seasonal flu kills 36,000 people every year. While people of all ages get the seasonal flu, its complications more severely affect older people or those with weakened immune systems. About 95 percent of people who die from the seasonal flu are 65 years old and above, according to the World Health Organization. Many of the confirmed and probable cases for the H1N1 virus have been younger people between the ages of 5 and 24. ""The hospitalizations that we're tracking have this disproportionate occurrence among younger persons,"" Schuchat said. ""That's very unusual to have so many people under 20 requiring hospitalization and in some of those intensive care units."" While there have been no deaths in that age group in the United States, Schuchat said: ""We would not be surprised to see serious hospitalizations and deaths occurring in people in this age group and I think we need to be prepared for that."" ""It's important to dispel the idea that we're out of the woods, or that this was a problem that really didn't merit response,"" she said. ""Influenza is unpredictable, and we really need to stay attuned to that, to be prepared for surprises in the days and weeks ahead."" And the flu viruses can mutate. Dr. Dan Jernigan, deputy director for the CDC's influenza division said last week, ""We're not seeing significant evidence of any mutation towards more virulence in the U.S."" H1N1 flu activity has been confirmed in 22 states and appears to be most active in the Southwest. In April, concerns about the H1N1 virus prompted travel warnings, airport checks and school closures. The outbreak has sickened 9,830 people worldwide and caused at least 79 deaths -- mostly in Mexico, according to the WHO. Last month, U.S. officials discouraged all nonessential travel to Mexico after the flu strain killed dozens of people there. On Friday, the CDC downgraded its warning and advised people with medical complications, advanced age or pregnancy to check with a doctor before going on a trip to Mexico. CNN medical senior producers Saundra Young and Shahreen Abedin contributed to this report.","CDC reported higher levels of flu activity than the average for mid-May .
