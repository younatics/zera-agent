"Washington (CNN) -- Myles Eaddy stands mystified at the edge of the baseball field along the first base line at Nationals Park while the New York Mets warm up for their evening game against the Nationals. His head traces the ball into the outfield with each crack of a bat. Nationals Park is one of several Major League Baseball parks that he has visited this summer with his Little League team, the Anderson Monarchs. As a tribute to Jackie Robinson and the Negro Leagues, the inner city team traveled back in time aboard a vintage 1947 Flxible Clipper touring bus, once used by the Newark Eagles, for the ultimate road trip. The three-week, 4,000-mile journey gave the team from South Philadelphia a glimpse at what Robinson and other players went through during the barnstorming days of the Negro Leagues. R.A. Dickey and the Zen of the knuckleball . ""I'll never forget this,"" said 10-year-old Eaddy. ""It's hard to explain. It's really fun. I get to do all this stuff, meet all these people. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity."" Along the cross-country trip, the Monarchs played games against local youth teams, met surviving players from the Negro Leagues and visited historic sites such as Robinson's grave site in Brooklyn, the Field of Dreams in Iowa and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. Then it's back on the road in the sweltering heat on the un-air-conditioned bus with no electronic games to pass the time -- a reminder of the traveling conditions the early baseball pioneers endured. ""Just like those guys did, there's a lot of card games, a lot of conversation, sitting and just staring out the window,"" said head coach Steve Bandura. ""It's been great, they're not bored."" This week, the team was in Washington, D.C., to play against another youth team in suburban Virginia. Their game attracted a special spectator: Mamie ""Peanut"" Johnson, the only female pitcher in the Negro Leagues. Johnson wanted to meet the Monarchs' only female player and the team's No. 1 pitcher, 11-year-old Mo'ne Davis, known for her sizzling fastball. ""I'm glad to meet them, and I'm glad to meet this young lady here because she reminds me a great deal of me, years ago, long time ago,"" said Johnson, who played for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1953 to 1955. ""It's a joy to see her out there. It makes me feel good."" How church helped sign Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn Dodgers . After the game, the team visited the Lincoln Memorial and stood where Marian Anderson, the namesake of their team's rec center, performed her historic concert on Easter Sunday in 1939. Still wearing their old-school uniforms with high socks, the team huddled around Bandura for a quick refresher on why they were there. The Daughters of the American Revolution forbade Anderson, the legendary contralto singer, to perform at Constitution Hall. But First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt invited Anderson to sing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he explained. ""We represent Marian Anderson,"" Bandura told his team. ""We have the 'A' on our hat and that's what it's there for. And that's why I wanted to bring you guys here."" The next day it was back to baseball, including a visit with Washington Nationals standout shortstop Ian Desmond. ""This is great, you know. This is something these little guys will never forget in their lives,"" Desmond said while passing out batting gloves to the Monarchs. ""When I was a kid I actually got to go to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, and to just experience baseball in a different way kind of makes you appreciate the hard times that people went through."" Eaddy said he doesn't want the trip to end, even if things got a little hot and sticky on the road. ""It's really hot. We always have to stick our heads out the window. The only time we get that much air is when we're on the highway,"" he said. ""I would like to stay on the bus every day, that's how much history that bus has."" Ballplayers served country on battlegrounds . The Monarchs have their own link to history -- their team is named for the Kansas City Monarchs, the Negro Leagues team where Robinson started, in the same city that hosted this year's All-Star game. This year marks the 65th anniversary of Robinson becoming the first African-American to play Major League Baseball. ""We are the only African-American club in any of the tournaments and leagues we participate in, so Jackie Robinson has always been a role model for our kids,"" Bandura said. ""We're getting so much love everywhere we stop, which would have been a little bit different in 1947 I'm sure, so that just shows how far we've come."" The players in Bandura's program start with T-ball and then go on to play basketball, soccer and baseball together. The commitment is year-round and includes dedicated parents, a rigorous schedule against competitive teams and focus on education. ""We didn't reinvent the wheel here,"" Bandura said. ""This is what they're doing in the suburbs every day ... all kids should have the opportunity to explore and develop their talents."" He said the goal is to get his players to college. The Monarchs wrapped the road series 8-4. Their last stop is Cooperstown, New York, where they'll attend the Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Sunday. ""It's been awesome,"" said Scott Bandura, the team's catcher and the head coach's son. ""I can't get enough of it.""

"(CNN) -- Anastasia R. hates her boss, Jay, and wishes he would die. Matt B. is ""carrying a bucket round in my car cause im so hungover."" Charlie S. wants everyone to have his new personal phone number. And all of them shared these updates on Facebook. These ill-considered posts, and dozens more, are being collected on We Know What You're Doing, a new website created by an 18-year-old student and Web developer to raise awareness about the information people unwittingly share on social networks. The site's search tool combs public Facebook statuses for words and phrases such as ""hate my boss"" and ""hungover"" to display posts under the headings, ""Who wants to get fired?"" and ""Who's on drugs?"" ""I was very shocked at exactly what people reveal in their public Facebook posts, which is one of the reasons I started the site,"" Callum Haywood told CNN. ""If there was no relevant data to prove the point, then the website probably wouldn't exist."" Facebook users feeling helpless: What's really going on . Haywood launched the site Monday afternoon. By midday Tuesday in the United States, his page had received more than 120,000 unique visitors and nearly 5,000 likes on Facebook, he said in an e-mail interview with CNN. ""I created the website to make people aware of the issues that it creates when they post such information on Facebook without any privacy settings enabled,"" said the teenager, who lives in Nottingham, England. ""The people featured on the site are most likely not aware that what they post as 'public' can be seen by absolutely anybody, and that Facebook will happily give away this information to other websites via its Graph API."" The site follows in a line of sites such as Please Rob Me, launched in 2010, which aggregated public check-ins from social-media sites such as Foursquare and Twitter in hopes of showing people that there was a danger in alerting the public that they weren't at home. Others have aggregated silly and ridiculous Facebook status updates in the past, leading to a debate about the ethics of drawing attention to information that Facebook users may not know is public. As of early Tuesday afternoon, Haywood said he had not yet heard from Facebook or anyone featured on the site. He said he would be willing to remove any incriminating statuses from the site if contacted by the people who posted them. But that wouldn't remove the information from Facebook, ""so another website could easily access it,"" he said. Despite years of warnings about privacy, there have been numerous publicized incidents in recent years of people losing their jobs after they posted incriminating or offensive information on public Facebook pages. Haywood said he believes his site, which as of Tuesday was showcasing more than 75 questionable, if not downright stupid, updates, helps demonstrate how often people overshare online. In case you're pondering an alcohol-fueled Facebook rant about your boss and don't want to appear on We Know What You're Doing, it may be wise to visit Facebook's privacy-settings page and make sure Control Your Default Privacy is not set to ""Public.""

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- A haunting moon rises over a darkened stage, bouquets of flowers masquerade as elaborate head pieces while a fair-skinned model smiles through a mask of colorful jewelery. Welcome to Fashion Forward, a semi-annual fashion expo that aims to promote the Middle East's burgeoning sartorial sector. Alongside these elaborate and eye-catching runway shows, pop-up shops tout the latest designer accessories and fashionistas host forums on the latest industry developments in busy meeting rooms. Although the Dubai event only began in April 2013, its founder has grand ambitions for its future and for fashion in the Middle East. ""I would like to truly have our own fashion heroes,"" said Fashion Forward founder and CEO, Bong Guerrero. ""Where every mall almost looks the same ... you really need to have your own home grown brands,"" he added. Established Arab labels such as Amato are already regular attendees at Fashion Forward as are smaller up-and-coming fashion houses like Dubai's Zareena line. The real yard-stick of the Gulf's fashion success, however, will be whether the creations on display from the likes of Zareena make it off runways and into popular stores around the region. Those that can make this jump will find a lucrative market waiting for them. The luxury fashion and design sectors are worth more than $14 billion across the Gulf alone, according to the consultancy Bain and Company -- and that accounts for just a tiny portion of the global market. To tap into that potential, industry experts like the creator of New York Fashion Week, Fern Mallis, say the region has to find a way to set itself apart. ""There's a lot of talent around the world but everybody is looking for something new,"" Mallis said. ""Even buyers in New York and Paris, they're all looking for something new that nobody else has."" ""I often say that (fashion) editors and journalists, they're like pigs sniffing for truffles. They'll find it if the talent exists,"" she added. But for many emerging designers in the Gulf having the talent is only part of the process. Some like Arwa Alamari, a local designer who recently completed her first collection, say they need guidance and mentoring in order to fully realize their potential. ""For a new designer, they need appropriate education so they'll be able to understand the concept behind fashion because fashion cannot be taken as a hobby,"" said Alamari. ""Second, I think you need a coach or someone to help you along the way. And the third thing, you have to find a proper outlet for your designs."" Creating that outlet for local talent is an integral part of Dubai Fashion 2020, a long-term strategy that aims to make the emirate a global fashion capital by the end of the decade. At the heart of this process is D3 (or Dubai Design District), a government backed entire business park just minutes away from the Burj Khalifa dedicated to supporting these goals. D3 will include commercial areas, manufacturing facilities and work spaces for artists and designers. The woman at the helm of the company responsible for delivering the D3 project says it will be an eco-system to create jobs and nurture the region's talent. ""You have Paris and you have New York, and you have London, the idea is not really to bring designers or mimic whatever they have there,"" said Dr. Amina Al Rustamani, group CEO of Tecom. ""We are very strong in attracting brands here but I believe we are also ready and have the right opportunity to also develop global brands from Dubai."" ""I believe we have our own authenticity, and you know, and unique design and talent that could showcase.""Rustamani added. See also: Middle East's new hotel king .

"(CNN) -- In the dystopian future imagined within the popular Terminator franchise, robots learn to think, self-replicate and eventually kill their human masters. While this bleak vision assumes a number of seemingly distant technological and political developments, some ideas currently driving robotics research may, for some, bear an uncomfortable resemblance to those of the 80s sci-fi smash. In particular, one area where life seems to be imitating art is the fledgling field of 'swarm robotics', in which scientists are creating teams of robots that can work together toward a single goal -- from mending a leak to clearing mines -- with minimal or no input from humans. Much of the research is based on the observed behavior of 'eusocial' insects -- such as ants, bees and termites -- who work collectively on complex tasks without central management or higher order intelligence. Consider for a moment a typical termite nest -- with its labyrinth of chambers and intersecting corridors. It's built entirely by vast teams of micro-sized, speck-brained creatures (no disrespect) -- without so much as a blueprint to work from. So, the question for researchers is: how can we emulate this type of behavior in robots to help us solve problems and generally make our lives easier? Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unveiled 'M-blocks' - robots that can assemble themselves into different shapes to perform a range of basic tasks, without input from a human controller. While M-Blocks may not look particularly inspiring, the way they reshape is the first step toward a future where robots rebuild themselves to solve new problems. An M-Blocks-based robot working underwater might make itself narrow to fit through a deep sea crevasse, or a tiny team of medical robots could spread themselves flat to plug a gap in the human heart -- all without having been pre-programmed to do so. At the moment researchers are still working to make teams of robots complete more basic tasks. Sheffield University researchers, for example, are using swarms of robots to fetch, carry and push objects in unison. Dr Roderich Gross, head of the Natural Robotics Lab at the University of Sheffield, says: ""We are developing artificial intelligence to control robots in a variety of ways. The key is to work out what is the minimum amount of information needed by the robot to accomplish its task. That's important because it means the robot may not need any memory, and possibly not even a processing unit, so this technology could work for nanoscale robots -- for example in medical applications."" Some of the most interesting applications for swarm robotics exist where robots go beyond the realm of easy human reach, say into space or under the sea, or -- as Gross says -- inside the human body to perform medical tasks at a microscopic or 'nano' scale. Aaron Becker, a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University has been working on an experiment (that you can join in here) to test different ways swarm robots can be deployed, with a view to seeing 'nano-robots' eventually used in medical operations. The project seeks to demonstrate how teams of robots could be utilized with minimal input from the outside world, possibly beneath the surface of the skin in a bid to tackle disease. But how might this be done? Researchers at the Nanorobotics Laboratory in Montreal are looking at using swarms of miniature drones to fight pathogens within the human body. Sylvain Martel, the laboratory's Research Chair, believes that preliminary research conducted in his lab could lead to future treatments where small magnetic robots are inserted into the body to fight cancer. Other researchers are investigating ways to use swarming robots in diagnosis, so that problems are detected before they become life threatening. Becker believes that in future, swarms of nano-robots might even come to be used in surgery: ""If we can shrink the surgeon and their tools while maintaining their effectiveness, non-invasive surgery could revolutionize health care. I want to be a part of that dream,"" Becker says. Jan Carlo Barca, a member of the Swarm Robotics Laboratory at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia says that there are plenty of worthy applications for swarm robots, but some scientists working in the field worry that their research may end up being used for military purposes: . ""Some potential application areas for swarms of robots are: cooperative search in disaster sites to support rescue efforts, pollution detection and monitoring, mine clearing, exploration, mapping and dynamic motion capture for the film industry,"" he says. ""However, all this comes at a cost as this technology also will be exploited by defense agencies all over the world. (For example) the U.S. Defense Force has investigated how the hunting strategies of wolf packs, coyotes and killer whales can be used in military contexts. The Israeli Defense Force is also investigating how one can use miniature robotic mosquitoes in the same context."" And while the apocalyptic events of James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day are relatively unlikely, it is reassuring that many within the swarm robotics community are determined that their work will be applied to the right ends: . ""The big challenge,"" Barca says, ""is not only to formulate technologies that can be used in the real world, but also to ensure that swarm robotics technology will be used for the betterment of mankind.""","Scientists are building robots that can work in teams .
'Swarm robots' operate like hive insects such as ants, termites or bees .
MIT's M-blocks robot can self-assemble to solve different problems .
Swarm robots could be used in search and rescue, medicine and space exploration ."
"(CNN) -- Pakistan can't get no respect. In 2007, Newsweek published an influential cover story proclaiming it ""the most dangerous country in the world."" The bill of particulars for this indictment typically includes the inarguable facts that the Taliban is headquartered in Pakistan, as is what remains of al-Qaeda, as well as an alphabet soup of other jihadist terrorist groups. And in 2011, it became embarrassingly clear that Pakistan had harbored Osama bin Laden for almost a decade, even if unwittingly, in a city not far from the capital, Islamabad. Leading Pakistani liberals are routinely assassinated by militants. Two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed when she returned from exile in 2007. Around three years later, the governor of Punjab was shot to death by one of his own bodyguards because he had the temerity to suggest, correctly, that Pakistan's onerous blasphemy laws tend to penalize its tiny Christian minority. The governor's assassin was feted as a hero by many Pakistanis. Pakistani scientists have proliferated nuclear technology to the rogue state of North Korea. And Pakistan now has the fastest-growing nuclear weapons program in the world. Pakistan is also routinely gripped by Sunni-Shia violence, has a serious secessionist movement in the vast gas-rich province of Baluchistan and its financial capital, Karachi, is one of the world's most dangerous cities. Add to this toxic brew the fact that Pakistan operates like a tea party paradise; only about 2% of the population pays income taxes, as a result of which the government doesn't do much of anything for anybody. Lengthy power cuts are hollowing out Pakistan's already weak economy, which, at its present 3% growth rate, cannot possibly sustain Pakistan's youth bulge. But there is another side to Pakistan that suggests some underlying strengths that don't make quite as good copy as the Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. Those strengths are Pakistan's maturing institutions. Pakistan has a largely ineffectual state, but it has a vibrant civil society that picks up at least some of the government's slack. The private Edhi Foundation, for instance, runs a fleet of 1,800 ambulances and a slew of other welfare services for the poor across Pakistan. As a result of this strong civil society, Pakistan had its version of the Arab Spring long before the wave of demands for accountable governments emerged in the Middle East. It was, after all, a movement of thousands of lawyers taking to the streets protesting the sacking of the Supreme Court chief justice by the military dictator Pervez Musharraf in 2007 that helped to dislodge Musharraf from power. Pakistan has a vibrant media. A decade ago, there was only Pakistan TV, which featured leaden government propaganda. Now there are dozens of news channels: many of them conspiracist and anti-American, but many of them also anti-Taliban and pro-democracy. In the past year, the Supreme Court has taken on the ISI, Pakistan's powerful military intelligence agency, successfully demanding that the organization produce prisoners who had disappeared for years. In November, Pakistan agreed to a pact with long-time rival India granting India ""most favored nation"" trading status; something that would have been unimaginable a few years back. This important development was sanctioned by Pakistan's powerful army, which is a significant player in the country's economy and understands that one way out of Pakistan's economic mess is to hitch itself to India's much larger economy. Even U.S.-Pakistani relations -- which were at a nadir in 2011 because of a CIA contractor killing two Pakistanis, the bin Laden raid and the death of some two dozen Pakistani soldiers during a NATO airstrike -- are gingerly improving. Pakistan has recently reopened the ground routes for NATO supplies to cross Pakistan into Afghanistan, which were closed for months to protest the deaths of the Pakistani soldiers during the NATO airstrike. Tellingly, Pakistan has never even threatened to close the crucial air corridor across Pakistan that allows U.S. and NATO aircraft to fly into Afghanistan. One can get a sense of how important this air corridor is from the fact that Kandahar Air Field near the Pakistan border in southern Afghanistan is reported to have the busiest runway in the world with some 700 flights landing or taking off there every day. The present government is the first civilian government in Pakistani history that is poised to complete its full term of office sometime this year or early next year -- depending on when the next election is called -- without being overturned by a military coup or dismissed in some back room deal. And the military, which has seized power four times in the past six and half decades, has shown no interest in doing so again for the foreseeable future. The lengthy debate in Pakistan's parliament that was completed in April about whether Pakistan should allow the United States to use armed CIA drones on its territory is a welcome intrusion of Pakistan's civilian officials into the national security arena long monopolized by the military. The parliament called for the end of any U.S. drone strikes. Despite the visibility of the hardline religious parties on the streets of Pakistan, in the voting booth, these parties have recently fared very poorly. A coalition of pro-Taliban religious parties known as the MMA secured control of two of Pakistan's four provinces in an election in 2002 and 11% of the votes to the National Assembly. But the MMA garnered only a piddling 2% of the vote in the 2008 election. And where Pakistan's national interests are at stake, the military is aggressive against the Taliban. As the Taliban marched three years ago as close as 60 miles to Islamabad, the army launched major military operations in the northern region of Swat and the western area of South Waziristan to end the Taliban's control of these areas. Pakistani officials are swift to point out, correctly, that as a result, more Pakistani soldiers have died fighting the Taliban than the servicemen of the U.S. and other NATO countries combined. Pakistan has a myriad of well-known problems, but it also has some residual strengths that often get obscured by rhetoric about the ""world's most dangerous country."" Pakistan is no North Korea, and if Pakistanis really got a grip on their own problems, rather than too often resorting to blaming the United States or India for their ills, Pakistan might begin to look more like Turkey than Bangladesh. One good start along this path would be for the government to privatize Pakistan International Airways and the country's steel mills, which hemorrhage public money and perform quite poorly. But this would require real political leadership, something that is in short supply in Pakistan. While Pakistan's institutions are slowly maturing, its political class remains largely moribund.","Peter Bergen: The West looks at Pakistan as a country in dire straits .

"(CNN) -- Try writing a post seeking comment on whether embattled NFL star Ray Rice could ultimately be forgiven and watch your social network streams light up with a fair amount of outrage questioning how you could even suggest such a thing. It is definitely not politically correct to ask if a man seen on a hotel surveillance video knocking out his then-fiancÃ©e and dragging her from an elevator could one day face redemption. But many other superstar athletes -- from Michael Vick, who was convicted of bankrolling a dog fighting ring, to Tiger Woods, who was divorced by his wife after several allegations of infidelity -- were forgiven by fans and the public. Could -- or should -- the same thing happen with Rice, a 27-year-old running back recently released by the Baltimore Ravens? There are signs some are already giving Rice a second chance. In his first public appearance since being suspended indefinitely by the NFL -- a suspension the NFL players' union appealed on his behalf -- he attended a football game Saturday at his high school alma mater in his hometown of New Rochelle, New York. Janay Rice, now his wife, was by his side, and his 2-year-old daughter sat on his shoulders for some of the game. ""Ray is a part of our family and a part of this program, and that's why I'm very happy that he's here today,"" said the team's coach, Lou DiRienzo, according to The Journal News. ""He made a mistake -- and he made a very terrible mistake -- but I know the character of the man, and he will rise from this."" At the Ravens' first game of the season, several fans, including women, wore Rice's No. 27 jersey. One, Lauren Brown, told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront,"" ""He is human and people make mistakes."" What it will take for the larger public to agree with that sentiment and forgive Rice comes down to two questions, according to Patrick Wanis, a human behavior expert. ""One (is) how much do we actually like the person already? The second is what did we just see? If we see the results of the beating, we react more harshly,"" Wanis said. For instance, he points to the condemnation of singer Chris Brown after the photo of Rihanna's bloody face surfaced. Brown ultimately pleaded guilty in June 2009 to assaulting his then-girlfriend on the eve of the Grammys. ""When we see the bruises, the cuts, the bleeding, the scars, we feel a lot more pain, therefore we respond with a lot more anger,"" Wanis said. ""We have anger that says this situation needs resolving."" Besides the brutality of the video that has now been seen by millions, Rice faces other challenges should he ultimately seek forgiveness, domestic violence experts and women and men around the country said: answering the questions of whether a man who hit his partner and knocked her out will do it again and whether he can ultimately change. Katie Ray-Jones, president and chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said a man who hits his wife can stop if there is ""an honest willingness to change and diligence applied to the process of changing."" That means taking full responsibility for his actions and seeking help, said Ray-Jones. If Rice does that, he could be given a second chance, she said. ""Abusers deserve to be forgiven, especially if they make changes in their life that allows them to live a life free from continuing to be verbally, physically and/or sexually abusive,"" said Ray-Jones. ""We at the hotline wouldn't be doing what we do if we didn't feel that people can make change. However, change is difficult."" Jamie Berndt, a mom of four from Hilton Head, South Carolina, said forgiveness on the part of the public could be possible for Rice but not just because time passes or he apologizes. ""Forgiveness comes when a person shows genuine remorse over and over, tries to do better over and over,"" she said on Facebook. ""It is trying to live right because that is right, not because one gains something in return."" Tish Howard, a retired elementary school principal in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said forgiving does not mean condoning Rice's actions. ""Ray Rice was wrong, needs consequences, counseling and ultimately forgiveness. He needs deep counseling, not talking heads on TV."" For others, the fact that Rice's wife, Janay, has forgiven him means the public can and should forgive him, too. ""I personally think what he did is despicable,"" said Scott Eddi of New York. ""However, we are not his spouse. So ultimately if his wife has shown grace to forgive him ... all we can do is support him. We all have done things in our past that we realize are wrong. The goal is to change and influence others to amend their behavior."" Lisa Abrams, a self-described ""huge Ravens fan"" from Baltimore who admits it's hard to be objective, said she believes Rice may be a scapegoat for other problems affecting the NFL. ""What Rice did was horrific, but he is now paying a penalty, not for his actions but for the NFL being embarrassed by not having punished him appropriately in the first place,"" she said. ""Everyone deserves a second chance. He has done so much good in our community and is doing all the things that have been asked of him legally and by the league in retribution."" But others said they believe Rice's actions can never be forgiven. ""From what I've heard and read, I wouldn't forgive him,"" said a woman on CNN Living's Facebook page. ""He hit his wife!

"(CNN) -- British photographers and self-described ""urban explorers"" Daniel Marbaix and Daniel Barter see beauty amid the desolation of abandoned buildings. Their shoots have brought them to defunct factories, mines and houses of worship around the world, from their native England to Japan. For their first book, they captured the forgotten structures of the eastern United States: ruins of churches and theaters in New York City, derelict train stations, asylums and factories in the Rust Belt. Images from ""States of Decay,"" published in July, evoke different reactions, especially the book's cover. Shot by Barter, it shows an American flag hanging over a defaced frieze of the Last Supper. Barter said the image reflects the separation of church and state in a reference to American politics. Citing an ""explorers' code,"" the photographers chose not to provide specific information about the locations of their shoots. Indeed, the decaying structure may or may not reflect a general decline in the surrounding area, regardless of the state of the structure. A shared fascination with old buildings brought the photographers together. Barter's love of old buildings started as a child. Growing up in North London, he and a few friends would climb a fence after school and play inside a derelict airplane. ""The combination of leather and shiny metal switches was a formative experience for me,"" said Barter, 29. ""If I close my eyes, I can almost still smell it."" When he grew older, Barter studied restoration art in college, and that knowledge transformed his interest into a job as a professional photographer. Meanwhile, Marbaix studied zoology at Royal Holloway, University of London, and somehow fell in love with photography. ""My courses seemed to just spill over into exploring the urban environment and that led to photography,"" said Marbaix, 33. ""I have not looked back since."" When the two first met through friends in a pub in London of 2011, they were competing photographers. But after they learned of their mutual interest in taking photos of ""older building and artifacts,"" a friendship developed that has led to many adventures, for work and pleasure -- often both. Poking around abandoned buildings has led to a few close calls with authorities, the ""Dan duo"" said. The mixture of luck and adrenaline has concocted a slew of comical memories for the pair as well as some great shots. Although many of their shoots might appear to be planned and organized, most of the time they're produced during holidays and trips with friends and family. ""There is not a method to the madness. We just do whatever we feel like,"" Marbaix said. While they continue to work on projects centered on the unseen and unfamiliar in Britain, they're looking forward to more adventures. ""We are told that we are too old to be doing this sort of thing,"" said Marbaix. ""But honestly I could care less. My mother loves it and that's all that matters.""","Abandoned churches, prisons, asylums are the stars of the photo book ""States of Decay""

"(CNN) -- It's vital that young Americans learn the history of our amazing nation. Being an American requires knowing what it means to be an American. It's the fabric that binds us together and helps us understand who we are. Today, unfortunately, many of our students are failing to learn American history, including our founding principles and values. And they're failing to learn why America remains an exceptional nation. For two generations, we've watched our nation's memory of the past slip away. The problem of historic amnesia is widespread, as evidenced by alarming results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which tests students in grades four, eight and 12 in several broad subject areas every few years. Among the survey's most frightening findings is our students' lack of knowledge in U.S. history. Just 20% of fourth-graders, 17% of eighth-graders and 12% of 12th-graders were at grade-level proficiency in American history in the 2010 exams. This lack of knowledge goes to the very basics. Only one in three fourth-graders could identify the purpose of the Declaration of Independence. Less than half understood why George Washington was an important American leader. And a majority of fourth-graders didn't know why the Pilgrims left England. These are frightening statistics, indicating that our children lack an understanding of our nation's history and the traits that have made America great. As the author of three children's books on American history, I've visited many classrooms across the country to share the adventures of Ellis the Elephant, my time-traveling pachyderm, with children ages 4 to 8. I've found most young students to be energetic, enthusiastic and eager to learn. We can get children engaged in learning at an early age if we as adults have enthusiasm for learning as well. Our history includes wonderful role models. In writing ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (published this week, in which Ellis the Elephant discovers the American Revolution), I was reminded that the brave men and women who fought to win our freedom were surprisingly young. Thomas Jefferson was 33. James Madison was 25. James Monroe was just 18, barely older than a high-school graduate. And yet these patriotic heroes were engaged in profound, often dangerous work. They were models of sacrifice, civic-mindedness and determination. With education surveys showing dismal results, we must find creative ways to teach our children American history. In ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" and the Ellis the Elephant series, my goal is to highlight the wonderful achievements of our country, to arouse a love for America and to communicate why America is indeed a special nation. Like children's books, educational video games, too, have enormous potential to make history come alive. And we are only beginning to see the potential of online systems like Khan Academy to revolutionize learning. There are many ways to improve the challenged state of education, but parents, teachers and mentors must pursue them eagerly. It was 232 years ago this month, on October 19, 1781, that the British surrendered to George Washington's Continental Army at Yorktown. This pivotal moment concluded an eight-year war in which thousands of brave men and women gave their lives to win the freedom we enjoy today. Yet we are for the first time in our history beginning to lose sight of our founders' sacrifice and wisdom. We must fight historical amnesia to ensure that future generations continue to appreciate the greatness of our nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Callista Gingrich.","Callista Gingrich: Tests show a failure to teach students American history .
She says few fourth-graders understand significance of George Washington .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian actress who was sentenced to a year in jail and 90 lashes for appearing in a film critical of the country's government has been released, according to Amnesty International and the film's producers. Actress Marzieh Vafamehr stared in the recently released ""My Tehran for Sale."" In the film, she appears in one scene without the head-covering Iranian women must wear, while in another she appears to drink alcohol, Amnesty International said. Vafamehr was released Monday night after an appeals court cut her sentence to three months and overturned the 90 lashes, the rights group said. Cyan Films, which produced ""My Tehran for Sale,"" reported that the actress is now with her family. ""As filmmakers, we believe in freedom of speech and support all artists who are imprisoned and punished in Iran for expressing themselves through their art. We admire their courage and the contribution they make to sharing with the world their truth about life for Iranian people,"" said Kate Croser and Julie Ryan, producers of the film. In August, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said it had interviewed the actress's husband, Iranian filmmaker Nasser Taghvai. ""It is a bitter tale why our artists should end up in prison for their profession; this is so painful. An actor cannot say I would do this in a film, or I wouldn't do that in a film. (If they did,) nobody would give them work anymore,"" the group's website quoted Taghvai as saying. Rights groups have previously blasted Iran, slamming its record on the media and the arts. In particular, they say the government is cracking down on workers in the film industry. ""In recent months, an increasing number of filmmakers and actors have been targeted for persecution in Iran. While the release of Marzieh Vafamehr is a welcome development, it is deeply worrying that three filmmakers are still being held in Tehran's Evin Prison,"" said Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Middle East and North Africa Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. According to the rights group, those filmmakers are Mehran Zinatbakhsh, Mojtaba Mir Tahmasb and Katayoun Shahabi.","Actress Marzieh Vafamehr stars in the film ""My Tehran for Sale""

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Nearly 60 Bahraini activists turned out Wednesday in downtown Manama calling for the release of hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. His daughter, Zainab al-Khawaja, stood at the front of the crowd and accused the government of torture. Police pushed protesters out of the marketplace, known as the Souk, and used stun grenades in an attempt to clear the crowd. Reporters were kept behind the police line during the protest and were told that the protest was illegal. Al-Khawaja, 52, was arrested in April 2011 for his role in anti-government protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority nation. In June, Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's royal family. The government has said he can appeal his life sentence during a hearing April 23. Last week the human rights group Amnesty International asked for al-Khawaja's release, saying in a statement that Bahrain's ""determination to persecute him seems to override any consideration for justice or humanity."" Zainab al-Khawaja said last week that her father was having trouble breathing and was harassed by hospital staff and security guards. ""His tone and the way he was speaking was like he was saying goodbye,"" she said on April 10. ""We're not sure if we'll ever see him again."" The United Nations last week urged Bahrain to consider transferring the detainee, who holds Danish citizenship, to Denmark on humanitarian grounds, but a judicial panel has said al-Khawaja does not meet the conditions to be transferred into Danish custody, according to the Bahrain News Agency. On Wednesday, al-Khawaja's hunger strike entered its 70th day.","Nearly 60 Bahrain activists turn out Wednesday in downtown Manama .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a $1 million civil penalty against a regional airline for allegedly using improper rivets on cockpit doors, saying the rivets could have damaged wiring and other aircraft components. The agency said Horizon Air operated 22 aircraft for more than three years with the improper rivets, making at least 186,189 flights while the planes were ""unairworthy."" The FAA discovered the violations last year when Horizon modified a 23rd aircraft with blind rivets, and the plane experienced an incident during a flight because of wire damage, the agency said. Airline takes heat over note on wing . Horizon Air was required to use solid rivets on the doors, but instead used blind rivets, which can be fastened from one side of a panel or structure, ""blind"" to the opposite side. ""We expect airlines to comply with all of our safety regulations and to correct safety defects promptly,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. Bag delivery fee worth it for some . The FAA said the airline has replaced the blind rivets on its aircraft. Horizon Air, which serves cities in the western U.S. and Canada, has 30 days to respond to the FAA's proposed penalty. Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for Horizon Air, said the airline opted to use an ""alternative and stronger"" rivet, which Horizon believed was acceptable to the FAA. AA chief: Success is only option . ""We believed at the time the alternative rivets were an acceptable substitution. At no time was passenger safety compromised or the integrity of the cockpit door affected,"" she said.","The FAA says Horizon Air operated 22 aircraft with improper rivets .

"New York (CNN) -- A peacock has flown the coop, stealthily escaping from its home at the Central Park Zoo. The male peacock ""wandered"" away from the Manhattan Zoo on Tuesday, said Wildlife Conservation Society spokeswoman Mary Dixon in a statement. The adventurous bird made its way to a Fifth Avenue apartment building near the park and perched on a third-floor window sill. Zoo officials are encouraging onlookers to avoid following or harassing the peacock and say the runaway poses no danger to the public. ""We are hopeful he will either fly back to the zoo or we will retrieve him nearby,"" Dixon said in the statement. Zoo officials did not comment on how the bird escaped or what type of enclosure he was in. According to the zoo's website, peafowl are kept in the Tisch Children's Zoo, described as a ""walk-through wildlife adventure."" The peacock has drummed up more than 340 followers on its @CentralPeacock Twitter feed. The Central Park escapee comes on the heels of a peahen -- the female counterpart to a peacock -- fleeing the Bronx Zoo in May and an even more infamous cobra, who disappeared from its Bronx Zoo pen for five days in March.","Bird perches on Fifth Avenue windowsill in New York .

"Ilovaisk, Ukraine (CNN) -- On a country road in eastern Ukraine, a scene of bucolic tranquility was suddenly interrupted by the aftermath of carnage. A burned-out tank tilted into a ditch, its turret blown some 20 meters away by a direct hit. Unexploded ammunition of every caliber lay everywhere. A troop transport vehicle was shot to pieces; a short distance away a simple grave was marked by a cross hastily made from branches. Amid the fields of sunflowers and grazing cows, the smell of burned metal hung in the air. The road, running south from Ilovaisk, was the escape route for Ukrainian soldiers when the town finally fell to pro-Russian separatists after a three-week siege. Except that many of those soldiers, at least 70 according to army medics and probably more, did not escape. Whether they were ambushed or killed making a final stand, or rebels reneged on a deal to grant them safe passage, is unclear. But their chaotic retreat marked one of the bloodiest defeats for Ukrainian security forces in their war to reclaim the east. It was also the latest evidence of a resurgence in the fortunes of the rebels. After being penned back into a shrinking corner of eastern Ukraine -- around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk -- for much of July and August, they are now advancing on several fronts. Last week the army of NovoRossiya, as it now calls itself, seized Novoazovsk, a town on the coast a few miles from the Russian border. Those fighters have begun to push west and north, while others have captured more territory south and east of the city of Donetsk. The rebels have established a corridor from the city all the way to the coast in which there is no sign of Ukrainian forces. In an interview with CNN Tuesday, the youthful commander of rebel forces in Ilovaisk, who gave his name as Givi, was contemptuous of Ukrainian troops, who he claimed vastly outnumbered his men. ""I proposed to them a million times to give up and get out,"" he said. ""But many of their officers are fighting for money, and the regular soldiers are forced into it. They died with tears in their eyes because they have no experience, and don't know who their enemy is."" Asked to show the rebels' front lines on a map of Ukraine, he leaned across the cot that takes up half his tiny office and drew a line beyond Mariupol -- and further west. ""But you don't control Mariupol,"" we countered. ""It is next,"" he said with confidence. That still seems unlikely. Mariupol is Ukraine's fourth-largest city with a population of more than 400,000, an uneasy mixture of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian viewpoints that has exploded into violence several times since the unrest began. It could only be occupied by a substantial force. But on Tuesday the rebels stationed a T-72 tank and troop carrier on the main highway just 40 miles (70 kilometers) from the city. A nearby Ukrainian checkpoint that was manned just last week is deserted. There is little evidence of the Ukrainian army around the city; just a few trenches, hastily dug by volunteers, on the outskirts. In Ilovaisk, Givi has certainly amassed an impressive store of weapons and ammunition. All were seized from the Ukrainians, he insisted, showing us their markings. Boxes of mortars and shells were stacked high in a garage; outside his men were trying to repair an armored personnel carrier. But his forces also boasted at least two T-72 tanks flying the flag of NovoRossiya -- a blue diagonal cross on a red background -- that looked virtually new. Asked where they came from, he said he didn't really care. Then he embraced and kissed a blonde female fighter carrying a Dragunov sniper rifle and walked off. Nearby, almost every window in a four-story school has been shattered. Mortar impacts have thrown up dirt and paving and demolished a wall in what was the playground. An anti-tank mine lay in the grass. In the road outside, a rocket was embedded in the tarmac; a Ukrainian flag lay twisted and dirty on the floor of a bus the troops were using. The school was the headquarters in Ilovaisk for the National Guard detachment sent to hold the town. They were targeted by mortar fire of an accuracy rarely seen from separatist forces. So were the blackened tanks --- a dozen or more --- that lay across the road south of Ilovaisk. Whether the separatists have had training in Russia or been joined by reinforcements from across the border is at the heart of the dispute that has drawn Europe into its worst crisis since the Cold War. What is beyond dispute is that the weaponry they now have -- and their ability to use it -- is far more advanced than two or three months ago. But identifying who is using what hardware in this conflict, and where it came from, is at best an imprecise science. In a burned field south of Ilovaisk, on what was the frontline of combat a few days ago, we found a large green tube amid bushes and trees. Military experts have identified it as the rocket motor section of a Russian-made SS-21 ""Scarab"" ballistic missile. But both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries have the SS-21. The same dilemma applies in identifying the separatists. Most of the fighters at Givi's base appeared to be from the Donetsk area. Further south, men manning a checkpoint near Novoazovsk had distinctly Russian accents. But the presence of active-duty Russian soldiers -- and in what numbers -- is impossible to know. The civilians who have remained in Ilovaisk, a town without water or electricity, seemed largely supportive of the new authorities. Few had anything good to say about the National Guard soldiers; some villagers claimed they had harassed and stolen from locals, claims that were impossible to verify. One man said the separatists had shot dead his 23-year old grandson when he was caught looting -- but at least they had helped arrange the funeral. In small towns and villages in this corner of Ukraine, it is increasingly rare to come across pro-Kiev sentiment. While identifying themselves as Ukrainian, many people have family links to Russia. They accuse the Ukrainian armed forces of being undisciplined, or indiscriminate in their targeting. Anecdotal evidence after two days in Donetsk suggests a similar feeling there. Wherever the shelling is coming from (and it is sporadic and seems largely indiscriminate), people seemed to blame the Ukrainian forces surrounding the city. Tens of thousands of people have abandoned Donetsk over the last few months, and the streets are eerily quiet. Stores and restaurants are boarded up; playgrounds deserted. Most professionals have left; most of those still in the city tend to be older and poorer, with nowhere to go. Among them are the store-owners at a street market by the railway station, an area hit by several shells at the weekend. As they swept away the shattered glass and gazed at their ruined livelihoods on Monday morning, one woman, on the verge of tears, said she had just brought $700 of clothing from Kharkiv to sell. Now it was gone in the fire ignited by the shelling. A grizzled middle-aged man wandered up. He had a unique prescription for Ukraine's troubles. ""Peace, freedom, Led Zeppelin,"" he said with a toothless grin. ""End of problem.""","In eastern Ukraine, burned-out military vehicles, used armaments litter the countryside .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain slammed President Barack Obama on Monday over his comments that U.S. intelligence underestimated ISIS. McCain countered Obama's assertions made on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" saying that ISIS' expansion in Syria and Iraq was tied to the President's decision not to leave a residual U.S. military force in Iraq and his refusal to arm moderate Syrian rebels last year despite urgings from his national security advisers. ""We predicted this and watched it,"" McCain said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""It was like watching a train wreck and warning every step of the way that this was happening."" In the ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday, Obama admitted that a chaotic Syria became ""ground zero for jihadists around the world"" and that the United States also overestimated the strength of Iraqi security forces. The Republican senator from Arizona also reserved some criticism for his fellow legislators who went on recess to focus on the November midterm elections without voting on U.S. military action in Syria. ""It's an act of cowardice on the part of Congress,"" McCain said. ""They didn't want to vote before the election."" After adjourning without a vote more than a week earlier, House Speaker John Boehner told ABC News on Sunday that he would be ""happy"" to call lawmakers back to the House floor for a vote if Obama submits a resolution to Congress. ""I'd bring the Congress back,"" Boehner said. Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the President for his ""political failure"" rather than a failure of the intelligence community, saying Obama needs to lead. ""It is incumbent upon the commander in chief to lay out the strategy that he wants,"" Royce said. ""We have given him those tools."" McCain also called on the Obama administration to take on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, renewing calls for a no-fly zone over Syria and saying the United States should ""take out his air force"" if the Syrian ruler doesn't keep his planes out of the air. McCain said Obama has the authority to attack al-Assad's regime without congressional authorization and said not doing so would be ""immoral."" ""They want to train 5,000 Free Syrian Army people in Saudi Arabia and send them back. But are we going to do anything about Bashar al-Assad's air attacks?"" McCain said. ""Are you going to ask these young people ... to fight against ISIS but not against Assad. It's not only unworkable, it's immoral."" McCain and fellow hawk Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, first advocated for a no-fly zone in Syria in the summer of 2013 when Obama was considering military action against the Syrian regime, which McCain said is responsible for the death of 192,000 Syrians. McCain agreed with the Obama administration that the United States is at war with ISIS -- a statement that only 40% of Americans agree with, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. ""Of course, we are,"" McCain said.","McCain on ISIS' growth: ""We predicted this and watched it""

"(CNN) -- On a warm evening in Istanbul, a bar called Kooperatif announced its last call. Friends old and new gathered in the art and performance hall, located in the heart of the city's Beyoglu district, for a smoke-filled goodbye accompanied by live music and doses of nostalgia. Kooperatif closed its doors in Rumeli Han, a venerable 19th-century Ottoman shopping arcade that until recently housed an eclectic mix of tenants, including an Indian cultural center, a rock-climbing wall and the district headquarters of the Turkish Communist Party. Safak Velioglu, founder and owner of Kooperatif, called Rumeli Han a ""small republic."" ""The story of the closing of Kooperatif is about gentrification"" Velioglu says. ""In the last 20 or 30 years, [establishments] like Kooperatif became very interesting places for different interests, art galleries and workshop areas. ""After gentrification, nobody could afford to find a place."" Velioglu had been paying $2,000 a month to run his pub in the basement of Rumeli Han. After the rent for the place was quadrupled, he'd little choice but to close the bar. Istanbul, Turkey's largest city and business hub, has witnessed a surge in population and a boom in urban construction projects over the past decade. Global tourism destination . It's also emerged as a leading global tourism destination. In 2012, according to the Turkish Ministry of Tourism and Culture, 31.7 million foreigners visited Turkey, compared to 1.3 million in 1980. Istanbul's Beyoglu district is the city's center of nightlife, enchanting visitors and locals with its unique combination of seedy bars, upscale nightclubs, historic churches and 19th-century mansions. That's all changing. A century ago, Beyoglu was the home of Istanbul's non-Muslim bourgeoisie -- religious and ethnic minorities including Armenians, Greeks and Jews. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire during World War I led to ""population exchanges"" that prompted the departure of many Greeks. Decades later, Turkish authorities imposed crippling minority taxes which accelerated the emigration of the city's indigenous Greek community in the 1950s and '60s. As of 2006, fewer than 3,000 ethnic Greeks are left in the city once known as Constantinople. During subsequent decades, Turkish and Kurdish migrants from the rest of the country moved into abandoned blocks in Beyoglu. The district's winding alleyways and crumbling mansions also became a favorite destination for artists and musicians. Kooperatif carved out a niche in this bohemian melting pot. It thrived as a place where patrons could to speak, drink, perform and display their art. To get to Kooperatif, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. Barefoot backpackers . Its cavernous space offered a stark change of pace from Istiklal Caddesi, the pedestrian thoroughfare that surges with locals and visitors most days and nights of the week. Patrons, who included everyone from barefoot foreign backpackers to independent musicians passing through the city, described it as a refuge. In the last decade, Beyoglu also began attracting international retailers and hoteliers, prompting some to compare its transformation to the gentrification of Manhattan's Time Square in the 1990s. While many mourn the appearance of Western franchises along Istiklal, others welcome the change, not least President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling Justice and Development Party has pushed to overhaul Istanbul and drive Turkey's economic growth. Under Erdogan, the city has been awash with massive construction and urban development projects ranging from gentrifying dilapidated neighborhoods near Beyoglu to building a new bridge and metro tunnel across the Bosphorus. Under this tide of change, 19th- and 20th-century shopping arcades, once cluttered with mom and pop shops and tea houses, have today been replaced by modern shopping malls and luxury hotels. Kooperatif owner Velioglu plans to reopen his bar in a new location, but he's unlikely to find a location as historic and quixotic as the old Rumeli Han, and concedes this might be a problem. ""The chemistry of Kooperatif needs this chaos and it has to be in the center,"" Velioglu said. Ryan Powell is a freelance writer based in Istanbul.","Istanbul's crumbling Beyoglu district has been home to the city's artists but rising rents are pushing some out .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Three men were convicted Tuesday in the gang rape of an American tourist in India. All Nepali men in their 20s, they were convicted of sexual assault and robbery, police said. They were sentenced to 20 years in prison. Officially, they were sentenced to 20 years each for sexual assault and five years for robbery, but the sentences will run concurrently. The men will also have to pay about $250 each in fines. The incident took place in June in the Indian mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. The men were accused of raping and robbing the American woman, who had sought a lift from them in their small truck, Vinod Kumar Dhawan, the state's police superintendent, told CNN. The woman, 31, was on her way back to a popular tourist destination when she got into the truck around 1 a.m. The men pleaded not guilty, Dhawan said. The rape case that changed India .

"(CNN) -- The University of North Dakota is one step closer to retiring its nickname and mascot, but changing the school's 90-year-old Native American moniker -- the Fighting Sioux -- has not been without complications. The school faces a Monday deadline to comply with the NCAA's policy on mascots ""deemed hostile or abusive toward Native Americans."" School officials were in the process of coming up with a new name and mascot this year until North Dakota legislators passed a law ordering them to stop, according to UND spokesman Peter Johnson. The rock and the hard place the school finds itself between marks the last gasp of a decades-long fight not just in North Dakota, but in all of college sports -- the climax (or nadir, depending on some people's perspective) of a nostalgia-imbued resistance to political correctness on the playing field. The kerfuffle at hand dates to 2007, when the North Dakota Board of Higher Education agreed to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname by August 15, 2011, in accordance with the NCAA's then-2-year-old policy on Native American mascots. If they ultimately chose not to do so, costly NCAA sanctions were promised, including the inability to host any championships and a ban on the use of the school's logo or nickname at any championship events. After Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed House Bill 1263 into law this year, the school was left with the dilemma of having to either disobey the government that controls its purse-strings or to flout the rules of the NCAA, the entity that controls the arguably mightier purse-strings of college football. The nickname controversy appeared to be closer to a resolution Friday when Dalrymple and other state officials traveled to Indianapolis to meet with NCAA officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve the matter. ""It's our understanding coming out of this meeting that the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo will be dropped,"" the NCAA quoted its Vice President for Communications Bob Williams as saying Friday. ""The contingent from North Dakota made it clear that they were committed to changing the legislative action that would require retention of the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo. However, our settlement agreement remains in effect, and, as a result, the University of North Dakota will be subject to the policy effective Aug. 15."" Doug Fullerton will be paying close attention to what happens Monday. As commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, he is overseeing North Dakota's ascent from Division II obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of Division I football. ""When we invited (North Dakota's football team) into the (Big Sky) conference this was not an issue,"" he said. Citing the conference's ""close, close ties to Native American tribes"" and the promise of boycotts from other Division I schools if the name goes unchanged, he says the school's membership in the conference ""could be in jeopardy."" The school is set to join the conference July 1, 2012. According to an NCAA press release, Dalrymple said at the Friday meeting that he would appeal to the state legislature ""to allow legislation to be introduced during a special session on Nov. 7 that will transfer the responsibility for the logo and nickname from the legislature back to the Board of Higher Education."" ""I have come to the conclusion that the cost of retaining the Sioux logo is too great,"" the NCAA press release quoted Dalrymple as saying. ""There's no question that the settlement agreement will stand according to the NCAA, and there will be no further negotiations."" The usage of Native American imagery in college athletics has been a long-simmering controversy. Such schools as Stanford University and New York's St. John's University, elected to drop their nicknames (the Stanford Indians became the Cardinals in 1972, then the Cardinal in 1981; the St. John's Red Men became the Red Storm in the mid-'90s), while others, like the University of North Dakota, balked. In 2000, for example, then-UND president Charles Kupchella tried to retire the Fighting Sioux until a wealthy alum threatened to withhold a $100 million donation for a new hockey arena, an episode chronicled by author Deni Elliot in her book ""The Kindness of Strangers: Philanthropy and Higher Education."" Today, the school's state-of-the-art rink not only bears that donor's name, it's decorated with more than 2,000 Fighting Sioux logos. In 2005, the NCAA sought to end the controversy surrounding Native American mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed ""abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin"" to either get Native American permission to use their name and likeness, or to come up with a new one. The resulting actions among the targeted schools were varied. The Arkansas State Indians became the Red Wolves; the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Indians became the Crimson Hawks. Other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name, like Southeastern Oklahoma State, where the Savages are now known as the Savage Storm. Others, like the Bradley University Braves, whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe, were allowed to keep their name so long as Native American logos and imagery were eschewed. Schools with higher-profile athletic programs fared better. The Florida State Seminoles, University of Utah Utes and the Central Michigan University Chippewas each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course. But the Fighting Sioux of the University of North Dakota -- winners of seven national championships in men's ice hockey -- was denied such an endorsement from the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux.","University of North Dakota faces a Monday deadline to change its Fighting Sioux nickname .

"(CNN) -- Color us confused. Geraldo Rivera tweeted over the weekend about Kobani, a key Syrian city that has been a focus in the battle against ISIS. The journalist used his official Twitter account to say ""from PR, Kobani is the real Benghazi, the beseiged fortress where president really can & must save heroic defenders."" But while we get that Rivera was enjoying his time in Puerto Rico, it seemed strange that his tweet would include a topless selfie of himself. It's not like topless selfies haven't stirred the pot for the 71-year-old before. Back in 2013, Rivera blamed it on the alcohol when he tweeted out a nearly nude self-portrait of him draped in a towel and wearing only his glasses. At the time he said ""I never do tequila when I'm alone, but I had this new bottle that someone had given me. The second one, my fate was sealed. ""I said, 'Dammit, I like that picture,'"" he added.

"(CNN) -- The promoter and agent who first brought The Beatles to America has died. Sid Bernstein died Wednesday in New York City, publicist Merle Frimark said in a statement. He was 95.

""I'm a hunch player, you see,"" Bernstein once said, according to his publicist's statement. ""I was just glad to get this group I had been reading about for months. It took eight months after I booked them for there to be any airplay of their records on the radio. I had to convince Carnegie Hall and my financial backers to take a chance on this then-unknown group. I had been reading about their progress in the European papers and was fascinated with the hysteria that surrounded them. I was the first to promote The Beatles in the States and Ed Sullivan called me first about them before he ever booked them on his television show."" The Beatles in color - Unseen photos . Ultimately, it was Sullivan's audience who heard them first, on February 9, 1964. The Carnegie Hall concert that Bernstein booked was three days later.

He is survived by six children, six grandchildren and his wife of 50 years, Geraldine.

"Washington (CNN) -- A controversial congressional hearing Thursday on the radicalization of Muslim Americans touched on sensitive questions involving terrorism and tolerance a decade after the 9/11 attacks. At times emotional and theatrical, the four-hour session of the House Homeland Security Committee included calls from moderate Muslims for support in overcoming extremists seeking to indoctrinate their children, as well as protests from Democratic legislators who complained the hearing unfairly implicated all Muslims for the criminal acts of a small minority. In the end, committee Chairman Peter King, R-New York, said the hearing that generated widespread media coverage ""actually went a lot easier than it could have."" He blamed what he called the ""mindless, baseless hysteria in the media"" in preceding weeks for the controversy, and promised additional hearings in coming months, with the next perhaps focusing on the radicalization of Muslims in U.S. prisons. Despite strong criticism from Muslim Americans and accusations of a McCarthyist revival,  King started the hearing by defending it as neither ""radical or un-American."" ""To back down would be a craven surrender to political correctness and an abdication of what I believe to be the main responsibility of this committee to protect America from a terrorist attack,"" he said. Recruiting young American Muslims is part of al Qaeda's strategy to continue attacking the United States, said King, who  called on Americans to reject the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a prominent Muslim-American advocacy group in the United States. Witnesses stressed to the panel the need for more understanding of the issue, with a father describing how his son was radicalized by Islamic extremists, and a moderate Muslim activist advocating an American form of Islam that believes in ""separation of mosque and state."" At the same time, the only law enforcement official to testify, Sheriff Leroy Baca of Los Angeles County in California, seemed to sum up the overall approach needed by calling for increased understanding by Americans of their changing society. ""The truth is that America is becoming a society of the world, and because of that we have to be sensitive, we have to know how to work with various communities,"" Baca said. ""Americans need to wake up and start learning more about all the issues that affect their well-being. ... The real truth is that the American public must step up to the plate and do more, even if it's just educating yourself."" Evidence of the deep public divide over the issue included a woman in the public gallery wearing a T-shirt that had ""No Bigotry"" written in large letters. Democrats on the panel sharply criticized King for focusing the hearing only on the Muslim-American community, with some expressing outrage and other making emotional pleas. Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York called the hearing ""great theater"" but lamented the lack of a definition for terrorism and radicalization. For example, she said, parents in her district tell of chidlren being recruited and brainwashed by local gangs. Rep. Keith Ellison, the first elected Muslim member of Congress, choked up in describing the sacrifices of Muslim Americans, among them Salman Hamdani, a 23-year-old paramedic and New York City police cadet who died trying to save others in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With Hamdani's mother in the room, Ellison teared up as he explained that people ""falsely speculated (Hamdani) was with the attackers because he was Muslim."" ""His life should not be identified as just a member of an ethic group or just a member of a religion, but as an American who gave everything for his fellow Americans,"" the sobbing Ellison said. He acknowledged that some Muslims are responsible for violent acts, but said blaming the entire Muslim community for the evil of individuals is ""the very heart of stereotyping and scapegoating."" Muslim Americans called the planned series of hearings an unfair attack on loyal citizens and a dangerous break from the traditional U.S. embrace of tolerance and pluralism. However, the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy told the hearing that the radicalization of Muslim Americans is a ""significant"" problem that only the Muslim community can resolve, instead of claiming victimization when concerns are raised. ""We can close our eyes and pretend it doesn't exist,"" said Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser, who is Muslim. ""You're not going to solve the problem and the problem is increasing exponentially."" Jasser called radicalization ""a moral corruption within a certain segment"" that is using the Islamic religion to spread its message. Countering such efforts would require teaching Muslim Americans about American principles of liberty and ""separation of mosque and state,"" he said, with a goal of allowing true Muslim reformists to gain a voice in the debate, instead of what he called Islamic revivalists clinging to traditional models that mix religion and government. Noting the controversy over addressing the issue, Jasser said ""I hope that you develop the political will to deal with this problem."" Critics have accused Republican leaders of bigotry and compared the hearings to those held in the 1950s to explore Sen. Joseph McCarthy's allegations of Communist infiltration in the early years of the Cold War. Democratic Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving congressman and the dean of the House, said he represented a Michigan community that included a sizable Muslim population. ""They are almost, without exception, honorable, loyal citizens,"" Dingell said. ""And as I've indicated, they are distressed as much as we are about the behavior of al Qaeda and other threats to their nation as we are to sharing their concerns about what is of danger to our nation."" Dingell then told the committee that in all the years that he headed investigative committees, he kept a picture of McCarthy hanging on the wall -- ""so that I would know what it was I did not want to look like, to do or to be."" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, told the committee that the hearings run the risk of taking too narrow a view of the scope of terrorism threats against the United States and could stoke a climate of fear and distrust in the Muslim community. ""As we consider the possible domestic effects of our actions, we must also consider the possible effects abroad,"" Thompson said. ""As I look at the recent uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, I'm struck by the fact that these movements are inspired by secular notions of democracy and freedom. Theocracy seems to be on the sidelines."" Other Democrats were more dramatic. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas expressed her ""outrage"" at limited scope of the hearing, while California Rep. Laura Richardson called it ""discriminatory"" and ""an abuse of power"" by King, who became committee chairman with the Republican takeover of Congress in last November's elections. Richardson questioned why other House committees weren't holding hearings on threats to American children involving other religions, a veiled but obvious reference to the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Rep. Al Green of Texas called for a hearing on the Ku Klux Klan, noting it was religious-based because all members were required to be Christians. Republican offered their own theatrics, with Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina expressing his own outrage over what he called the Obama administration's ""failure to single out who our enemy is."" Witnesses invited by King told stories of personal loss. Melvin Bledsoe, the father of an American youth who converted from Christianity to Islam at age 19 and later shot two U.S. army troops outside an Arkansas recruiting station, asked the committee for help. Bledsoe blamed Islamic extremists for radicalizing his son Carlos at mosques in Nashville, Tennessee. Carlos changed his name to Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad and was held responsible for the 2009 fatal attack on an Army Recruiting Center killing in Little Rock, Arkansas. ""We are losing American babies. Our children are in danger. We must stand up and do something about the problem,"" Bledsoe said. ""I'd like to see something change that no other family in this great country of ours has to go through what our family is facing today. What happened to Carlos at those Nashville mosques isn't normal."" Later, Bledsoe seemed perplexed by criticism of the hearing by Democrats, saying they didn't understand the reality of the problem or appeared fearful of political ramifications. To Baca, the sheriff, part of the problem stems from distrust between Muslim communities and local law enforcement in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. He described successful outreach by his department to minority communities that have brought cooperation in criminal investigations, and called on Muslim parents to notify authorities at the first sign of irregular behavior that might signal radicalization of a child. King complained about a lack of cooperation from Muslim organizations and Muslim-American communities, and he and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, took direct aim at CAIR, which was a harsh critic of the hearing. Wolf said the group was ""counter-productive and it is hurting the Muslim-American community,"" accusing it of waging ""a campaign to intimidate and silence anyone who raises concerns about Muslim radicalization."" Jasser also criticized CAIR, saying it and other well-known Muslim groups emerged from and represented the more traditional elements of Islam, rather than the majority of Muslim Americans who had a more secular world view. King told CNN he had increased security because of the anger generated by the hearings, describing threats he is getting as a ""combination of things."" He already had security protection with him at home in New York following the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. CNN's Tom Cohen, Moni Basu, Richard Allen Greene, Alan Silverleib, Dana Bash, Mike Ahlers and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff says Americans must educate themselves better about Islam .

"(CNN) -- The Year of the Gamer. Does 2013 actually deserve that title? Among video-game enthusiasts, the year was nearly consumed by the official announcement, subsequent speculation about, and ultimate release of Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One home consoles. Controversy and questions from gamers followed each long-awaited console until their arrival in homes began in November. Both clearly sparked lots of interest. Sony is reporting 2.1 million in global PS4 sales, while Microsoft says it's sold more than 2 million Xbox Ones. Both are poised to hit large, but slightly different audiences. Sony is going after the hardcore, dedicated gamer while Microsoft is positioning their device as an entertainment hub for the whole family. Either way, both are expected to do very well and create a huge demand for games and other content well into 2014. Nintendo, who led the next-generation charge in 2012 with the Wii U, spent much of the year concentrating on developing games for their new console. Battling a soft reception for the Wii U, the company released a wide range of games for hardcore players as well as casual, family-friendly titles, including a return of the always-popular Mario in the new ""Super Mario 3D World."" Their handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, continued to be a boon for the company. It's regularly the company's best-selling platform, and the release of ""Pokemon X/Y"" for the device ushered in a new chapter in the long-running franchise. They also added to their handheld stable with the Nintendo 2DS, a portable console designed for children. More durable and without the 3D effect, the 2DS was developed for the rough-and-tumble life of a kid. They weren't the only ones with a new entry in the portable market. The Nvidia Shield, released in July, tries bridge PC gaming and portable gaming. It can be used as a PC game controller, uses an Android-based mobile platform and has access to the Google Play store as well as Nvidia's own TegraZone. Technology advancements are creating more detailed, more responsive, and better quality games for the mobile gaming audience. A new iPhone 64-bit processing chip released in September had developers saying phone games are getting closer to console quality. And analysts are bullish on the future of mobile gaming, predicting revenues to reach $13.2 billion by the end of 2013 and nearly double in the next two year. Established PC and console game makers (Firaxis and UbiSoft to name just two) pushed into the mobile market aggressively in 2013, making games for the casual as well as the dedicated gamer. Mobile games weren't the only winners in 2013. The massive release of Grand Theft Auto V helped propel consumer spending on gaming to $3.45 billion in the third quarter of the year, the best quarter since 2011, according to The NPD Group. However, it wasn't all peaches and cream for the gaming industry in 2013. Despite a flood of money to some titles, some big-name game companies found themselves on the outside. THQ, a company that created the very popular ""Saints Row"" series and held the WWE license, finally broke apart in February with many of its properties being bought up by other companies. Zynga, a major powerhouse in social platform gaming, began shutting down some games, laying off personnel, closing offices and reported losing nearly half its user base from the previous year. Despite the hiring of former Microsoft executive Don Mattrick as Zynga's new CEO, many top executives also left the company. The landscape of gaming is definitely in flux. The development of new technology is expanding the reach of quality games to more players. Female gamers and parents playing with their kids are growing in numbers and game makers are working on games to reflect that more diverse audience. And with the expansion of the audience comes greater acceptance of the gaming experience in our culture. So if you think 2013 was the Year of the Gamer, just wait until 2014.","Release of Xbox One, PlayStation 4 topped 2013 gaming news .

"(CNN)  -- Two U.S. journalists who had been detained by North Korea were traveling back to the United States with former President Clinton hours after being pardoned, a Clinton spokesman said. Former President Clinton meets Tuesday with North Korea leader Kim Jong Il. ""They are en route to Los Angeles [California] where Laura and Euna will be reunited with their families,"" said spokesman Matt McKenna. Doug Ling, Laura's father, reacted to the news outside his home in Carmichael, California, with, ""One of the best days in my life ... I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back."" In Los Angeles, family friend Welly Yang said the Ling family had ""done everything they could, while respecting the North Korean government, to try and get Laura home."" He predicted that Ling would remain a journalist. ""Despite this terrifying experience, I can't imagine that Laura would give up her passion to tell stories that otherwise wouldn't be heard."" Their release Wednesday came after Clinton met with top government officials in Pyongyang. ""Clinton expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il for the hostile acts committed by the two American journalists against the DPRK after illegally intruding into it,"" the news agency reported. ""Clinton courteously conveyed to Kim Jong Il an earnest request of the U.S. government to leniently pardon them and send them back home from a humanitarian point of view. ""The meetings had candid and in-depth discussions on the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. in a sincere atmosphere and reached a consensus of views on seeking a negotiated settlement of them.""  Watch Ling's father welcome his daughter's pardon » . The report said Clinton then conveyed a message from President Obama ""expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters in Washington before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message -- written or oral -- from Obama. Gibbs added that the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a ""solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."" The report from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the nation's official name, described the agreement to release the journalists as ""a manifestation of the DPRK's humanitarian and peace-loving policy. ""The DPRK visit of Clinton and his party will contribute to deepening the understanding between the DPRK and the U.S. and building the bilateral confidence."" Ling and Lee are reporters for California-based Current TV -- a media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore. The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China for California-based Current Media and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign. Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue had been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang. ""We want to thank the Obama administration for its continuous and determined efforts to achieve this outcome, and President Clinton for his willingness to undertake this mission,"" Current Media co-founders Gore and Joel Hyatt said in a written statement. ""All of us at Current are overjoyed at Laura and Euna's safe return. Our hearts go out to them -- and to their families -- for persevering through this horrible experience."" The visit by the former president, whose wife, Hillary Clinton, is the Obama administration's secretary of state, came about three weeks after the United States dropped a request that Ling and Lee be released on humanitarian grounds. Instead, the United States was seeking amnesty for the women, Hillary Clinton said.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton » . Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks, which have stalled. North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has conducted several missile tests since. The United Nations has responded to those tests by tightening and expanding sanctions on the nation. North Korea and the United States were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Former President Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with Kim. The 67-year-old North Korean leader is widely reported to have suffered a stroke a year ago and is believed to be grooming his youngest son, Kim Jon Un, as his successor.

"London, England (CNN)  -- If the Omani royal family had its way, the entire world would recognize the country's ancient scent, frankincense -- so highly prized the Magi brought it to celebrate the birth of Jesus. The Omani royal family's perfumer, House of Amouage, is one of the world's luxury perfume brands. And it's on a serious expansion streak, despite the worldwide recession. The luxury perfumer was founded 25 years ago at the request of Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman's head of state, as a way to both preserve the sultanate's biblical perfume-making traditions and provide gifts for visiting world leaders. Now, it's looking to infiltrate the European -- and eventually the U.S. -- markets with its own named stores selling an unique, expensive brand of perfume, and other luxury goods, for the body and the home. Two new stores are planned for 2010 -- one in Dubai and one in London. The Dubai store, scheduled to open at the end of March, will be the first outside Oman. The London store, scheduled to open in May, will be the first outside the Gulf. ""This is the first part of our strategy to open mono-brand stores in key opinion-forming cities throughout Europe and the States,"" David Crickmore, the company's CEO, told CNN in an interview from his office in Oman. ""We believe that selling our ever-growing catalogue of products within their true environment gives the best explanation of the brand."" The perfumer's flagship store in Oman, opened in 2008, is a contemporary rendition of an Omani-style house, complete with Arabic touches. The London store, scheduled to open in May in the capital's upscale Knightsbridge neighborhood, will recreate a London townhouse, Crickmore said. The company already sells its perfumes wholesale through several upmarket department stores in Europe, Russia, the U.S. and Asia. Besides opening new branded stores, the company has also been busy expanding its product range, moving into both a bath-and-body line, perfumed essential oils and Italian hand-made leather goods. It also recently re-packaged its line, stressing the company's royal connection. The bottle caps for perfumes Jubilation 25 for women and Jubilation XXV for men, fragrances introduced to coincide with Amouage's 25th anniversary, resemble the dome of the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat and a ceremonial dagger. The company's logo, on the front of the perfume bottles, is also reminiscent of the royal seal. ""We like to remind people we're a royal brand,"" Crickmore said. When the company was founded, it started with a flourish, according to Luca Turin, a leading perfume critic and co-author of the book ""Perfumes: The Guide."" The royal family first commissioned a leading French perfumer to create one of the greatest fragrances money could buy. ""That kind of stuff only happens to a perfumer once or twice in a lifetime,"" said Turin. ""The money, the artistic freedom, no focus groups, nobody breathing down your neck. The whole thing was done with just greatness in mind. Utterly amazing. And the fragrance he came up with, Gold, is one of the greats of all time."" In the 1990s, though, the company lost its way, Turin said, introducing a host of fragrances with no clear artistic direction. Four years ago, Amouage hired Briton David Crickmore, a 29-year veteran of the luxury goods industry, to kick-start its image -- and grow the brand internationally. ""The aspiration of the family who owns it, members of the royal family, was to increase its international spread. They wanted an international brand that happens to be based in Oman, not an Omani brand selling internationally."" ""When I was brought in, it was predominantly a Gulf-oriented brand,"" Crickmore said. ""They felt that a fairly major change was required."" Crickmore hired Christopher Chong as creative director, a move perfume critic Turin said was critical to the company's newfound success. ""Art direction in fragrance is under-estimated,"" said Turin. ""A perfume is a message in a bottle. It's not a smell. It's an impression, an idea. Great fragrances are usually made by a perfumer, and an art director, who says, 'I want it to be like this.'"" Crickmore said the recession hasn't hit the luxury company, which sells a 50 ml bottle of perfume for $230, as hard as one would think. ""It put our plans back a year basically,"" he said. ""I wanted to open the stores in Dubai and London last year. Instead, we're doing it this year."" Asked if it was hard to compete in this era of celebrity fragrances, where every well-known face seems to be trotting out their own line of perfume, Crickmore replied: ""What sets us apart is longevity. Celebrity perfumes are here today, gone tomorrow, often made from cheap, in-the-lab ingredients."" ""We search for the finest possible ingredients, the rarest ingredients,"" he said. ""We just want the best, without worrying about the cost.""","House of Amouage, luxury perfume brand, on expansion streak .

"(CNN) -- In many ways our relationship with the hospitality industry is like a fledgling romance. Sometimes, it pulls some smooth moves, everything clicks and we walk hand in hand into the sunset. But just as often, its fumbling advances leave us feeling cheap, embarrassed and more than a little concerned about an itchy rash. So, in the interest of seeing this relationship through its growing pains, here are a few hints about what we'd like to see more of -- and less of. Share your loves and hates in the comments box below. We love airport taxi driver signs . Foreign airports can be intimidating places. Humidity hangs in the air, smells hang in the toilets and the mustaches hang off the faces of customs officials. These can all leave the frazzled traveler feeling disorientated. So, when we emerge onto a concourse filled with hundreds of baying touts, there's nothing more comforting than seeing a small cardboard sign bearing our misspelled name. This is our ticket through the chaos. Instantly, we have a friend and guide to get us through the perilous first few hours, to usher us to an air-conditioned vehicle and navigate the potholed roads that lie between us and our hotel. And if we're not too choosy about where we're staying, there's no need to book ahead to take advantage of this service. Few drivers speak our language and will be so bored of waiting, they'll happily accept our claim to be ""Goerge Cloney."" Clooney can find his own way to the city. We hate welcome drinks . Because -- after we've traveled halfway across the world in a cramped and airless passenger jet -- the last thing we want on arrival at our resort is a glass of sugary punch to swill into the fur-coated hole we used to call our mouth. Maybe hotel staff think that hot, sticky and uncomfortable guests need hot, sticky and uncomfortable beverages. But what's wrong with a freshly brewed cup of tea or coffee or a restorative pitcher of beer? Failing those, a bucket of cold water would do the trick. We love pillow chocolates . There's a glorious lack of logic to the hotel habit of placing chocolates on pillows. When we've brushed our teeth in readiness for a snooze, why do we then need a mouthful of sugar? But for anyone who relishes the joy of a new hotel room -- trampolining on beds, raiding minibars, wallowing in bathrobes -- pillow chocolates serve to heighten those childish pleasures. They do, however, present a hazard to those too exhausted to spot them. Although there are probably hotels somewhere that deliberately cater to this, most guests won't enjoy waking up to find a blotch of warm, brown goo sliding down their cheeks. We hate bellboys hauling our luggage . We've bounced our suitcase down 6 million steps from our apartment. We've pulled every muscle in our upper bodies hoisting it into the overhead lockers. We've survived angry mobs bent on avenging the elderly woman we hospitalized with a careless swing of our backpack. So why do we now need to tip someone to carry our bags the last 20 meters? Sure, we appreciate that some frail or lazy folk need a helping hand with their luggage. But look at us: we're normal human beings, we've made it this far and we can manage on our own. It's a long shot, but we can probably also figure out how to switch on the lights in our room, flush the toilet and put the large denomination banknote, which is inevitably the only cash we have on us right now, to much better use. We love towel elephants . ""Towel elephant"" sounds like a euphemism for an unexpected encounter in the men's steam room, but actually describes a form of origami deployed by some hotels. This involves folding together a hand and bath towel to produce a cute, fluffy pachyderm, replete with trunk, ears and legs. Towels have long been at the front line of hotel cost-cutting -- usually in the shape of those environmental notices that urge you to reuse them as much as possible -- so it's nice to see a bit of attention lavished on them for once. Just remember to unfold them before use. There can be few things more distressing to hotel maids than seeing a damp elephant in the corner of the bathroom, its trunk drooping in shame. We hate hotel music . There are two types of jazz -- and they're both execrable. Neither more so than when they're oozing through a hotel loudspeaker system. As if it wasn't bad enough to smother us with soft saxophone every time we step into an elevator, many hotels also pursue us down their corridors via loudspeakers embedded in the ceiling. In psychological warfare, music is often blasted round-the-clock at targets to force them into surrender. This won't work if the enemy has spent any amount of time in a hotel. We love the concierge desk . Always smiling, always genial, always ready to serve. Many of the responsibilities of the concierge are being replaced by the Internet -- after all, it's tough to compete with local websites when searching for the best jalapeno-infused margarita in town. But it's nice to know these service stalwarts are still around to scatter our dog's ashes in the sea and find us life-sized replicas of ourselves made of chocolate at a moment's notice. We're not making those up. Click here for a list of bizarre hotel guest requests. We hate feeble Wi-Fi signals . For most people, an Internet connection is now as essential as having water on tap in the bathroom. So if you're going to include it in the price of our hotel room, make sure you give us a strong, uninterrupted signal. If the water slows to a trickle or cuts out every couple of minutes, angry guests will willingly stomp down to Reception, naked apart from a bath towel, to point wet accusing fingers at the manager. Given that many bored business travelers also use the Internet while wrapped in a bath towel, it's in everyone's interests to ensure they are kept online and their wet accusing fingers are kept out of Reception. We hate unreliable magnetic swipe cards . Magnetic key cards are easier to carry than clumsy old skeleton keys and when we forget to return them at checkout they're easy to throw away. Hooray. But few indignities foisted on us by the hotel industry are as aggravating as returning to the hotel at 11:30 at night after drinks and dinner, crossing the lobby, taking the elevator to the 23rd floor, walking down the hallway thinking of nothing more than that toilet in the room we so desperately need right now ... then not seeing that reassuring little green light appear when we swipe our key card. Wait, did we do that right? Try it again. Try the other one. Do it again. The other way. Try the ... Eventually, the only thing left to do is slog back down to the front desk for a ""quick fix"" to a problem that pops up far more often than it should. We love free bread sticks . Perhaps love is too strong a word. But we like them a lot, so do keep them coming while we're deciding what to order. Yes, obviously some are finding their way into our pockets for later consumption, but after the ""towel elephant"" incident in Reception and that George Clooney mix-up with the taxi, it could be a while before we're able to sneak past the bellboys and get to eat our pillow chocolates.

"(CNN) -- The Texas Giant roller coaster is set to reopen this weekend, nearly two months after a woman plunged to her death on the ride. The roller coaster will reopen with new safety measures in place, Six Flags Over Texas said in a statement Tuesday, including redesigned restraint bar pads, new seat belts and a coaster seat at the ride's entrance for visitors to test their fit before they get in line. The ride has been closed since July 19, when Rosa Esparza fell out of a car and plummeted to her death. As park officials trumpeted the ride's reopening, Esparza's family filed a civil wrongful-death lawsuit Tuesday, accusing Six Flags of negligence. Police: No foul play seen in roller coaster death . According to the lawsuit, Esparza's daughter heard screams behind her and turned around to see her mother being thrown out of the car. She was thrown against the ride and then catapulted onto the metal roof of a tunnel below, the lawsuit says, dying from traumatic injuries she sustained. ""As Rosa Esparza's tragic death starkly illustrates, errors on the part of the Six Flags Defendants turned a thrilling illusion into a nightmarish reality,"" the lawsuit says. ""Customers of the park expect mock scares and delighted screams as they ride the Texas Giant roller-coaster, but they certainly do not expect to be placed in any real danger, whatsoever."" Opinion: Death by 'amusement' Six Flags spokeswoman Sandra Daniels responded in a statement Thursday, ""While our thoughts and prayers remain with Ms. Esparza's family and friends, there are a number of inaccuracies contained in the recent lawsuit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously."" In their statement Tuesday, park officials said an investigation had revealed that there had been no mechanical failure on the ride. ""Due to litigation, the company is not releasing any further information about the outcome of the investigation,"" the statement said. Texas state officials have approved the reopening of the ride, the statement said, adding that it had undergone extensive testing.

"(CNN) -- Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is overseeing the federal response to the BP oil spill, said Sunday that he is ""satisfied"" with the amount of dispersants that have been used to clean up the disaster, saying crews have used them only when needed. Allen's comments were in response to new documents released by a congressional subcommittee that indicate Coast Guard officials allowed BP to use excessive amounts of chemical dispersants in the Gulf of Mexico. BP used the chemicals to break up oil after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion sent millions of gallons of crude gushing into the Gulf. Allen noted that the decision to use the dispersants does not rest with BP; rather, ""it's a decision by the federal on-scene coordinator,"" he said in describing a ""very disciplined process."" Despite a federal directive restricting the use of dispersants, the Coast Guard routinely granted exemptions, said Rep. Edward J. Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee. In May, the Environmental Protection Agency, along with the Coast Guard, ordered the oil giant to stop surface application of the chemicals during the oil spill except in rare occasions, according to a House subcommittee on energy and environment. In rare cases, exemptions had to be requested, documents show. ""BP carpet bombed the ocean with these chemicals, and the Coast Guard allowed them to do it,"" Markey said in a statement Saturday. ""After we discovered how toxic these chemicals really are, they had no business being spread across the Gulf in this manner."" Allen dismissed Markey's allegations during a conference call with reporters Sunday. ""I'm satisfied that we only use them [dispersants] when they're needed,"" he said. Allen said field commanders on a case-by-case basis have decided to use dispersants when oil has been spotted by surveillance aircraft and no other method of cleaning it up is available in the area. ""We're going to accept some impact on the water column"" rather than having the oil reach the beach, he said. The Coast Guard approved more than 74 exemptions in 48 days, Markey said. In one instance, Coast Guard officials allowed the oil giant to use a larger volume of dispersants than it had applied for, he said. Dispersants are ""a toxic stew of chemicals, oil and gas, with impacts that are not well understood,"" Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in the letter to Allen. BP issued a statement Sunday saying it has worked closely with the EPA and the Coast Guard over the use of dispersants ""since the very beginning"" of the disaster. ""Furthermore, we've complied with EPA requests regarding dispersants which are an EPA-approved and recognized tool in fighting oil spills,"" the statement said. Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, said Sunday that the oil company is funding research into the long-term effects of the spill, including the use of dispersants. ""Right now we haven't seen anything that shows us to be concerned, but we're going to keep looking,"" he said. Markey said the findings are based on an analysis by the Energy and Environment Subcommittee. ""The use of dispersant is always a difficult decision, with environmental trade-offs that must be taken seriously into consideration,"" EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said Sunday. ""As a result, its use in response to the BP spill was subject to numerous strict conditions once it quickly became apparent that BP wanted to use it in unprecedented quantities and in novel ways."" BP's use of disperants peaked at 70,000 gallons on May 24, the EPA said. It was after that the EPA ordered the halt on its use, except for rare occasions. From the time that directive was issued, dispersant use dropped 72 percent, Gilfillan said. Initially, the EPA was not involved in the day-to-day decisions about which exceptions were granted, but that changed in late June. ""While EPA may not have concurred with every individual waiver granted by the federal on-scene coordinator, the agency believes dispersant use has been an essential tool in mitigating this spill's impact, preventing millions of gallons of oil from doing even more damage to sensitive marshes, wetlands and beaches and the economy of the Gulf coast,"" Gilfillan said. Allen said Sunday that he and EPA administrator Lisa Jackson talk daily about dispersant use, saying ""we haven't ignored EPA's guidelines."" Markey said the subcommittee also found contradictions on how much chemical dispersant was being used. On other occasions, BP used more than the amount approved by the Coast Guard, Markey said in his letter. The report brings into question the total amount of dispersants used in the Gulf. BP says it has used 1.8 million gallons to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon's ruptured well. ""The validity of those numbers are now in question,"" Markey said. Meanwhile Sunday, Allen announced that the first of two efforts to seal the ruptured well once and for all could begin as early as Monday night. The ""static kill"" -- when mud and cement are poured into the well from above -- had been previously delayed while debris that collected during Tropical Storm Bonnie can be cleared out. Suttles said that the more likely start for the static kill will be Tuesday. ""I do have a lot of confidence we'll be successful,"" Suttles said. That will be followed by a final ""bottom kill"" after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that Allen estimated Sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete.","NEW: BP says it complied with EPA guidelines .

"(CNN) -- Is this the dream for families traveling by air or their worst nightmare? Thomson Airways, the third biggest airline in the UK, is considering new seating configurations that'll seat parents and kids face-to-face around a table. Promo photos for the rear-of-the-plane concept look good, showing a relaxed mom and dad presiding over a well-behaved brood. Families like this may actually exist, in which case Thomson is on to a winner. Parents looking forward to corralling irksome offspring into middle seats while they binge-watch blockbuster movies may think differently. Child-free zone and snack bar . The flying family circle setup is one of several ideas Thomson is considering for the new fleet of 47 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft it has on order. Also on the drawing board are ""couple pods,"" featuring a table (for champagne, according to the airline) sandwiched between two seats with mood lighting. As a possible sop to parents deprived of their movie marathon, Thomson is also looking at on-board childcare services. Flight attendants will be trained to engage kids with entertainments like crafts and quizzes that related to the destination. There are plans to keep adults happy, with a ""beach snack bar"" in premium cabins and a zoning system deployed to create a child-free zone. Unusual innovations . Thomson may also introduce resort concierges on board, offering recommendations about the destination. Inflight entertainment systems will allow last-minute bookings and room upgrades. A Thomson spokeswoman told CNN that all the ideas were genuine plans that could be introduced as the new fleet is rolled out over the next five years. She said some were already being trialed. The airline's concepts follow a slew of other speculative in-flight innovations created by industry players attempting to raise profit margins or outdo competitors. Air New Zealand recently touted its Skycouch -- a three-seat row that can be converted into a futon in economy class. Manufacturer Airbus this year filed a patent for saddle seats -- an idea once floated by low-cost carrier Ryanair but largely dismissed as a marketing stunt.","UK airline Thomson considers introducing round-table seating for families .

"Washington (CNN) -- A civilian mortician who was recently demoted for misconduct in handling remains of the U.S. military's war dead has resigned, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said Friday. Quinton ""Randy"" Keel, who worked at the U.S. military mortuary in Dover, Delaware, was among three supervisors who ""illegally tried to suppress (three employees') disclosures and punish them for their whistleblowing"" about mismanagement and mishandling of human remains, the independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency said in a statement. ""It is not surprising that Mr. Keel chose to resign,"" the agency said. ""The Office of Special Counsel's report of investigation, which will be made public in mid-March and which the Air Force received in late January, found that Mr. Keel retaliated against the whistleblowers."" The special counsel's office is awaiting the final decisions by senior U.S. Air Force officials on disciplinary action for the two other supervisors, who remain on staff, the agency said. The office has been investigating claims by three of the whistleblowers that the Air Force retaliated against them for bringing up the problems, in one case attempting to terminate the employment of one of them. ""The government needs to listen to employees who come forward with serious allegations of wrongdoing,"" Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said in a statement. ""And it needs to take disciplinary action when supervisors suppress or punish whistleblowers. Failure to do so sends a chilling message."" In November, a Defense Department official confirmed that Keel, a civilian, was demoted to a non-supervisory job and was working in another area at Dover outside the mortuary. Another civilian, Trevor Dean, a mortician and funeral director there, was transferred to a non-supervisory job. Col. Robert Edmonson, the mortuary commander between January 2009 and October 2010 when the incident occurred, was issued a letter of reprimand. A year-long Air Force investigation into whistleblowers' 14 allegations of wrongdoing involving four U.S. service members killed in action found that Quinn sawed off the arm of a dead Marine without consulting the Marine's family. The body was being prepared for viewing by his family and had a badly damaged arm, whose bone had fused at a 90-degree angle, a Pentagon official said. The Air Force found no wrongdoing and officials say preparing badly damaged bodies can be very difficult. But the federal Office of Special Counsel, which also investigated the matter, said the family should have been notified, according to a statement issued by that office Tuesday. In November, U.S. Air Force investigators found ""serious misconduct"" in the handling of remains of the nation's war dead at the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary, special counsel's office said. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz referred to ""gross mismanagement"" in some aspects of the mortuary's operations. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta appointed a panel to review operations at the Dover mortuary, Schwartz said then. The Air Force investigation confirmed several of the allegations from whisteblowers, including several instances in which portions of remains from troops killed in action were lost or unaccounted for. It included losing an ankle that had been in storage and some bags that held other body parts and remains. A Pentagon official confirmed that elements of the Army and Air Force were criticized for shipping fetal remains from military families to Dover in cardboard boxes. At a news conference in November, Schwartz said the investigation began after allegations from three employees ""became known to us."" He did not identify the employees or their positions. But the report from the Office of Special Counsel identified the three as James Parsons, Mary Ellen Spera, and William Zwicharowski. The Air Force said all three are still employed by Dover Air Force Base. ""The fundamental result of the investigation was that senior Air Force mortuary operations affairs officials did not meet standards in that they failed to act with clear indications that processes and procedures ... were inadequate to ensure accountability of remains,"" Schwartz said in November. He said among their findings, investigators ""concluded that the loss of two specific portions of remains constituted gross mismanagement."" Those two cases involved the remains of an Army soldier and those of an Air Force airman. ""In one case we have reason to believe that the remains were properly disposed of; in the second case, we cannot make that argument. It is simply unknown what happened to the second set of remains,"" Schwartz said. ""This gross mismanagement dealt with the fact that ... supervisors, of which there were three, failed to properly perceive and then act upon ... clear indications that there were systemic issues with respect to accountability of remains in the mortuary."" Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said in November that the Air Force hadn't taken ""sufficient disciplinary action against the officials responsible for wrongdoing,"" according to an OSC statement. But Schwartz said last year that he did not believe the situations cited in the report were intentional. He emphasized that ""this was difficult work, 24/7. And while their performance did not meet standards, this was not a deliberate act, in my personal view."" The Air Force said in November that it is improving procedures at Dover but admitted that ""the mortuary staff failed to maintain accountability while processing remains for three service members."" ""While it is likely that the disposition of remains was by appropriate method, it could not be shown that it was in accordance with the families' directions,"" the Air Force said in a statement in November. Panetta noted that ""one of the Department's most sacred responsibilities is ensuring that the remains of our fallen heroes are recovered and returned to their families with the honor and dignity they have earned. ""I was deeply disturbed to learn about questions involving the possibilities of improper handling and preparation of remains of four service members at the Air Force's Dover Port Mortuary,"" Panetta said in a statement last year. The Office of Special Counsel said last year that while the Air Force investigation ""confirmed most of the whistleblower's factual allegations,"" it ""nonetheless failed to admit wrongdoing."" ""The Air Force did, however, respond positively by changing numerous practices at the mortuary,"" the OSC said in a statement. The OSC said that in the incidents in which ""three body parts of service members killed while on active duty were lost by the Port Mortuary,"" the Air Force acknowledged its ""negligent failure,"" but ""still concluded that there was no obligation to notify the families."" The OSC also criticized last year the handling of some fetal remains from military families that ""were shipped to Dover inside plastic pails, which were in turn placed in non-reinforced, used cardboard boxes, even though military guidelines require that remains be treated with 'reverence, care and dignity.' ""The Air Force acknowledged that this handling was 'substandard' and that it 'wasn't very dignified,' but nevertheless said the remains were afforded the requisite reverence, care and dignity,"" an OSC statement said. The remains of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan have regularly been flown to Dover since the wars began. More than 6,300 deceased individuals have been returned there. Due to combat injuries, remains are often difficult to identify and officials have long acknowledged that Dover does retain some human remains and parts that are so damaged they are not possible to identify. ""The mortuary for the United State military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary,"" Lerner said. ""These events are deeply troubling, as is the Air Force's failure to acknowledge culpability."" In a letter to President Obama, the OSC said the report ""demonstrates a pattern of the Air Force's failure to acknowledge culpability for wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and their dependents. While the report reflects a willingness to find paperwork violations and errors, with the exception of the cases of missing portions, the findings stop short of accepting accountability for failing to handle remains with the requisite 'reverence, care, and dignity befitting them and the circumstances.'"" The Air Force has contacted families of the war dead and Schwartz has asked Panetta for an independent assessment of mortuary operations at Dover. Former Surgeon General Richard Carmona was to lead that investigation and provide a report to Panetta. Schwartz said that he and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley ""have taken personal responsibility for this."" ""I want to assure our men and women in uniform, and the American public, that the Air Force mortuary standards they expect for our fallen heroes are being met,"" Schwartz said in a statement. The Air Force has set up a toll free number for the families of fallen service members to call if they have questions about the investigation. They can call 1 855 637 2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil.

"(CNN) -- The first U.S. case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has been reported in Indiana, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. The patient is a health-care provider who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to provide health care, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The person, an American male, traveled on April 24 from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said. He began experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, and fever on April 27, according to the Indiana State Department of Health. The patient was admitted to Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28, the same day he visited the emergency department there, the health department said. He has been isolated and is in stable condition. He is receiving oxygen support, but does not require a ventilator, Schuchat said. MERS: 5 things to know . The virus poses a ""very low risk to the broader general public,"" Schuchat said, as it has not been shown to spread easily from person to person. The CDC and the Indiana State Department of Health are conducting a joint investigation into the case, according to a CDC statement. The CDC confirmed Indiana test results on Friday. ""The CDC, IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health) and CDPH (Chicago Department of Public Health) do not consider passengers on the flight or bus to be close contacts of the patient and therefore are not at high risk,"" said Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, director of the IDPH. Passengers on the same plane and bus as the patient will be contacted by the CDC as a precautionary measure, starting Saturday, the Illinois statement said. If the CDC identifies ill individuals with possible MERS-CoV, it will notify health officials in Chicago and Indiana. ""There is no reason to suspect any current risk to travelers or employees at O'Hare Airport at this time,"" said CDPH commissioner Bechara Choucair. The coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was first reported in the Middle East -- specifically, the Arabian Peninsula -- in 2012. Laboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries, including the Indiana case, Schuchat said. Ninety-three people have died. So far, all MERS cases have been linked to six countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said. The Saudi Ministry of Health has reported 339 cases, and said nearly a third of those have died. Not all of the Saudi cases have been confirmed by the World Health Organization. ""The MERS virus is of grave concern because of the virulence,"" Schuchat said. But, she added, ""We're not yet aware of confirmed sustained community transmission."" Late last month, Saudi officials noted a spike in new cases. The CDC has expected MERS to come to the United States, Schuchat said. ""We have been preparing for this."" However, ""The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away,"" she said. Opinion: Why MERS virus is so scary . MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. The CDC has issued general precautions such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding close contact with infected people, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched. Pediatricians should ask about where young patients with high fever and respiratory symptoms have traveled, Schuchat said. ""Young children often have fever and respiratory symptoms, but the key here is: Was there a history of travel within the past 14 days to the Arabian Peninsula, or contact with someone? ... They should alert their clinician about that travel or contact,"" Schuchat said. Currently, the CDC does not recommend changing travel plans because of the virus, Schuchat said. No one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence is emerging implicating camels. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. The same group of researchers reported in February that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus. MERS mystery: Virus found in camels . Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Egypt reported its first case on April 26, according to the WHO. Limited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the Middle East gave the virus to others. Officials are not aware of any other confirmed U.S. cases, Schuchat said, adding it's too early to assume no one else is ill. An active investigation is underway.

""This is the text message that caused the car accident that changed my life forever,"" the man said. According to Stephenson, the ad did its job. ""She said, 'Dad ... that's heavy',"" he said. ""I said, it's supposed to be heavy. It got your attention and that's what we're trying to accomplish."" Massachusetts teen convicted of homicide in texting-while-driving case . The ad, from AT&T, is part of the mobile company's ""It Can Wait"" campaign. First launched in 2009, the campaign aims to curb texting and driving, especially among young drivers. It will be ramping up between now and September 19, or what the campaign is calling ""No Text on Board -- Pledge Day."" AT&T is asking all Americans to visit ItCanWait.com on or before that day and take a pledge to not text behind the wheel. According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, texting while driving increased 50% in one year (2010), when 20% of all drivers admitted to texting or sending an e-mail while driving. Teens report doing so at more than twice that rate, with 43% admitting to doing so in an AT&T survey. People texting are 23 times more likely to get into an accident than other drivers, according to the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. Several AT&T competitors, including Sprint and Verizon, have their own anti-texting-and-driving campaigns in one form or another, a fact Stephenson said he welcomes. ""If it's just AT&T owning this issue, it doesn't get the traction it needs,"" he said. ""This is a dead-serious issue and I don't mean that as a pun. People are dying ... we just need everyone to get after this and reverse this trend."" But with the ads like the one Stephenson watched with his daughter, AT&T's campaign has been most visible. Stephenson makes no apologies about the frank nature of the ads, another of which features a woman sharing the one-word text she'd sent to her sister, who was reading it behind the wheel when she flipped her car and died. ""I don't think you're going to move the needle without making people uncomfortable,"" he said. Texting while walking a dangerous experiment in multitasking . Others supporting the campaign include the National Safety Council, National Organizations for Youth Safety, wireless-industry trade association CTIA and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration issued guidelines Thursday to ensure children can enroll in public schools even if they or their parents are living illegally in the United States. The legal guidance from the Justice and Education departments allow school districts and states to ask for proof of students' age or that they are residents in the jurisdictions where they attend school. But schools can't require proof of citizenship or block students if parents can't prove their legal residency. Attorney General Eric Holder said the legal guidance is in reaction to reports from around the country that some school districts have identification requirements that create hurdles for undocumented children to enroll in public schools, in violation of federal law. Holder cited a 1982 Supreme Court decision that ordered states to provide education to any child living in their jurisdiction. ""Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin,"" the attorney general said. Schools have to be flexible about the proof of residency they can ask of parents, the guidelines issued Thursday say.

The Obama administration issued legal guidance to states and school districts in 2011, but some problems have persisted.

"(CNN) -- World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic ""has the faintest idea"" what his organization does after the former world No. 1 said he'd lost faith in the system. The Serbian labeled compatriot Viktor Troicki's 12-month ban from tennis for missing a drugs test a ""total injustice"" and said he was now nervous to give any sort of sample. But Fahey dismissed the six-time grand slam winner's comments as unhelpful and said it was up to the sport to do more to fight against doping. ""I don't think Novak Djokovic has the faintest idea what we do and if he wants to understand what we do I'm more than happy to pick up the phone and talk to him, if he wants to talk to me,"" he told CNN. ""If he wishes to then make a comment I might listen to him but for the moment I don't think that was an informed statement."" WADA's role in the fight against doping in sport has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of athletes failed tests in Kenya and Jamaica. And as well as Troicki, Croatian tennis star Marin Cilic also served a ban for doping offenses after taking a prohibited substance contained in supplements bought from a chemist. Those cases have provoked disagreement within the game as to the best course of action, with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray calling the pair's actions ""unprofessional."" Roger Federer, winner of 17 grand slams, said more testing needed to be done within the sport and also said players should give a sample when requested. But when asked if he knew how widespread doping in tennis was, Fahey replied: ""No I don't and nor do I think tennis knows how widespread it is. ""What I do know is they have a program and a commitment has been given. Can they do more? Every sport can do more. ""And when you get criticism from some of the champion tennis players about the number of times they've been tested then I hope tennis takes notice of it. I know they have and I believe that they'll address it."" Fahey also said the fall from grace of cyclist Lance Armstrong had been the best anti-doping message since he became WADA president in 2007. In January, Armstrong -- following years of strenuous denials -- admitted to doping throughout his storied career, after he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. But Fahey thinks Armstrong's descent has proved that drug cheats will be caught out and punished no matter what their status. ""I think the Lance Armstrong story was the best message in my six years as to the effectiveness of the anti-doping programs,"" he explained. ""What that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are, how tall, how successful you are, you can get caught and be dealt with. That man has been destroyed in terms of reputation and in terms of, perhaps, many other aspects of his life. ""He's been seen as a cheat, a bully, a liar -- there's no doubt about that. Once upon a time he was revered as one of the greatest champions in his sport, of all time. ""The fact that someone as big as that is ultimately brought to justice shows that our code is effective."" As for athletics, Fahey acknowledged that doping is ""widespread"" and said part of the reason might be that there are different resources available to tackle the problem in different countries. Kenya has had 17 athletes banned for doping offenses since 2012, while former 100 meters world record-holder Asafa Powell and three-time Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown are among six Jamaicans to have tested positive this year. Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica, but rejected the notion performance-enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport. There had been a suggestion that certain countries could be banned from the Olympics if they refused to comply with anti-doping programs -- raising the prospect of Jamaica's six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt missing out -- but Fahey said that was for the International Olympic Committee to determine. ""Should the Iinternational Olympic Committee take stronger steps? I'm sure if the evidence is there on the basis of difficulties with compliance in any particular country they would look seriously at that,"" he said. ""I think we have to stop for a moment and say, 'What is actually going on in Jamaica?' They do have an anti-doping program, it has not been effective, it has not been as good as it could have been and that's what WADA examined. ""We now have given them recommendations and we've got a commitment to say, 'Yes we dropped the ball but we've picked it up again and we'll get it right and we'll do that quickly.' "" Fahey also said that WADA's revised code, which is due out this week, would allow the agency greater investigative powers and called it a ""great jump forward.""","WADA president John Fahey replies to Novak Djokovic's criticism .

"(CNN) -- Hannah Whiteley laughs in the face of danger -- at least she does now. But it wasn't always that way, for this was one kitesurfing tale which almost ended in tragedy. Rewind 11 years and with her father Pete, a five time British senior champion, watching on in horror. Whiteley came within inches of serious injury -- and maybe even death. It was a moment which would have forced lesser beings into nightmares and cold sweats -- but not this British-born battler. ""My dad was teaching me and I was going along fine, then all of a sudden then I was out of control and went flying through the sky,"" Whiteley told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I was getting dragged down with the kite and heading into the wavebreakers. ""I thought I was going to hit the pier and that was scary, but I hit the ground and was in a daze. Some guy came and helped tame my kite and made sure I stayed still. ""When you crash in the water, the water turns into concrete, it's not soft. You get a lot of whiplash in your neck and it gets flung back. ""I was in a semiconscious state, a bit shaken up but that put me off for five years. Looking back, I'm just so relieved I gave it a second chance."" Rising star . Kitesurfing is a fusion of some of the most exciting and challenging water sports, taking components of paragliding, surfing, windsurfing and wakeboarding before sprinkling some acrobatics and gymnastics on top for good measure. Standing on a small board, the rider uses the wind to power the large kite, which propels it across the waves at rapid speed. Since returning to action at the age of 15, Whiteley has gone on to establish herself as one of Europe's rising stars -- an outcome which looked unlikely following her first ever event. On that occasion, the amateur competition ended in disappointment after she finished last, beaten by a considerable distance and defeated by a far more experienced field. It was to prove the turning point. ""I was so embarrassed,"" Whiteley recalled. ""I couldn't do any freestyle tricks and I came last. ""I just sat there and thought, 'What am I doing here?' But that competition really inspired me and suddenly I said to myself, 'I'm never going to be that bad again.' ""I went out and trained as much as possible after that."" Reaching the top . That chastening experience powered Whiteley through months of training, hitting the waves at every opportunity despite the infamous British weather. The rest is history. At just 15, Whiteley became the youngest ever female to win the British Amateur Ladies title, repeating the feat the following year at the professional championship. Two more title wins followed in consecutive years as did the prestigious Big Air/Board off crown at the 2009 Pro Kite World Tour competition. Now at the age of 21, and voted as the country's most influential female kitesurfer, Whiteley has her sights set on reaching the very top. ""I'd really like to be European champion,"" she added. ""At the moment I feel as if I'm not at my peak. I always want to push it and I think I'm going to be going for some time. ""There's plenty of time for me to progress and have fun."" Magical . There's certainly plenty of fun. Whiteley travels across the globe to some of the most exotic places to improve her kitesurfing skills. Australia, Turkey and Hawaii are just three of her favorite places -- although she retains an affection for her local beach at Lytham St Annes in the north west of England. But it doesn't matter whether its brown water off the British coast or sharks lurking beneath sunnier climes, nothing puts Whiteley off taking her kite into the deep unknown. ""It's a pretty magical feeling when you're out kitesurfing,"" she added. ""You're looking back at the land, you've got the whole ocean, and it's just really special. ""We're using the wind, the sea and the waves. When it's cold and windy you feel like you're really in the elements, it's great, you feel alive. ""When I started to compete at the age of 15 it was a real eye-opener. I got to travel to some amazing places and it was definitely for me. ""You have so much freedom on the water and it takes you to beautiful places you wouldn't normally go to. It's amazing.""","Hannah Whiteley is a three-time British freestyle kitesurfing champion .

"(CNN) -- Two schools: one a football powerhouse, steeped in athletic glory, and the other a bastion of military tradition. Each have faced allegations in recent weeks of child sexual abuse -- in the case of Penn State, by a former assistant football coach; at The Citadel, by an alumnus and former counselor at the college's summer camp. And in each case, the schools did not notify law enforcement after allegations were made, drawing criticism for apparently choosing to protect the institution's reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims -- something many find hard to understand. ""I think this is a pattern which is not surprising,"" said Kirk Hanson, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics and a social ethics professor at Santa Clara University in California. ""Institutions would like to find a reason that they don't have to publicize their own failings. ... Institutions too often substitute their own interests for the interests of the victims. This is an institutional ethics problem, in general."" Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. John Rosa, president of The Citadel, apologized in a press conference Monday for not reporting to police an allegation against Louis Neal ""Skip"" ReVille, 32. In 2007, The Citadel received an allegation from a former camper that five years earlier, ReVille had invited the boy into his room at The Citadel Summer Camp to watch pornography. Another camper was also present. They did not touch each other, but engaged in sexual activity, the college said. ReVille was arrested last month and faces at least six charges, including three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of lewd acts on a minor, according to police in the Charleston, South Carolina, suburb of Mount Pleasant. Although police did not provide specifics, CNN affiliate WCBD reported ReVille was accused of molesting at least five boys. According to court documents, he has admitted guilt in at least three cases involving incidents between November 2010 and October 2011. Meanwhile, at Penn State, legendary football coach Joe Paterno and university president Graham Spanier were fired after former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested and charged with child rape and sexual abuse following the release of a grand jury report detailing alleged crimes between 1994 and 2009. Authorities allege Sandusky accessed many of his victims through Second Mile, the charity he founded. Ohio State to Penn State: We support you . One incident, allegedly the rape of a young boy, was witnessed by then-graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary in 2002, in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities, according to the grand jury report. McQueary told Paterno what he had seen, and Paterno alerted the athletic director, Tim Curley, but no one notified police. Curley and Gary Schultz, Penn State's senior vice president for finance and business, face charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities. In an interview with NBC on Monday night, Sandusky denied he is a pedophile and said he is innocent of charges he sexually abused young boys. He conceded that he should not have showered with any of them. Penn State's football culture could inspire a reaction of ""we need to rally and protect that institution,"" and The Citadel has a storied and proud military history, Hanson said, and ""one can imagine that there would be considerable hesitation"" to report the allegations to police. ""This is the same mentality which has gotten the Catholic Church continually in trouble,"" Hanson said. ""It's the desire not to have a respected institution embarrassed and its reputation tarnished. It's a desire to protect their own, and that's clearest in the Penn State issue."" The parallels between Penn State's situation and the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Catholic Church are ""very pronounced,"" he said. The fact that Paterno and Sandusky were revered in the Penn State community could also have played a role. Thomas Day, a Penn State graduate and Second Mile alumnus who is now a graduate student at the University of Chicago, told CNN that when he went home to State College, Pennsylvania, and heard about the investigation into Sandusky's alleged acts, people's ""reactions were all the same: How could they ruin this man's name around town?"" he told CNN. It didn't seem to occur to them that the allegations could be true, he said. ""I don't think it's anything unique to universities,"" said Ramon John Aldag, an expert on behavioral decision-making and organizational behavior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""I think the same sorts of things happen in organizations in general and in life in general."" He referenced the ""bystander effect,"" in which people know someone is being hurt and do nothing. A number of explanations can be given for that, including ""diffusion of responsibility,"" in which the pressure on people to act is reduced because of the number of people who may share in the knowledge. In addition, there is ""pluralistic ignorance,"" in which people assume everyone else may know something they don't, he said. People may assume someone else is taking action, or that those above them are handling the situation, Aldag said. He cited the recent case of Wang Yue, a Chinese toddler who drew international attention after a security camera showed her being run over by two drivers and ignored by numerous passerby as she lay injured in the road. The 2-year-old girl later died, and the video sparked a global outcry about the state of morality in China. ""Criminal law imposes very few affirmative obligations on people,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""By that I mean criminal law is mostly about 'don't do this, don't do that. Don't kill somebody, don't do drugs, don't engage in fraud.'"" But, he said, ""the law is much less clear or less frequently used to tell people to do things."" There are a variety of historical reasons for that, he said, but ""as a result, people have developed the idea that it's safer to do nothing than do something."" Both Sandusky and ReVille are innocent until proven guilty, Hanson noted. But, he said, ""the difference between the legal and the moral (obligations), while important, obscures the fact that every individual who sees the abuse, who sees an evil like this, should feel morally obliged to act in order to protect the victim and future victims."" People should consider that a person accused of molesting a child could continue to commit such crimes, he said. The whistle-blower effect may also have contributed to the lack of action, Aldag said. ""Whoever it is that would speak out, either going to the police or to the press, that person is essentially a whistle-blower, and we know that whistle-blower -- that's a tremendous role to take on, especially if you're in a situation where you're probably going to cause huge harm to the university and people involved, and especially if you're in a position without too much power,"" he said. ""... They're permanently scarred by this."" Sandusky interview infuriates critics . ""The discussion of whistle-blowers over the last 25 years has struggled with this question of institutional interest and concern for individuals who are harmed by the behavior of representatives of that institution,"" Hanson said. ""... There are many laws in the U.S. which simply require reporting it to the institution. It is an ongoing dilemma of whether that's enough. Should we require, legally, individuals to report misbehavior not just to their institutions, but to police and public authorities?"" Pennsylvania is considering adopting a mandatory reporting law in the wake of the scandal. Hanson said such a law is already in place in California, requiring health care workers, teachers and others to report suspicions to police ""regardless of what their institution does."" The law was passed ""because of concerns like this -- 'I washed my hands of the responsibility because I told my boss,'"" Hanson said. ""As word of misbehavior goes up the chain of command, each level will have the temptation to sweep it under the rug,"" he said. ""And they can frequently be pressured to ignore the behavior. ... ""What you hope will happen in the future is that anyone who witnesses a child being molested will take the personal responsibility to make sure the authorities are called and not just report it to the institution.""","Both Penn State and The Citadel are criticized for failing to report abuse allegations .

"(CNN) -- For decades, comic books have had major shake-ups in their pages, with varying degrees of fan support -- and outrage. In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves. In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died. And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus. The just-released ""Amazing Spider-Man"" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of ""The Superior Spider-Man"" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit. Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott. Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: ""Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it."" Slott later noted that the reactions were getting more civil, as time went on. Comic book reader calls the new Spider-Man 'inferior' CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic. CNN: Why did you choose Doc Ock as the next Spider-Man? Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids. One of his first lines was, ""Some day I'll show them all! Some day they'll be sorry they ever laughed at me."" That's not something a hero would say. If Peter had never learned the lesson of ""great power and great responsibility,"" there's every chance he would have become a supervillain. And then you have Otto Octavius, a bespectacled scientist who, after his radioactive accident, became the eight-legged Doctor Octopus. For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection. So what if we flipped it? What if we gave him a second chance? Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path. But is that enough? Can that overcome Ock's true nature? CNN: How did this idea originate? Stephen Wacker: This was an idea Dan had when he came onto the book. It changed shape as we went. It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change. With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang. CNN: Did the word spread around Marvel quickly when this was first discussed? Wacker: Three times a year we have editorial retreats, where we bring in our writers and discuss every single book. Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal. There were certainly some loud opinions in the room. Our editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso, was one of the louder voices not buying it originally. All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently. CNN: Was that a sneak preview of how fans might react? Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me. Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online. It gets more magnified with Spidey. You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever. I keep all the fan mail. You can see some of the same people who have written about six things over the past six years that made them drop Marvel forever. There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction. That's a part of the job I like. Slott: I've actually gotten a fair amount of ""This is awesome!"" (reactions to the story), but it's been very polarizing. No one has a middling review. No one has a take of, ""It was all right."" People are very split. I got an angry tweet saying, ""I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people."" I'm like, good luck reading Charles Dickens, Mark Twain -- anything in literature! Now people are saying, ""Nooooo! Why are you being mean to (Peter)?"" The answer is two words: ""Dra. Ma."" CNN: Have you learned anything in dealing with the reaction to this particular issue on social media? Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world! Everyone knows who Spider-Man is-- and everyone cares about him! In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace. But in our world, he's beloved. Now we're going to flip that too. The readers are Jonah. They aren't ready to cut this guy a break. They think he's a menace! This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all! And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!","""Amazing Spider-Man"" #700 is latest comic book to court controversy .

"(CNN) -- Tomas Berdych finished the China Open final in Beijing Sunday with a broad smile on his face. It is not the reaction one would expect from a top-10 player thrashed 6-0 6-2, but his opponent was world number one Novak Djokovic, and the Serb had been in unstoppable form. Czech star Berdych was 6-0 5-0 down and facing the humiliation of the ""double bagel"" before staging a brief rally to break back and at least get two games on the board. So his demeanor at the handshake was one of pure relief, despite hardly troubling the scoreboard in a one hour six minute match. Djokovic broke Berdych's giant serve at will from the start and was never seriously troubled as he hit 19 winners in the one-sided contest. The loser acknowledged that he had been playing against someone in very special form. ""I just said to my coach now that I probably played over 700 matches in my career, and I met guys like Andre (Agassi) , Roge (Federer), all those probably in their best times. But I have never, ever experienced anything like that,"" he told the ATP Tour website. Form had dictated that Djokovic would emerge the winner, he has entered the ATP 500 event in the Chinese capital on five occasions and each time he has won the title. A straight sets semifinal win over Britain's Andy Murray had also shown him at his best, but Berdych had also dispatched Martin Klizan, the quarterfinal conqueror of world number two Rafael Nadal. Djokovic will now head to Shanghai for a Masters 1000 tournament, which he has won for the past two years. The WTA event in Beijing was claimed by Russia's Maria Sharapova, who beat Petra Kvitova in a tight three-set final. Sharapova will leapfrog Kvitova to go to number two in the rankings with a 6-4 2-6 6-3 win over the Czech. It was her first title since claiming the French Open and her fourth of the year. Kvitova saved a match point in a marathon eighth game in the third set, but Sharapova closed it out in the next game, her sixth victory over her opponent in eight career clashes. In Sunday's other ATP Tour final, there was a popular home triumph for Kei Nishikori in the Japan Open. He beat Canada's big-hitting Milos Raonic, the same player he beat for the 2012 Tokyo title, 7-6 4-6 6-4 at the Ariake Colosseum. Nishikori, who beat Djovovic in the semifinals of the U.S. Open before losing to Marin Cilic, has risen to number five in the race to qualify for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London.","Novak Djokovic thrashes Tomas Berdych 6-0 6-2 in China Open final .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The villagers' faces light up as Evans Wadongo arrives. Men, women and children sing and gather around as he shows how his invention -- a solar-powered LED lantern -- will soon light up their homes. ""These families, they are so poor. They don't have electricity,"" said Wadongo, a native of rural Kenya. ""It's only kerosene and firewood that they use for lighting, cooking. ""The amount of money that every household uses to buy kerosene every day -- if they can just save that money, they can be able to buy food."" Wadongo, 23, not only is giving his country's rural families a way to replace the smoky kerosene and firelight with solar power, he says he also hopes his invention will ultimately improve education and reduce poverty and hunger. And he's providing it for free. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . The youngest of four children, Wadongo grew up in a home that stressed the importance of education -- his father was a high school teacher. But years of exposure to smoke while studying by kerosene and firelight left Wadongo with eyesight problems. With a lack of good light to study by -- Wadongo often had to share one lantern with his siblings and other family members -- he remembers the frustration of unfinished homework and poor exam performance. ""I couldn't compete effectively with other kids who had access to lighting,"" he said. ""In every home in the village it was the same. Many children drop out of school for these reasons ... so they remain poor for the rest of their life. All along I was asking myself if there is anything that can be done to improve this situation."" In 2004, while attending a Kenyan university for agriculture and technology, Wadongo found his answer. He was fiddling with a dorm experiment involving the timing of LED (light-emitting diode) Christmas lights when it struck him: The environmentally friendly light source could be used to light rural homes. ""I knew it would have to be sourced by the sun to be useful to people in rural areas,"" he said, ""but [I] had never seen a solar panel small enough for individual homes."" Then, while walking home from visiting a friend, Wadongo stumbled upon a broken-off piece of a discarded solar panel. With it, he was able to light a small number of LEDs. His project -- Use Solar, Save Lives -- was born. ""I immediately knew the impact that [it] would have on the rural communities,"" he said. An artisan helped him design the solar lantern, which Wadongo calls MwangaBora -- Swahili for ""good light."" To help get the project started, Wadongo's family and friends subsidized his student loans for two years. Production of the lanterns was slow until Wadongo attended a leadership training program sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Development for All-Kenya. When the group heard about his MwangaBora, it immediately committed to help, eventually bringing Wadongo on as a partner and chairman of the board. The group has helped reduce production costs to $20 per lantern. Costs are covered by donations. Volunteers help build the lanterns and work with local government and women's groups to determine the communities most in need. The group sets a small percentage of the cost of each lamp to go toward the volunteers. ""We're helping them to earn a living. They're able now to sustain their families,"" he said. Wadongo works on the lantern project full time without pay and eats only one meal a day to help save money and build more lanterns. He said he expects costs to decrease further as the program grows. The group buys excess pieces of solar paneling, cut from commercially sold panels, in bulk from an overseas company. In an outdoor metal shop, Wadongo and volunteers hammer scrap metal for the frame of the lantern. Wadongo estimates he's distributed 10,000 lanterns -- and he has no plans for slowing down. ""I want to reach out to as many rural communities as possible,"" he said. ""The impact is saving lives."" Children can now study. Households can buy food with the money they save on kerosene, reducing hunger in communities. The solar lanterns help reduce carbon emissions, too. Wadongo said that when the time and need arises, he intends to service, replace and recycle his lanterns. For villager Julia Dzame and her three children, life will change dramatically thanks to Wadongo and his solar lantern. ""I am so grateful for the lights,"" she said. ""My children will have light to read, and I'll have my own light to cook in the kitchen. No more sickness brought [on] by smoke."" For Wadongo, the satisfaction comes in knowing that he's helping to lift people out of poverty. ""I just feel like it's right,"" he said. Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony, the Florida woman who was tried and acquitted in the death of her young daughter, broke her silence Tuesday to CNN's Piers Morgan, saying she was rightly found not guilty. ""Obviously I didn't kill my daughter,"" Anthony said, Morgan reported on ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The two spoke for roughly 10 minutes by phone. ""If anything, there's nothing in this world l've ever been more proud of, and there's no one I loved more than my daughter. She's my greatest accomplishment,"" she said. Anthony, 26, was acquitted last summer of murder charges in the 2008 death of Caylee, 2, but was convicted of four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child's disappearance. She was given credit for time already spent behind bars, however, and was released from jail July 17. Watch: Anthony's lawyer opens up to Dr. Drew . Anthony has remained in seclusion since then, although a judge ruled she must serve a year of probation stemming from her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges.

Investigators searched for the child for five months, eventually finding Caylee's skeletal remains in woods less than a mile from her grandparents' Orlando home. Prosecutors alleged Casey Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. They alleged that she put the child's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. Defamation lawsuit can go ahead, judge rules . Casey Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered. They said the child drowned in the Anthonys' above-ground pool on July 16, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in testimony. Though Anthony's trial made national headlines, she has since dropped largely out of sight. She surfaced in January when a ""video diary,"" apparently recorded in October, found its way onto YouTube. In that video, Anthony talks to the computer about a dog she adopted. She wore dark-rimmed glasses and her naturally brunette hair was colored blond. Rob Lowe cast in Casey Anthony movie .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Promising to return America to the ""moral high ground"" in the war on terrorism, President Obama issued three executive orders Thursday to demonstrate a clean break from the Bush administration, including one requiring that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed within a year. President Obama signs the order requiring that the Guantanamo Bay facility be closed within a year. During a signing ceremony at the White House, Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have ""to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals."" The president said he was issuing the order to close the facility in order to ""restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war, even in dealing with terrorism."" A second executive order formally bans torture by requiring that the Army field manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations. That essentially ends the Bush administration's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods. ""We believe that the Army field manual reflects the best judgment of our military, that we can abide by a rule that says we don't torture, but that we can still effectively obtain the intelligence that we need,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama sign the orders » . ""This is me following through ... on an understanding that dates back to our founding fathers, that we are willing to observe core standards of conduct not just when it's easy but also when it's hard.""  Watch Obama vow that the ""U.S. will not torture"" » . A third executive order establishes an interagency task force to lead a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases. The task force, Obama stated, will also ""provide me with information in terms of how we are able to deal [with] the disposition of some of the detainees that may be currently in Guantanamo that we cannot transfer to other countries, who could pose a serious danger to the United States."" The president also signed a memorandum requesting a delay in the Supreme Court's hearing of the case of Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a legal U.S. resident contesting his detention for more than five years as an enemy combatant. He has been held in a military brig without the government bringing any charges against him. Al-Marri's case is scheduled to be heard by the high court in March or April. Al-Marri ""is clearly a dangerous individual,"" Obama said. ""We have asked for a delay in going before the Supreme Court to properly review the evidence against him."" During the second Bush term, the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged the Bush administration with torturing terrorist suspects. President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.  Watch experts debate the Guantanamo dilemma » . The decision to close the detention facility received immediate backing from Obama's general election opponent, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. McCain, in a joint statement with South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he supported Obama's decision to ""reaffirm America's adherence to the Geneva Conventions, and begin a process that will, we hope, lead to the resolution of all cases of Guantanamo detainees."" Thursday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" McCain said he thinks the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable. Specifically, McCain said he thought Obama needed to consider what would happen to the prisoners held at Guantanamo before ordering the facility to be closed. ""So, the easy part, in all due respect, is to say we're going to close Guantanamo,"" McCain said. ""Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken. Because you're going to run into a NIMBY [not in my backyard] problem here in the United States of America."" A number of congressional Republicans criticized Obama's decision. ""We cannot risk going back to the politically correct national security policies that left us vulnerable in the lead-up to 9/11,"" Michigan GOP Rep. Peter Hoekstra, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a written statement. ""Without a clear plan for the detention and interrogation of captured terrorists and combatants, we are unnecessarily risking the safety of our nation."" Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, an outspoken critic of the Bush administration, praised the action, calling it ""a first key step in restoring America's image and credibility in the world."" ""The Bush administration never understood what the Guantanamo detention facility symbolized to the rest of the world,"" Murtha said in a written statement. ""They saw it as simply a prison. ... The problem with Guantanamo was never about its bricks and mortar. The problem with Guantanamo is that its very existence stains and defies the moral fiber of our great nation."" Obama's move highlights a fierce struggle over where the prison's detainees will go next. iReport.com: Closing Guantanamo is a ""risk"" Asked about that issue Thursday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ""We have developed some options in terms of how many we think could be returned to other countries to take them. That diplomatic initiative has not started. That will await work in carrying out the executive order."" ""We have identified a number of possible prisons here in the United States"" that could take the detainees. However, Gates added, ""I've heard from members of Congress [representing] where all those prisons are located. Their enthusiasm is limited.""  Watch what may happen to Guantanamo's inmates » . Rep. Bill Young, R-Florida, said he has ""quite a bit of anxiety"" about the possibility of transferring detainees to U.S. facilities. ""Number one, they're dangerous,"" Young said. ""Secondly, once they become present in the United States, what is their legal status? What is their constitutional status? I worry about that, because I don't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have. They're our enemy.""

"(CNN) -- I can't remember exactly when I began reading Ebony. I've been flipping -- now scrolling -- its pages as long as I can remember. Like family, it's just always been there and helped form my perspective. That's why it was so troubling for me when a senior editor of the esteemed magazine, Jamilah Lemieux, recently went on a Twitter tirade against black Republicans, failing to uphold the standards that I'd come to expect from Ebony. ""I care about NOTHING you have to say,"" she wrote while disparaging conservatives and Republicans in general. This was not the Ebony I'd grown up with, I thought, the Ebony I'd worked with, that encouraged political discourse and diversity of opinion. To my relief, the next day, Ebony issued an apology for its editor's actions after receiving a letter from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. ""EBONY strongly believes in the marketplace of ideas,"" the editors wrote in their response. And we all should. Any good publication allows for diversity of thought. Any good journalist should be able to listen to all sides of an issue. She should not resort to the virtual equivalent of putting her fingers in her ears. As a conservative black woman, I understand I'm in the minority of a minority. But I challenge all of those who disagree with me to listen to what my party has to say. Are your opinions based on hasty assumptions? Or were they formed after reasoned debate? We don't have to agree on every issue. We shouldn't. But we can't claim to be informed citizens if we refuse even to hear another perspective. And it's never been more important for us to be informed than at a time when our political clout as black Americans, especially black women, is growing. In last year's gubernatorial race in Virginia, where I live, black women turned out to vote at a rate higher than other demographic groups, according to exit polls, just as we did in the past two presidential elections. It's in our interest to understand the full spectrum of political ideas. Most black Americans only need to ask a parent or grandparent to hear stories of when the opinions, views and voices of blacks were silenced, not because of what they said but because of who we are. Some of us have experienced that bigotry firsthand. How can any one of us, then, be so quick to refuse to listen to others? If you take the time to listen, you might be surprised at what you hear. Ask a Republican about education policy, and you might learn that she is fighting to ensure school choice is the right of parents to choose the school that's right for their kids, regardless of their ZIP code. Yes, Republicans agree with the majority of black parents. If a black female entrepreneur asked a conservative about economic policy, she might learn that Republicans at every level of government are fighting to streamline regulations so that she can grow her business faster, hire more workers and keep more of what she earns. Yes, Republicans are fighting for her, too. If the young black millennial who's looking for work asked a Republican congressman what he'd done for him lately, he'd hear about the 40 jobs bills that the Republican-led House of Representatives has passed but the Democrat-run Senate has refused to consider. Yes, you might be surprised. In the course of my career, I've worked as a journalist and held editorial management positions at a number of media outlets. Objectivity and balanced coverage were demanded; personal views could not and did not interfere with a reporter's duty to tell the full story. That's because journalism and political discourse must make room for a diversity of opinions. The ""marketplace of ideas"" can sort out what's right, wrong, persuasive and not. And it won't be the same for every person. But for me and many others, conservative policy solutions offer more financial freedom, greater religious freedom and more economic opportunities. And if you can't understand why, well, that's all the more reason why we need to engage in meaningful political discussion.

"(CNN) -- Acura found itself in a bit of hot water this week when it was revealed that a casting agency in Los Angeles only desired light-skinned African-American actors for the company's Super Bowl commercial featuring Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. The company apologized, but that hasn't stopped a lot of the chatter criticizing Acura for not doing more to keep the casting agency in check. This really isn't a new story considering how many times in the past we've heard similar stories, including that advertising agencies have non-urban dictates like refusing to buy advertising space on black-focused radio, TV, magazine and online properties. Worldwide, nearly $500 million is spent on bleaching products, an effort for people with darker skin to lighten their skin. This is pretty laughable considering the lengths some whites go to darken their skin through tanning beds or even spray painting a bronze look in order to appear darker. (I'm still trying to figure out the skin tone of Speaker of the House John Boehner.) But there is another critical discussion that must be had, and that is the belief that the lighter skinned you are, the better your life will be. The effects of this mindset are examined in the documentary ""Dark Girls,"" produced by actor/director Bill Duke and directed by Chan Berry. ""Dark Girls"" explores the pain that is associated with having dark skin, even re-creating the white doll-black doll studies made famous by Dr. Kenneth Clark, which played a crucial role in the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. Facilitator: Show me the smart child. [A Black child's hand points to the fairest-skinned depiction among a spectrum of drawings of a little girl, identical, save for the skin color). Facilitator: And why is she the smart child? Child: 'Cause she is white. Facilitator: OK. Show me the dumb child. [The little girl, who is brown-skinned, points to the drawing of the child with the darkest skin). Facilitator: And why is she the dumb child? Child: Because she black. Facilitator: Well, show me the ugly child. [Again, the little girl points to the darkest drawing). Facilitator: And why is she the ugly child? Child: 'Cause she black. Facilitator: Show me the good-looking child. [The little girl points to the fairest drawing.] . Facilitator: And why is she the good-looking child? Child: 'Cause she light-skinned-ed. I talked to Duke and Berry on my TV One show, Washington Watch, and both said the results of the documentary were stunning when considering how pervasive skin color plays a role in the minds of kids, even at an early age. ""Unfortunately, I think we've accepted values that set standards of beauty that are not us,"" Duke said. ""And as a result of that, as you saw the small child, unfortunately, at a very, very, very young age, whatever they look like is not beautiful enough. And so they try to be something other, and we sell them products to do that, and I think whoever's selling that ad thinks in the same way."" In the documentary, one woman fighting back tears tells the story of a friend who recently had a baby: ""It was my first time seeing the baby, and the baby was beautiful. And she said, ""Girl, I'm so glad she didn't come out dark!"" In addition to the Acura controversy, there have been complaints that on album covers and magazine ads, the skin of Beyonce, who is already light-skinned, is made even lighter to make her appear white. Even when it comes to dating, some black men have the view, ""Light is bright; she's alright."" ""In our film, we have a young man saying he does not think a dark-skinned girl looks right on his arm. He says that in the camera,"" Duke said. ""He says long hair, fair skin - he feels better with that person on his arm."" Berry says it's vital that we have real discussions about this issue. ""I want to continue what has happened six months ago when we dropped the trailer on everybody -- to know that -- to recognize that there is an issue with us, and then start the healing process,"" he said. ""If you recognize that you have an issue, and then open up about it and start talking about it, that's when the healing begins. ""So with our film -- we're not psychiatrists, or psychologists, or sociologists, Roland. We're just filmmakers who decided to point a lens at this particular subject, this issue, to say, 'Listen. This is how we can fix this, possibly. Just open up and talk about it,' because, as Bill says, you're not going to find anything outside of yourself to heal this. It's going to come from within."" While ""Dark Girls"" (www.officialdarkgirlsmovie.com) makes its way across the country, Duke and Berry are working on their next documentary, which will deal with light-skinned black women. Even that is a serious issue; even to the degree that some blacks still pass for white in the 21st century. Just last year, my Aunt Rita died in Louisiana. She lived most of her adult life as a white woman, even though she was black. Her daughter, who is married to a white man and passes for white even though she knows she's black -- but her kids don't know -- waited two months to tell my grandmother that her only surviving sister had died. Why? Because she was afraid of her black relatives showing up and exposing their secret. How's that for a post-racial America?","Acura criticized after agency sought light-skinned African-Americans for its Super Bowl ad .

"(CNN) -- Thandi Zulu was single, pregnant and staying at a women's shelter in Houston, Texas, when she received a mysterious letter one day. Single mom Thandi Zulu says she was duped by a work-at-home scam. A company told Zulu that she could make big money working at home in a data-entry job. No résumé or experience was needed. All she had to do was pay a $200 fee. You probably know what happened next. Zulu called the company, gave them her checking account number and then tried to stop herself because she realized that she was doing something stupid. ""The moment I did it, I said 'Damn, this is a scam,' "" Zulu said of her 2001 nightmare. ""I put them on hold, and then I tried to call them back, but nobody was home."" Financial guru Bernard Madoff is grabbing headlines because he is accused of swindling wealthy clients out of $50 billion in a massive Ponzi scheme. But work-at-home scammers are also plundering the paltry savings of ordinary people like Zulu every day. Work-at-home-scams are on the rise, consumer watchdog groups say. Scammers are busier than ever because tough economic times are making people more desperate to make money, says Christine Durst, CEO of Staffcentrix, a company specializing in home-based careers that sifts through home-based job leads every day. iReport.com: Do you have a business at home? Tell us . Durst says people are searching more for home-based jobs to save money on gas, clothing and child care. Seniors are also looking to supplement their dwindling retirement income. Durst says Staffcentrix researchers screen about 5,000 home jobs leads every week, and there is a ""54-to-1 scam ratio."" ""This means that for every 55 [work-at-home] leads we investigate, only one passes our legitimacy standards,"" she said. Work-at-home scammers have traditionally used letters, television commercials and magazine advertisements. But the Internet is becoming their favorite hunting ground, says Karen Hobbs, an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission, the federal agency responsible for consumer protection. ""The Internet is a boon for this industry, because it's a very cheap method for reaching consumers across the U.S. and the world,"" Hobbs said. Catching work-at-home scammers is difficult because they use online facades and fake identities, and they constantly change names and mailing addresses, Hobbs says. Those who are caught, though, can face serious time. One work-at-home scammer was sentenced to 22 months in federal prison last year and ordered to pay $293,619 in restitution, Hobbs says. But many scammers often act as if they're too clever to get caught, Durst says. ""We have over the years engaged in e-mails with them, and frankly, they're quite cocky,"" Durst said. ""It's a craft for them. They really pride themselves on understanding the human psyche."" Be wary of ""palm trees, beaches and bikinis"" A consumer's best defense against these clever predators is to develop their own guile, Durst says. First, they should learn how to spot the warning signs of a work-at-home scammer. Any advertisement that contains the phrase ""work at home"" is immediately suspect, because working at home is not a job title, Durst says. Scammers use that phrase to bait their victims. Other warning signs: You're required to pay a fee for additional information, promises of ""unbelievable pay!"" and claims that no experience is necessary or résumé is needed. Durst also says to watch out for ""palm trees, mansions, beaches and bikinis."" ""If the ad you're looking at features palm trees, a mansion and a Ferrari, it's probably a scam. Successful scammers often bag their prey by dangling enticing things in front of them, much like kidnappers do: 'If you get into my car, I'll give you this candy bar,' "" Durst said. There are other rules people should follow as well: Never forward any money to an ""employer,"" never give personal information like a Social Security or bank account number over the Internet and never agree to cash checks for a percentage under any circumstances, consumer watchdog experts say. Those who think they've been scammed can still get help. They can contact the FTC (http://www.ftc.gov/), the Better Business Bureau or the attorney general's office in their state. Why do people still fall for them? Despite the publicity generated by work-at-home scammers, why do so many people still fall for the scams? Some consumer watchdog groups say it's too simplistic to say that people are gullible. For example, many of the people who say they lost money in Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme were celebrity actors, writers, wealthy people -- people with abundant smarts.  See some of the celebrities » . Hobbs, from the FTC, says work-at-home scams appeal to that can-do spirit in Americans. ""Americans have an entrepreneurial sprit,"" she said. ""Many people will want to work independently, and they're looking for those opportunities, especially in hard times."" Durst, the CEO of Staffcentrix, cites another reason. ""It's desperation,"" she said. ""It's the same reason people play the lottery: They think today could be their lucky day."" Zulu, the single mom, subscribes to Durst's theory. ""I didn't pay attention,"" she said. ""When you're desperate and you're looking for something, you just go ahead. I was pregnant, and I didn't have a job. I wanted to work at home."" Zulu says she finally found a legitimate job. She moved to Laurel, Mississippi, and now sells medical and dental plans through a company called Ameriplan USA. She even calls people and tells them that they can sell Ameriplan from their own homes. But sometimes she runs into an unexpected problem. ""They don't believe me,"" she said. ""People think we're scammers.""","Single mom Thandi Zulu says she lost $200 in a work-at-home scam .

"(CNN) -- Nathan Jones was 18 when he had his first seizure. He lost consciousness, fell off his porch and woke up to hear a paramedic yelling at him to name the president of the United States. Over the next four years, Jones had 10 or 11 more generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. He had seizures in his dorm room, while driving, in class and on a trip to New York. Jones, 29, has epilepsy, and feels so strongly about educating people about the complex brain disorder and the seizures that stem from it that he became the project coordinator for the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Los Angeles. When he heard that U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson had a seizure while driving in Southern California, Jones was empathetic. ""It seems that some people have been so quick to judge him. It just goes to show you that there are so many misconceptions,"" Jones said of Bryson, who is under investigation after allegedly causing two car accidents last week. ""It's such a dramatic and stressful period as it is. I can only imagine what he is going through. This is all happening in the spotlight. If he would have had a heart attack, the public would have just thrown sympathy his way."" It is unclear what caused Bryson's seizure, which officials said was his first. The Commerce Secretary has resigned, telling President Obama he's doing so for health reasons, according to a statement obtained by CNN. Some doctors and those living with seizures said the Bryson incident is an opportunity to dispel myths about seizures and explain just how common they are. Bryson is not the first high-ranking public official to have a seizure: Five years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts had a seizure that caused him to fall while at his summer home. Roberts also had a seizure in 1993. Up to 10% of the world's population will have at least one seizure, the World Health Organization says, and having one seizure does not signal epilepsy. Withdrawal of certain medications, antibiotics, alcohol withdrawal and extremely low blood sugar can all cause seizures, experts say. Epilepsy, a neurological condition, is usually diagnosed after someone has had at least two seizures that were not caused by a medical condition, according to the Epilepsy Therapy Project. Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder in the United States after migraine, stroke and Alzheimer's disease, and yet it is widely misunderstood, according to the Institute of Medicine. In fact, one in 26 people in the United States will develop epilepsy at some point in their lifetime. Seizures occur when the electrical system of the brain malfunctions. The brain cells keep firing instead of discharging electrical energy in a controlled manner. The result can be a surge of energy through the brain, causing unconsciousness and muscle contractions. Some seizures, however, are barely noticed. ""You can have your first seizure at any point,"" said Dr. Joseph Sirven, who worked on an Institute of Medicine report called ""Epilepsy Across the Spectrum: Promoting Health and Understanding"" released in March. ""It's actually very common to present with seizure at an older age. Oftentimes, you will look for potential cerebrovascular implications,"" such as stroke, hemorrhages or a tumor, said Sirven, who is chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona, chairman of the Epilepsy Foundation's Professional Advisory Board and editor-in-chief of Epilepsy.com. ""If you remember, Ted Kennedy had presented with a seizure and that led to the diagnosis of a brain tumor. It's not that uncommon. But not all seizures are brain tumors."" Dr. Christianne Heck, medical director of the University of Southern California Comprehensive Epilepsy Program in Los Angeles, calls epilepsy a ""hidden disorder."" ""Epilepsy doesn't have a poster child like muscular dystrophy. We just don't have anybody who is willing to talk about it,"" said Heck, who also worked on the Institute of Medicine report. ""I think it's important for people to understand you can be OK. You can function at a very high level. Most of the time, 70% of the cases are easily controlled, easily managed."" Yet a large number of people go about their daily lives hiding the fact that they have seizures because they are concerned such disclosures would negatively affect their lives, she said. ""Lots of things contribute to that stigma and that embarrassment,"" Heck said. ""It's a disorder of the brain, and the public doesn't understand it in terms of what it looks like and what it is and what they need to do to keep someone from having a seizure safe."" The fact that seizures can happen any time and in public makes it difficult for some people with epilepsy, she added. Kevin Oliver, 46, of Los Angeles knows that problem all too well. ""I know that's one of the main fears for people that have epilepsy -- telling other people. You always have that fear of that person's reaction. We have a wall up sometimes,"" he said. ""I think it's a fear we don't want to be judged in a certain way. We're trying to protect ourselves."" But the aerospace technician said it's important for anyone with a seizure disorder to be honest about his or her medical condition. Everyone at work knows he has epilepsy, he said. ""They are very protective of me. I do feel it's something you need to express. You shouldn't keep it hidden. You do want people to know."" Still, it isn't always easy, Oliver said. ""You feel embarrassed when you are coming out of it,"" he said. ""There are so many people standing around looking at you. They are looking at you out of concern, but that's not your first reaction."" When Oliver heard about Bryson, he said he was immediately relieved no one was hurt. ""I have had one before when I was driving,"" Oliver said. ""I know the fear behind that. When you come out of it, you don't know what happened. You are just hoping you didn't injure anyone."" Frank Chavez, 63, a retired parole agent in California, had his first seizure in 1999 while driving his daughter's car. He was later told that he got off the freeway, hit a black van and just kept going. ""I lived about two blocks away and instinctively I just drove that car right home,"" he said. ""I started walking up the driveway."" He was putting the key in the door when he heard a man screaming. The man was yelling that Chavez should have stopped after the accident. Chavez has frequent and serious seizures, is on medication and has even undergone surgeries to try to stop them. ""This is a disease that jumps out of nowhere,"" said Chavez's wife, Patricia. ""We used to call it the monster. We never knew when it would jump out."" When her husband's seizures begin, Patricia Chavez first asks God to let him live. Then she looks at the clock to time the seizure and tries to turn her husband on his side to help him breathe. She tries to stay calm and talk to her husband. At some point, Frank Chavez understands his wife is talking to him. ""I'll hear my wife and she'll tell me, 'Frank, Frank,' "" he said. ""I do hear her. I just can't do the things she wants me to do."" The lack of control is something you have to deal with, said people living with seizures. ""You become 200% vulnerable to your surroundings and to (other people's) knowledge of what is happening to you,"" said Jones of the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Los Angeles. ""If I have a seizure in public and I'm next to a bunch of broken glass, are they going to be able to react? Are they going to forgive me when I can't react and listen to them? It's part of the education process. Your brain has just suffered this huge electrical brainstorm."" Heck said anyone living with epilepsy that is not well-controlled should seek out neurologists who are highly trained in managing epilepsy. She and others urge people to seek out information about seizures and epilepsy. ""The biggest misconception is that it is a disease of the young and that it is something you are only going to see in a younger kid or a younger adult,"" Sirven said. ""This is actually a condition that affects all age groups, and older adults seem to have a higher propensity for this. This is not uncommon."" Soo Ihm, 41, was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 6 or 7. She said she gets frustrated that more people with epilepsy don't speak out. People who haven't had seizures need to understand there is nothing to be afraid of, she said. ""People don't understand the full spectrum of seizures and also the idea of a seizure,"" Ihm said. ""It looks so different and people don't know what to do when you are having one. Epilepsy has such a range of experiences. Seizures can last from a second to several minutes. You can be fully aware, you can lose total consciousness or anywhere in between.

"(CNN) -- The final two teams left standing at Euro 2012 should come as no surprise, and nor should another painful exit for perennial underachievers England. A heart-breaking defeat on penalties in their quarterfinal was preceded by 120 minutes which saw the style of finalists Italy overwhelm English pragmatism and conquer their heart-on-sleeve spirit. So why does England continue to employ this bulldog style? And why can't the country who gave birth to the game reinvent itself like the all-conquering Spain team, who will be gunning for a third consecutive major title against Italy in Kiev on Sunday, or the dynamic Germans, young pretenders who fell at the semifinal stage? The answer, according to two respected authors, is history, and how the nation's deep-rooted view of masculinity has molded its soccer style. Until that changes, this relentless cycle of disappointment will continue. David Winner, who wrote ""Brilliant Orange,"" a study of how Dutch culture and psyche contributed to the influence their football visionaries have had on the game, argues England's approach to football has not changed for over half a century. ""The English were very true to their strengths and weaknesses at Euro 2012,"" Winner told CNN. ""They've been losing in that way for 60 years. ""Every time it comes as surprise when English heart, commitment and valor and all these old Victorian values come unstuck against much more skilful opponents.""

The breeding ground for this English style of football has its roots in the boisterous games of the medieval period, Winner argues, and the intrinsic love for ""testosterone festivals"" like rugby, which was invented around the same time as soccer. For him, the attritional modus operandi showcased by England during Sunday's morale-sapping defeat to a far more fluent Italy side shows the national game is still weighed down by this regressive approach. ""The game is profoundly rooted in old English stuff and we never lost that,"" he adds. ""We love the battlers like (former England players) Terry Butcher, Stuart Pearce and Tony Adams."" ""The idea the game is all about skill and you express your manliness not by fighting but by your skill in being able to do very delicate things -- that affronts something deep in the English male psyche and I don't see any change to it."" Winner's view is shared by Simon Kuper, journalist and co-author of ""Soccernomics,"" a book about football's truths, who subscribes to the view that England's methodology was spawned from a notion that the soldier was society's greatest role model. This then infiltrated the nation's best-loved game, reinforcing the idea of a ""warrior"" culture, when grit and determination were valued over technical skill. The stats from Euro 2012 back this theory up, with England blocking more shots on goal and putting in more tackles than any other nation upon their exit. ""In northern Europe, in general, we tend to value discipline and sticking to your task highly,"" said Kuper. ""The collective discipline is important and England and Germany are examples of that. We live in countries where that is valued. You don't lose yourself in personal creativity, you do your job. ""The model for the British man is the soldier, maybe even still is. The tabloids talk about our players as soldiers, so the values that are very highly praised in English football are bravery, passion, obedience, hard work and you don't tend to hear that much talk about creativity and inspiration, which are not soldierly virtues."" But it isn't all gloom and doom for England. Hope can be extracted from two titans of Europe, Spain and Germany, both of whom radically revamped their approach to the game in the last 15 years. For decades, Spain were one of soccer's greatest underachievers, entrenched in a style that emerged from what General Franco termed ""La Furia EspaÃ±ola,"" or the Spanish fury. Like England, Spain's values were immersed in hard work and fight. Time and time again Spain promised much but failed to deliver on the biggest stage. It was not until after the turn of the century their traditional tactics were abandoned, and a new style executed by a generation of emerging players started to yield unprecedented results. Winner insists the revolution was brought about by Spanish giants Barcelona, and their modern interpretation on the Netherlands teams of the 1970s, led by Johan Cruyff, who were said to play ""total football."" During his stint as manager of Barcelona, Cruyff's doctrine permeated the club, and he played a key role in the establishment of its ""La Masia"" youth academy that has produced so many gifted players that now make up the backbone for the national team. ""Look at how the Spanish used to play and the way they play now,"" Winner explains. ""There's almost no point of contact between the two styles."" Reinventing the wheel: How Guardiola revolutionized football . Germany have also undergone a relatively recent transformation, shedding their traditional, battling, hardworking approach after poor returns at the 1998 World Cup in France and the European Championships two years later. Their past triumphs in both competitions -- Germany can boast three titles in each tournament -- were conducted in a manner far removed from the way the current side operate, with skilful and exciting players like Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller at their forefront. German football expert Raphael Honigstein told CNN an insistence on better technical development for young players, instigated in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a result of an under-performing national side, are now starting to pay dividends. ""Those changes are apparent now -- this is the first generation to benefit,"" he said. ""If you have those technical players at your disposal then that will affect they way you play. ""There was a realization that the Bundesliga's power and success saw an increase in foreigners and that young German players weren't coming through. One of the reasons they identified was the coaching wasn't up to scratch anymore. ""They invested lots of money into coaching and youth development and they produced better players. As a result better all-round players were being produced. They gave someone like coach Joachim Low many more options."" Germany knock Greece out of Euros . England's quarterfinal defeat has prompted a familiar round of introspection as journalists, pundits, players and managers put forward their blueprint for a bright new future. Yet the national team's malaise is at odds with the global success enjoyed by its domestic competition. The English Premier League is regularly described as the best, most exciting league in the world, borne out by the record amounts of money broadcasters pay to televise it. The next slab of TV rights in the UK was recently sold for Â£3 billion. But would the Premier League punters welcome a move away from traditional values, which often provide open and frenetic matches, if it meant England were able to re-establish themselves as an international force? ""People would like England to be a winning team but they aren't willing to go through the changes to make it possible,"" Winner added. ""If English clubs team were good enough to play the way Spain do -- get a one goal lead and close it out by keeping the ball -- no club crowd would tolerate that for more than 20 minutes. They'd scream 'Get it upfield.' ""We'd find that boring and the crowds would stay away, and they'd also find it unmanly."" There are changes afoot though. The English Football Association told CNN its new National Football Center, which will act as a development hub for young players and coaches, is due to be handed over next week. Prior to England's humiliating 4-1 defeat to Germany in the second round of the 2010 World Cup, the FA embarked on a process to develop a new philosophy for how the national game should be played, and it has subsequently made changes to the way youngsters are coached. Andy Hilton, a development officer at the coalface of grassroots football in Manchester, says coaching methods and the attitude of parents who would perpetuate the ""win at all costs mentality"" are also starting to change. He and his colleagues are trying to mesh the traditional English ""warrior"" style with the more cultured flavor of Spain and Germany, in order to produce players who are comfortable in any type of match situation. ""With the older age groups of 15 and over, the English 'warrior' is still the dominant football force. Players love street football moves to beat and humiliate an opponent but the game is high tempo, high octane power and speed with an edge of violence,"" Hilton said. ""Conversely with the younger players many coaches are concentrating on manipulating the ball, being comfortable with it, and not being afraid to dribble or pass it when the situation dictates. ""I suppose the question is how do we keep the tiki-taka with young adulthood from childhood? Testosterone, body changes and finding their niche in society forces players to conform to the warrior or look lesser in others' eyes."" Both Winner and Kuper agree that England needs a new model, and beginning with a detailed look at how Spain and Germany transformed their fortunes would be a productive starting point. In the meantime, until any of these changes take hold, perhaps the best thing for English fans to do is lower expectations and prepare for an immediate future laden with modest returns. ""The future is only bleak in terms of winning tournaments -- England are not going to do that,"" said Winner. ""But they'll bring the nation some pleasure and get out of their group most years. They qualify for tournaments almost always. ""We have to change our expectations as a nation, stop having this post-imperial sense that we are entitled to win because we invented the game, and be a bit realistic.""","Perennial underachievers England last won a major international tournament in 1966 .

"(CNN) -- Manliness, metaphorically embodied these days by facial hair, grilling meat and building domestic ""man caves,"" is now carving its own space online. Look around. The line of what is and isn't masculine is blurring, whether it is through manscaping, as shown in Morgan Spurlock's new documentary ""Mansome"" or barbecue chefs such as Elizabeth Karmel expertly wielding tongs. This trend may be rightly celebrated for breaking gender stereotypes. But as the ""mantuary"" for hanging with the bros gets invaded by scented candles, some entrepreneurs are fighting back with new websites that cater to stereotypically manly interests such as cars, sports, tech toys and bachelor living. They have names such as Dudepins, Manteresting, PunchPin, Gentlemint and Dartitup, and they claim to target the male demographic not just in content but also in utilization. They've all launched in the past six months, and their inspiration appears to be the skyrocketing popularity of Pinterest, a virtual pinboard where users post, or ""pin,"" images of their favorite things. Unlike Pinterest, however, these sites have fewer photos of wedding dresses and more pics of beards, babes, guns, Harleys and bottles of whiskey. Pinterest has more than 20 million users, and a survey last spring found they spend more time there per month than users of any other social network except Tumblr and Facebook. Considering those numbers, and that Pinterest has been valued at $1.5 billion, and it's no surprise that similar websites such as Pinspire, Clipix and Stylepin have popped up. But Pinterest and its copycat sites are largely populated by women. A February survey by Visual.ly found that women comprise 83% of Pinterest users. A quick browse through its most popular pins and its About section (""People use pinboards to plan their weddings, decorate their homes and organize their favorite recipes"") seems to reinforce this gender imbalance. CNN Tech: Pete Cashmore on why Pinterest is 2012's hottest website . Brandon Harris, co-founder of Dartitup, said that when he first played around with his fiancee's Pinterest account, he appreciated the concept. ""I loved what it did and I loved the features, but I didn't like the content,"" he said. ""The content is not geared towards a guy. I am not interested in cupcakes or puppies. But I am interested in cars and gadgets."" CNN Tech: Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions . Not that there aren't any men pinning. But Ricardo Poupada, co-founder of AskMen, said that when his online men's magazine started using Pinterest, they noticed that there wasn't a strong male presence. ""There's still that perception that it is a female-centric site,"" he said. 'Manly' alternatives . Enter sites such as Manteresting. ""We were thinking of mimicking the [Pinterest] business concept but catering to the male demographic,"" said Brandon Patchin, who co-founded Manteresting with Jesse Michelsen. ""Jesse and I, we are intentional in our naming of our website. We needed to be divisive."" While Manteresting has managed to rack up more than 2 million page views since it started in February, the plan is not to declare war against Pinterest, Patchin said. So what makes up a manly image bookmarking website? Let's start with the look. Manteresting's layout swaps Pinterest's cursive red title on a cream background with a black, block-letter title and the tag ""Interesting.Man.Things"" on a dark steel background. Dartitup goes for a dark navy blue with white lettering, and Gentlemint opts for an elegant black-and-white theme with a moustachioed logo. Then there's the testosterone-laden choice of words. Instead of ""Pin It,"" users on these websites can ""Nail It"" (Manteresting), ""Dart It"" (Dartitup) and ""Save to Your Mint"" (Gentlemint). Dudepins' slogans are ""Dudes like sharing stuff"" and ""Man Up. Sign Up. Pin Up."" The founders of Manteresting, Dartitup and Gentlemint were all quick to say that they don't emphasize photos of women in bikinis or tolerate offensive content. Their most popular image subjects range from food to technology to sports to memes to bachelor pads, they said. Embracing stereotypes? Glen Stansberry, co-founder of Gentlemint -- ""a mint of manly things"" -- said he felt no pressure to set a certain bar for manliness. ""How do we know what's manly? We really don't,"" he said. ""There is no editorial guideline, so people interpret it their own way."" Each site embraces ""manliness"" in a different way. Dartitup prides itself as ""a guy's night out"" and pairs you up with similar users during registration. It also has a ""Challenges"" section where users are asked to dart images in response to a challenge like finding ""something Chuck Norris cannot defeat."" Manteresting gives you the option to ""bump"" or ""shame"" an image to the ""Top Voted"" or ""Wall of Shame"" sections of the site. Gentlemint has ""Collections"" that allow users to group images in whatever form they like as opposed to categorizing them. AskMen's Poupada believes men share content differently than women and are more likely to share that which is representative of stereotypical male interests. ""It's more about what your stuff says about you,"" he said. ""The sharing is very much in line with what society dictates to us. If a guy talks about calorie counting, he will be ostracized."" Poupada warns that the content on these niche websites could perpetuate stereotypes about what men are interested in. He's not alone. Gawker's Adrian Chen also mocked the idea of ""Pinterest for men"" in a recent article and suggested men are threatened by the female-dominated website. ""Why do we need these sad virtual man caves?"" he wrote. ""Get over yourselves, dudes. Maybe you'll even learn a little about closet organizing."" Manteresting's Patchin says his team has been accused of being ""homophobic or misogynistic or sexist."" But he points out that Manteresting has no restrictions against women joining, and that his site's 45,000 images of bacon doughnuts, basement game rooms and movie posters offer proof that there is a market for such content. Harris of Dartitup says his site has received invite requests from women and that they are more than welcome to join. ""But we said from the start, this is a service that guys will like,"" he said. More men on Pinterest . This raises a question: Would it be so terrible if Pinterest remains dominated by women and female-oriented content? Mary Elizabeth Williams, a staff writer at Salon.com, wrote in a recent article that Pinterest's gender gap reveals how ""conservative ideas about gender find themselves reproduced online."" But she believes that may not be such a bad thing. ""Within a seemingly tame array of cute animals and wedding ideas, nearly 20 years into Web culture, we have nevertheless somehow managed to create something formidable -- at long last, the Net's first true woman-centric blockbuster,"" she wrote. Last week, Alexandra Lange wrote on The New Yorker's culture blog that she fears Pinterest's founders might ""push the flowers off screen"" because ""women's interests are coming on 'a little strong' for an Important Social-Media Platform,"" she said. She later added, ""We should be long past women's clubs, but if Pinterest remains one, let it be the men's loss."" The scales of gender balance might already be leveling. A recent Mashable slide show featured men with hundreds of thousands of followers on Pinterest. And according to Visual.ly, a data visualization community, 56% of Pinterest users in the UK are men. Poupada predicts that Pinterest is in a pre-evolutionary stage, just as ""Facebook was once considered for college students."" The bookmarking site may attract a more balanced group of users once it tweaks its branding, he says. ""There will always be places to be gender-specific,"" he said. ""There will always be the [male] equivalent of Pinterest. But the beauty of the Web is you can never stop anyone else from joining. The medium doesn't allow it."" What do you think? Do you find Pinterest too ""girly"" or do you think it is fine the way it is? Should Pinterest become more gender neutral? Would you use these manly alternatives? Let us know in the comments.","One recent survey found that 83% of Pinterest users are women .

"(CNN) -- Is this the quintessential TMI Facebook post? Rep. Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor known for having an extramarital affair while his staff claimed he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, wrote in a 2,300-word Facebook post Friday that he and his Argentine fiancée have broken up. The congressman says the strains between him and his ex-wife have complicated his relationship with his three children, as well as his relationship with fiancée Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford and Chapur got engaged in August 2012, a few years after he publicly admitted that he had been cheating on his wife. The Sanfords divorced after the scandal, and the then-governor finished his time in office, leaving the governorship in January 2011. The Republican, who was once considered a potential presidential contender, mounted a political comeback and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013. In the Facebook post, Sanford says he's being summoned to court on Monday as part of what he described as ""yet another lawsuit"" by his ex-wife.

"BLOOMINGTON, Illinois (CNN) -- On a recent chilly Illinois morning, Dimitria Alvarez sat at her kitchen table and looked through her son Devon's baby clothes. ""He was just so happy all the time,"" Alvarez remembered later with a smile. ""He was so much calmer than my girls."" Devon Mehlberg-Alvarez died at 4 months from an overdose of an ingredient in cough syrup. Devon Mehlberg-Alvarez was Alvarez's firstborn -- and her mother's first grandchild. When he was 4 months old, Devon got a cold. Alvarez took him to the doctor. The doctor told her to give Devon an over-the-counter infant cold and cough medicine. Alvarez followed the doctor's directions and gave Devon the suggested amount. However, a few mornings later when the Bloomington, Illinois, mother checked on her son, something was wrong. ""I screamed,"" says Alvarez, ""He wasn't breathing. He was cold."" Devon was dead. Deborah Mehlberg found out her grandson was dead after returning from a weekend trip. When she pulled into her driveway, her family was standing in the front yard. Her son told her the terrible news. ""My heart fell out of my chest. I couldn't believe it,"" says Mehlberg. ""No one in my family ever died this way."" She needed answers. At first, investigators blamed SIDS for Devon's death. But Mehlberg and her family were not convinced, so they pushed for more tests. ""I'm a technical person,"" says Mehlberg. ""I know that there's a cause and effect for everything, and I knew that there was something that caused this baby to die."" A few months later, the results came back. The cause of death: Dextromethorphan intoxication. Devon's family says they were told later that Devon's body could not metabolize one of the key ingredients found in many infant cold and cough medicines. Over the past two years, 1,500 babies and toddlers have wound up in emergency rooms after having a bad reaction to cold medicines, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration will meet to discuss whether over-the-counter cold medicines are safe and effective in children age 6 and under. Earlier this year, the FDA completed a review that found between 1969 and the fall of 2006 there were 54 reported child deaths from decongestants and 69 from antihistamines. Most of the deaths occurred in children under 2. Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein headed the push that led to the FDA hearing. He became alarmed when four Baltimore children died after their parents gave them excessive doses of cold medicines. ""I didn't quite realize that it could potentially be a life-and-death issue,"" says Sharfstein. In August, federal health officials recommended the ""consult your physician"" advice to parents on the labels of cold and cough medicines aimed at young children be replaced by a warning not to use the medications in children under 2 unless directed to do so by a health care provider. Last week, in advance of the hearings, some of the leading manufacturers of cold and cough medicines announced a voluntary recall of more than a dozen cold medicines for infants. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said the products were being pulled ""out of an abundance of caution."" Potential misuse of the medications, not product safety, is driving the voluntary withdrawal, the group said. In a written statement, the group's president, Linda Suydam said, ""It is important to point out that these medicines are safe and effective when used as directed, and most parents are using them appropriately."" The recall ""in no way affects our taking this issue to the advisory committee meeting,"" said Dr. Joel Schiffenbauer, deputy director for the FDA's Division of Nonprescription Clinical Evaluation, Office of Nonprescription Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""All potential actions are on the table,"" he said. Sharfstein says the industry must go further. He wants the FDA to ban the use of cold and cough medicines in children under age 6. ""There's no evidence that they actually work,"" he says. In a statement on its Web site, the American Academy of Pediatrics states ""No well-controlled scientific studies were found that support the efficacy and safety of narcotics (including codeine) or dextromethorphan as antitussives in children. Indications for their use in children have not been established."" Since Devon's death, his grandmother has been on what she calls a ""one-woman crusade."" ""I'm the nut that walks up to people in the grocery stores and asked them if they have ever heard of this."" says Mehlberg. From her home in a quiet Bloomington neighborhood, Mehlberg says she e-mailed comments to the FDA and will be watching what happens at the hearings closely. During a recent trip to Devon's grave, Mehlberg received word of the voluntary recall. ""Oh thank God,"" she said with tears in her eyes. ""I never want another family to go through what we have.""

"(EW.com) -- At the end of last season on ""The Big Bang Theory,"" Sheldon finally had to cope with not getting what he wanted in his career. That's not a problem Jim Parsons is dealing with these days. In addition to his two Emmy nominations—one for playing Sheldon Cooper, the other for Tommy Boatwright in the gut-wrenching HBO movie ""The Normal Heart""—Parsons' salary for ""Big Bang"" skyrocketed from $350,000 per episode to $1 million after a contract dispute that pushed back production on the eighth season. After a week-long delay, production began on Aug. 6. Parsons sees the whole brouhaha as a simple issue. ""I always thought everything would be worked out by the start date [July 30],"" he tells EW. ""When it wasn't, it certainly wasn't a good feeling, but there was absolutely no getting around the fact that everything had to be dealt with and finished before we could get back."" He says reports of the dispute were overblown. ""You see the word 'strike'—'They're walking out!'—but there was nothing to walk out from,"" he says with a laugh. ""That's always hard, because part of you wants to explain to people what's really going on. 'Don't worry, we're not leaving, we want to do the show.'"" As for all those zeroes? ""I came from a family in Texas who simply never spoke about money,"" he says. ""When suddenly everybody is guessing, or some even getting close, to the ballpark of what you're earning—well, that's interesting, that everyone knows what you make. It is what it is, and the job is so wonderful that those minor oddities are well worth the ride."" Looking forward to the Emmys, Parsons has different feelings about his very different nominations. ""To be nominated again for Big Bang, is at least as touching to me, if not more so now, than it was the first time,"" he says. ""Look, I'm only human and therefore there's a part of me that's waiting for people to say, 'Enough of you!'"" As for his nomination for ""Normal Heart,"" ""I would be lying if I said it didn't feel really good to know that people had seen and thought it was also good work, because again, it is such a different ball of wax from the life of Sheldon.""

"(CNN) -- A house that tracks your every movement through your car and automatically heats up before you get home. A toaster that talks to your refrigerator and announces when breakfast is ready through your TV. A toothbrush that tattles on kids by sending a text message to their parents. Exciting or frightening, these connected devices of the futuristic ""smart"" home may be familiar to fans of science fiction. Now the tech industry is making them a reality. Mundane physical objects all around us are connecting to networks, communicating with mobile devices and each other to create what's being called an ""Internet of Things,"" or IoT. Smart homes are just one segment -- cars, clothing, factories and anything else you can imagine will eventually be ""smart"" as well. But there's a catch: So far, most Internet of Things products have been a messy tangle of different wireless protocols and brands. Many can communicate with their own apps and ecosystems but haven't found a way to play nice with each other. The Nest thermostat, which can adapt to your energy-consumption habits, is just one example. These standalone devices and ecosystems are running their own proprietary software and speaking different languages. Your smart toaster is humming along in French, for example, while your fridge is babbling about dairy expiration dates in Japanese. Now chipmaker Qualcomm is trying to give the industry a major push with an open-source project that can link all these disparate pieces. Qualcomm is hoping its platform, called AllJoyn, could act as a sort of universal translator for the industry. Over the past four years, Qualcomm has been working on its AllJoyn protocol to connect devices from different manufacturers, even if they have different communication standards. It wants to be the de facto language your fridge, lightbulbs and garage door all use to communicate. ""The only way that vision can be realized is if we turn this into a true panindustrial effort with companies all over the world,"" said Liat Ben-Zur, Qualcomm's senior director of product management. Choosing a standard . Many standards already help smart devices communicate, though none has emerged as a dominant option yet. Some companies, such as SmartThings, Lowes and Revolv, depend on a physical hub to link devices. Experts say this market will struggle to really take off until someone can convince the major players it's in their best interest to work with other brands. ""We could see a few large ecosystems emerge for (the Internet of Things), such as we have today with Android, iOS and Windows. But consumers like to have choices and will demand that closed systems learn to communicate with each other,"" explained Karen Bartleson, president of the IEEE Standards Association. If there are too many different ecosystems, people will find a way to connect them -- much like how the problem of multiple phone chargers is being solved by micro-USB, she said. ""Because (the Internet of Things) is so vast and varied, it will be hard to come up with a 'one size fits all' standard,"" said Bartleson. ""Instead of a single, dominant communication standard for IoT, there will likely be several that serve different purposes."" A company with as much industry clout as Qualcomm might have luck bridging some of the gaps. It's a smart business move: The wireless technology giant makes many of the chips found in smartphones and tablets. It also sells the chips that will go inside smart thermostats, security systems, cars and everything else. But the connected-things revolution will only work if all the companies and products find a way to break out of their silos and work together, according to Ben-Zur. ""Oftentimes we kind of think about the evolution of the Internet in two revolutions. The first revolution was the connected Internet,"" she said. ""The second kind of revolution was when we suddenly went to the mobile Internet."" Being able to access the Internet from our pockets isn't just revolutionary because it is portable. The devices collect and share information about us using built-in sensors, such as accelerometers and GPS. The Internet becomes a two-way street where we share context about our location, environment and habits so it can serve up customized information. A third revolution . Ben-Zur predicts the Internet of Things will be the third revolution. Sensors will show up in more and more devices and turn them into sponges that soak up data about our habits, environment, movements and health. A smart smoke detector, for example, might also gather information about the pollen count in a house. A home security system's motion detectors can track a family's movements and location over time, sharing information with a central heating or cooling system to customize each room's temperature. But it's still to early to say for sure how all these devices will chat with each other and whether Qualcomm's AllJoyn or some other option will take off. The exact killer apps for the Internet of Things are also a mystery. We won't really know how the technology will change our lives until we get it into the hands of creative developers. ""The guys who had been running mobile for 20 years had no idea that some developer was going to take the touchscreen and microphone and some graphical resources and turn a phone into a flute,"" Ben-Zur said. The same may be true when developers start experimenting with apps for connected home appliances. ""Exposing that, how your toothbrush and your water heater and your thermostat ... are going to interact with you, with your school, that's what's next,"" said Ben-Zur.","With the Internet of Things, regular appliances and objects could evolve into tech products .
Sensors will appear in cars, homes, toasters, clothing and more .
One company is trying to connect all of those devices with a common language .

"(CNN) -- When I was young, I thought my country was the best on the planet. I grew up singing a song called ""Nothing to Envy."" I felt very proud. I thought my life in North Korea was normal, even though when I was 7 years old, I saw my first public execution. My family was not poor, and I had never experienced hunger. But after my mother read me a letter from a coworker's sister who said that her family was dying of hunger, I realized that something was very wrong in my country. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid to late 1990s, and I began to see suffering, hunger and death around me. Watch Hyeonseo Lee's TED Talk . I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can say that during the dark years of the famine when I was a young girl, I went alone to China to live with distant relatives. I thought I would be separated from my family for a short time. I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years for my family to live together again. TED.com: Escaping the Khmer Rouge . Since North Korean refugees are considered illegal migrants in China, I lived in constant fear that my identity would be revealed and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea. One day, my worst nightmare came true when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation. Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions. I thought my life was over, but I managed to control all the emotions inside of me and answered their questions. They let me go. It was a miracle! TED.com: The voices of China's workers . After 10 years of hiding my identity and living in fear in China, I decided to risk going to South Korea. Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan and started studying for the university entrance exam. Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call -- the North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent my family through a broker, and as punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. They had to get out of North Korea quickly. So I started planning how to help them escape. I took a flight back to China and headed toward the North Korean border. Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia. The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times. North Korea's propaganda machine grips defector 11 years on . One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. He took everyone's ID cards and started asking questions. Since my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought we were going to be arrested. As the police officer approached my family, I quickly stood up and told him that these were deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily, he believed me. We made it all the way to the border of Laos, but I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border guards. Even after we got past the border, my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. TED.com: How to combat modern slavery . After I paid the bribe and fine, my family was released after one month. Soon after, they were arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos. This was one of the lowest points in my life -- my mind and body felt completely drained, and I felt like a failure. I did everything to help my family get to freedom -- and we came so close. And now my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. I went back and forth between the police station and immigration office, desperately trying to get my family out ... but I didn't have enough money to pay the bribes. I lost all hope. At that moment, I heard a man's voice asking me: ""What's wrong?"" I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. He would only give me his first name. With my broken English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without hesitating, the man went to the ATM and paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. I thanked him with all my heart, and then I asked him, ""Why are you helping me?"" ... ""I'm not helping you,"" he said. ""I'm helping the North Korean people."" I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and other North Koreans when we needed it the most. He showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope that the North Korean people need. Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea.

"(CNN) -- The cruise-line industry is a rough business. Every time a passenger ship leaves port with a guest cabin unoccupied, that's money the cruise operators are never going to see. Last week Micky Arison, the longtime chief executive of Carnival Corp., announced that he will be stepping down; revenues at the world's largest cruise-ship line have been falling. Arison will remain as chairman of the firm, but a new CEO will step in. Cruise companies have always had to contend with uncertainties in the economy, which sometimes make travelers cautious about planning leisure trips, and Carnival has faced widespread unpleasant publicity in recent years. The Costa Concordia, owned by a subsidiary of the corporation, ran aground and partially sank off the coast of Italy in 2012, killing 32 people. This year the Carnival Triumph lost power in the Gulf of Mexico after a fire in the engine room, creating distressing conditions onboard for its more than 3,000 passengers. The very nature of the cruise business -- the relentless competition between various lines, the need to fill those staterooms, a fickle public with a multiplicity of options for how and where to vacation -- might cause sleepless nights for executives, but for certain people, it provides a dream scenario: . A seldom-considered way to live the ultimate beach-bum fantasy, 21st-century style. It's not for everyone. You need to, at least temporarily, have unlimited time on your hands, and you need to have saved, or come upon, some money that you won't one day regret using up this way. And a desire, at least once during your time on Earth, to live your life as if it's a Jimmy Buffett song. A few years back, I was on a cruise ship after a week at sea with the Surf City Allstars, the band with whom I occasionally travel and sing. Most of the passengers, on that final morning, were harried and tense about gathering up all their baggage and making the jarring reentry to the mundane real world. The fun was over. But in a lounge area of the ship, one man sat near us as he waited for his debarkation group to be called. He seemed as serene and calmly blissful as if he was just getting ready to start a cruise, not end one. That's because he was. The way he explained it to us, he had parted company with the corporation that employed him; we got the impression that this was not voluntary on his part. He had been given some severance. So, he told us, he had figured out a way, for a relatively small amount of money, to live, for a while, like a king. Like a sultan at sea. He was now, he said, residing virtually full-time on cruise ships -- eating gourmet meals, lounging in the sun, listening to music and going to stage shows at night, sleeping in freshly made-up beds with the oceans of the world lulling him to sleep. How could he do this? Each week, he explained, he'd get on his computer and do searches for cheap, last-minute cruise deals. There are websites that specialize in exactly that. He was counting on the need of all those cruise lines to fill every cabin -- he was counting on their willingness to do just about anything to get rid of their inventory (the unoccupied rooms) as their ships were about to sail. He said that, by waiting until the last minute, and by not particularly caring where the ship with the best bargain was heading, he was able to find astonishing rates. The ship upon which we were talking had been sailing the Caribbean for a week. I believe he told us that the seven-day cruise, with all meals included, had cost him, as the clock ticked down and the rock-bottom price popped up, a little more than $300. There is no way, on dry land, that you can eat a week of extravagant multi-course dinners in fine restaurants for $300 -- much less get living quarters, entertainment, recreation and all your other meals, too. That winter, he said, he'd made the decision to base himself in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area, near the massive Port Everglades seaport. Occasionally he would have to pay for a night or two in a budget hotel before the next ship left, but his goal was to get off one ship, wait a few hours, and get right back on another. And, while at sea, get on the internet and search for the next bargain. For many people, a cruise is a once-in-a-lifetime treat. He had figured out how to make it his everyday world. Now. . .there are tradeoffs. You don't get to plan in advance and choose exactly where you want to go. But if you do it every week, do you really care if, on a particular week, one of the ports of call is St. Lucia instead of St. Thomas? The Dominican Republic instead of Costa Rica? It doesn't matter -- for you, it's all travel roulette. The downside -- and it's a huge one -- is that you are cast adrift in many ways. Eventually, when your money runs out, you are going to have to think about rejoining the world of ambition and ladder-climbing, and trying to make up for lost time. You have to be the kind of person who can be content with the thought that you are accomplishing and accruing absolutely nothing while other people, back on land, are applying for jobs and working for promotions that will bring them financial security. You have to be comfortable in the company of complete strangers, who materialize and then disappear week-by-week. You can't be a person with a family who is expecting you at the dinner table back home. And, although you don't have to be trust-fund wealthy, you have to somehow have $400 or $500 a week on hand, for weeks on end. But the opportunity, for a particular kind of person, is there. The modern-day combination of a vast cruise industry, and an internet that makes finding 11th-hour bargains effortless, means that you can, for as long as you are able to get away with it, indulge yourself in an endless summer, letting rootlessness be a virtue. Probably very few people reading these words will find themselves in a position, or a frame of mind, to do it, but maybe, the next time the cubicle culture begins to feel too confining, just the thought of it will bring a smile. On gray days, it has for me. I've thought, from time to time, of that guy on the ship, and wondered how long he was able to make it last. Or whether it became a case of too much ice cream -- if he ended up deciding that the long meal of life was not meant to be an infinite succession of desserts. And whether a fellow like Micky Arison, the head of Carnival, with all of the job's challenges and headaches, ever daydreams of being that guy instead.

"(Health.com) -- Get excited: You can burn calories and combat fat by eating yummy food. ""If you choose the right picks, studies show you can torch up to 300 extra calories a day,"" says Dr. Pamela Peeke, author of ""The Hunger Fix."" Whole, unrefined foods are your heroes. Your metabolism has to work harder to break them down than processed ones, so you're zapping more calories — and storing less as fat. These recipes double up (even triple up) on foods with serious metabolism-boosting power. Take that, dastardly fat! Salmon . What a catch! Research suggests the omega-3s in salmon and other fatty fish help build muscle — and the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. Omega-3s may also help reduce fat storage by lowering cortisol levels (scientists have yet to confirm how). Go for: Two 3-oz servings of fatty fish per week. Health.com: New ways to boost your metabolism . Yogurt . Calcium-rich foods have slimming superpowers. Get too little of this mineral and your body's more likely to pack away calories as fat, according to a review of studies. With up to 50% more calcium per ounce than milk, yogurt is a potent source. Better yet, its probiotics may help keep belly fat under control. Go for: At least two servings a day. Avocado . For a speedy metabolism, you need to keep inflammation in check and blood vessels clear and supple. Avocado's unique combo of essential fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, and antioxidants helps you do just that. Plus, one avocado's 14 grams of fiber kicks up your calorie burn. Go for: One to two daily servings of foods high in healthy fats. Health.com: Best superfoods for weight loss . Beans . High in resistant starch and fiber, beans force your system to use extra energy (as in calories) to break them down. Research from the University of Colorado suggests that if you choose foods high in resistant starch — it's also found in whole grains and not-quite-ripe bananas — you can increase your calorie-burning power by up to 24% over the course of the day. Go for: One serving of a resistant-starch food per meal. Chili peppers . Feel the burn? It's more than mere sensation: chilies' heat signals the presence of capsaicin, a compound that, along with capsiate, can propel the body to scorch an extra 50 to 100 calories following a spicy meal. Go for: Chilies as hot as you can stand. (But watch out! The hottest ones — habanero, Scotch bonnet, and Thai or Indian peppers — are too fiery for many people.) Health.com: The best and worst foods for digestion . Green tea . This packs caffeine and antioxidants called catechins, a dynamic duo believed to stimulate your nervous system and increase fat-burning. Studies suggest that drinking green tea can help you drop pounds and trim your waist. Go for: Several cups a day (keeping in mind how caffeine affects you). Coffee . You use it to wake up — and your metabolism will, too. The caffeine in one cup of joe temporarily perks up your metabolism by as much as 15 percent. Caffeine also helps mobilize the forces that burn stored fat. Go for: One to two cups a day, especially before exercise. Health.com: Big perks: coffee's health benefits .

"(CNN) -- Donna Summer died of lung cancer, but the singer wasn't a smoker, and the cancer wasn't related to smoking, her family's representative said Friday. Summer's family issued the announcement in the wake of how ""various reports currently surfacing about the cause of Ms. Summer's death are not accurate,"" representative Brian Edward said. ""Obviously, numerous factors can be attributed to the cause of cancer in general, but any details regarding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of Ms. Summer's case remain between her family and team of doctors,"" Edwards said in a statement. Five-time Grammy winner Summer, 63, known as the ""queen of disco"" during the 1970s, died Thursday at age 63. Summer: A diva who defined the disco movement . Much like the expressive era that her music defined, Summer danced her way through the 1970s with extraordinary success, posting successive hits that electrified dance floors and prompted her coronation as America's disco queen. But her own life was marked by the highs and lows of the ballads that she energetically sang, and even at the height of her popularity, she once took steps toward suicide -- only to be stopped by the interruption of hotel maids. She overcame the negative dimensions of relentless public attention, and her legacy as a genre-leading vocalist endures decades later among music enthusiasts, even resulting in an appearance a few years ago on ""American Idol."" Summer died surrounded by her family in Florida. Overheard on CNN: This 'last dance' goes out to Donna Summer . Said her family in a statement Thursday: ""Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith. While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy."" Summer, who was born in Boston and whose father was a butcher and mother a schoolteacher, sang from the moment she learned to talk, and her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer didn't show and the pastor asked Donna to step in. Summer later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears. While she is iconic in the disco genre, her Grammy wins were also in the R&B, rock, inspirational and dance categories. ""Her talent was a true gift to the music industry,"" said Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy. At the height of her career, she and Casablanca Records created a sex symbol persona for her, and in an October 1977 cover story for Ebony, she remarked about her other nicknames: Queen of Love and Symbol of Eros. ""Well, you have to get people's attention some kind of way,"" Summer told the magazine, ""but I'm not just sex, sex, sex. I would never want to be a one-dimensional person like that. ""I can sing songs like 'Love to Love You, Baby,' but I can also sing ballads, light opera, things from musical comedies, church hymns -- all kinds of things. Plus I can write, act and think."" Listen to a playlist of Donna Summer's greatest hits . Summer added that she didn't ""want to be known for just one thing."" In a 2003 interview with CNN, she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots. Her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing, she said. Her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon. ""Yes, it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me,"" Summer said. ""I was sort of there, but not consciously there. And I didn't have anybody sort of on my side at that point, fighting for me, except for me, being in the middle. And then people would say, you know, 'Lay down here and do this.' And you know, whatever,"" Summer said. Her big break came when she was a teenager and auditioned in New York for a European version of ""Hair."" She landed a role and went to Europe. When she achieved success by her mid-20s, she wasn't able to handle it well. ""It was tough,"" Summer said. ""I think success is always a surprise, you know."" She eventually suffered depression and found herself in an abusive relationship. ""If people are in abusive relationships, I think they need to get out of them or at least get help,"" Summer said. She lived in fear during that relationship, she said. ""Thank God this person was from Europe, so they were deported. And then I was able to sort of be free, but I was afraid for years,"" she said. Her hits included ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Bad Girls"" and ""She Works Hard for the Money."" Summer rose to fame the mid-1970s, thanks to ""Love to Love You Baby."" The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans supported by heavily synthesized backing tracks, fueled the decade's disco mania and hit No. 2 in 1976. Summer followed the song with such hits as ""I Feel Love,"" ""Last Dance"" and a disco version of the Richard Harris hit ""MacArthur Park,"" which outdid Harris' version by hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It was Summer's first of four chart-toppers. But with her 1979 album ""Bad Girls,"" Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, stimulated by the success of the Bee Gees' ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. ""Bad Girls"" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls,"" as well as a Top 10 ballad, ""Dim All the Lights."" However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, ""The Wanderer,"" went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially disappointing after the success of ""Bad Girls,"" a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1. It wasn't until 1983's ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late-'70s zenith. CNN's Denise Quan and Todd Leopold contributed to this report.","Donna Summer died of lung cancer, her family says .

"(CNN) -- You know that friend who has an opinion or a joke about everything? Sure, they're entertaining, but sometimes you wish you could get them to shut up. Now on Twitter, you can. Twitter is rolling out a ""mute"" feature that will let you silence certain users in your feed. Once you've muted them, their tweets and retweets will no longer be visible in your timeline, and you won't receive their push or SMS notifications, although @ replies and mentions will still appear. ""In the same way you can turn on device notifications so you never miss a tweet from your favorite users, you can now mute users you'd like to hear from less,"" Twitter said in a blog post late Monday. The mute function will be available on Twitter's iPhone and Android apps and its website and will roll out to all Twitter users ""in the coming weeks."" Twitter says muted users will still be able to favorite, reply to and retweet your tweets, but you won't see any of that activity in your timeline. Muted users you follow can still send you a direct message. But the muted user won't know you've muzzled them, and you can unmute them at any time. In this way, the mute tool is similar to Facebook's feature that lets you hide friends' updates without unfriending them and, presumably, hurting their feelings. The change is Twitter's latest attempt to give its 200 million-plus users greater control over their interactions on the social platform. The company must hope it will be better received than its last similar update. In December, Twitter tweaked its settings that allow users to block others who harass or annoy them. The change allowed the blocked user to still see the profile and tweets of the person who blocked them and to retweet their posts. But after a furious user backlash, Twitter abruptly reversed itself. Unlike muted users, blocked users can't follow you on Twitter. Some Twitter users were questioning the need for a mute feature Tuesday, saying people should just unfollow users who annoy them. ""I find the #twittermute thing hilarious. It's just the Internet switch it off and go for a walk!"" wrote Stewart Lee, a Web officer for a foundation in the United Kingdom. Others, of course, just made jokes. ""Forget Klout, now we need a 'Muzzle' ranking showing your Follower-Mute ratio,"" said Christian Christensen, a university professor in Stockholm.

"(CNN) -- Recently, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, came under fire for reportedly proposing exceedingly weak ""open Internet rules."" If the reports are correct, the FCC will allow broadband providers like Comcast to make special deals that give some companies preferential treatment, as long as those deals are ""commercially reasonable."" In other words, rather then requiring broadband providers to treat all Internet traffic more or less equally, the FCC will permit them to create an Internet ""fast lane"" and shake down content providers like Netflix, Google and Amazon for the right to travel in it. Guess who will really end up paying for the fast lane? Yep -- you, the customers. The price will be higher than you think. Not only will you have to pay more for the services you already use, but you will also lose out on emerging services that will be crushed by the new costs. YouTube and Netflix may be able to ""pay to play."" But innovative competitors -- the next Facebook, Twitter or YouTube being dreamed up in someone's garage right now -- may not. The proposed rules aren't all bad. The FCC will also require ISPs to be more transparent about the deals they make so customers will know what they are getting. The FCC will also caution ISPs against making deals that favor their own affiliated businesses (we're looking at you, Comcast -- no special favors for your friends at NBC Universal). Unfortunately, even ""transparency"" is tougher to enforce than many might think, because so much of our connectivity depends on secret agreements between various kinds of Internet service providers. The devil is in the details. The good news is that we will have a chance to look at those details in a few weeks and tell the FCC what we think. The FCC will be voting on the new rules at its May 15 meeting. If it votes to adopt them, it must publish the proposed rules in advance and respond to public concerns about them. The problem is that most people don't know how this process works, and so they don't participate. (The Electronic Frontier Foundation is building a tool that will make that easier; visit our site next month at www.eff.org) The Internet is too important to leave to bureaucrats who seem more beholden to the ISPs than the public. We need to let the FCC know we will not tolerate rules that let ISPs pick and choose how well Internet users can connect to one another. If we really want to stop net discrimination, we need to foster a genuinely competitive market for Internet access. Right now, subscribers have few ISP options in many markets. If subscribers and customers had adequate information about their options and could vote with their feet -- i.e., switch providers -- ISPs would have strong incentives to treat all network traffic fairly. Moreover, they would also have an incentive to improve our Internet speeds. Most Americans don't realize it, but the United States is falling behind when it comes to high-speed Internet. We pay much more for much less than subscribers in other developed countries like Sweden, South Korea and Japan. Subscribers in those countries are getting Internet service that is 100 times faster than the fastest connection in the United States -- for a fraction of the average U.S. cable bill. That's appalling. We can do better, but only if we start demanding more from ISPs. Already, our lagging Internet speeds are likely to have serious consequences. ""What's at stake is whether the new jobs, new ideas, new services of the 21st century will come from the United States or they'll come from Stockholm, Seoul, Beijing, where kids are already playing in the virtual sandboxes of these very high capacity networks,"" noted Susan Crawford, a legal scholar who has served on President Obama's science and tech team. Our ISPs have no incentive to invest in building powerful, competitive, networks. Why should they? It's not like their customers are going anywhere. Fortunately, efforts are under way to address this. For example, all around the country, cities are investing in their own broadband networks, some successfully. Fostering strong alternatives in high-speed Internet access won't be easy, and community broadband alone won't be the panacea. But it's a start, and a movement the FCC should support. We'll need more experiments like these if we want the Internet to continue to be an extraordinary platform for free expression, innovation and commerce. So let's make sure the FCC hears us loud and clear: Reject ""pay to play"" and resist monopolies so that everyone benefits, not just the powerful Internet service providers.","The FCC might allow Internet service providers to charge more for a ""fast lane""

"London (CNN) -- Police in London were on Friday questioning a suspected rogue trader arrested after Swiss banking giant UBS discovered an estimated $2 billion worth of unauthorised deals. The man -- named by British media as UBS trader Kweku Adoboli -- was held on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced on Thursday, officers said. CNN has not independently confirmed his identity, but was told when calling his desk at UBS that he was not available. The bank declined to comment on the arrest. A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN. ""We have only had three or four other situations... in the billions, and that is exactly what happened,"" he said. The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said. Shares in UBS rose slightly in early trading in Europe Friday after falling around 10% the day before. Brokers tell CNN the unauthorized trade in question at UBS was likely on an exchange traded fund (ETF) -- a structured instrument based on one or more underlying assets -- that is sold as a fund but trades like a stock. The ETF in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in Swiss francs, they say. Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each. It is thought that he may accidentally have left the Swiss franc vs U.S. dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the Swiss national bank intervened to defend the franc in early September. Credit rating agency Moody's has said it is looking at UBS for a possible downgrade. Its review of UBS will focus on ""ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls"" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement. Moody's downgraded two French banks earlier this week amid questions over their exposure to debt. News of the alleged rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield. Rogue trader's impact on UBS . U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies are also present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks. The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt. European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutions' exposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is to attend a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. As to the epidosde at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, ""basic stupidity"" in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls ""fat fingers,"" which means typing the wrong number by accident. Perhaps the trader ""put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem,"" Silva said. Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job. ""Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year,"" said van Dam. ""With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you're worried about your job and you try to hide (a mistake or loss), you can see how these situations arise."" A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said. ""He must have done something that he wasn't supposed to do, obviously,"" van Dam said. UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated. But the ""unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank"" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year. Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997. Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie ""Rogue Trader,"" lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close. UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said. There is a ""much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up"" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said. He favors that alternative, he said. ""The banks are too large,"" van Dam said. ""The products are so complicated, and the management doesn't understand it."" UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych would sign a law that would allow imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko to leave the country for medical treatment if Parliament passes such a measure, he said Thursday. The comment on the president's official website confirmed a second-hand account of his position given earlier by Tymoshenko's spokeswoman, Natalia Lysova,who said the president is ready to let the jailed former prime minister to go abroad for medical treatment. In separate remarks to reporters in the eastern city of Svetlodarsk in the Donetsk region, Yanukovych added that Parliament is preparing a law to help Tymoshenko's medical situation. Once there is legislation, ""most likely, it will be a court that will take a decision about an exit procedure, about maintaining some guarantees,"" Yanukovich said. Media reports have said Tymoshenko has suffered serious back pain while in prison. Her daughter, Yevgenia, said that her mother would like ""to travel to Germany or to a place outside of Ukraine where she can be medically treated."" Yevgenia Tymoshenko said that she expects her mother's release to take place before November 20. ""It was very hard for her to make this decision (to leave). So she made this decision, and now of course we are waiting, and our European friends are waiting for the decision from the president,"" the daughter said. ""To make this decision for him is also very easy and it would have been very fast if he used his right for a pardoning decree."" Ukraine: Caught between East and West . Two years ago, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated. In 2012, after Tymoshenko was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards, she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country. Opinion: Tymoshenko could become Europe's Suu Kyi . Back in April, the European Court of Human Rights found that Tymoshenko suffered arbitrary detention in 2011, violating multiple articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. The outspoken Tymoshenko, famous for her blond braid, was a heroine of Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution. That wave of peaceful protest swept her and Viktor Yushchenko, Yanukovych's chief rival, into power, but the promise of the revolution is seen as having soon turned sour. Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko in the country's 2010 presidential contest. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: President says he would sign a law allowing Tymoshenko to leave for care .

"(CNN) -- When Maria Elza de Fatima learned the World Cup was coming to Brazil in 2014, she thought the good times were soon to return. Once the owner of a busy clothing stall, the 59-year-old Sao Paulo resident had scraped around for work since her license expired and wasn't renewed by city authorities. But now the World Cup was coming to her home town -- along with many thousands of fans, visitors and tourists -- opportunities would abound, wouldn't they? It hasn't quite turned out that way. De Fatima may be one of the lucky ones who has been able to secure an official World Cup job but what she can do and where she can work is limited. Alongside roughly 600 others, she has been given permission to sell ice packs and soft drinks outside the Sao Paulo stadium. Only official FIFA partners are allowed to hock their wares here and within the arena. De Fatima is all too aware that many others haven't been so fortunate. She recalls the days when as many 22,000 stall-owners plied their trade on Sao Paulo's streets. A mere 600 jobs (although there are also temporary roles in other areas) isn't nearly enough for them, she laments. ""This World Cup is not for the Brazilians,"" de Fatima replies when asked whether Sao Paulo has experienced the boon she expected. ""It is for the foreigners and FIFA friends."" Nationwide protests . De Fatima isn't the only disillusioned Brazilian. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of respondents felt hosting the World Cup would be a bad thing for their country. According to Marina Mattar of the Sao Paulo Popular Committee of the World Cup, an umbrella organization for disparate protest groups in the city, the tournament will bring a lot of money into Brazil, but mainly to a well-connected few. ""The World Cup is bringing benefits to Brazil but it's to the economic and political elites -- not to street vendors, not to small companies, entrepreneurs and not to workers in general,"" she said. Key to this debate are the spiraling costs of building new stadia across the country to host matches during the World Cup. Promotional literature released by the Brazilian government puts expenditure in terms of funds, loans and credit lines from the public purse for stadium projects at at $3.5 billion. But a recent audit suggests the price has escalated to $4.2 billion. ""The stadiums are not being built for ordinary people because the price of the tickets is very high and many people will not be able to go watch football any more. ""Instead, the stadiums are in a way very good for big engineering companies to make money,"" Mattar said. People have also been evicted from their homes to make way for projects relating to the World Cup and there has been the ""pacification"" of favelas, which has seen police forcibly occupy some of the poorer neighborhoods in the city, she added. Such concerns are far from exclusive to Sao Paulo. All across Brazil, street protests have raged in the last year while popular committee groups have also sprung up in Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and beyond. A multitude of grievances, not all directly related to the world Cup, have driven this discontent -- including rising transport prices, higher living costs, housing concerns and accusations of police brutality. Fairness and equality are at the heart of these concerns. While Brazil has grown rapidly since the turn of the century, creating a new middle class, inequality remains high and some fear the very poorest are being left behind. According to the CIA World Factbook, Brazil ranks 17th out of 140 countries in terms of the highest levels of income disparity. Protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament when that money could be better directed towards alleviating poverty. ""It is unacceptable to build a mega event that will provide high profits to FIFA ... while there are serious problems of social inequality in the country,"" said Jean Marcelo, an activist with the student protest group Domino Publico. ""The World Cup reaffirms an existing logic that rules the Brazilian government. It's a logic benefiting big businesses and a small elite who occupy the top of the social pyramid,"" he added. But with new roads, airports and stadiums being built, all of which have brought jobs and improvements to the country's infrastructure, there are many who say the initial outlay, however eye-watering, will be worth it in the long term. The Brazilian government estimates that 710,000 temporary and permanent jobs will be created during the tournament while fan spending alone is expected to total $13 billion. On top of that, many Brazilian cities see the exposure they will gain hosting matches as an opportunity to position themselves as attractive destinations to potential investors and tourists now and in the future. A World Cup for all? ""There has been significant investment in urban mobility projects, in airport modernization projects, in port modernization projects, telecommunications infrastructure and security infrastructure,"" Brazil's deputy sports minister Luis Fernandes told CNN. ""You have to remember that Brazil is still a developing nation... as well as providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, these investments will benefit people in terms of the services provided,"" he added. ""The fans who come to the World Cup won't be taking back with them the new urban transport solutions or airport extensions,"" Fernandes said. Paulo Esteves, general supervisor at Rio de Janeiro-based think-tank, the BRICS Policy Center, agrees with this viewpoint. ""In a way, what we are seeing are investments that otherwise do not take place,"" he said. ""The World Cup has been a kind of catalyst for this."" ""The government did not take money from health or transportation to invest in stadiums. Investments in public health and transportation will go on and on."" Esteves is quick to add, however, that this doesn't mean public grievances are without merit, and believes the World Cup has created a platform for groups and people dissatisfied with how Brazil is developing as to unite and make their voices heard. In recent weeks teachers, metro workers and bus drivers have gone on strike demanding better pay and conditions. Others have taken to the streets to campaign for better housing. Rather than highlighting the negatives of hosting a football tournament, these protests ""are really talking about the other side of economic modernization in Brazil,"" Esteves said. ""The World Cup is not a target per se but it is an opportunity to vocalize and make stronger ... claims for strengthening the process around political and social inclusion."" However, Mattar and others in protest movements maintain their opposition to the World Cup is based on principled rejection of spending decisions tied to what they regard as an elitist, closed event. Yet, with billions of dollars already spent and the tournament about to start, they are realistic about what opposition can now achieve. Still, Mattar hopes the anger felt by many Brazilians will reach the watching world and provide lessons for future hosts of big sporting events, including the next two World Cup host countries. ""We hope our legacy will be to show to people in Russia, Qatar and maybe in other places that these events and the way they are organized (make it) impossible they will bring any benefits,"" Mattar said.","The World Cup is expected to bring in billions to Brazil's economy .
Many protestors claim this money will remain in the hands of a well-connected few .
Brazilian officials say World Cup has boosted infrastructure projects and created jobs .

"(CNN) -- The Beatles invented rock music as we know it, and as pretty much everyone has known it since the mid-1960s. But because their success was so revolutionary, it's hard to remember where the music seemed to be headed before they arrived in the United States 50 years ago -- or to imagine what might have happened if they had not. There are some familiar myths: One is that by 1964 rock 'n' roll had become insipid music dominated by teen idols like Frankie Avalon and Fabian, and the other is that the Beatles introduced white American teenagers to the power of black music. In fact, the rock 'n' roll scene had become increasingly integrated through the early 1960s, to the point that in late 1963 Billboard magazine stopped publishing separate pop and R&B charts because so many of the same records were on both. The big new sound in rock 'n' roll was Motown, and James Brown was coming up strong, having broken onto the pop charts with his ""Live at the Apollo"" album. Back then, pop prophets were divided into roughly two camps: Some predicted that African-American artists would increasingly dominate the rock 'n' roll scene, providing a joyously danceable soundtrack to the broader story of a triumphant civil rights movement. Others continued to optimistically predict the demise of rock 'n' roll, pointing to all the young people who were abandoning teen dance music for more mature and intelligent styles like folk and jazz. All agreed that the teens buying rock 'n' roll singles and dancing up a storm to the Supremes were the opposite of the serious folk and jazz fans buying LPs and discussing them endlessly in college dorms. That divide seemed unbridgeable: People who loved rock 'n' roll thought of it as thrilling, fun, youth music, and expected adults to hate it, while people who appreciated adult styles considered them an antidote to the stupid noise on the radio. The few who imagined rock 'n' roll growing up thought it would take the path of jazz, getting hipper, blacker, and more melodically and harmonically complex. But most people assumed it would remain kid's music and even its most passionate acolytes would grow up to prefer other styles. No one could have dreamed that rock 'n' roll would be reshaped as a sophisticated British import, or that anyone would want to mingle the already old-fashioned sound of Chuck Berry with baroque string quartets, Indian sitars and avant-garde poetry. The Beatles were not only unimagined, but unimaginable. It took the Beatles a couple of years to evolve from peppy rockers to psychedelic culture-trippers, but they transformed Americans' image of rock 'n' roll within hours of stepping off the plane at Kennedy Airport. Previous rockers had been famously inarticulate -- in the movie ""Jailhouse Rock,"" when a group of college professors asked Elvis what he thought of Dave Brubeck, his response was to sullenly slam out of the room, sure that they were laughing at him. The Beatles, by contrast, were witty and urbane. When reporters asked them silly questions about their long hair and screaming female fans, they responded with elegant mockery. Their Liverpool accents may have struck Britons as provincial and working class, but to Americans they sounded dazzlingly sophisticated. The Beatles backed up their exotic charm with brilliant music, but at least for the first couple of years that was somewhat secondary -- witness the success of fellow invaders like Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clarke Five. They had lovely harmonies and interesting melodies, but in retrospect those early records sound no more advanced or earthshaking than what was coming out of Motown, and ""Yesterday"" sounds positively archaic next to ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag."" The change that redirected the course of American pop was this: By 1965, the year those two records appeared, the British Invasion had resegregated the charts and no one was comparing the Beatles to James Brown. They are remembered as rock 'n' rollers, he is remembered as playing soul and funk. The Brits didn't do that on purpose -- they loved contemporary African-American styles (the Beatles told 16 Magazine that Brown was their favorite singer) -- but they couldn't manage the tricky new rhythms, so they fell back on older varieties of blues and rock 'n' roll. For dancers, that made their music relatively boring, and after the first wave of Beatlemania the twisting, frugging girls abandoned them for Motown, then moved on to funk and disco. But their blues-based, guitar-driven sound and increasingly adventurous lyrics created an unexpected bridge to the folk crowd -- they inspired Dylan to go electric, he inspired them to write obscure poetry instead of poppy love lyrics, and rock became music that boys discussed seriously in dorm rooms. Every revolution has winners and losers. A generation of black musicians remembers the Beatles' arrival as an apocalypse, the moment when rock 'n' roll became white and they were banished to a lower-status ghetto labeled R&B or soul. On the other hand, millions and millions of listeners all around the world remember the Beatles as leveling the divide between high art and street pop, paving the way for 50 years of rock innovation, and making some of the most spectacular music of the 20th century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elijah Wald.","Elijah Wald: Familiar myth holds that Beatles introduced white kids to black music .
Quite the contrary, Wald says: The rock scene had already integrated .
He says Beatles created a bridge no one had imagined for youth pop and more adult styles .
By 1965, the British Invasion had resegregated the pop and R&B charts, Wald says ."

"(CNN) -- The latest celebrity Twitter feud erupted Sunday between two heavyweights of the social medium. In one corner: pop superstar Lady Gaga and her nearly 40 million followers. In the other: pop culture blogger Perez Hilton and his 6.1 million Twitter fans. Who won the war of 140 characters? It depends on whom you ask. The feud between the former friends appears to stem from several incidents: Hilton tweeted Thursday that Katy Perry's new single, ""Roar,"" is better than Gaga's latest song, ""Applause."" On Friday, Gaga, who is in the midst of a comeback following a serious tear to her right hip, cryptically referenced a text from Hilton that appeared to make light of her injury. ""Still have the text Perez sent me of me in a wheelchair with the words KARMA written across + Madonna pointing a gun at me,"" she tweeted. But Gaga went into Twitter overdrive Sunday, accusing Hilton of stalking her, after one of her followers alerted her that he was at Gaga's apartment building in New York. ""STAY AWAY FROM ME + MY FAMILY YOU ARE SICK TRYING TO RENT AN APARTMENT IN MY BUILDING TO STALK ME. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!"" she tweeted. Hilton, who lives in Los Angeles, announced last week that he is moving to New York as he raises his new son, born via a surrogate in February. He responded to Gaga's tweets with a post on his blog Sunday night, titled ""A Statement On Lady GaGa's Lies."" In the statement, he explains he was house-hunting and later learned one of the buildings he looked at was, in fact, Gaga's building. ""After a day of innocent house-hunting, I am devastated and my heart hurts that my former very good friend, a person I used to call my 'wifey' and traveled the world with, is making very public and very untrue allegations about me on Twitter,"" he wrote, adding ""it is still too painful"" to reveal what caused the end of their friendship. He said that as a result of Gaga's series of tweets Sunday, her fans have sent him death threats and posted derogatory comments about his 6-month-old son. ""If her fans want to send a message of support to Lady GaGa, they should buy her music,"" he wrote, a thinly veiled reference to Gaga's new single being declared a flop by several media outlets. And while Gaga vowed ""I've been quiet for a long time, not this time,"" Hilton appeared to be getting the last word. ""The truth will all eventually come out. It usually does!"" he wrote.","Lady Gaga accuses the blogger of stalking her after he house-hunts at her NYC building .

"(CNN) -- Activision Blizzard is set to launch a new ""Call of Duty"" game for consoles alongside an ambitious digital platform later this year, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg said on the company's earnings call Monday. Executives have expressed an especially keen excitement about the new platform features. They named ""Call of Duty"" as one of the two ""significant investments"" that Activision is making, which will include the company's largest marketing campaign, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said on the call. (The other investment is in PC developer Blizzard, which is working on ""Diablo III"" and a new massively multiplayer online game franchise unrelated to ""World of Warcraft."") ""This year's 'Call of Duty' initiatives will result in the best 'Call of Duty' experiences we have created to date,"" Kotick said. In addition to paid features integrated into the platform, ""You will see a lot of new services and capabilities that will be provided free of charge to all of our customers,"" he said. The ""Call of Duty"" online service has been in development for two years under the name Project Beachhead, Hirshberg said. The company created a separate group, also called Beachhead, to focus full attention on the project, Kotick has said previously. Activision will begin briefing reporters in San Francisco later this week about the project under nondisclosure agreements. The company plans to make a formal announcement in the next several weeks, Kotick said. Still more details are expected in June for the Electronic Entertainment Expo. That a new entry in the ""Call of Duty"" series will be released this year isn't a bombshell. Activision has introduced a new game in that franchise each year since 2005. The most recent, ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" was the top-selling game in the United States and Europe over the last three months. ""Black Ops"" still draws fervent crowds for its multiplayer features and continues to sell well. But that experience has been hampered by Sony Computer Entertainment's shutdown of the PlayStation Network, with the online gaming service approaching three weeks of downtime this week. Activision intends to release a download package for ""Black Ops"" in the next three months. ""Hopefully the situation will be resolved by then,"" Hirshberg said. Cliff Bleszinski, the design director for Epic Games, which makes another popular shooting franchise called ""Gears of War,"" said he has doubts about ""Call of Duty's"" viability. ""'Call of Duty' is doing well right now, but if I was one of the owners of that property, I'd be concerned about potential fatigue,"" he said in a recent interview. This year's new installment may be called ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" and debut in November, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times. ""The game has exceeded every internal milestone,"" Hirshberg said on Monday's call.","Activision Blizzard plans to release a new ""Call of Duty"" game this year .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt, the anchor of Jamaican sprinting success for the past six years, led his 4x100m relay team to a new world record and in the process picked up his third gold for the second successive Olympic games. He pulled away from Team USA anchor Ryan Bailey about half way through the final leg to cross the line in a time of 36.84 seconds, beating the previous record of 37.04 seconds. The Jamaican team seemed to show no concern that regular anchor Asafa Powell was missing through injury, as they eased up through the gears and ensured some perfect baton changes to keep in their destiny in their own hands. The crowd cheered not only a perfect end to Jamaica's campaign but also a great end to all the action within the Olympic stadium. And Bolt was celebrating with them, doing the 'Mo-Bot' -- copying the celebration of British athlete Mo Farah, who completed a Olympic double earlier in the day winning the men's 5,000m as well as the 10,000m earlier in the week -- as he followed his 100m and 200m golds with a relay victory. Bolt has now won seven out of eight of the major athletics competitions, only missing out on a World Championship 100m title in South Korea due to a false start. The United States claimed silver in a national record of 37.04sec, which matched the previous world record. Meanwhile, Canada's team of Jared Connaughton, Gavin Smellie, Oluseyi Smith and Justyn Warner crossed the line in third, but were disqualified after Connaughton ran outside his lane on the third leg.

"(CNN) -- Cast your eye across a line-up of world leaders and it might look a little something like this: Man in dark suit, man in dark suit, man in dark suit, Angela Merkel in fire engine red two-piece. Or it could be mint green. Maybe electric blue. It doesn't really matter which part of the rainbow the German Chancellor chooses to swathe herself in, her multi-colored power suits have become as much a part of political fashion mythology as Margaret Thatcher's shoulder pads or Jacqueline Onassis' pearls. Ok, so while Merkel isn't going to be invited to the front row of the world's biggest fashion weeks -- kicking off in New York, Paris, and London this month -- anytime soon, there's no denying the powerful politician's equally imposing wardrobe. But then, how do women dress to impress in the workplace? And how has it changed over time? From the severe khaki uniforms of World War Two, to romantic princess frocks of the 1950s, and fierce power suits of the 1980s, CNN takes a look at women's work wear in the 20th century -- and the pioneering female designers behind them. Function vs fashion . ""Women have worn tight pencil skirts and high heels at various times, which isn't necessarily functional, but they might feel they have to wear them in their workplaces to be taken seriously, "" said Rebecca Arnold, professor of fashion history at London's Courtauld Institute of Art. ""I think women's work wear is more to do with being mentally comfortable, fitting in, and being seen as respectable."" Of course each workplace is different. As Arnold says: ""Someone who's a lawyer is going to dress in a very different way from someone working in a shop."" Working it . Gaze across some of the most popular workplace fashions of the last 100 years, and they often act as a mirror to much bigger social trends. ""What you see from the 1920s onwards, is this negotiating of public space -- using dress to visualize the way women are seen at work, and how they want to be seen,"" said Arnold. ""In the 1970s you had lots of debates around what women should wear to be feminist and still be taken seriously. Some really felt you should wear trousers and others thought that was wrong because it was being seen as a man."" And just because it's workplace fashion, doesn't mean it has to be fashionable. ""We've still got shirts that look like men's shirts, we've still got suits based on men's fitting,"" said Arnold. ""Workplace fashion doesn't move quite as fast as fashion itself."" By women, for women . Then there's the female designers who helped redefine women's wear in the modern age. From Coco Chanel's suit dress in the 1920s, to Diane von Furstenberg's casual wrap dress in the 1970s, some of the most pioneering pieces were created by women. Still, many of the top fashion houses are still dominated by male names -- think Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Gianni Versace. ""Perhaps in the wider culture, men have traditionally been more successful at marketing themselves and having authority over their customers,"" said Arnold. ""I think that's gradually changing -- but I don't think you're going to see more women in fashion until you see more women in all kinds of roles across the board.""

"(CNN) -- When Dr. Rachel Wellner got a text from her brother Tuesday night that his wife was in labor, she was speaking at a fancy charity event for breast cancer research. As soon as her speech was over, she raced in her evening gown to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan to watch her nephew, Lincoln Jacob Wellner, come into the world. Holding the newborn baby in the delivery room, Wellner, 36, was overwhelmed with joy, but it was tinged with sadness as she wondered when -- or whether -- she would ever have a baby of her own. An accomplished breast surgeon, Wellner has no husband in sight. Then she relaxed as she remembered what awaited her 50 blocks away: 13 eggs frozen in a bank at New York University Fertility Center. If by the time Wellner gets married the eggs in her ovaries are too old to work, she can thaw out her frozen eggs, have them fertilized with her husband's sperm and implanted into her uterus, and hope that her younger eggs will succeed where her older eggs failed. Freezing eggs for one's own future use has become a growing trend, with an estimated 5,000 women nationwide making use of the technology, according to Dr. Daniel Shapiro, medical director of the egg bank at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta. ""I'm really hoping I find Mr. Right soon, but if I don't, having those eggs in the bank is a big weight off my shoulders,"" says Wellner, who banked her eggs in June. ""It empowers women,"" adds Dr. Jamie Grifo, program director of the New York University Fertility Center. ""Patients get to be their own egg donors."" (Entertainment journalist Maria Menounos made news last week when she announced she's freezing her eggs, but it turns out she's actually doing something different -- read The Chart to find out what.) ""It's an insurance policy,"" says Wellner, director of breast services at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. ""Maybe now I'll be one of those lucky girls who has babies later in life."" ""I never thought I wouldn't have kids at this point."" Freezing your eggs may be an insurance policy, but it's an expensive one. It costs thousands of dollars (or in some cases, tens of thousands of dollars) and it doesn't always work. Plenty of things can go wrong. Wellner's 13 eggs might not survive the freezing process. They might not create viable embryos when mixed with her future husband's sperm. And, even more likely, they might not attach to her uterus when doctors implant them. That's why the American Society for Reproductive Medicine hasn't endorsed egg freezing, calling it experimental and unproven. ""Patients need to be advised there are some things we don't know,"" says Dr. Eric Widra, a spokesman for ASRM. Pamela Madsen, founder of the American Fertility Association, says a woman has to decide whether it's worth it to take the financial risk. ""If not having a baby is not an option, then I'd go to Vegas and play my cards, knowing that it's Vegas,"" she says. If you're considering preserving your eggs, here are five basic questions and answers: . 1. How much will it cost? Centers charge between $6,500 and $15,000 per cycle, according to Dr. Andrew Toledo, the CEO of Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta. RBA in Atlanta charges $7,600 per cycle, and NYU charges $12,000. Some women need more than one cycle to get enough viable eggs. 2. Will it work? Shapiro at RBA estimates that a woman who freezes her eggs between the ages of 32 and 35 will have a 40 to 50% chance of achieving a successful pregnancy. If freezing between ages 35 and 38, the rate goes down to 35%. If freezing at 39 or 40, it's 20 to 25%, and if freezing eggs over age 40, the success rate will be less than 10%. 3. Can I find out in advance if it's worth the money to freeze my eggs? A test for levels of anti-Mullerian hormone can help predict whether doctors will get enough eggs to make the procedure worthwhile. ""If the results are unfavorable, we say they're probably wasting their time and money,"" Shapiro says. 4. What's involved in freezing my eggs? The procedure involves injecting yourself with medicines for 10 days, visiting the doctorÂ¹s office five or six times. About two days later, doctors will harvest your eggs while youÂ¹re under twilight sedation. Most women feel little pain aside from a bit of cramping and breast tenderness, and go back to work the next day. 5. How do I find the best place to freeze my eggs? ""Make them show you their data,"" Toledo advises. ""How many patients have they treated? How many eggs did they get? What is the data on survivability when they're thawed?"" Wellner says even if her eggs don't work when she thaws them out, it was worth the financial risk. ""I spent all this money on my education. Twelve thousand dollars on my reproductive future is relatively inexpensive,"" she says.","An estimated 5,000 women nationwide are using egg-freezing technology .
Process costs thousands of dollars and it doesn't always work .
American Society for Reproductive Medicine hasn't endorsed egg freezing ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has properly decided to go to Congress and then the American people this week to reveal his strategy to degrade and destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS). To paraphrase former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, this is a crisis the President should not waste. How individual members of Congress respond to this call should matter and should be a 2014 election issue -- the duck and blame game stops here. Since September 11, 2001, the relationship between Congress and the president has collapsed. Following the lead of President George W. Bush, President Obama has used Article II commander-in-chief authorities, plus the quaint and seemingly ancient 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, to hijack Congress' constitutional responsibility over war and peace. As a member of Congress, I witnessed the transformation. I was there on 9/11 and a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee. But House Speaker John Boehner, The New York Times recently pointed out, is the only member of House Republican leadership who was in office on the day that changed this country. And Democrats have faced turnover, too; institutional memory of a time before the 2001 AUMF is fading fast. Speaking to Chuck Todd for ""Meet the Press"" this weekend, Obama suggested he has ""the authorization he needs"" for the mission he has in mind,- but no one is clear on what authority he's invoking. Jack Goldsmith, writing for Lawfare, suggested recently that the Obama administration might think it can restart the War Powers clock with each notification it sends to Congress. By this otherworldly interpretation, we aren't fighting a war with ISIL, we're picking a dozen sequential fights with ISIL (which calls itself the ""Islamic State""), and will continue doing so until the President decides he has achieved his objectives. With all this going on, it's no wonder that we've struggled to craft a coherent response to this depraved band of thugs. There's a reason Obama doesn't feel able to trust this hyper-partisan Congress, but this is a poor way of shaping strategy. It's also an attitude that blows the War Powers Resolution to pieces and evokes Richard Nixon's actions in Vietnam. But it doesn't have to be this way. A change can start immediately, at no cost to the President. When he speaks with congressional leaders, Obama should -- at the very least -- be explicit about what he believes his authorities to be. Can he strike Syria on his own authority? Can he keep up the air campaign in Iraq indefinitely by hitting the snooze button on the War Powers alarm every few weeks? If he believes the answer is yes, Congress deserves to know as much. But if the President believes he has these authorities, he's setting a very dangerous precedent. He does need a vote -- and he should want it, too. President Obama has an opportunity to unite Congress and the American people behind a cause on which they seem (for a change) to agree. This is not the same country that Obama addressed last year, when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons came to light. In September 2013, 55% of Americans opposed airstrikes against al-Assad even if the President were to secure congressional approval. Today, 60% of Americans, including majorities in both parties, support air and drone strikes against ISIL in Syria. If the President will explain and defend his plan for countering ISIL, he likely has a congressional and public majority ready to back it. Its outlines are clear: no American boots on the ground; strikes on ISIL wherever it is (Iraq, Syria, and beyond if necessary); sustained support for the Kurds, Syrian opposition fighters, and Iraqi troops on the front lines; and a coalition of Western and Arab nations dedicated to shepherding ISIL into its grave. This seems to be the fight that President Obama already has in mind. On Tuesday, he should ask congressional leaders for the authority to wage it. On Wednesday, he should be clear about his objectives and the costs, and he should ask the American people for their support. And on Thursday, we should hope to mark a sea change in the way the United States conducts foreign policy. We used to treat these debates with reverence. Describing the vote to authorize the use of military force in the Gulf War, venerable Sen. Robert Byrd said, ""I've cast 12,822 votes during my 39 years in Congress, but this vote is the most important vote that I shall have cast in my career."" We could use more of that spirit today -- and we'll need it when the next threat, whatever it may be, rears its head. After all, the current dysfunction is deeper than ISIL. The fact is that this crisis can be an opportunity for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Voters are paying attention. The duck and blame game on this issue isn't good politics -- and it's reckless policy.","Jane Harman: President Obama is right to go to Congress over ISIS strategy .
Since 9/11, relationship between Congress, president has collapsed, Harman says .

"(CNN) -- Before Robin Williams, there was Jonathan Winters. Winters begat Williams, if only in comedic spirit. To understand the genius of Williams, an audience must look to Winters. They were kindred clowns, and even as you read their names now, you wonder what jokes each comic would have conjured up seeing their surnames side by side, W with W. Winters was the original master of funny characters created out of the thin air of a stage, Williams once pronounced. Winters could invent them with nothing more than a stick as a prop. Winters became a deity to Williams. In fact, he was the ""Comedy Buddha,"" as the protégé put it. ""Jonathan Winters is the reason I became a comedian,"" Williams declared. Indeed, Winters' influence began in Williams' childhood, when he saw how his father belly-laughed at Winters on television. Robin Williams and the next generation of comics . A rush of insight overwhelmed the boy named Robin: The way to his stern father's heart was through imitating Winters. That's how Robin Williams the prodigy was born. ""My dad was a sweet man, but not an easy laugh,"" Williams wrote in The New York Times in an homage to Winters shortly after his death in 2013 at age 87. ""My father's laughter introduced me to the comedy of Jonathan Winters."" The father and son were watching Jack Paar on ""The Tonight Show"" when Winters appeared as a guest, wearing a pith helmet, Williams recounted in the Times. ""Who are you?"" Paar asked. ""I'm a great white hunter,"" Winters said in an effete voice. ""I hunt mainly squirrels."" ""How do you do that?"" ""I aim for their little nuts."" Williams repeated this tale often. The moment put him on the path to become one of America's funniest and most prolific artists, until this week when he apparently ended his life at age 63. The epiphany of his life came in boyhood, while in front of a television screen, he said. ""My dad and I lost it. Seeing my father laugh like that made me think, 'Who is this guy and what's he on?' "" Williams wrote in 2013. The symbiosis lasted throughout Williams' career, except Williams was a far more hyperactive comic. Pity the co-star with whom he shared a stage. There was no way to stop Williams when he was on a roll. Winters, in contrast, enjoyed a pause. He evoked an era before technology decimated our attention spans. What the two masters shared was an irrepressible mischief, delivering joke upon joke with originality and freshness that left audiences wondering, how do they do it? ""Once upon a time, I called Jonathan my mentor and he immediately corrected me and said, 'Please,' he told me, 'I prefer idol,' "" Williams said, drawing laughter from an audience gathered for the 2008 TV Land Awards. Williams presented the Pioneer Award to Winters at that event. ""Jonathan Winters is my idol, and he is a true pioneer,"" Williams added in a rare moment of seriousness. It wasn't the first time the mentor and the protégé shared a telecast. When the acolyte surpassed the master and became a bigger name in show business, he and his producers invited Winters to join Williams' successful sitcom ""Mork & Mindy"" in 1981. It could have made for an awkward moment: Winters was clearly the journeyman, in his late 50s; Williams was turning 30 that year. After all, Winters was better known to the generation of Williams' parents. Winters' namesake show aired in 1956, when Williams was 5. What would Hollywood do? In a clever move, the show employed a role reversal. Winters emerged from an egg as a middle-aged offspring of Williams' Mork and Pam Dawber's Mindy. The image of Winters as an infant born to Williams was an example of the two comics' imaginative powers. ""Jonathan's improvs on 'Mork & Mindy' were legendary,"" Williams wrote in the Times. ""People on the Paramount lot would pack the sound stage on the nights we filmed him. ... Sometimes I would join in (on his bit), but I felt like a kazoo player sitting in with Coltrane."" Winters cast a long shadow in Williams' work, comedian Gilbert Gottfried said. ""When you watch Robin Williams, you can see a lot of Jonathan Winters. Robin is the first one to admit that; he worshiped Jonathan Winters. He insisted that Jonathan be written in as a regular on 'Mork and Mindy.' They wrote him in as an overgrown child, which was perfect casting,"" Gottfried wrote for CNN in a tribute to Winters shortly after his death. Their shared backgrounds weren't all laughs, however. Both men knew darkness. Inner battles took them to the brink. Winters suffered two nervous breakdowns, in 1959 and 1961, according to the Internet Movie Database. He even voluntarily spent time in a private mental institution in his early 30s. And, like Williams, Winters also saw uneasy moments with his father, a banker who became an alcoholic after losing everything in the Great Depression, IMDB says. When in his room away from his parents, who later divorced, Winters invented characters to amuse himself. Winters was a manic depressive, or bipolar, and described to National Public Radio in 2011 how, ""I need that pain — whatever it is — to call upon it from time to time, no matter how bad it was."" Williams' descents into the abyss are well known because he openly spoke about them. He was an alcoholic who suffered relapse, costing him his second of three marriages. He abused cocaine, and made jokes about it afterward. He also suffered depression -- so hard to imagine between all the laughs -- and at the time of his death, he was being treated for a severe bout that now seems more serious than he ever allowed his audiences to know. Whatever hardships they endured, both jesters left a legacy that is unconquerable: a public court that is still laughing and a world of characters as richly pluralized as the names of Winters and Williams.

"New York (CNN) -- Backstage at the Michael Kors show, a strange air of calm hangs over the make-up area. Although security is predictably tight, there is no screaming or high drama. It's 7.30 a.m., hours before the show, and the machine is just beginning to mobilize. Liu Wen is an early arrival, quietly sitting in a chair listening to her iPod as a make-up artist begins to apply foundation. Her cup of coffee and bottle of green tea reveal that even the women dubbed ""China's first supermodel"" finds early starts challenging. But there is no trace of fatigue: Her face looks flawless with little make up, and her skin luminous. ""Today I have five shows, so we'll be running around."" she says smiling. ""Yesterday I was really happy because my agent sent me the schedule. I was so excited. I still love it because I love walking the runway."" At the age of 23, Liu has worked for most of the world's prestigious fashion houses, and recently ascended into the top tier of models who are recognizable enough to command major fees. She has also broken molds, becoming the first Asian model named as a global spokesperson for Estee Lauder. With some two million followers on a Mandarin-language version of Twitter, her ability to sell products to the prized Chinese consumer is obvious. ""When we met her in person, we were so impressed with her warmth, beauty and enthusiasm,"" says Aerin Lauder, the firm's Style and Image Director. ""It's amazing to see how consumers respond to Liu Wen -- she has so many fans, not only in China, but around the world as well."" Some of those fans gathered for an Estee Lauder event at the start of New York Fashion week, where CNN first met her. Amid the flashbulbs and relentless dance music, Wen cheerfully signed autographs and posed for photos, seemingly enjoying the spectacle. A few days later, CNN caught up with her as she shuttled between assignments in a chauffeured people carrier. She emerged fresh from a Rodarte show, wearing the kind of intense eye shadow that would stop a polar bear in its tracks. ""Yesterday I had a fitting that was very late,"" she explains. ""So I went back home at almost one o'clock. And this morning I woke up late ... my call time was seven but I woke up at 7:30. Just brushed my teeth before rush rush rush. So I didn't pick up my make up remover."" For a public figure whose image is key, Liu remains surprisingly open and accessible. She laughs frequently, is impeccably polite and even offers to help us with our camera equipment as we arrive at her agency. While the image of a five-foot-ten supermodel carrying a tripod is almost irresistible, CNN declines. At the stylish Manhattan offices of Marilyn Agency, Wen catches up with staff and removes her war paint. The agency has managed her since she arrived in New York and is focused on maintaining relations with top-end brands, while exploiting opportunities with appropriate Chinese firms. ""She has already achieved historic success as a model,"" says agency president Chris Gay. ""China's influence in the fashion world will be tremendous both from a stand point of every Western fashion brand wanting to establish their presence there, as well as Chinese brands, designers, and models having more of a global impact."" Wen was brought up in Hunan Province and began her modeling career in 2005 after entering a competition, which promised a computer as first prize. ""I was a very young girl, I think I was 18,"" she recalls. ""I just wanted to win the computer. Before I didn't really understand what modeling was because I grew up in a very small town, no fashion."" Soon, she moved to Beijing, abandoning her plans to work as a tour guide. Photo shoots followed, which led to a trip to Milan in 2008, where she was cast for her first runway show for UK fashion label Burberry. ""I didn't understand anything because I couldn't understand English. I just listened to the music and followed my feelings."" Despite the genuinely long days of fashion weeks, her drive is evident. Wen power naps in the car between appointments, but approaches each casting and show with enthusiasm. The one moment of disappointment we witnessed was in a restaurant when her agent suggested she avoided spicy chicken noodles for lunch. She greeted the news stoically and ordered regular chicken noodle soup, which she ate up. Quieter moments like these are fleeting during the whirl of the fashion weeks and soon Liu returns to the drumbeat of shows and fittings which go on all afternoon and into the evening. At Michael Kors the following day, CNN leaves her backstage, heading through the main entrance to film the show. CNN had spent days navigating the complex hierarchy of New York Fashion Week's accreditation and guest lists, often being excluded from both in this rarefied world. But this time, CNN was appraised by a headset-wearing, clipboard-wielding PR, who muttered to security: ""These guys are okay."" It was the most ringing endorsement of our lives. CNN took our place in ""The Pit,"" ahead of the deluge of other crews and watched as the room began to fill with socialites, industry movers and shakers and celebrities, like Michael Douglas. Eventually the hum of low-level gossiping died down, guests took their seats and the runway's cover was elegantly peeled away. The collection had a vague safari theme and Liu Wen appeared, transformed again, pounding down the catwalk with a steely faraway glare. In a few months, Liu will unveil her own line of clothes in collaboration with a Chinese company and her agency is expecting film offers. But she dismisses the idea of herself as an ambassador for China and any accompanying pressure. ""It has been an honor to represent my country as a model, but I don't think I've ever thought of myself as an ambassador, just someone trying to do her job as best as she can -- so there isn't that much pressure at all! If what I've done so far can inspire others in China, then of course it is a great thing.""","Liu Wen is regarded by many in the fashion world as China's first supermodel .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- On a recent trip home to India, I heard a German man on my flight remark to another passenger that he'd taken his son on a tour of a Kolkata slum. I believe the man was well-intentioned -- he wanted his child, accustomed to a comfortable existence, to get a firsthand look at how millions of poor people live. Later, I discovered that slum tours in India are often organized and can cost money. Reality Tours and Travel takes tourists on slum and sightseeing tours in Mumbai. A walking tour of Dharavi, Asia's largest slum, costs only $9. For about $135, five people get a nine-hour car tour of Dharavi, the red light district of Kamathipura, as well as other more traditional tourist areas. Reality Tours founders say the tours were set up ""primarily to show the positive side of the slums and break down negative stereotypes about its people and residents"" who occupy cramped huts in unending stretches of squalor. They say 80% of their profits go back to local communities through social service programs. That seems like a noble cause, but then I got to thinking about the idea of poverty tours in general -- how it might feel to be a slum-dweller coming face to face with a wealthy visitor gawking at me as though I were an animal in a zoo. Therein lies the debate over such tours. Kennedy Odede, the executive director of Shining Hope for Communities, a social services organization in Kenya, decried poverty tours of Nairobi's largest slum, Kibera. He wrote in The New York Times that the tours do nothing to alleviate the problem. ""Slum tourism turns poverty into entertainment, something that can be momentarily experienced and then escaped from,"" he said. ""People think they've really 'seen' something -- and then go back to their lives and leave me, my family and my community right where we were before."" I decided to see for myself. When I was in New Delhi over the winter, I signed up for a walking tour in Paharganj, a neighborhood near the train station that I had always known as seedy. I'd rushed through it once before in my life, when I had to spend a night after a train was delayed. It's not unlike the many neighborhoods in Kolkata I know so well. The smell of turmeric and green chiles mixing with that of garbage and urine. It's a hodgepodge of activity. Women cooking. Men working. Children sleeping out in the open, a swarm of flies covering their unwashed faces. A maze of snaking alleyways and dark, dank corners. And people everywhere, entire families crowded into small rooms, sleeping on one bed. These were sights and sounds familiar to me, and I always considered myself immensely lucky to have lived outside of that world -- lucky, at least, to live in relative comfort. I was curious to see how tour operators presented Indian poverty, especially to foreigners. I picked one run by a nonprofit organization that works to improve the lives of street kids. This way, my money was going toward a good cause. ""This is unlike other poverty tours,"" says Poonam Sharma, coordinator of the tours. ""When people start interacting with the children, misconceptions about street life fall away."" I am asked to meet the guide from Salaam Baalak Trust at 10 a.m. Salaam means hello and baalak means child. The tours are conducted by former street kids who were able to improve their lives through the organization. On this day, I am among a handful of people, all foreigners on the City Tour. Our guide is a young man named Iqbal, who has been living on the streets since he ran away from home at 5. ""Can you guess why a child runs away from home?"" he asks us. ""Poverty, abuse, addiction. And sometimes, they think if they come to the city, they can become a Bollywood star."" The tourists laugh. Iqbal continues and tells his own story. ""My parents used to fight,"" he says. ""My father beat me."" So he ran away to the streets of New Delhi. He spent nights terrified, alone and hungry on trains and in stations. He was beaten and abused, he says, by other street dwellers and even by the police. Most of the boys work menial jobs or steal, he tells us. They are deft pickpocketers. Girls, he says, run away because their parents cannot afford dowries to get them married, and they don't want to be a burden to their families anymore. Instead, they come to the city and sell their bodies to eat. The street kids have nowhere to keep their money. They spend whatever they earn, or it's stolen while they sleep. Iqbal used to work at a recycling center. Out of every 100 rupees ($2.25) he earned, 75 went to the gangs who provided security. After that, he worked at a chai (tea) stall and then at a dhaba (roadside eatery), where he didn't get paid but got something even better: food and shelter. Iqbal leads us from the main road into a lane. He shows us a recycling shop, like the one where he worked, where newspaper and glass bottles turn into money. We wander through the main market in Paharganj, assaulted by a panoply of goods -- handbags, sweaters, pots and pans, pirated CDs and DVDs, refurbished electronics, blankets, shoes. He takes us to one of Salaam Baalak Trust's shelters next to the bustling train station. We learn a bit of history from him. ""In 1911, Delhi became the capital of India,"" Iqbal says proudly. ""More than 400,000 people pass through this train station every day."" Upstairs from a small police station is a shelter where children can come to rest, eat and get medical attention. Boys of all ages were hanging out that day, glued to a television set. ""Normally, kids don't trust you,"" Iqbal says. ""It is quite difficult to convince them to come to a shelter."" Dr. Vijay Kumar sits behind a stark wooden table with a giant logbook in front of him. He says he treats kids for all sorts of ailments and regularly administers HIV tests. Many children fall into a life of addiction. They sniff glue or burn foil and smoke gecko tails. Next, we make our way to the Salaam Baalak Trust office in Paharganj, passing by a pottery market, where merchants, mostly women, are selling their terracotta wares. The tourists in my group are wide-eyed. They peer down alleys where you can only walk single file. They smile at people who pass us. Photography is forbidden on many parts of the tour. Nor do we stop to speak to any of the residents. We climb up several flights of stairs at the office. A wall of success stories greets the tourists. Sonia works for designer Ritu Kumar. Nitish works for the Delhi metro. And there's Iqbal, who eventually made his way to one of Salaam Baalak Trust's shelters and straightened out his life. He studied computers and dreams of becoming a software engineer. Not surprising, I think, for a kid who grew up during India's information technology boom. Iqbal is 20 now and has not seen his family since that day that he decided to run. He cannot even remember where he was from. ""Maybe UP,"" he says, referring to neighboring Uttar Pradesh state. He takes us into one of the classrooms. The younger children at Salaam Baalak Trust perform for the tourists. They sing their hearts out; their smiles are wide. They seem so innocent, like children at my neighborhood day-care center in Atlanta. But they have seen the worst of life. They can never grow up with the sweet naivety that makes childhood carefree. Caitlyn Oleykowski, a student at the University of Pittsburgh, says the City Tour is eye-opening. She came to India to see places such as the Taj Mahal, and although she encountered beggars on the street, she never would have walked through Paharganj by herself. She tells me she has not seen poverty like this before. Through her travels in India, she felt helpless, not knowing whether or how to help. University of Illinois student Ruth Tekeste says she feels inspired by the street kids. Others in the group also tell me that this is an India they might not have otherwise seen. And maybe they were wiser for it, sensitized to problems that can be unimaginable back home. How can that be bad? There's no better way to learn about a place, after all, than to experience it. Still, as the foreigners turn in their donations for Salaam Baalak Trust, I can't help but think about the day for what it was: a tour of poverty. And hasty, I think. In all of less than two hours, our look at others' lives is over. The only people I have spoken to are connected to Salaam Baalak Trust and provide a very positive outlook on things. What might Paharganj residents have told us? We all head back to where we first met Iqbal and scatter in our taxis and auto rickshaws. We escape the slums and return to comfort, leaving Iqbal and thousands of other baalaks on the streets. I think about Iqbal's parting words. He feels lucky most of the time, though sometimes, he can't shed the melancholy that blankets him. That's something that visitors cannot see on the tour.

"(CNN) -- When people complain about the nearly three-hour length of the first installment of ""The Hobbit"" film trilogy because the source book is a slim 300 pages, they're forgetting that much of the story isn't from ""The Hobbit"" itself -- but expanded from the appendices to ""The Lord of the Rings."" That extra material is what justifies the longer time on screen, and answers such questions as where does Gandalf go when he disappears? Why is the wizard helping the dwarves on their quest in the first place? What's so bad about dragons? And so, to put a stop to all those moments when you'd otherwise wonder, ""But that wasn't in the book!"" here are the five major changes from ""The Hobbit"" the book to ""The Hobbit"" the films. The Dwarves' Quest . In the book ""The Hobbit,"" a company of dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield seek help from Bilbo Baggins because they need a ""burglar."" That's the term they use, because they seek to steal a whole mess of gold, treasure and other gems such as the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug. (Or rather, steal it back, since Smaug stole it from them in the first place). In the film, the quest becomes a bit more noble, since the dwarves now phrase it as stealing back their homeland, Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. Even though this only existed in ""The Hobbit"" as a story Thorin told Bilbo to explain their quest, in ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" film we get to see what a thriving dwarf town looks like and how they lost it, even if Smaug himself is barely glimpsed yet -- a tail here, a wing there, an open eye that looks eerily like the Lidless Eye of Sauron. The Necromancer . ""He is an enemy far beyond the power of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again,"" Gandalf says in ""The Hobbit."" But when J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the novel he had not yet conceived of Sauron and the One Ring which only came 17 years later in ""The Lord of The Rings,"" so the connection between the Necromancer and Sauron was not made clear. Now that we know they're one and the same, the filmmakers are able to connect the dots for us, by bringing in glimpses of the Ringwraiths (or the graves of the nine men who are the Ringwraiths) and their Morgul blades. And while Gandalf knew that the Necromancer was a great threat, knowing Sauron is no longer sleeping is an even greater one. Dol Guldur . Gandalf found Thorin's father Thrain in Dol Guldur, which was near the river where the Ring was lost, as ""a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer,"" he says in ""The Hobbit."" When asked to explain, he says, ""Never you mind."" We get much more an explanation in the appendices, which will undoubtedly become a major scene in a later Hobbit film. As a ringbearer, he was hunted down by Sauron's emissaries, who then tortured him and took the Ring from him at Dol Guldur. When Gandalf found him, he was near death, and could barely remember his own son's name. Despite his condition he asked the wizard to give him an inheritance anyway: a map and a key to Erebor. Of course, when Dol Guldur is threatened, Sauron need only move on -- to Mordor. The Orc Azog . We also will meet another foe, Azog (played by Manu Bennett), an Orc who fights with Thorin's family and during which Thorin earns his nickname ""Oakenshield"" for the makeshift tree branch he uses in battle against him. Azog is described in the appendices as ""a great Orc with a huge iron-clad head, and yet agile and strong."" Azog, who killed Thorin's grandfather Thror, is believed to be dead in ""The Hobbit,"" but why kill off a great villain when you can have him hunting down the dwarves throughout the story? His history gives the Orcs more reason to chase down Thorin and company than the other nameless Orcs who would have been required otherwise. The White Council . In the film, Gandalf leaves the dwarves (and Bilbo) from time to time on their quest -- but where does he go? At least during one of these absences, he consults with a member of his order, Saruman the White (before he goes bad) and two elves, Galadriel and Elrond. It's never specified in the books who are the members of the White Council other than Saruman (who never actually appeared in ""The Hobbit"" proper). We do know from the appendices that the council is formed around the same time that Deagol found the Ring, only to be murdered by Smeagol. Coincidence? With the council, Gandalf discusses what kind of a danger the Necromancer really is, why they should destroy Dol Guldur, and why that's necessary for him to help the dwarves -- getting rid of the weapon of mass destruction that is Smaug is their best interest, too, since the dragon would certainly aid the enemy. And why shouldn't they be allies, when both are played by Benedict Cumberbatch?","There are some differences between ""The Hobbit"" book and the new film .
Much of the film's story is actually from the appendices to ""The Lord of the Rings""
The first movie installment of ""The Hobbit"" is almost three hours long ."
"(CNN) -- Wish you could play video games at work? How about a happy hour with free drinks every week? Or exercise breaks during the day? As much as these activities may sound like the opposite of work, companies around the world are starting to integrate them into their environments. The theory is that encouraging ""play"" at work not only boosts morale but also fosters increased creativity and teamwork, leading to better productivity and quality of work. You may have heard about the free food and Razor scooters at Google, the famed multistory slide at YouTube, or the climbing wall and yoga classes at Twitter, but it's not just tech companies that are jumping on the trend. Industries from food to marketing are giving it a shot, too. So we couldn't help but wonder: Does the idea of play at work, well, work? And do employees actually take advantage of it? Scientific data on both is limited (don't worry, the National Institute for Play is on it), but we heard from a variety of professionals who are convinced play is the way to go. ""The emphasis on fun spawns creative energy,"" explains Lauren Austin. She's creative director at marketing agency MKG in New York, where play is a priority. ""Inspiration comes from interacting with one another and the world around us."" And how does the company foster that interaction? With weekly happy hours, a snack bar, craft days, organized runs and even an in-office photo booth. ""The photo booth is always a draw, stuffing as many random people in a tight space as possible -- I think the record is seven -- and taking goofy group shots,"" said Austin. The company has also tried even wackier ideas, like a petting zoo. ""Our office is our playground,"" she said. It ""was designed to ignite imaginations and encourage employees to interact, because that is how the best ideas are born."" Business experts agree that we're living in a time when traits like imagination and creativity are of the utmost importance in business. Richard Florida calls it the ""creative age,"" and Daniel Pink has dubbed it the ""conceptual age."" ""In the same way that machines have replaced our bodies in certain kinds of jobs, software is replacing our left brains by doing sequential, logical work,"" Pink explained in a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""What's important now are the characteristics of the brain's right hemisphere: artistry, empathy, inventiveness, big-picture thinking. These skills have become first among equals in a whole range of business fields."" At Remedy Health Media, a health information and technology company just outside Washington, social media manager Stuart Perkins has another theory about why play is critical. ""I've been in fun offices like this and ones that were not as fun, and the retention rates are much higher when you have a few fun things to do around the office,"" he said, particularly among millenials. ""We have an extremely talented but fairly younger workforce who expects the office to be more than just a desk and a chair,"" Perkins said. ""My coworkers love having a chance to take mini-breaks and rest their minds before moving onto a new task."" At Remedy, those breaks could include anything from foosball or Wii tournaments to a team bike ride during the lunch hour. ""Some of our most creative business ideas come from this 'downtime,'"" he added. Of course, in a difficult economy, not all workers feel comfortable participating in the fun. ""We have a TV and lounge area. But I'd be afraid of looking unproductive and under-worked if I utilized it,"" wrote Lauren La Franca in a comment on HLNTV.com. ""The rest seem to agree too because the lounge area has been sat on once since it was implemented."" It's up to management to change that perception, says Craig McAnsh, president of Native Marketing. ""It has been a problem for many employees because they may feel that the idea 'play' is just given lip service by management,"" he said. ""Knowing it's required is the only way this works. And the only way this happens is for senior staff to lead by example. Top down. If you have a ping-pong table, but don't play, your ... employees will not play."" ""Talking about 'play' and actually playing makes all the difference,"" he added.","More companies are encouraging fun as a business strategy .
The idea is that play boosts morale, encourages creativity and fosters teamwork .

"(CNN) -- It's no easy matter becoming a world class tennis player. It's even harder when everyone (really -- everyone) is calling you the ""new Martina Hingis"". No pressure then on the 17-year-old Swiss tennis prodigy Belinda Bencic. ""Belinda is the best junior player in the world and I think that shows that she has a great potential,"" said Hingis' mother Melanie Molitor, who has been working with Bencic for over a decade. ""The number one junior player usually develops into a good senior player as well. As for Belinda it's all up to her and what she makes of it. ""She certainly has good basics, she's very versatile and therefore I think she has good chances."" But the road to greatness is paved with many pitfalls as Bencic discovers two hours into her deadlocked Family Circle semifinal clash against a faultless Jana Cepelova earlier this month. After missing a relatively easy winner, the Swiss teenager slashes her racket toward the crowd and screams into the floor, yanking her pink cap down toward her eyes. A squandered chance. And Bencic knows it. If she really wants to be the new Hingis, she'll need to keep it together. A big year . Weeks before, as Bencic sits courtside at the Chris Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Florida -- the training facility that she and her family have made their winter home -- she cuts an entirely different figure. Beaming a smile in the Florida sun, Bencic reflects on a year that started as she exploded out of tennis' youth divisions by taking the junior crowns at Wimbledon and the French Open -- before rising to become world junior No. 1. Arriving at January's Australian Open unseeded, she fought through three qualifying rounds, and broke 43-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm 10 times on the way to an impressive first-round win. Faced, next, with Chinese star Li Na -- and her first chance to shock the tennis world -- Bencic kept a steady head, insisting she ""didn't have much to lose."" After being blitzed 6-0 in a 20-minute first set in the Rod Laver arena, the then 16-year-old challenger almost seemed to be enjoying herself. She put up a gritty fight in the second -- which went to a tie-breaker -- before her defeat to the eventual champion: . ""I could go out there and play my best and the pressure was all on her. It's not easy to play a younger player,"" Bencic, who is now the youngest player in the top 100, told CNN's Open Court. ""The first set was a lesson but ... the second set I relaxed a little bit more and I gave her a fight."" Like Hingis? If Bencic wasn't born to be a tennis star, it wasn't long before she set about making herself one: . ""I started walking on the tennis court, so my first steps were on the tennis court,"" she says. ""And a few moments later, I tried to play and I had fun."" As a child, her walls were lined with posters of compatriots Roger Federer -- her mother is his biggest fan, she says, so the two watch all his matches together -- and, of course, her idol Hingis. By the time she started racking up wins in junior competitions, the comparisons with the former world No. 1 -- who won three of her five grand slam singles titles before turning 17 -- were inevitable. In addition to the inevitable -- being a hard-nosed Swiss-born star, to Ã©migrÃ© parents from the former Czechoslovakia -- from the age of four she was coached by Molitor, who imparted her with a certain familiar style. ""You can see by the hands, and you can see how she takes the ball on the rise,"" 18-time grand slam champion Chris Evert tells Open Court at her exclusive academy, referring to the similarities between Hingis and Bencic. ""And how she improvises and how she comes up with touch shots when she needs them."" Molitor concurs: ""Their technique is very similar,"" before adding the proviso: ""However, it's been 17 years and the style of tennis has changed."" Mental strength . Evert is adamanat she saw Bencic's ""X-Factor"" as soon as she arrived. ""She's very focused mentally, emotionally very composed and I just thought: 'She has it.'"" While many young players are singled out by technique -- the ability to strike a killer serve or critical backhand -- Bencic is one of the very few already applauded as a tactician. ""I think it's true I'm not the biggest power player but I am trying to think on the court and (have) a good tactic against opponents,"" said the world No. 91. Molitor also cites the relentless preparation that modern sport now demands -- and Bencic's willingness to accept the sacrifices that need to be made in the pursuit of greatness. ""I think a lot of it has to do with me and the training I put her through,"" said Molitor. ""We've put much emphasis on discipline and versatility. I think it makes a big difference that she is versatile and can rely on all these shots on the court."" Ever the perfectionist though, Molitor cautions: ""However, she still has to work a lot on her serve."" Evert and Bencic agree that behind her mature composure and mental strength lies a close-knit and supportive family. Bencic's father Ivan is now her full-time coach, while her brother fills in as hitting partner. After each match, that maturity becomes clear. From the hard-fought win against Date-Krumm, to the gutsy defeat by Na, Bencic undergoes a remarkable post-match transformation, from steely, ruthless competitor to gracious student -- thanking her opponent for a tough lesson, and vowing to put it into action in the next match. Coping with expectations . Back at the Family Circle, Bencic is forced to admit defeat. After more than two and a half hours on court, grappling an opponent with more than double the matches she has on the circuit -- who has twisted her and turned her with a ruthless display of her own -- Bencic smiles. She is the first female qualifier to reach the semifinals and the youngest finalist since (who else?) Hingis -- but will go no further. But for ""the new Hingis,"" there's no rush to match the expectations that come with the title. Just a composed desire to take it to the next level. ""My goal is to improve every day, to get as far as I can, be the best that I can, and just to look step-by-step. I don't want to set any goals -- it's extra pressure -- and I will just play.""","Belinda Bencic is the youngest women's player in the world's top 100 .

"(CNN) -- As residents of Toledo, Ohio, waited for word on when their water will be safe to drink, Mayor D. Michael Collins said Sunday morning that tests of the water supply were going to take longer than expected. He said results would likely be available Sunday afternoon but would not provide a specific timeline. As many as 400,000 people were told not to consume, cook with or even boil the tap water, after a toxin called microcystin was found in the water supply late Friday. Collins told reporters the advisories will remain in effect until at least Sunday evening. He said test results so far are ""trending in a very positive direction."" The tests are being done by the Environmental Protection Agency. Toledo's drinking water comes from Lake Erie, where a harmful algae bloom that causes microcystin has been growing, according to a city spokeswoman. Several locations around the city have been designated as distribution centers for potable water, where members of the Ohio National Guard, fire officials and other first responders are giving out safe water. About 350 Ohio National Guardsmen have been activated by the governor, according to a U.S. Defense Department official, adding that they have set up three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit sites at two high schools and a police facility. The guardsmen have also delivered ready-to-eat meals, the official said. Lining up for water . On Sunday, at least one Toledo restaurant was open, despite the water issues. The Claddagh Irish Pub brought in about 400 gallons of water from Michigan, according to Janeil Mesteller, the area director for Northwest Ohio Claddagh Irish Pubs. According to Mesteller, the 400 gallons are for cleaning and the pub now has cases of bottled water also. The pub will do whatever it takes to stay open and serve customers, she said. They're using disposable plastic plates and are ""feeding anyone who wants to be fed,"" Mesteller said. Saturday morning, a line formed outside Walt Churchill's Market & Pharmacy in Perrysburg, Ohio, before the business even opened. Toledo-area residents, desperate for clean water, bought all the bottled water inside, market co-owner Bob Carpenter said. Then, hearing that a water tank truck full of about 8,000 gallons had set up outside the store, more people descended on the oasis with empty jugs they could fill for $1 a gallon. About two-thirds of the Toledo area population is affected by the water warning. Ohio Gov. John Kasich issued a state of emergency for Fulton, Lucas and Wood counties. The potential contamination also affects four municipalities in Michigan, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported. There are no reports of anyone getting sick from the water, officials said. Harmful algal blooms . When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, algae can reproduce rapidly, forming a dense population known as a ""bloom,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Testing is crucial because NOAA says it can't determine just from images whether blooms are toxic. Ingestion of the toxin can affect the liver and cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and even acute liver failure, according to NOAA. But the Ohio state emergency management agency said it is safe for adults to shower and for everyone to wash their hands. CNN's David Shortell, Ryan Sloane, Barbara Starr, Marisa Marcellino, Donovan Long and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Test results on Toledo-area drinking water were not complete Sunday morning .

"(CNN) -- Onyx was 9 months old, black and white, part dachshund and part chihuahua. She was a family dog, one that Mandy Malone kept in part to play with her grandchildren. Until Onyx ended up in Malone's freezer. How did she get there? According to a criminal complaint filed in a Torrance County, New Mexico, court, the dog was stabbed in the heart and skinned. Parts of the animal were then buried in the backyard, while others were stashed inside a bag in a freezer. ""He had her marinating in Italian dressing in the fridge,"" Malone told CNN affiliate KOAT. ""...What could possibly go through someone's mind to do something that sick?"" Authorities characterized the man they say killed the dog as Malone's boyfriend. Salvador Martinez was released Wednesday on bond tied to the felony charge of extreme cruelty to animals, Torrance County Sheriff Heath White said. The sheriff predicted he wouldn't be free for long. ""He was already on probation for trafficking drugs and ... violated his probation, so he's likely going to be picked back up ... and sent back to a federal facility,"" White said Wednesday. Martinez's latest legal trouble began Friday, July 18, when sheriff's deputies responded to a call at an Edgewood, New Mexico, residence. They found a gray plastic bag ""containing some bones and meat (that) appeared to be a carcass of an animal,"" the complaint said. Authorities said Martinez admitted he had killed the dog, saying there was no food around and his girlfriend ""told him to go ahead"" and do it. After killing the animal, skinning it and burying parts of it in the yard, ""he said that he ... found (a) recipe for dogs online"" and found states where eating dogs is allowed, the complaint says. New Mexico is one such place; in fact, there are no laws against eating cats or dogs in most states. In some cultures, it's more widely accepted. ""But it's the manner that it was done, and the emotional stress it put on the rest of the family, that led us to arrest him and charge him with animal cruelty,"" White said. Martinez could not be reached for comment and it was unclear late Wednesday if he had an attorney. The girlfriend told the deputies that Martinez admitted killing the dog around noon of that day, explaining ""it was all right to do this in New Mexico to feed your family."" She disputed the assertion that they didn't have food in the house. Malone told KOAT that Martinez had previously told her, ""just out of the blue, 'I'm going to barbeque one of your dogs.'"" But she didn't believe it -- then or now. ""Nobody knows what to think,"" Malone said.","New Mexico authorities find parts of a dead chihuahua, dachshund mix in a freezer .
They say a man admitted killing the animal for use as food .
Eating dog is legal in New Mexico and many other states .
Sheriff: Charges filed due to how it was done, stress on family ."
"(CNN) -- Thick, handsome mustaches have long been prized by men throughout the Middle East as symbols of masculine virility, wisdom and maturity. But not all mustaches are created equal, and in recent years, increasing numbers of Middle Eastern men have been going under the knife to attain the perfect specimen. Turkish plastic surgeon Selahattin Tulunay says the number of mustache implants he performs has boomed in the last few years. He now performs 50-60 of the procedures a month, on patients who hail mostly from the Middle East and travel to Turkey as medical tourists. He said his patients generally want thick mustaches as they felt they would make them look mature and dignified. ""For some men who look young and junior, they think (a mustache) is a must to look senior ... more professional and wise,"" he said. ""They think it is prestigious."" Pierre Bouhanna is a Paris-based surgeon who, for the past five years, has been performing increasing numbers of mustache implants. He says the majority of his patients come from the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Lebanon and Turkey, with men traveling to France to have the surgery performed. More from Inside the Middle East: Paris Hilton whips up a storm in Mecca . ""My impression is more and more they want to establish their male aspect,"" he said. ""They want a strong mustache."" Both surgeons use a technique -- follicular unit extraction -- in which groups of hairs are taken from areas of dense hair growth to be implanted in the mustache area. Bouhanna said the patients were generally aged between 30 and 50, and were able to fly home the day after they had the procedure, which costs about $7,000 (â‚¬5,500) and is performed under local anesthetic. They are able to wash the next day, had to abstain from shaving for 15 days, and could expect to see full results after six months. Tulunay said some of his patients had specific looks in mind. ""They have some celebrities as role models,"" he said -- Turkish singer and actor Ibrahim Tatlises had a look that many wished to emulate. Politicians in the region had also sought out his services to boost their appeal to voters. Andrew Hammond, a Saudi Arabia-based journalist and author on Arab popular culture, said the mustache has a long history in the region. ""Having a mustache was always a big thing, ever since the Ottoman time,"" he said. ""Most Arab leaders have mustaches, or some form of facial hair. I think culturally it suggests masculinity, wisdom and experience. "" More from Inside the Middle East: Fast-food-loving Kuwaitis fight fat with stomach stapling . Saddam Hussein's bushy whiskers were among the world's most recognizable, but all of Iraq's presidents before and since have also sported mustaches, as did Nasser and Sadat of Egypt (and the kings and sultans before them), Turkey's Erdogan (and the two prime ministers before him), Syria's Assad (and his father before him). Christa Salamandra, an associate professor of anthropology at City University of New York, said that ""traditionally, a luxurious mustache was a symbol of high social status,"" and had figured heavily in matters of personal honor in the Arab world. Men swore on their mustaches in sayings and folk tales, used them as collateral for loans and guarantees for promises, and sometimes even shaved their opponents' lips as a punishment. The notion of a man's personal honor being bound up with his mustache appears to have survived into more recent times in some areas. In 2008, militants in Gaza abducted a Fatah opponent and shaved off his mustache to dishonor him, while in 2003, in the lead up to the Second Gulf War, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri -- a senior aide to Hussein and, like the rest of the former Iraqi leader's inner circle, himself mustachioed -- created headlines when he yelled ""Curse be upon your mustache!"" at a Kuwaiti counterpart at an emergency summit of Islamic states. Visitors to the region, too, have long seen a value in growing a mustache to help earn respect. The American diplomat Joel Barlow, who in 1795 was posted as U.S. consul to Algiers, wrote to his wife that he had grown a thick black mustache, which gave him ""the air of a tiger,"" and had proved useful in his work in the region. More than 200 years later, a unit of American Marines in Iraq's Sunni stronghold of Fallujah attempted to follow his example in 2004, growing mustaches in an attempt to help them win local sympathies. In Turkey, different styles of mustache carry their own political nuances. According to one research paper, mustaches with drooping sides signify a conservative, nationalist bent, left-wingers favor mustaches like Stalin, while a ""political religious"" mustache is carefully groomed, with ""cleanliness as its guiding principle."" Jenny Soffel contribued to this story.","Cosmetic surgeons say mustache implants are proving popular .

"(CNN) -- The recent release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl by the Taliban in Afghanistan has refocused attention on some of the other Americans held captive in that region. Bergdahl spent five years in the hands of the Taliban before the U.S. government reached an agreement for a prisoner swap with his captors stirring debate in the United States about the terms of the deal and circumstances surrounding his capture. Although Bergdahl was the only American soldier in captivity, other U.S. citizens are being held in the region. The longest detention is that of former FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing after traveling to an Iranian island more than seven years ago. His family says he was working for the CIA at the time. Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter wrote to President Barack Obama this week to ask why three other Americans he said were being held by Taliban-linked militants were not part of the deal that freed Bergdahl. Here are several of the most high-profile cases: . Bob Levinson . In March, Levinson, 66, passed a grim milestone, becoming the longest held hostage American in history. He vanished after traveling to the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007. The FBI says he was there as a private investigator. But news reports late last year said he was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. That prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the U.S. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy. The FBI, White House and CIA have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the CIA and Levinson. It's unclear who exactly is holding him or what his condition is. The family received a video in 2010 in which Levinson said he had been treated well but needed the help of the U.S. government ""to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three-and-a-half years."" American officials have said they believe Levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, is being held somewhere in southwest Asia. In March, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. government ""remains committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family."" He asked the Iranian government to ""work cooperatively with us"" on the investigation, Kerry said. But Iran has repeatedly said it isn't holding Levinson and doesn't know his whereabouts. During an interview in September with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was asked what he could tell Levinson's family. ""We don't know where he is, who he is,"" Rouhani said. ""He is an American who has disappeared. We have no news of him."" In January, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tolds CNN's Jim Sciutto that he hadn't seen ""anything that could prove"" that Levinson was ever in Iran. If he was, Zarif said, the United States should explain ""what a CIA operative was doing"" there. Warren Weinstein . Gunmen abducted Weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in Lahore, Pakistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards. The 72-year-old is being held by al Qaeda, which released a video of Weinstein at Christmas, showing him looking tired and pale. ""Nine years ago, I came to Pakistan to help my government and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here,"" he said. ""And now, when I need my government, it seems I have been totally abandoned and forgotten."" His daughter, Alisa, says she's worried about his health: he has a heart condition and severe asthma. She told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday that the release of Bergdahl raised her hopes that her father could be next. For years, when Warren Weinstein's case came up, U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Now, Alisa Weinstein says it's clear that negotiating is an option. But she also said she's worried that the political backlash over Bergdahl's case could harm her father's cause. ""We started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them,"" she said. ""So does that mean that the door is closed for us?"" Weinstein was employed by J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, that is a USAID contractor. He is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website. ""My father is just as deserving of freedom as Sgt. Bergdahl, as are all of the Americans who are being held abroad,"" his daughter said. Caitlin Coleman . In October 2012, Coleman and her husband, Joshua Boyle, disappeared in Afghanistan. In his last contact, Boyle, a Canadian, said they were in an ""unsafe"" part of the war-torn country. Coleman's family received two videos last year in which the couple asked to be freed from the Taliban captors. The family gave the videos to The Associated Press. In the videos, Coleman is nine-months pregnant and makes a direct plea to ""my President Barack Obama for help."" ""I would ask that my family and my government do everything they can to bring my husband, child and I to safety and freedom,"" she says. Her family had already a posted video of their own on YouTube two months after she and Boyle disappeared, appealing for their safe return. They said they were concerned about her health and fearful for her unborn child. ""As parents and soon-to-be grandparents, we appeal to whomever is caring for her to show compassion and allow Catie, Josh, and our unborn grandbaby to come home,"" her father said. Boyle's former wife, Zaynab, is the sister of Omar Khadr, a former Guantanamo detainee who allegedly received training from al Qaeda. Their father, Ahmed Said Khadr, was a senior al Qaeda leader with connections to Osama Bin Laden. Less than two weeks after Khadr was released from Guantanamo and sent back to Canada, Boyle and Coleman went missing. The videos Coleman's family received offer the only clue about what may have happened to the couple, but provide little proof they were indeed kidnapped. No demands for ransom have been made. State Department officials say they are aware of the video and of the disappearance of the couple and are in touch with the family. But they say they can't say more because of privacy laws. A spokesman for the Canadian Foreign Ministry says that the government is aware that Boyle and Coleman have been kidnapped in Afghanistan and is in contact with the Afghans about the case.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Hours after it snapped power lines, overturned cars and ripped away bamboo homes, the most powerful cyclone to hit India in years weakened Sunday, but not before it left at least 14 dead. Morning light revealed damage from Tropical Cyclone Phailin after it pounded the eastern coast, the strongest storm in India in 14 years. Debris littered wet streets. Buildings had gaping holes where roofs and windows had been. In Odisha state, where the cyclone landed, at least 13 people were killed after trees fell and walls collapsed when the storm hit, Police Chief Prakash Mishra said. Another death was confirmed in Andhra Pradesh state, India's disaster management authority said. Many had feared the death toll would be higher. Massive evacuation efforts helped limit the number of casualties, officials said. ""It is a huge, huge relief,"" Naveen Patnaik, Odisha's chief minister, told CNN sister network CNN-IBN. ""Damage has been minimal."" But in the hardest hit areas, the storm's impact was clear, with flooded highways, fallen trees and downed power lines. As a precautionary measure, authorities cut the electricity in the affected districts. It could take up to a week to restore power, authorities said. Like a fierce hurricane . Hurricanes are known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean. At 140 mph wind speed, Phailin made landfall as the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. The strongest hurricane is a Category 5, which comes with winds greater than 155 mph. By Sunday, some 13 hours later, it was the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of about 80 mph. Where have all the hurricanes gone? 'Zero-casualty approach' India evacuated nearly a million people before the storm to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1999, when a cyclone killed 10,000 people. ""We have taken a zero-casualty approach,"" said Kamal Lochan Mishra, Odisha state's disaster manager. ""If people do not move, force will be used to evacuate them."" Phailin has brought nearly 8 inches of rain to Odisha's capital of Bhubaneswar, about 30 miles from the coast. The city's average rainfall for October is 6.5 inches. The storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land, but tropical storm-force winds are still possible through early Monday, said CNN meteorologist Judson Jones. Rainfall will also be a problem as Phailin moves up toward the Himalayas in Nepal. Multiple states in the region were under weather warnings for excessive rainfall and thunderstorms. Hundreds of emergency shelters . About 900,000 were evacuated in Odisha alone. Most people in low-lying coastal areas of the state left on foot or by bicycle, Kamal Lochan Mishra said. Relocating evacuees is a major challenge because of property damage and losses caused by the storm, said Patnaik. Most are housed in nearly 250 emergency shelters set up in sturdy buildings like schools and government offices. The India Meteorological Department warned of extensive damage to houses made of flimsy materials like mud and bamboo, as well as damage to old buildings. The storm disrupted power and communication lines. Extensive flooding also affected rail and road traffic, and crops are likely to suffer major damage, the agency said. In Gopalpur, a coastal resort town in Ganjam, restaurants were shuttered and streets deserted. Tourists and local residents left the town. Military deployed . In October 1999, Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, killing 10,000 people. It was the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Bay of Bengal, with winds of 155 mph at landfall. It caused more than $2 billion in damage. In advance of Phailin, military units and National Disaster Response Force personnel were deployed to coastal areas with relief supplies and medical aid, CNN-IBN said. All flights to Odisha have been canceled and train services in the state are also disrupted, CNN's sister network reported. Officials survey damage . As authorities surveyed the damage Sunday, they said food assistance would be provided to severely impacted villages. Teams from nonprofits were also canvassing the affected areas. Initial surveys indicate the damage was not as bad as many feared it could be, Save the Children said. But strong winds and heavy rains continued to pound some areas. ""There may be delays in being able to reach the most vulnerable families with aid,"" said Devendra Tak, a spokesman for the organization. ""This also means it could take some time before the full extent of the damage is known."" CNN's Neha Sharma and Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Mallika Kapur, Bharati Naik, Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- The drummer for the Scorpions rock band has been sentenced to a month in jail for being drunk, insulting Muslims and lowering his trousers at Dubai International Airport, local media reported. James Kottak, the band's 51-year-old American drummer, admitted to a Dubai court Tuesday that he had been drinking when he landed at the airport on April 3 on a flight from Moscow, court reporters from The National and Gulf News said. The band was on its way to Bahrain for a concert for the Formula One Grand Prix. Witnesses said that Kottak became angry and swore. One passenger services agent is quoted as telling the court that ""he was shouting 'non-educated Muslims,' then he went to the office of the head and flashed his middle finger at the passengers."" Kottak admitted to drinking but denied making any insulting comments about Muslims and denied flashing his middle finger. A policeman testified that Kottak shouted that he wouldn't travel with a group of Pakistanis and Afghans, saying they ""smell,"" a claim Kottak denied. Witnesses also said Kottak removed his trousers, but his lawyer said he just raised his shirt to show off a tattoo.

"(CNN) -- Raised steins, raised bosoms, leather-clad Bavarian thighs. Oktoberfest's sure got a beer tent full of clichés about it. But bet you don't know why ""Gemütlichkeit"" is untranslatable (let alone unpronounceable), what false teeth were doing in the lost property bin last year and whether the yodeling or oompah tent would best suit your personality. Read on, Lieblings. Bavaria's biggest beer love-in kicks off in Munich on Saturday, September 21, and runs through October 6. 1. Gird your bosom, hitch those hosen . Worried that squeezing into a bosom-lifting dirndl or a pair of skin-tight lederhosen will make you look ridiculous? Don't worry: it will, but considering almost everyone will also resemble an extra in a B-grade medieval romp, you'll fit right in. To put it another way, when in Bavaria, do as the Bavarians do -- and they're pretty proud of their huntsman-and-strapping-maid heritage. Rent a costume if you don't fancy splashing out on your own outfit. Although -- used lederhosen? 2. Learn to belt out ""Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit"" Fitting in at Oktoberfest is all about getting the balance right. Leather shorts and flouncy dresses: good. Beer stein hats: bad. Also good: singing. Not anything, though (unless it's really late). Bavarian bonding is about sing-alongs, and one such tune you'll hear time and again at the festival is ""Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit."" It's tricky to translate because ""Gemütlichkeit"" is supposed to mean some fusion of ""happiness"" and ""belonging"" that Anglo-Saxons are too uptight to understand. So try mumbling, ""Cheers to something-Anglo-Saxons-are-too-uptight-to-understand"" and then the important bit -- clink glasses. 3. Find table; don't visit rest room . You're thinking: Oh, Bavarians sound really jolly. Not at all the punctuality freaks of German stereotype. Well, kind of, but this country didn't set the standard for luxury precision automobiles without thinking ahead. Which means that Germans book tables months in advance in the most popular Oktoberfest tents (see below for a tent-by-personality guide). Without a reservation you'll spend hours queuing and, even if you eventually get a seat, will lose it as soon as you pop to the toilet. 4. Sit on that Viking helmet . Of the thousands of items ending up in lost property each year at Oktoberfests past, some have been obvious: Viking helmets, (ahem) wedding rings, French horns. Others were less obvious: false teeth, (live) grasshoppers. Lesson: don't bring anything precious to Oktoberfest, especially not your dignity. 5. Drink like a European . You know those patronizing stories about how Continentals -- unlike Yanks, Brits and Aussies -- don't get drunk but sit around sipping Gewürztraminer in sidewalk cafes, quoting Proust? They're not all lies! That said, Germans do have a word for a paralytic person -- a Bierleiche, meaning beer corpse. Don't be one. Surviving 12 hours of solid drinking is a marathon, not a sprint, so make each liter Mass (those jug-like glasses) last. At up to 8%, this wheat beer is strong stuff. For the record, a Mass costs around €9.80 ($13) in 2013. Tip well if you expect to be served again. 6. Choose your tent . There are 14 tents in all at Oktoberfest and the one you choose says a lot about you. ""Tent,"" though, requires some clarification -- this isn't boy scout-related. Schottenhamel and Hofbräu-Festzelt tents each have a mammoth 10,000 seats (around six million people will attend the festival in total), filled with a generally youngish, oompah-singing, rollicking international crowd. Champagne-drinking celebrities hang out in the Hippodrom or Käfer's Wies'n-Schänke tent. Arguably the best beer is served in the traditional, family-friendly Augustiner (where people are likely still to be noticing such things), though the roaring lion at the Löwenbräu would have something to say about that. Would-be shepherds drink under a painted sky at Hacker-Pschorr, dubbed the Himmel der Bayern (""Bavarian heaven""), while Bräurosl has a resident yodeler. 7. Do your Wurst . Luckily, Oktoberfest food -- make that German food, in general -- seems designed to protect the stomach, and reputation, against excessive wheat beer consumption. A meal of Wurst in various guises -- pork knuckles with sauerkraut, goulash and dumplings and pretzels as big as your head with Obatzda, a Camembert-paprika dip -- is ideal preparation for a more or less civilized session at the stein table. Saueres Lüngerl -- sour calf-lung dumplings -- is another Bavarian speciality, yet one that risks having the opposite effect from that intended. The restaurants page on Muenchen.de has a selection of traditional Bavarian restaurants in Munich. 8. Wear your dirndl bow right . Mead! Banquets! Maidens! Debauchery ... ... er, no. Bavarians might let their braces down at Oktoberfest but while flirting is fine, even expected, it stops at a very firm line. You can call a lady fesch (pretty), but don't imagine you're in the aforementioned B-grade medieval romp and start praising her Gaudinockerln (lit. lovely dumplings -- no need to spell it out). Ladies, be aware of the signals your dirndl bow is sending out: to the right means attached, to the left, single, in the center -- not recommended and somehow unlikely to be true -- a virgin. 9. Play the proper tourist . Believe it or not, there's more to Oktoberfest than beer-guzzling, thigh-slapping revelry. You can see its more traditional side at Saturday's opening Festzug, where a thousand tent owners and brewers parade through Munich's streets with horse-drawn, flower-bedecked drays laden with barrels. It's also kitsch heaven, with Oktoberfest-themed steins, fridge magnets and snow globes on sale, plus the chance to get a last-minute embroidered dirndl or lederhosen (used or unused).

"(CNN) -- South Korea midfielder Park Ji-Sung has confirmed his immediate retirement from international football. The Manchester United star won his 100th international cap at the Asian Cup last week, as South Korea lost on penalties to eventual winners Japan in the semifinals. Speaking at a press conference of the Korea Football Association in the country's capital Seoul on Monday, the 29-year-old said he wanted to give up his place in the team to make way for a new generation of South Korean players. ""I am announcing my retirement to open more doors for younger, junior players who have to grow to replace me eventually,"" Park told reporters. Japan's Asian Cup glory . He added that a right knee injury, for which he has undergone two major operations, also played a part in his decision. ""I think without health issues I could have continued my international career. But I will accept the situation as it is and I have no regrets."" Park was not included in the squad who defeated Uzbekistan in Friday's third-place playoff match in Qatar, but the news that he was to step down as South Korea captain was announced by coach Cho Kwang-Rae after the match. Reacting to Park's decision, and also that taken by former Tottenham Hotspur defender Lee Young-Pyo to retire from international duty, Cho said: ""They did a remarkable job for Korean football and I want to say I have loved working with them. ""It would be better if I could keep both of them in the national team but they have done an excellent job and I'm sure the Korean fans would like to congratulate them for all their hard work."" Park, who made his international debut 2000 before going on to play in the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cup's, said the future of South Korean football was in safe hands and singled out compatriots Koo Ja-Cheol, Ji Dong-Won and Son Heung-Min as players who would have a particularly bright future in the national team. ""Like we have seen during the Asian Cup games, there are many young Korean players who have enormous potential, passion and talent,"" Park, who led South Korea to the World Cup semifinals on home soil in 2002, said. ""My departure will help more young players who have demonstrated their talent and ability during the Asian Cup to prepare for the next World Cup."" The former Kyoto Purple Sanga and PSV Eindhoven player added that his retirement was definite and he would not be tempted back into the fold even if South Korea qualified for the World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014. ""It's the players who will make that happen. Thus the opportunities to play should be given to them alone. ""Just like I was given an opportunity for enormous growth during the 2002 World Cup, I think it is necessary to give good opportunities to junior players through generational change."" Park became the first Asian to play in a UEFA Champions League final, when Manchester United lost to Barcelona in 2009. And he said that despite his international career being over he had no plans as yet to leave the Premier League leaders, who he has been with since 2005. ""I haven't decided when I'll quit. I think I can play at least three to four more years,"" he added.","South Korea's Park Ji-Sung retires from international football .

"(CNN) -- Every American can make their own judgment about whether justice was served by the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial but one thing we should all recognize: President Obama's interference in a local law enforcement matter was unprecedented and inappropriate, and he comes away from the case looking badly tarnished by his poor judgment. ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" the president said when asked about the case in the Rose Garden on March 23, 2012, after many had called for Zimmerman's arrest but several weeks before he was charged. ""When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids."" In fact, if the president had a son, he would have been born to extraordinary privilege and raised with all the advantages of two very affluent and highly educated parents. He would have gone to tony private schools. His path in life would have been almost as dissimilar from Trayvon's as one could imagine. Yes, Obama's hypothetical son and Trayvon would have shared the same brown skin color. Would that have made them interchangeable? Not unless all brown-skinned boys are the same. Does the president really believe that? The president's remarks created a clear impression that he was motivated by one of two factors, and we can only guess as to which, or what combination of the two, was at work here. One possibility is that this is merely another manifestation of the president's well-known narcissism: No matter what the situation may be, it's all about him. The other, more troubling possibility is that the president surrendered to his political instincts. He wants disadvantaged Americans to believe that he and his family are one of them -- despite their life of unparalleled privilege -- and he wanted the prosecutors, judge and jury to believe that this was a case about race where justice demanded a guilty verdict. If that was his motivation -- and we cannot know, but reasonable people certainly may suspect -- then Obama should be ashamed of his effort to stir America's turbulent, dangerous racial waters. The president's role is not to be a racial agitator, and the mark of a great civil rights leader has been a determination to reject the temptations of that approach. And not that long ago -- in 2008, in Philadelphia -- candidate Obama distanced himself from such agitators. People such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson see white racism as endemic and elevate what's wrong with America over all that is remarkably right. In his 2008 Philadelphia speech, Obama separated himself from activists of their ilk: the very people who today still hope to punish George Zimmerman. On the campaign trail, Obama understood the sensibilities of the American people on these questions; in office, Obama seems to have lost that touch. On Sunday, the president did once again separate himself from the voices of anger. ""We are a nation of laws and the jury has spoken,"" he said. But if his Justice Department brings civil rights charges against Zimmerman, as the NAACP has urged and which it is reportedly still considering, the ugly racial politics of this prosecution will be undeniable. Let us hope it never comes to that, for at that point a double tragedy will have occurred. Trayvon Martin will be dead, and our hopes for a president whose judgment is unaffected by his race will have been thoroughly and irreparably dashed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Abigail Thernstrom.","Abigail Thernstrom: President Obama's 2012 statement on case was a mistake .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama cares, the White House insisted Tuesday in asking Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to better respond to the flood of immigrants illegally crossing the border into Texas. No he doesn't, say Republicans who note Obama doesn't plan to visit the border area when he travels to Texas -- the epicenter of the immigrant influx -- on Wednesday for a trip that includes a meeting with Gov. Rick Perry. Amid the political sniping, many of the tens of thousands of young Hispanic immigrants who have illegally crossed the border into Texas this year remain in limbo while waiting to be processed and possibly sent back to their home countries. The surge of undocumented youths from Central America has overwhelmed federal facilities and revived the debate over an immigration policy overhaul, one of the most partisan issues in the already overheated political climate of an election year. U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an ""immediate humanitarian crisis."" Obama administration officials blame the immigrant influx on dire conditions in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that cause people to send their children on dangerous journeys to the United States with smugglers who falsely promise the kids won't get deported. Critics, however, say the administration invited the problem by halting deportations of some young immigrants who came to the country illegally in past years. Funding request . Obama's emergency funding request is just over 10% of the $30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the Senate-passed immigration reform bill that House Republican leaders have stalled. A breakdown of the request, which requires approval from the deeply divided Congress, shows a broad approach by the administration to a problem that the critics say should have been anticipated. It seeks $1.6 billion for the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to bolster customs and border efforts as well as cracking down on smugglers, and $300 million for the State Department to help Mexico and Central American governments counter what officials called ""misinformation"" by smugglers about what immigrants will face on the journey to the U.S. border and once they arrive. A main goal is to speed up the processing of arriving young immigrants to send back those who lack legal status. For most, the likely outcome will be a return home, White House officials told reporters on a conference call. Obama's funding request also seeks $1.8 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services to provide appropriate care for unaccompanied children crossing the border. The officials said that money would allow the government to meet its legal and moral obligations for such youngsters now being crammed in overcrowded facilities in several states while awaiting processing. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said it was processing requests from HHS to house more minors and Defense Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the matter was still under discussion. But U.S. officials told CNN's Barbara Starr the requests cover about 5,000 new beds at military facilities. There currently is space for about 3,600 children. The current arrangement is to use military facilities for up to 120 days. Kirby wouldn't speculate whether the time frame would be extended, although he said it's something that would be discussed. ""Urgent situation"" In addition, the emergency funding request for the rest of fiscal year 2014, which ends on September 30, seeks an additional $615 million to ensure necessary money to fight wildfires -- an issue separate from the immigration matter. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the ""urgent situation"" that the emergency appropriation request would address should usurp any talk of making budget cuts elsewhere to offset the cost. ""With an emergency request like this, traditionally Congress has not sought to bog down that process in a search for offsets,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. The administration also will seek more leeway under existing law to speed up the processing of the undocumented newcomers who are overcrowding holding facilities and sparking protests in communities intended as temporary destinations. In particular, it wants Congress to make it easier for the Department of Homeland Security to deport new immigrants who lack legal standing to remain in the country, which would ease a growing backlog of cases resulting from the influx, Earnest said. ""What we are seeing along the Southwest border is a spike in illegal migration from a handful of Central American countries,"" he added. ""And what we would like is for the secretary of homeland security to exercise some greater discretion after the due process rights of those individuals has been acknowledged and respected."" Partisan divide . It was unclear how much cooperation Obama would get from congressional Republicans. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the request would be considered, but noted it lacked a component sought by the Republican leader. ""The speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address,"" said Michael Steel. On the Senate side, Republicans argued for changing a 2008 law signed by GOP President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from non-bordering countries. They blame the process for a backlog created by the surge in unaccompanied minors from Central America entering the United States illegally from Mexico. ""I don't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit"" the law, said conservative Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Democrats, however, want to keep the law intact to ensure that any children who deserve asylum get due process in the form of a full hearing. ""I'm not inclined to support any policy change that ultimately undermines existing law and would violate the right of someone who is actually a legitimate refugee,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat of Cuban descent who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Each child should be able to make their case as to why they qualify. Many will be sent back but others will qualify."" No border visit . Obama has come under criticism from Republicans and some Democrats for not planning to visit the border area during his Texas trip, which will include a Democratic Party fundraising event. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a possible GOP presidential nominee in 2016, called the situation similar to the much-disparaged federal response to Hurricane Katrina by the Bush administration. ""For him to go to Texas and spend two days shaking down donors and never even getting near the border mess he helped create would be like flying into New Orleans in the highest waters of Katrina to eat Creole cooking, but never getting near the 9th Ward, the Superdome, or the Convention Center where thousands languished in squalor,"" Huckabee said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas questioned if the border problem would harm the President in the same way the Katrina response tarnished his predecessor, telling Fox News: ""I hope this does not become Obama's 'Katrina moment.'"" The White House officials on Tuesday's conference call repeatedly emphasized that Obama regarded the immigration crisis as ""an urgent humanitarian situation."" Political squabble . Obama's trip to Texas set off a political squabble, with Perry refusing to greet the President at the airport and instead calling for a meeting to discuss the immigration crisis. In response, Obama invited Perry to a meeting in Dallas with faith leaders and local officials, according to a letter written by senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Perry, who is seeking to re-establish his national credentials after a disastrous bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, said Tuesday he looked forward to meeting with Obama. Previously, Perry has said he ""readily"" welcomes any federal emergency funds, but also has asked that Texas be reimbursed for more than $500 million the state has spent on border security over the past decade. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday the administration will take steps to fix the nation's broken immigration system, even without the help of Congress. That's the same message Obama has given in response to the refusal by House Republicans to take up a Senate-passed immigration reform bill. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis .

"(CNN) -- Australia's ailing flag carrier was sent into a tailspin Thursday, as the airline reported its biggest ever loss. In its latest report, Qantas revealed an after-tax net loss of $2.6 billion (A$2.8 billion) for the year to June 30, with the cumulative effect of high fuel costs, falling demand, and a massive writedown of its international fleet blamed. ""There is no doubt today's numbers are confronting, but they represent the year that is past,"" said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who added that he predicted a return to underlying profitability in 2015. ""We have now come through the worst. With our accelerated Qantas Transformation program we are already emerging as a leaner, more focused and more sustainable Qantas Group."" Tough times . Despite his optimism, the carrier has faced an extremely turbulent ride in recent years. In February, it announced plans to cut 5,000 positions over the next three years as it seeks to claw back costs. The airline employs 33,000 people, according to the company website. About 93% of them are based in Australia. Qantas has also clashed with domestic unions over plans to review its maintenance operations. Union officials accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. The dispute came to a head in late 2011, when the carrier grounded its fleet -- with unionized pilots, engineers, ramp, baggage and catering crews effectively locked out -- affecting around 100,000 passengers at the time. The airline was eventually ordered to end the dispute by the government. Joyce has also blamed competition, particularly in Australia's busy domestic market, for many of Qantas' problems, suggesting that rival Virgin Australia -- which has been rapidly adding flights since 2011 -- has the advantage of an ""uneven playing field,"" as their price war intensifies. ""The Australian domestic market has been distorted by current Australian aviation policy,"" he said earlier this year, referring to the fact laws restrict Qantas from receiving foreign investment. Virgin, by comparison, is supported by three foreign airlines -- Air New Zealand, Etihad and Singapore Airlines -- which helped the company raise more than $300 million in investment last year.","Qantas reveals after-tax net loss of $2.6 billion (A$2.8 billion) for the year to June 30 .

"London (CNN) -- Scientists have picked a prime landing site on the ""head"" of a comet for the next stage of the Rosetta mission. The project, led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with partners including NASA, recently placed the Rosetta probe in an orbit 30km (18 miles) from the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a 10-year chase across the solar system. If successful, the mission will be the first to orbit and land on a comet as it journeys around the Sun. A statement on the space agency's Rosetta blog says landing site ""J"" was chosen due to its ""scientific potential"" while posing less risk to Rosetta's lander module Philae compared to other possible sites. A backup site (marked ""C"" in the above composite image) has been identified on the irregularly-shaped ""body"" of the comet which has two distinct lobes -- and mission controllers say they are aiming to reach the surface on November 11. Rosetta will stay in orbit around the comet as it rushes towards the Sun, taking measurements as gas and dust are ejected into a huge tail, while the lander carries out experiments on the surface. The mission is aimed at learning more about the composition of comets and the project may shed light on whether they brought water to Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. 3D animation: See how Rosetta met the comet . ""We will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site, giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition, structure and evolution of a comet,"" said a lead lander scientist Jean-Pierre Bibring on ESA's Rosetta website. Making a landing is particularly difficult as the probes are so far away that steering Philae once it has separated from Rosetta is not possible. The lander's trajectory has to be programmed ahead of its release. Project leaders had to find a landing site that avoids large surface hazards and allows Philae to continue to communicate with Rosetta. Before the prime landing site was chosen, Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor also explained that power was a crucial consideration. Philae's batteries will have enough charge for 64 hours but the lander needs sunlight to generate more energy for the extended science mission. ""There are certain parts of the comet where you won't be able to do any science because you will never get the lander in enough sunlight to be able to recharge the batteries,"" Taylor told CNN. Taylor shared the excitement of seeing the first high-resolution close-up images but said his reaction to the odd shape was: ""What are we going to do with this? Where are we going to go? ""It has presented a challenge as to where we can land on the comet because there are certain regions you just can't reach. The neck is quite difficult to get to -- it's difficult to get a trajectory that will end up on that point without clipping one of the lobes."" Taylor told CNN that results were starting to come in from the on-board instruments. ""There are some dust instruments that kind of put their hand up for a couple of weeks and then bring the hand back in again and analyze what it's caught,"" he said. ""We are starting to sniff and taste the comet.""

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez appealed to the Court of Arbitration (CAS) Friday against his four-month ban imposed by FIFA for biting during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Suarez and his legal team spent five hours before a three-man CAS appeal panel in Lausanne in an attempt to reduce the suspension, which covers all football activity. The Uruguay striker bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during a World Cup group game in Natal last month. It was the third time he had committed a similar offense and it drew an immediate response from football's world governing body. With Suarez banned, Uruguay lost its last 16 match to Colombia and was knocked out of the World Cup. Despite the punishment, it did not stop Spanish giants Barcelona from signing Suarez from English Premier League Liverpool in a $127 million deal last month. Ushered away . Suarez did not comment to reporters either before or after the proceedings Friday in the Swiss city, but did take time to sign autographs for waiting children before being ushered away. His connections are hopeful of cutting his ban by two months, meaning he would be available to make his Barcelona debut by the end of the month. The CAS said it would issue its decision ""as soon as possible, probably before the end of next week."" Suarez, 27, was top scorer in the EPL last season, winning the two major player of the year awards for his outstanding performances in helping Liverpool to runner-up spot in the standings. He suffered a knee injury at the end of the season which threatened his participation in the World Cup, but he recovered to score two goals in a decisive 2-1 victory over England. But in the final group game, his bite on Chiellini, captured by television cameras, provided the most notorious moment of the World Cup. UEFA adopts spray . One of the biggest successes of Brazil 2014 was the use of a ""magic spray"" which was used by referees to mark the spot from which a free kick was taken and to make sure the defensive wall retreated the requisite distance. UEFA said Friday that it would be used in all its competitions, including the Champions League, following successful trials in its recent under-17 championship in Malta. ""As we all saw at the World Cup, this spray was very useful in helping the referee in free-kick situations, and I am sure we will see similar results in our matches this season,"" said UEFA president Michel Platini. The spray will be used for the first time in the UEFA Super Cup game between Real Madrid and Sevilla in Cardiff on August 12. Celtic lifeline . In other football news Friday, Scottish champion Celtic has been handed a Champions League lifeline after UEFA punished Legia Warsaw for fielding an ineligible player. Legia won the third qualifying round tie 6-1 on aggregate, but brought on Bartosz Bereszynski for the last four minutes of its 2-0 second-leg victory at Murrayfield Wednesday. Bereszynski was supposed to be serving a three-game ban for violent conduct in last season's Europa League. UEFA awarded the second leg game 3-0 to Celtic, handing them victory on away goals. Legia, who say the problem arose because of the failure to fill in appropriate paperwork for Bereszynski, will appeal the decision.","Luis Suarez appeals biting ban at sport's highest court .

She and her family were living in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where the Taliban had issued an edict in 2009 banning all girls from school. Writing anonymously in a blog for the BBC at the time, she praised her father for continuing to operate a school that defied that order. Gordon Brown: The story of Malala's friend . She wrote of the constant, terrifying reminder that war lurked outside her door, and that her books offered peace. ""The night was filled with the noise of artillery fire and I woke up three times,"" she blogged. ""But since there was no school I got up later at 10 a.m. Afterwards, my friend came over and we discussed our homework."" Her blog attracted the attention of media everywhere, particularly journalists in the West. For years, this small girl with a big voice made it clear that she wasn't going to be intimidated. In interviews, she spoke without her face covered. ""I have the right of education,"" she said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" Her speech Friday had that same, if not stronger, tone of determination. ""The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions,"" she said, ""but nothing changed in my life except this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born."" Speaking for children across the world, she told world leaders: ""We are really tired of these wars."" Yousafzai went on to address specific attacks in Pakistan on teachers and schoolchildren. Earlier this summer, a teacher was gunned down in front of her son as she drove into her all-girl school. A school principal was killed and his students severely injured when a bomb was tossed onto a school playground at an all-girl school in Karachi in March. In January, five teachers were killed near the town of Swabi in the volatile northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the United Nations says. And, in June, a suicide bomber blew up a bus carrying 40 schoolgirls as it made its way to an all-girl campus in Quetta. Fourteen female students were killed. ""Dear sisters and brothers,"" she said, ""we realize the importance of light when we see darkness. We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced. In the same way when we were in Swat, we realized the importance of pens and books when we saw the guns. ""The extremists were and they are afraid of books and pens,"" she said. ""The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them."" This fear is partly based on the Taliban's own lack of education, Yousafzai said. And, she said, world leaders should ""change their strategic policies"" to press for peace and ensure that children's and women's rights are protected. ""We call upon all governments to ensure free, compulsory education -- all around the world for every child."" Yousafzai presented Ban, the U.N. secretary-general, with a petition signed by nearly 4 million people in support of the 57 million girls and boys around the world who are denied education. In October, six men were arrested in connection with the attack on Malala and the other schoolchildren who were on the bus as they headed home from school. All of the men were released from jail because of a lack of evidence against them. The one named as the primary suspect, identified by police as Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man from the Swat district, remains on the run, authorities told CNN. Khan was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. CNN's Saima Mohsin contributed to this report.","Malala Yousafzai: After the bullets, ""out of that silence came thousands of voices""

"(CNN) -- Frank Sinatra is back, crooning 'Fly Me To The Moon' live in his trademark suit and fedora as if he had never left the stage. A decade and a half after Ol' Blue Eyes passed away, this unexpected new appearance has been made possible with an optical technology called Musion Eyeliner. Based on a Victorian-era light projection system called 'Pepper's Ghost' which was developed by two inventors -- Henry Dircks and John Pepper -- in the 1860s, Musion Eyeliner offers a range of spectacular stage effects that, in addition to bringing Frank Sinatra back to life, have been used to reanimate Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Uwe Maass, the inventor or Musion Eyeliner, explains that when it was first developed in the 19th century, Pepper's Ghost was quite straightforward: ""The Pepper's Ghost system is relatively simple. It is a piece of foil in a 45 degree angle and it reflects the image from the floor onto the stage."" From the audience's perspective the light projection can offer all kinds of effects including making realistic 3-D people appear on stage."" Maass -- an accomplished electronic engineer with 30 years experience in optics -- advanced the concept of Pepper's Ghost with modern video projection and animation techniques that serve to update the old technology. Maass's main innovation is to replace the glass used in original systems with an invisible polymer foil to offer a more substantial image while also allowing the stage behind to remain visible. Maass's developments quickly attracted interest from senior figures around the entertainment industry: . ""I first thought of it 15 years ago and I filed a patent application using foil for a Pepper's Ghost system and two weeks later I got phone calls from Steven Spielberg's people. They came to my office (as well as representatives) from Disney and Siegfried and Roy ... David Copperfield came personally,"" Maass says. Even though it has been around since the 90s, Musion Eyeliner really came to prominence in 2006 when Madonna performed alongside the animated British band Gorillaz at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Since then the technology has been used by Universal Studios, Disney, and Sony, as well as performers including ABBA, Will.i.am, Mick Jagger, and Mariah Carey, as well as Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre in their famous performance alongside Tupac at Coachella in 2012. Maass is also working with artists to help create shows that bring together members whose schedules clash: ""We got a lot of good response from the artists Black Eyed Peas (and) Will.i.am,"" Maass says. ""They're really pleased with the system because in France they couldn't travel all together, so we had two of the group members virtually on stage and performing together, interacting together with the rest of the group who were real on stage."" The system has also been used to simulcast events and performances around the world: . ""Another application is teleconferencing ... You can have one performance on one stage that is live and then you can have a hundred performances at the same time all over the world with the same concert,"" says Maass. Resurrecting performers of the past comes with a complex of legal, technical and ethical questions, but has nevertheless been proving popular with audiences around the world. Maass says that his company's next main project is to help Cirque du Soleil bring the work of Michael Jackson back to life in the 'Immortal World Tour'. In an interview with Ebony Magazine in 2007 Michael Jackson said ""Music has been my outlet, my gift to all of the lovers in this world. Through it â€” my music -- I know I will live forever."" With the help of Musion Eyeliner, Jackson may be immortalized in a more literal way than he could ever have imagined.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid move three points clear in Spain ahead of the winter break with his fifth hat-trick this season in Saturday's 6-2 win at Sevilla, as both teams had a player sent off. The Portugal forward claimed outright top spot in the La Liga scoring charts as he moved clear of Lionel Messi, who is in Japan with Barcelona for Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final against Brazilian side Santos. Real, smarting from last weekend's 3-1 home defeat by the Spanish and European champions, made the perfect start when Ronaldo ran onto Angel Di Maria's threaded pass to net in the 10th minute. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas did well to stop Sevilla making an immediate reply, with the Spain captain pushing Manu's shot onto the post. Sevilla thought they had equalized in the 35th minute but Emir Spahic's effort was ruled out for a marginal offside following Ivan Rakitic's free-kick out wide, and Real doubled the home team's anguish by immediately doubling the lead. Jose Callejon, who like Ronaldo scored in the midweek Copa del Rey first-leg win over third division Ponferradina, was credited with another goal after making enough contact with Di Maria's chip into the box to distract keeper Javi Varas. Ronaldo made it 3-0 in the 41st minute with his 19th league goal this season after being given too much space to shoot from outside the box. However, Real went to the interval reduced to 10 men after defender Pepe was sent off for striking the face of former Madrid striker Alvaro Negredo. Sevilla could not capitalize on that advantage, and Di Maria was finally rewarded in the 66th minute when he ran onto Karim Benzema's first-time pass and coolly slotted low past Varas. Jesus Navas reduced the deficit when he fired through the legs of defender Sergio Ramos in the 69th minute, but Manu was red-carded for a rash tackle from behind on Madrid fullback Alvaro Arbeloa. Ronaldo netted from the penalty spot with five minutes left -- sealing his 13th treble for Real --after Benzema was fouled by Federico Fazio in a challenge that saw the France forward carried off. His replacement Hamit Altintop then scored his first league goal for Real, with the Turkey midfielder netting from Xabi Alonso's low cross. Negredo hit back in the second minute of time added on for his fifth in La Liga to ensure a repeat scoreline from last season's fixture. The defeat left Sevilla 16 points behind Real after 16 games, and facing the prospect of losing fifth place to Malaga -- who visit third-placed Valencia on Sunday. Espanyol moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at Sporting Gijon that left the Barcelona-based club a point behind Sevilla and Malaga. Sergio Garcia netted the winner with six minutes left, after captain David Barral equalized for third-bottom Gijon with his seventh goal this season in the 61st minute. French teenager Thievy Bifouma put Espanyol ahead after only two minutes as the 19-year-old fired home from outside the box. Athletic Bilbao beat bottom club Real Zaragoza 2-1 to move up to eighth, despite having Spain midfielder Javi Martinez sent off midway through the first half. Leonardo Ponzio put the visitors level from the resulting penalty, but his teammate Maurizio Lanzaro was dismissed for a second booking on 69 and Gaizka Toquero netted the Basque side's winner with three minutes to play. Getafe joined 10th-placed Atletico Madrid on 19 points with a 2-1 win at Real Mallorca as Abdel Barrada netted both goals. Defender Ivan Ramis headed Mallorca into a 10th-minute lead, but Pedro Rios helped 22-year-old French midfielder Barrada score on 28 and 44.","Real Madrid three points clear of Barcelona going into Spain's winter break .

"(CNN) -- The vanishing spray used by referees at the recent FIFA World Cup has found a new home in the English Premier League. The biodegradable foam, which provides a visual 10-yard marker at free kicks to stop defenders encroaching, will make its debut in the 2014/15 season. ""At the Premier League we are open to developments that enhance the competition and it was clear from watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil that Vanishing Spray benefited referees, players, and all of those who watched the matches,"" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in a statement. The move follows consultations with both Premier League clubs and referees. The spray will be used for the first time in the match between Manchester United and Swansea City at Old Trafford on August 16. Mike Riley, general manager of the Premier League refereeing body -- the Professional Game Match Officials Limited -- welcomed the idea. ""As an assessor at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil I saw firsthand the benefits of Vanishing Spray for referees, and for the game as a whole,"" Riley said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Four goals from Cristiano Ronaldo laid the foundation for a thumping 6-2 win for Real Madrid over Sevilla on Saturday. The win keeps Madrid's slim chances of overcoming leaders Barcelona alive, reducing the gap between them and their rivals to five points. Although Josep Guardiola's team can restore their eight-point lead with a win over Espanyol on Sunday evening. Sergio Ramos opened the scoring for Madrid after 22 minutes before Ronaldo weighed in with his first of the night nine minutes later, with Kaka adding a third before half-time. Alvaro Negredo pulled one back for the home side on the hour mark but three Ronaldo goals in the space of ten minutes shortly afterwards killed any hopes of a revival stone dead. Negredo bagged his second of the night with six minutes remaining but it was the Portuguese winger's night as his fourth goal saw him move one ahead of Lionel Messi's league goal tally of 32. In the earlier La Liga matches, Roberto Soldado scored twice as Valencia beat Real Sociedad 3-0. All goals came in the first half -- Soldado scoring in the 17th and 37th minutes while Brazilian Jonas Goncalves netted after 25 minutes. The win consolidates Valencia's grip on third place although Villarreal can reduce the gap from six to three points with a win over Mallorca on Sunday. Seventh-placed Atletico Madrid lost 3-0 to Malaga who recorded their fourth successive win in La Liga thanks to goals from Jose Salomon Rondon on the half-hour mark, followed by a Julio Baptista header five minutes later before Enzo Maresca added the third six minutes before the final whistle. Athletic Bilbao defeated Levante 3-2 as they continue their quest for a Europa League spot next season. Bilbao surged into a three goal lead after little more than a hour played with goals from Gaizka Toquero, David Lopez and Fernando Llorente. But Levante staged a late comeback banging in goals in the 77th minute (Christian Stuani) and in the 86th minute courtesy of Victoriano Nano to set up a tense climax, but the home side held on to claim the three points. Getafe gave their supporters hope that they might avoid relegation after a 2-0 win over bottom side Almeria. Goals from Adrian Colunga and Pedro Rios lifted them out of the relegation zone and up 15th place with 40 points. Racing Santander looked to have ensured their survival in La Liga after a 3-2 win over second-from-bottom Hercules. Giovani dos Santos opened the scoring for Santander in the 14th minute before Sendoa Agirre equalized for Hercules five minutes before halftime which ushered in a frantic passage of play. Giovani restored Santander's advantage a minute later, before Tiago Gomes made it 2-2. Henrique capped a madcap five minutes with a header in stoppage time and ultimately sealed the win for Santander. An injury-time penalty by striker David Barral saw Sporting Gijon salvage a 2-2 draw in their match against struggling Deportivo La Coruna.","Real run riot as Ronaldo bags four goals to move ahead of Lionel Messi's league goal tally .

"(CNN) -- Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo both scored hat-tricks as Real Madrid thrashed Levante 8-0 in the first leg of their Spanish Copa del Rey last-16 tie on Wednesday. Jose Mourinho's side, who have not won this cup competition since 1993, scored four goals in each half to make the second leg in January a formality. Mezut Ozil and Pedro Leon, who added the final goal in the 90th minute, were also on target as Mourinho's near full-strength side ouclassed their opponents.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored a superb hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed Osasuna 7-1 to increase their lead at the top of the Spanish La Liga to three points following Barcelona's surprise 2-2 draw at Athletic Bilbao. Osasuna came into the match at the Bernabeu in good spirits after ending Levante's unbeaten record last weekend, but they were always up against it after Ronaldo headed home Angel di Maria's 22nd-minute cross. Although the visitors levelled through a Ibrahima Balde free-kick eight minutes later, Madrid soon re-took the lead when defender Pepe glanced home another di Maria cross. Gonzalo Higuain curled home Madrid's third on the stroke of half-time and Ronaldo made it 4-1 with a 54th minute penalty, following a foul by Eneko Satrustegui which resulted in a second yellow card. The Portuguese international completed his hat-trick with a header three minutes later and Karim Benzema came off the substitutes' bench to add two further goals as Madrid made it 10 successive win in some style. Champions Barca remain unbeaten, but they have now drawn four of their 11 league matches and they had Argentine maestro Lionel Messi to thank for earning a late point in rain-sodden Bilbao. Ander Herrara put the hosts ahead with a fine curling strike only for Cesc Fabregas to quickly level matters with a superb header from Eric Abidal's cross. Then, with 10 minutes remaining, Abidal's clearance eventually found the Barca net off Gerard Pique to hand Bilbao the advantage. But, in injury time, Messi took advantage of some hesitancy in the home defense to claim a vital equalizer. It means Real lead the way on 28 points, with Barcelona on 25 and Valencia just a further point behind on 24. Meanwhile, in the English Premier League, Tottenham withstood repeated pressure from the home side to win 2-1 at Fulham to maintain their status among the league leaders. Gareth Bale opened the scoring in the 10th minute from an acute angle and Aaron Lennon doubled their lead with a fine individual effort just before half-time. Younes Kaboul put through his own net from a corner to reduce the arrears and Fulham wasted a host of chances to level, before Jermain Defoe secured the three points with a deflected shot in injury time. The result keeps Tottenham in fifth position in the table, level on points with Chelsea but with a game in hand. However, both clubs are still nine points behind runaway leaders Manchester City. At the other end of the table, Wigan stay bottom of the table after a 3-1 defeat at Wolves, while Chris Eagles and Ivan Klasnic both scored twice as Bolton thrashed Stoke 5-0. That result lifted Bolton above Blackburn into third bottom and went some away to avenging their 5-0 FA Cup semifinal defeat by Stoke last season.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores a hat-trick as Spanish leaders Real Madrid thrash Osasuna 7-1 .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barcelona produced a mesmeric display of attacking football to rout Osasuna 8-0 in the Camp Nou Saturday. The Spanish and European champions were coming off two draws against Real Socieded and AC Milan but were back to their very best against opposition rendered helpless by their attacking fluency. Messi started the goal spree after just five minutes with new signing Cesc Fabregas, pushed up front with Pedro Rodriguez rested, adding the second to continue his fine scoring form since joining Barca from Arsenal. David Villa made it 3-0 on the half hour mark before an unfortunate own-goal from Ruben Gonzalez summed up Osasuna's woeful night. Messi scored his second and Barcelona's fifth just before the break. The goals continued after the interval and Xavi lobbed the visiting keeper for the sixth before Villa and Messi, with his hat-trick goal, wrapped up the scoring. Earlier, Valencia maintained their 100 per cent start to the season with a 1-0 win over Sporting Gijon with Robert Soldado on target. It left them top ahead of Barcelona, with Real Madrid set to join them on nine points if they beat Levante Sunday. In Germany, Werder Bremen went top of the Bundesliga after a 1-1 draw at Nuremberg despite having Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese sent off. With Bayern Munich playing at Schalke Sunday, Bremen took advantage as they battled for a point despite losing Wiese after just 17 minutes for a bad foul on Nuremberg striker Christian Eigler.

"(CNN) -- Evander Holyfield has faced many difficult opponents in the ring -- but nothing quite like this. The former heavyweight world champion has teamed up with colorful Canadian businessman and philanthropist Yank Barry to help Syrian refugees in Bulgaria. Barry, once the lead singer of The Kingsmen, shot to fame briefly in 1963 with the single ""Louie Louie."" He went on to become a music producer before turning his focus to international aid and diplomacy. The U.N. estimates about 5,000 Syrians have asked for asylum in Bulgaria. About 1,200 mostly Syrians live cramped inside containers and tents at the Harmanli camp near Bulgaria's border with Turkey. On a foggy Sunday morning, I accompanied the pair on a drive from the capital, Sofia, to the camp, about 170 miles away. As soon as we arrived, Holyfield and Barry were surrounded by hundreds of refugees angry at camp conditions in Bulgaria. The pair planned to deliver food aid and to help resettle some families in a home supplied by Barry's charity, Global Village. One refugee woman asked: ""Why don't you do more to help us?"" Barry replied: ""Since last year I've delivered 5,000 tons of food to camps. I'm a private individual. We now have a hotel and we are bringing families."" The woman persisted: ""What about the rest of us?"" Syrian refugees in Lebanon face polio threat . Holyfield and Barry's recent aid mission was not supposed to be like this. In midst of the chaos, Barry said to Holyfield: ""We can't blame them for being angry. But they have to understand. We are a private foundation."" The refugees questioned why more was not being done to help them. Visibly annoyed, Barry said: ""Wait a minute! Time out! We got here 15 minutes ago. Now have a little bit of patience before I lose my patience. And we take our food and don't take anybody!"" That did not appease the refugees. Instead, they held up their thumbs, chanting ""fingerprint"" -- their way of demanding to be documented as refugees and then released from the camp. ""I wouldn't refuse food if I was hungry. If they can't handle it, let's go,"" Barry said as he got back into the car. They managed to sneak two families out and meet them at a nearby gas station. Barry offered to place them in a converted hotel with other Syrian refugees for up to a year. But Barry has more ambitious plans. He told us he would be meeting President Bashar al-Assad within a few weeks. ""We know he's killed some of his own people. But then so did Mubarak. So did Gaddafi. So did Saddam,"" Barry explained. When asked why he would have more success than others in reaching out to Assad, Barry said: ""I know he loves Louie Louie. It's my song. I sang it and I'll sing it to him. I'm going with Evander and possibly Mike, Mike Tyson. He, Assad, is a big boxing fan. And we're not politically involved."" It's dark by the time we reach our next destination -- the hotel that Barry is using to rehouse refugees. There is already one family inside. Syrian refugees face miserable winter in Lebanon . When the new arrivals walk through, tears start to flow as Mohammed recognizes his brother, Noor. He hasn't seen him in nearly a year. ""Hey Noor, you know this man? It's your brother!"" Barry says enthusiastically. ""Your heart skips a beat and I was crying probably as much as he was,"" he tells me. ""I saw Evander had a tear in his eye."" When I ask Holyfield why this mission is important to him, he says: ""Because at some point in time, when you leave this earth, they won't be asking about how many championships I won. They'll say: 'What did you do for the least of them?' I can say I was in Bulgaria, I was in Russia, I was in the Philippines."" Barry says he is already looking for another hotel to house more refugees. But with so many needing help, they may not be able to reach as many as they hope. More than 100 people try slip into Bulgaria every day, border police say, most say they are the fleeing the fighting in Syria. They pay smugglers as much as $1,500 to guide them in. ""The amount refugees pay varies according to the number of people trying to cross the border. If the group travels only to Bulgaria, the price they pay to traffickers is much lower. If Bulgaria is only a transit point, however, the price can go much higher,"" George Kalaydjiev, Director of the board in Svilengrad city explains. Bulgaria is one of the poorest countries in Europe. And this, Bulgarian officials say, is the best they can do. The UNHCR says it is trying to get more help for Bulgaria from the European Union. The U.N. says more than 62,000 Syrians have applied for refugee status across the EU. ""But we cannot forget these people have suffered enormously. It's unacceptable that they go on suffering once they reach the EU,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees AntÃ³nio Guterres said recently during a trip to a refugee camp in Sofia. Bulgaria is now building a wall along the most thickly-forested section of Bulgaria's border with Turkey, in an attempt to keep people out. But Syria's refugees are desperate. And with or without a wall, Bulgaria remains the doorway to Europe.

"(CNN) -- A group of heavily armed men opened fire at a soccer match between two local teams in western Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, killing seven people and wounding two others, according to a municipal police spokesman. The soccer field is at a community center opened four months ago as part of a program to decrease drug violence in a city that has been racked by violence and killings linked to drug cartels. Police said Monday they had not determined a motive for the shooting. The dead from the shooting Sunday evening were males ranging in age from 19 to 26, police said. At least one was a soccer player -- an image from the scene showed the dead player face down on turf. Above him was a posted sign reading in Spanish, ""Live Better"" -- a slogan in Juarez's anti-violence campaign. Three victims died at the scene, while four others died on the way to area hospitals. The gunmen -- reportedly traveling in three vehicles -- sprayed the soccer field with about 180 rounds from assault rifles around 6 p.m., just before the game got started, police said. Among the dead and wounded were several fans. Some of the victims were taken to hospitals by family members. One of the injured was a 12-year-old shot in the foot, the newspaper El Diario de Juarez said. ""We still do not have a motive why they opened fire,"" municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez told CNN in a phone interview from the scene. ""They fired 180 rounds in three or four seconds. It happened fast,"" Sanchez added. ""People here are still confused about what happened.""

The discovery turned the world of physics and astronomy on its head when it was first reported in 1998 by competing teams of scientists, two from the United States and one from Australia. It helped lead scientists to the conclusion that nearly three-fourths of the universe is made up of ""dark energy,"" a mysterious force that seems to be staying gravity's hand in stopping the universe from expanding forever. The nature and role of that force has become what the Nobel organization described as one of the most enigmatic mysteries of modern physics. Half of the Noble award will go to Saul Perlmutter from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley. The other half was awarded to Brian P. Schmidt of Australian National University and Adam G. Riess of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The prize in physics is worth 10 million Swedish kronor, about $1.44 million. ""I am delighted, excited, and deeply honored,"" Perlmutter said in a written statement. Reiss called the project ""an incredibly exciting adventure"" in a statement issued by Johns Hopkins University. ""I am deeply honored that this work has been recognized."" he said. The two teams, working separately, each measured the light coming from a specific kind of exploding star, or supernova, in what began as an effort to confirm expectations that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. Instead, they found that the exploding stars they were using as galactic yardsticks were dimmer than they had expected, indicating that the galaxies containing them were racing away from each other and the rest of the universe at an accelerating rate. The widely celebrated discovery indicated that a mysterious and invisible form of energy is counteracting the force of gravity, pushing matter apart at an ever faster rate. ""Today, we know that 74 percent of the universe consists of this dark energy,"" Riess wrote on his website before the award was announced. ""Understanding its nature remains one of the most pressing tasks for physicists and astronomers alike."" The discovery means that the universe is likely to continue expanding indefinitely, instead of reaching a steady state or collapsing back in on itself in what some call a ""big crunch."" ""The findings of the 2011 Nobel Laureates in Physics have helped to unveil a universe that to a large extent is unknown to science. And everything is possible again,"" the academy said in announcing the prize. The Nobel Prize in Physics is the second of six Nobel prizes to be announced this month. Last year, professors Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov from the University of Manchester in England won the physics prize for ""groundbreaking"" experiments with the two-dimensional material graphene. Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physics 104 times. The youngest recipient was Lawrence Bragg, who won in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate, he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel prize area. The oldest physics laureate was Raymond Davis Jr., who was 88 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2002. In the coming days, the committee will announce prizes in chemistry, literature, economics and peace. On Monday, the Nobel committee named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The announcement came three days after Steinman died of pancreatic cancer at age 68. Nobel rules don't allow awards to be given posthumously, but the Nobel Assembly issued a statement after the award was announced saying it interprets the rule to mean that no one can be deliberately given the award after death. Since the group's members did not know of Steinman's death when they made the decision, the award will stand, the assembly said.","NEW: Winners say they are ""deeply honored""

"Bossangoa, Central African Republic (CNN) -- Months after a coup escalated chaos and violence in the Central African Republic, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday unanimously approved the deployment of African and French forces there. The council also voted to impose an arms embargo on the nation, which is east of Cameroon and north of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A representative of the Central African Republic told the council the vote would ""give reasons to hope for a new dawn"" for the country's embattled population. Speaking after the vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said the U.S. government was ""deeply disturbed"" by ongoing reports of brutality in the nation. ""It is clear that urgent action is needed to save lives,"" she said, adding that the crisis has affected nearly half the country's population. The Security Council resolution, put forward by France, authorizes an African Union-led peacekeeping force to intervene with the support of French forces to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. Hours before the meeting, heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential palace in the capital of Bangui, witnesses said. Samuel Henryon, of Doctors without Borders, told CNN that eight people were killed and 65 wounded in clashes in the city. The agency, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has 16 people helping at two hospitals where the wounded have been taken, it said in a statement. Twenty are badly hurt, most with gunshot, machete or knife wounds. An official with the African-led peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic, Jean Pierre Sadou, told CNN he had seen eight bodies in the street. He said he had been told there were more bodies near the National Assembly. Violence has raged in the country since a coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the president's ouster. Multiple sources told CNN that the military commander of Seleka, Gen. Issa Yahya, was killed Thursday in Bangui. His second-in-command, Col. Saleh Zabari, is now thought to be in charge. Sadou said Seleka is now back in control of the center of Bangui and the situation there is quiet. Fighting continues near the airport, however. Members of Seleka told CNN that at least 30 people had been killed in the clashes in Bangui, men and women among them. Christians take refuge . Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines, leading to fears of sectarian violence. The situation in Bossangoa, a town about 185 miles north of Bangui that is at the epicenter of displacement resulting from the violence, was extremely tense Thursday. About 35,000 Christians have taken refuge in a Catholic church compound there. The headquarters of the small regional peacekeeping mission told CNN that the second-in-command of Seleka had given the militia permission to attack the compound. The mission has sent reinforcements in defensive positions around the church to protect civilians. A CNN team in the vicinity could hear sustained gunfire and rocket-propelled grenade fire that appeared to be directed at the church compound. There is no word yet of any casualties or damage suffered. Speaking to CNN before reports of the death of Seleka's commander emerged, Zabari said that it was believed there were armed elements in the compound but that unless those inside moved against them, they wouldn't attack it. Power, the U.S. envoy, said the sectarian tension that has made the tens of thousands of Christians seek refuge in the church compound in Bossangoa, while their Muslim neighbors shelter in a mosque nearby, was a tragic result of the coup. ""Extremists on both sides, in an environment of lawlessness and an environment of state failure, have taken advantage of that vacuum and stoked animosities,"" she said. The U.S. State Department said the United States was ""appalled by today's reports of the murder of innocent women and children outside of Bangui"" and was working with its international partners to find the best way to stabilize the situation. ""This horrifying account is the latest in a string of reports that illustrate the deteriorating humanitarian and security situation in the Central African Republic that could lead to an escalation in violence and further atrocities,"" the State Department statement said. An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas too risky to access. United Nations officials have warned that the violence between the Christian majority and Muslim minority now in power could lead to genocide. More than 400,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. ""They are hiding in the bush without shelter, food, or drinking water, exposed to the weather and mosquitoes that carry malaria, the leading cause of death in the country,"" Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. The group has operated in the country for years and is helping dispatch mobile units to take care of the wounded. French troops . An African Union force is already in the nation, but rights group say it's not enough to halt the escalating violence. Last month, France pledged to send about 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 already there. The troops currently there are deployed to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital, France said. Sources in the African Union mission to the Central African Republic said Wednesday that more French troops are on their way to the nation. France's ambassador to the United Nations, Gerard Araud, who holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, welcomed the body's decision to intervene in what he said was a ""forgotten crisis."" The United Nations has suggested its peacekeeping force could eventually augment the African-led mission. Bozize fled the country after the coup led by rebel leader Michel Djotodia. A transitional government is in place led by Djotodia, who was commander of the Seleka rebels. But the country continues to be wracked by unrest and new elections have yet to be held.

"(CNN) -- As a former U.S. brigade commander of several thousand coalition forces during surge operations in Iraq, it is difficult to watch this country fall apart. When I came home in 2007 after 15 months in Diyala province, I answered questions about what we accomplished there by explaining that we sowed stability and the seeds of self-governance in an Arab country that holds significant strategic interest for the U.S. Now, as the U.S. commits to targeted airstrikes on top of the troops we sent last month to shore up the weakened country, I question everything. Were the losses my command suffered in the volatile Diyala province in 2006-07 worth it? How is it possible that the Iraqi military, well-trained to take over security duties, has performed so poorly? Seven years ago, I would have agreed with the decision to return to Iraq. Today, I feel different. We fought long and hard, spending over $25 billion to train and equip Iraqi security forces. We helped them develop a working government based on democratic principles. And while it might be wholly appropriate for the U.S. to provide humanitarian aid to those under siege, it's the responsibility of the Iraqis to protect Iraq. As someone who helped train these forces, I know they have the capability to stand and fight. The training wheels have to come off. While it is frustrating and painful to watch militants take over a third of the country, we must focus on the here and now. The responsibility is to our soldiers who spent 13 years at war accomplishing what they were asked to do, often at a great cost. I fought to help my Iraqi friends and fellow soldiers establish a rule of law, and we achieved remarkable results. Civilian casualties fell from an estimated 29,380 in 2006 to 4,153 in 2011. In Diyala province, we went from 1,500 violent acts a month to less than 250. What is happening now should not detract from that success. But I came home to my family, my neighbors and my community. We cannot let the chaos in Iraq increase the disconnect between a war-weary American public and those veterans working through their transition back home. The needs in Iraq evolved over time, and they didn't disappear when we left. This is also the case with the needs of our Iraq- and Afghanistan-era veterans and military families. I worry about the future of those who served in these wars five or 10 years down the road when the wars have receded from the minds of the American people. At a time when the need will be greatest, interest will diminish, and they may struggle in a peacetime status quo. We need to focus on this generation, which has spent more than a decade at war. The National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics projects the number of veterans from recent conflicts to jump by 26% by 2016. They want to contribute in the same way to their communities as they did in Iraq and Afghanistan. But even with thousands of organizations operating to help them, a 2012 report from the Center for a New American Security finds that veterans are not receiving the care and services they need to transition successfully. They must have a chance to thrive where they live. This means education to transition beyond battlefield knowledge to private-sector careers and meaningful employment that pulls in a family wage. Along with their families, they require options for wellness and services. Caring for them includes understanding: listening to their service stories and future ambitions. Adm. Mike Mullen, 17th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ""If you listen closely to the voices of our veterans, you understand that yes, they all returned from war changed, but what never changed is this: They never forgot your generosity. They never forgot the power of opportunity. They never forgot the American dream."" As much as it pains me to see Iraq reverting to chaos, that does not mean that we should turn our focus there anew. We now have a stake in supporting the future in front of us: the evolving needs of the phenomenal, confident and self-assured men and women who served in and out of combat for these many years.","David Sutherland, U.S. brigade commander in Iraq, says it's hard to watch country fall apart .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi hit a hat-trick as Barcelona triumphed 3-1 in their Spanish Copa Del Rey last-16 first leg tie at 10-man Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. Argentine coach Diego Maradona saw Lionel Messi fire a King's Cup hat-trick for Barcelona in Madrid. Argentine coach Diego Maradona watched as one of his World Cup stars found the target after 12, 58 and 80 minutes having been rested for last weekend's 3-1 Primera Liga win over Real Mallorca. Messi fired the first beyond French goalkeeper Gregory Coupet following a return pass from Daniel Alves and added the second from the penalty spot. He sent Coupet the wrong way following an infringement that saw John Heitinga red carded before Atletico pulled one back through Czech defender Tomas Ujfalusi after 69 minutes. Messi completed his treble 10 minutes from time before leaving to a standing ovation with record 24-time winners' Barcelona facing a comfortable task in next Wednesday's return leg.","Lionel Messi hits hat-trick as Barca win 3-1 in Copa Del Rey last-16 first leg .

"(CNN) -- Holding up a coca leaf at a U.N. meeting on narcotics Monday, Bolivian President Evo Morales defended the practice of chewing on the leaves as tradition and urged the body to reconsider its decision to declare it illegal. Coca leaves, the raw ingredient used in the making of cocaine, were declared an illegal substance under Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, along with heroin and others. ""I want to ask the assistance of the international community in correcting a historical error that was committed against the Bolivian people when it unreservedly ratified the Single Convention Against Narcotic Drugs of 1961,"" Morales told the 55th session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna, Austria. Bolivia has withdrawn from the convention, but said it would rejoin if the traditional consumption of coca leaf is allowed to continue. Morales, a former union leader for coca growers, told the body his country has designated $20 million to fight cocaine trafficking -- but cultural ""producers of coca leaf are not drug dealers; consumers of coca leaf are not drug addicts,"" he said. ""I want to stress that at no time Bolivia acts untimely or irresponsibly,"" he said. Coca is widely used in the Andes as a mild stimulant and herbal medicine. Advocates say the leaves, which contain small amounts of cocaine, have several health and social benefits and dismiss claims it is dangerous. Morales has said ""sacred"" coca in its raw state is not an addictive drug and emphasizes that it has had a legitimate medical purpose for hundreds of years. But coca remains the raw ingredient for the purified forms of cocaine, which are illegal for non-medicinal, non-government-sanctioned purposes in virtually all countries. And for almost half a century the chewing of coca leaves has been banned internationally. Bolivia is currently the world's third biggest coca producer after Colombia and Peru, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. It has much to gain if its campaign to legalize coca leaves is successful. Energy drinks, flour and even toothpaste derived from the leaves could be sold around the world. One of these, Coca Colla, which trades on the name of the more famous U.S. soft drink that originally contained coca, has been a hit since its launch last year in Bolivia in 2010. According to the Washington Office on Latin America, (WOLA) an American non-governmental organization, the United States is likely to oppose any move to have coca leaf removed from the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs. The International Narcotics Control Board is also opposed to any lifting of the ban. CNN's Peter Wilkinson and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","Coca leaves is the raw ingredient used in the making of cocaine .

"(CNN) -- I was walking down 125th Street in Harlem last week when my iPhone beeped to alert me that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed saving obesity-prone urbanites from themselves by banning restaurant sales of large sugary sodas and teas. Nor was he taking any chances on a thumbs-down from New Yorkers. Instead of putting the measure to referendum, he is bypassing the vote to seek approval from the 11 members of the Board of Health, who are all his handpicked appointees. Knowing what I do about Bloomberg's relationship with sugary drinks, I stopped, stunned. Isn't this the same man who made Snapple the official drink of New York, giving its sucrose-laden potions a monopoly in high school vending machines over the objections of the health-conscious? But this whiff of hypocrisy is just one of the many problems with this proposition. Imposed bans and ""sin taxes"" often have unintended consequences. For example, the high cigarette taxes that New York has imposed to discourage smoking while filling government coffers have instead driven cigarette sales underground -- as entrepreneurs buy untaxed cartons from Native American shops and other outlets, then sell them cheaply on the street. The tax-evading tobacco addicts are still smokers, but now they are criminals, too, as the state rakes in extra revenue, but citizen smokers realize no health benefits. This result may have been unintended, but it could hardly have been unforeseen: When Canada imposed even higher taxes on cigarettes, tobacco smuggling became an industry worth $1.5 billion (in Canadian dollars) as the enterprising stocked up in the U.S. Plying the waters of Lake Ontario after dark in boats laden with contraband cigarettes, freelance tobacco merchants became indistinguishable from the cocaine and marijuana smugglers with whom they shared the night. The moral? Autocratically imposing public health measures rather than persuading people of their worth can easily backfire. Reducing the high intake of sugary drinks is a laudable goal, but should it be a priority, and if so, is this the best way to pursue it? No, and no. Imposing an outright ban is less ethical than public health leadership that induces behavior change. Some public health experts have achieved such positive health behavior transformations very successfully indeed. As a visiting fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health's Center For Health Communication in the early 1990s, I observed its masterful spearheading of the U.S. ""designated driver"" campaign. Today, Americans expect the ""designated driver"" to social events where alcohol is served will not drink, but 25 years ago, before Harvard's ""The designated driver is the life of the party"" campaign, this was not the case. Working with physicians, politicians, advocacy groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and even Hollywood celebrities, the Harvard center engaged in ""social marketing"" that sold people on the idea of a sober driver. The center also elevated social expectations around problems such as binge drinking and violence, not via punitive bans and ""sin taxes,"" but by education and celebrity examples that helped to transform unhealthy activities into socially unacceptable activities. The ethical advantages of voluntary restraint over legislated behavior are clear. They can enhance a sense of community, and avoid the defiance that can sabotage well-meaning laws, such as tobacco taxes that spawn smuggling. Moreover, the force of law can have disproportionate effects on segments of society: In this case, the obese are more likely to be poor people of color who can least afford the premium they will end up paying for their supersize drinks. Autonomy is an important ethical value, especially for freedom-loving Americans, and it should be preserved whenever possible. People should be free to make their own choices, from the clinical trials they join to the food and drink they consume, without duress and unmolested by the state. Sometimes it is necessary to override free choice for the utilitarian ""greater good of the community."" For example, some vaccinations are necessary, as are inspections of day care centers and restaurants. Otherwise, the health of others could be seriously imperiled. But there are no parallel laws that compel diabetics or people in heart failure who prefer using natural herbs to take their medications. Such laws might save lives but would violate the person's right to personal choice, however foolhardy it appears. Drinking oversize sodas falls into this category: The sugar-swiller is hurting no one but himself, and he should be persuaded, not compelled, to lay off. Bloomberg attempts to convince us that the sugar consumers are hurting others, feeding urgency by declaring that the city spends $4 billion a year on medical care for overweight people. It is certainly a significant figure, but it means little unless it is compared with the cost of care for people of normal weight and for those who are underweight. Some of the underweight also suffer from serious ailments that may raise their health care costs -- from anorexia to cancer to AIDS. Some studies even find that overweight people can be healthier than the underweight. As for me, I'm still puzzling the question of the five-year $116 million marketing monopoly that Bloomberg gave Snapple. It failed to generate the anticipated income and fizzled out by 2009, leaving one to wonder: ""Would sweetened ice tea still have been included in the ban if the contract with Snapple had proved more profitable?"" On June 1, the very day after Bloomberg announced the soda ban, he championed supersize doses of sugar and fat when he proclaimed National Donut Day, posing with enormous doughnut props. Predictably, money changed hands as pastry maker Entenmann's donated $25,000 to the Salvation Army. Surreal? Yes. You can't make this stuff up -- as Bloomberg should note. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harriet A. Washington.","High-cigarette taxes have driven sales underground in New York, ethicist says .

"(CNN) -- Helen, 50, was college educated, married, worked in middle management at a financial services company and had good health insurance. She was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 1990. She saw doctors with some of the best reputations. After an appropriate surgery, she was given high dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant. The treatment almost killed her several times and she was hospitalized for nearly a year. My book, ""How We Do Harm,"" co-authored with Paul Goldberg describes the challenges that some ordinary Americans experience while trying to get quality health care. In the book we show real examples, like Helen, of the irrationality of how medicine is practiced and consumed in the United States. We discuss those who do not get good care and those who suffer because of excessive and illogical health care. Both occur among the insured and the uninsured. The book also assesses the threat our health care system poses to the economy and offers suggestions on what needs to change. It was motivated by the ongoing debate about health care reform. For more than two decades, I have studied disparities in health outcomes and the inconsistencies in how medicine is practiced. I have come to believe that much of the rhetoric for and against health care reform lacks the understanding that the issue involves human beings. Lost in that debate is the fact that a large number of our fellow Americans are suffering and dying avoidable deaths, because of lack of quality health care. I believe we should be both ashamed and furious about our health care system. America spends more per person on health care than any other country. Per-person costs are nearly 1.5 times higher than the second most expensive country. We simply do not get the outcomes we pay for. Among the nations of the world, we rank 50th in life expectancy and American life expectancy is decreasing. America is 47th in infant mortality, just better than Croatia. The therapy Helen received was expensive and commonly given to women with breast cancer in the early 1990s. During this time, numerous women sued insurance companies who did not want to pay for the therapy and nearly a dozen states passed laws saying insurance companies had to pay for it. There was one really good reason why the health insurers did not want to pay for high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant for breast cancer: No study had ever been done to prove it beneficial. Even without evidence, some patients and their doctors had faith that it worked. The procedure was common because some doctors taught that the transplant was beneficial to patients. Truth be told, it was very beneficial to the doctors and hospitals offering it. By 1999, well after Helen had recovered, three well-designed clinical trials were completed. They showed that bone marrow transplant and high dose chemotherapy, a treatment now common for nearly a decade and a half, was not better than the standard therapy and there were indications it was more harmful. This shows that even the well-insured often get substandard care. Medical gluttony, the inappropriate use and overuse of medical treatment, is not just adding unnecessary cost to health care. It can actually be harmful to the individual. Doctors deserve some blame for this mess. Appreciation of the science of medicine and the scientific method is often lacking. It is amazing the number of health care professionals who seemingly reject the scientific method. They prescribe treatments they believe to be appropriate as opposed to therapies that are known to be appropriate based on objective scientific evidence. This form of ignorance is a root cause of much of the overuse of medical therapy. Too often, doctors fail to distinguish what is scientifically known from what is unknown, from what is believed. This is beyond mere disagreement about interpretation of the science. There is often selective reading of the science, especially by those trained in a specialty wanting to advocate for it. Health care providers and the public often overlook the emotional and financial conflicts of interest of health care professionals. While I blame the medical profession, blame also rests on hospitals, drug and device manufacturers, insurance companies, lawyers, politicians, government and even with patients. I see hospitals advocating unproven screening and treatment while advertising for business. There are patient advocacy groups often funded by hospitals and medical manufacturers, who also advocate the unproven and instill in patients that they need what may be unnecessary and can be harmful. American medicine is big business. It is about 18% of the U.S. economy and growing. The average cost of a health insurance policy for a family of four is $19,400 per year. The expense of our inefficient health care system is a major drain on the economy. It is a major reason why employers are hesitant to hire and a reason why many employers cannot provide health insurance to employees. We have what could be an extraordinary health care system and some patients do get extraordinary care. But patient stories show how our system is inefficient. Our system is focused on treating people after they get sick with relative inattention to promoting health and preventing disease. Such public health efforts have not received adequate support. The triad of obesity, lack of physical activity and high caloric intake (bad diet) is creating a tsunami of chronic disease. If the system persists as is, medical costs will grow dramatically over the next several decades as the number of patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and orthopedic injury dramatically grows. The current course is not sustainable. Medical costs will rise until the economy collapses. I know that the book will upset and anger some people, especially those who profit from medicine. I hope the book allows some reasonable people (both lay and medical professionals) to better understand what we are doing to our country. We all need to realize that some Americans are harmed by lack of treatment and others by overtreatment. The cold hard reality is America does not need to reform health care, we need to transform health care. The American health care system is fundamentally flawed and encourages inappropriate behavior and a subtle form of corruption. There truly is a combination of greed, ignorance and apathy within health care that is a cancer on this country. There is nothing wrong with medicine as a business, and nothing wrong with making an honest profit. However, in some cases, greed needs to be replaced with public interest, a concern for the national good. We need a greater commitment to the practice of evidence-based medicine. Some politicians choose to scare people with words like ""rationing medicine"" and ""death panels."" Truth be told, we all need to talk about defining the ""rational use of medicine."" A widespread demand for rational use of health care can lower costs and increase the number of people getting high quality care and save lives. Americans need to better understand the science of medicine and the scientific method, be true to science and support evidence-based medicine. We need to embrace an interest in public health and adopt preventive strategies. The most important question we can ask is, ""How can we provide all Americans with good high quality care to include preventive care?""

"(CNN) -- Many were surprised that he was even on the field at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, but when Cristiano Ronaldo left it he did so with the adoring chants of Real Madrid's fans ringing in his ears. Jose Mourinho had been expected to rest the Portugal star ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last-16 clash against his former club Manchester United due to fitness worries, but the 28-year-old shrugged off any concerns with a virtuoso display. He fired a hat-trick in the 4-1 win over Sevilla, and had a hand in the other goal, before being taken off with almost half an hour to play as the sounds of ""Ronaldo, Ronaldo"" resounded around the ground. It was a touching moment for the player, who has not always had the closest relationship with the Madridistas despite his phenomenal scoring record. He took his tally to 24 in La Liga this season -- behind only Lionel Messi's 34 -- and 36 in all competitions as he fired his 20th treble since joining Real from United for a world-record $130 million fee in 2009. Have your say on the Champions League with The CNN Football Club . Ronaldo's low cross gave Karim Benzema the easiest of his 50 La Liga goals as the ball ricocheted kindly off Sevilla's Fernando Navarro, then he fired in a superb left-foot effort from outside the box in the 26th minute to make it 2-0. Just 36 seconds after the halftime break, Ronaldo was at it again as he pounced on a error to score his 11th goal in nine games against Sevilla in all competitions. The 12th was worth the price of admission as he led a counter attack from his own penalty area, and slotted home a return pass from Gonzalo Higuain. The Argentine forward departed soon after Ronaldo did -- but it left Real a player short after he received a second yellow card. Midtable Sevilla also dropped to 10 men in the 80th minute as Dutch defender Hedwiges Maduro also picked up a second booking, but Manu del Moral still managed a late consolation goal. The result left Real four points behind second-placed city rivals Atletico and 13 adrift of Barcelona, who both play on Sunday. Meanwhile, Malaga stayed fourth with a 2-1 win at Levante thanks to two goals from 20-year-old midfield star Isco, while Valencia moved up to fifth with a 1-0 win at Celta Vigo as Paraguay striker Nelson Valdez netted three minutes into time added on. England . Manchester City's Premier League title defense is in tatters after Saturday's shock 3-1 defeat by promoted team Southampton. Leaders Manchester United can move 12 points clear of second-placed City with victory in Sunday's home match against Everton. City boss Roberto Mancini had been defiant after last weekend's 2-2 draw with Liverpool, but the Italian was more downbeat about his team's chances after dropping more points. ""I used to be always optimistic and want to be in this moment, but it's difficult. I think we now have 10% chance. I don't think United will drop 12 points,"" he told reporters . ""It was a really poor performance. Southampton were better than us. We conceded two goals which I didn't think a team like us could concede. We played this game with only two or three players. Three versus 11 was really difficult."" Gareth Barry gave away possession for Southampton's first goal by Jason Puncheon and also conceded an embarrassing own-goal soon after halftime to make it 3-1. Goalkeeper Joe Hart was at fault for Steven Davis' goal for 2-0, and Edin Dzeko's 12th in the league this season for City in the 39th minute did not signal the fightback it promised. It was Southampton's first win in four games since Mauricio Pochettino took over as manager, and lifted the team six points clear of the relegation zone. Chelsea won for the first time in five matches to retain third place, thrashing third-bottom Wigan 4-1 to ease the pressure on manager Rafael Benitez. Veteran midfielder Frank Lampard scored his 12th goal this season, moving closer to Bobby Tambling's club record total of 202, as the 34-year-old raised speculation that he will earn a new contract. ""It is not my decision. I am trying to improve him, if that is possible, because he is a great influence,"" Benitez said. Chelsea stayed a point ahead of fourth-placed Tottenham, whose winger Gareth Bale scored both goals in a 2-1 win at home to Newcastle to take his tally to 13 in the league. Arsenal moved above Everton into fifth with a 1-0 win at Sunderland as Santi Cazorla scored the only goal, while Swansea went above Liverpool in seventh after beating bottom team Queens Park Rangers 4-1 thanks to two goals from Michu, who now has 15 in the EPL this season. Italy . Juventus' hopes of a second successive Serie A title were boosted after second-placed Napoli dropped points against fellow Scudetto hopefuls Lazio. Juve won 2-0 at home to Fiorentina as strikers Marko Vucinic and Alessandro Matri scored in the first half -- the latter despite losing a boot and playing on in his sock. That put the pressure on Napoli to reduce a six-point deficit, but Walter Mazzarri's team needed an 87th-minute equalizer from defender Hugo Campagnaro to come away with any reward. Striker Sergio Floccari volleyed an 11th-minute opener, but Argentina international replied in kind at the end to keep his side six points clear of the third-placed Rome team. Germany . Bayern Munich marched towards a 23rd Bundesliga title on Saturday, moving 15 points clear in the title race after a 4-0 victory at home to Schalke. With two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund and third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropping points earlier in the day, Jupp Heynckes' team romped to victory against a Schalke side which had won just one out of nine games. Young Austrian star David Alaba scored twice, the opener from the penalty spot after Franck Ribery was fouled. Bastian Schweinsteiger made it 2-0 with a free-kick, then after the break Mario Gomez set up the 20-year-old Alaba and then wrapped up the win with his first goal of 2013 in his first start this year. Dortmund crashed 4-1 at home to Hamburg, with South Korea forward Son Heung-Min and Latvian Artjoms Rudnevs scored twice each as both teams had a man sent off. Robert Lewandowski put the home side ahead in front of a crowd of more than 80,000 but Rudnevs and Son netted before the Poland striker was sent off. Hamburg lost defender Jeffrey Bruma after halftime following his foul on Marco Reus, but . Rudnevs headed home on 62 and 20-year-old Son' netted at the end as Hamburg moved up to fifth. Leverkusen drew 3-3 at seventh-placed Borussia Monchengladbach, for whom Patrick Herrmann scored a late equalizer.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat-trick in Real Madrid's 4-1 victory at home to Sevilla .

"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN) -- Some residents were breathing sighs of relief Monday as the Red River receded, but an early-spring snowstorm that swept into the area prompted officials to warn the flood dangers weren't over. North Dakota National Guard members inspect a levee along the Red River near Fargo on Monday. With winds of 25 to 40 mph expected and as a much as a foot of new snow possible in some areas, North Dakota officials weren't ready to let down their guard. ""It's not over,"" Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said during a televised meeting of officials. ""We're still in a flood fight, so now you just have to be careful and watch things, and we'll monitor as we go along,"" Mahoney said. Still, he said, it's time to ""start thinking about what we'd do if we weren't fighting a flood,"" and that the city is ""going to start talking to different people to see when we can start getting things back online and get going."" The most intense portion of the snowstorm was expected to roll through southwest and south-central North Dakota, easing some concerns that it could cause more immediate flooding at the Red River to the east. At 8:15 p.m. Monday (9:15 p.m. ET), the Red River at Fargo was at 38.71 feet, more than 2 feet below Saturday's crest. The river was forecast to be below 38 feet on Tuesday and approach the 18-foot flood level by early next week. But officials warned the storm's wind would cause waves in the floodwater and put more pressure on the sandbag dikes along the river. And the National Weather Service warned of another rise in the river level in mid-April as temperatures begin to warm and melt the snow.   Watch how the storm could bring new problems » . The city planned to halt its sandbagging operation Monday. Bruce Grubb, Fargo's enterprise director, said 3.5 million sandbags have been filled. Officials emphasized the process could resume at any time, particularly in the face of the storm. In the meantime, National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Gust said, ""we are very confident now that [the] river is in a slow decline."" Two deaths and 50 injuries have been reported in flood-related incidents. The injuries included victims of car wrecks caused by flooded roads, epidemiologist Kirby Kruger said. Other problems, including mental health issues, carbon monoxide poisoning and cardiac-related events, were reported, Kruger said. Water seeped into two of five buildings at the Oak Grove Lutheran School primary and secondary complex after a flood barrier began to leak, officials said. School officials said the two buildings had about 6 inches of water in the basement. The school last flooded in 1997.  See how a levee can fail » . ""We knew this flood was going to be different,"" said school spokeswoman Ann Marie Campbell. ""There was a lot of emotion this morning when we got the word we had a breach."" A contingency dike contained the water, said Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker, but three houses between the contingency and primary dikes also flooded. iReport.com: Send your photos, video of flooding . Meanwhile, on the other side of the river, residents of Moorhead, Minnesota, were waiting to see if miles of levees and sandbags there would hold. ""We're all in this together -- so far, so good,"" said U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minnesota, at a Sunday news conference. ""Keep vigilant, keep checking the dikes."" Evacuations in Moorhead were proceeding smoothly, Mayor Mark Voxland said Sunday. No breaches of dikes were reported, he said. Mike Redlinger, Moorhead city manager, said the city was securing neighborhoods, particularly at night.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, fiscal deal maker? That's the latest incarnation of the congressman from Wisconsin, who has glided between his role as fiscal wonk to 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate to potential 2016 presidential candidate. Ryan was one-half of the bipartisan duo that unveiled a budget deal Tuesday evening that would set spending levels for the next two years -- just days before a deadline to settle the matter. ""This agreement makes sure that we don't have a government shutdown scenario in January. It makes sure we don't have another government shutdown scenario in October. It makes sure that we don't lurch from crisis to crisis,"" Ryan said. Budget deal aims to avert another shutdown . The compromise deal is significant in large part because agreement was reached -- not an easy feat amid deep partisan divides in Congress, where lawmakers have failed to reach a budget accord numerous times since 2011, including one instance that led to a 16-day government shutdown in October. Low profile . After being on the losing presidential ticket, Ryan kept a low profile. He even remained largely silent in October while Republicans and Democrats battled over a federal shutdown and how to move forward on a government funding bill. His reticence was more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise. He is known in Congress as the budget wonk, the expert on the federal government and spending. His colleagues look to him for guidance. In recent years, he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. His budgets, titled ""Path to Prosperity,"" became the defining documents for Republican fiscal policy. Silence shattered . Ryan slowly started to reinsert himself when his party was flailing during the government shutdown. He broke his months-long silence with an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in October, where he implored both sides to sit down at the negotiating table. Patty Murray emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal . After the government reopened, Ryan appeared to take his own advice. As head of the House Budget Committee, he led negotiations with his counterpart in the Senate to reach a government spending deal for the remainder of fiscal year 2014. While the budget did not address the benefit programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- that Ryan wants to reform, it did avert another government management crisis. With the announcement of this deal, Ryan has reemerged to be a central figure within the GOP. Now the more pressing question is: Will the GOP still follow him? The dilemma . As recently as last year, Ryan was considered a tried-and-true conservative. He was able to bridge the gap between the two dividing components within the GOP. He both won the praise of tea party supporters and had the ears of party leaders. That's because Ryan is a true conservative. Twenty years ago, he worked for the conservative organization Empower America, which later became FreedomWorks. Since then, the organization has successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited-government tea party-aligned group. But his support might not be in lockstep. FreedomWorks sent an advisory to Republican lawmakers Tuesday urging them to vote against Ryan's deal. And many Republican members have already panned the deal. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, said he would not vote for it because it ""raises spending. There's no way around it."" The budget deal in plain English . ""I don't know how a deal is good for conservatives or for America if the spending is going to go up,"" Huelskamp said on CNN's ""Crossfire."" Republican strategist and former Mitt Romney spokesman Ryan Williams has said that Ryan's October op-ed shows that he's ""the adult in the room."" ""He felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we're witnessing in Washington,"" Williams added. 2016 ambitions? While speculation only grew louder that Ryan would run for the Republican presidential nomination, with trips in recent months to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first presidential nominating states, a high-profile role in Congress -- especially as a deal maker -- could be both a political risk and benefit. It will depend on the mood of the country and the influence of the Republican right. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","U.S. Rep.

"(CNN) -- An Alabama man pleaded guilty Friday to poisoning oak trees that drew generations of Auburn University football fans celebrating victories, officials said. Harvey Updyke will serve at least six months of a three-year sentence for criminal damage to an agricultural facility, a felony, Lee County District Attorney Robbie Treese said in a statement. The plea brings to an end the criminal proceedings in an act in 2010 that outraged Auburn fans and others upset that the trees at Toomer's Corner were poisoned. Upon release, Updyke will be under five years of supervised probation, which includes a 7 p.m. curfew, a ban on attending any collegiate event and a ban on stepping on Auburn University property. Updyke, who is in his mid-60s, also will be assessed restitution, Treese said. ""Whether or not Mr. Updyke can manage to stay on probation is entirely up to him,"" the prosecutor said in a statement. ""Despite the destruction he has caused, no one is capable of diminishing the spirit of our community."" Auburn police two years ago arrested Updyke for allegedly dousing the landmark trees on the edge of the Auburn campus with herbicide so potent that agronomists said they had little to no chance of survival. Authorities first learned of the herbicide after a caller who identified himself as ""Al from Dadeville"" phoned into a Birmingham, Alabama, radio talk show, saying he had poisoned the renowned oaks after Auburn won a contentious November 2010 football game against the University of Alabama. ""Al"" ended the call with ""Roll Damn Tide,"" a battle cry for the University of Alabama. Fans typically gathered around the trees after wins, draping them with toilet paper. According to reports, Auburn last month announced the historic trees could not be saved. Treese said the plea will allow his office to tend to violent felonies and save the county extensive costs associated with a trial. ""I could not in good conscience justify financing a three-week trial merely to arrive at no better a resolution.""","Harvey Updyke pleads guilty .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik, the man who killed 77 people in a bomb attack and gun rampage just over a year ago, was judged to be sane by a Norwegian court Friday, as he was sentenced to 21 years in prison. Breivik was charged with voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the attacks in Oslo and on Utoya Island on July 22, 2011. The issue of Breivik's sanity, on which mental health experts have given conflicting opinions, was central to the court's ruling. Breivik, who boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, wanted to be ruled sane so that his actions wouldn't be dismissed as those of a lunatic. He says he acted out of ""necessity"" to prevent the ""Islamization"" of his country. But prosecutors had asked that Breivik, 33, be acquitted on the grounds of insanity, in which case he would have been held in a secure mental health unit. Suspected Breivik sympathizer arrested, arms seized . The unanimous verdict was delivered at Oslo district court by a panel of five judges. Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and tie, had a slight smile on his face as the decision was given. He was sentenced to the maximum possible term of 21 years and was ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years in prison. The sentence could be extended, potentially indefinitely, in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society. Norway does not have the death penalty. Breivik has said he won't appeal the verdict. The chief prosecutor also confirmed Friday that the prosecution does not intend to lodge an appeal. Bjorn Ihler, a survivor of the Utoya Island attack, told CNN he was glad the trial had concluded and that justice had been done. ""It's been an amazingly difficult process. It's been a constant, constant reminder of why we have to fight extremism in every way possible,"" he said of the trial. ""We have to make sure nothing like this ever happens again."" The court's judgment that Breivik is sane means that the far-right views he espouses can be confronted in Norway without being dismissed as those of a madman, Ihler said. ""There are extremist people around, they are not insane, and we have to be able to take a proper debate with them,"" he said. Asked whether the verdict meant closure for him, Ihler said: ""This case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life probably."" Send us your reaction to the verdict . Reading out the court's ruling, Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen spoke of Breivik's ""manifesto,"" a document published online in which he set out his ultranationalist political views. Breivik claimed to belong to a far-right group called the Knights Templar but the court found no evidence of its existence, the judge said. He described his actions as a pre-emptive attack in defense of ethnic Norwegian people and culture, the court heard. Breivik trained for his attack by working out in the gym, running with a backpack filled with rocks and practicing at a shooting club, the court heard. He was under the influence of ephedrine, a stimulant, at the time of the attacks, and the possibility that this contributed to his behavior cannot be ruled out, Judge Arne Lyng said. He used meditation techniques to cut off his emotions, Lyng said. In the course of the 10-week trial, which wrapped up in June, the court heard chilling evidence from some of those who survived Breivik's shooting spree on Utoya Island, in which 69 people died -- most of them teenagers attending a Labour Party summer youth camp. Opinion: Does the internet breed killers? In his own testimony, given without emotion, Breivik recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and couldn't escape, killing those who tried to ""play dead"" and driving others into the sea to drown. His fertilizer bomb attack against government buildings in Oslo also killed eight people and injured many more. It was only luck that more people were not killed and hurt in the blast, the court heard. Breivik blames politicians, and the Labour Party in particular, for promoting multiculturalism in Norway. He has been held in a ""particularly high security"" wing of Ila Prison since his detention immediately after the killings. The prison's governor, Knut Bjarkeid, said Wednesday that the institution was ready to hold Breivik securely whether the court ruled him sane or not. ""Our job is to protect the community,"" Bjarkeid said. Over the past year, Breivik has had three cells for his use, one for physical exercise and another for reading and writing, as well as a separate outdoor exercise space, he said. Breivik cannot mix with prisoners from other wings, but does have contact with prison staff. Norway attacks and multiculturalism . ""As of now, we think there is a need to subject Mr. Behring Breivik to a particularly high security regime,"" Bjarkeid said. The high security regime ""puts a heavy strain on an inmate, especially if it lasts for a longer period,"" he added, so Breivik's continued detention under these conditions will be kept under constant review. Defense lawyer Geir Lippestad has previously said it is important to Breivik that people see him as sane so they don't dismiss his views. The court had to consider conflicting opinions from medical experts in reaching its verdict. An initial team of psychiatrists found Breivik to be paranoid and schizophrenic, following 36 hours of interviews. However, a second pair of experts found he was not psychotic at the time of the attacks, does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged. Their report said there is a ""high risk for repeated violent actions."" Mark Stephens, a partner at law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, told CNN Friday: ""The general public will think only a madman can commit these offenses, but in law madness is defined very narrowly. Basically it requires a doctor to come to court and say this person has a definable medical illness -- in this case the prosecution said he was a paranoid schizophrenic, and that can be treated with drugs and behavioral therapy. ""If, however, he had a personality disorder or was just ... motivated, as in this case, by a misguided political belief that this was the only way to stop the Islamization, as he would have it, of his nation, then in those circumstances he has be found guilty because he understood what he was doing was wrong."" Disturbing look into mind of Norway shooter . Breivik's rampage, the worst atrocity on Norwegian soil since World War II, prompted much soul-searching. Norwegians reasserted their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes held in the immediate aftermath of the massacre. And earlier this month, Norway's chief of police stepped down after an independent commission detailed a catalog of police and intelligence failures. It concluded that those errors cost police 30 minutes in getting to Utoya, and that dozens of lives might have been saved. Speaking last month on the anniversary of the killings, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg urged Norwegians to ""honor the dead by celebrating life,"" and said Breivik had failed in his attempt to change Norway's values. CNN's Diana Magnay and Per Nyberg reported from Oslo and Laura Smith-Spark from London.","NEW: Anders Breivik does not intend to appeal the verdict; prosecution also won't appeal .

"(CNN) -- Safety in a free, democratic society can't rely solely on armed security agents or gun laws. Laws require the consent of those who are governed by them, and the police cannot be everywhere all the time. Like it or not, our safety is based on what John Locke referred to as the social contract. This contract carries the implicit understanding that in exchange for living with order and safety, we give up some degree of freedom. That ""freedom,"" if we want to call it that, is the tacit agreement not to act on impulses that might lead to us harm others. For the most part it works. We usually go about our lives without worrying if we will be attacked walking the streets, shopping, watching a movie or going to school. The shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, serves as pointed reminder that our social contract is breaking down. That is because the most recent shooting was not an isolated incident. In December, an armed assailant killed two people before killing himself at a shopping mall in Portland, Oregon. In July, a gunman slaughtered 12 people in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. The list goes on and on. Given the frequency of these attacks it is clear they can longer be treated as aberrations or simply explained away as actions by deranged man who had easy access to weapons. Of course, part of that is true. In each case, mentally ill men with easy access to semi-automatic assault rifles devised ways to take innocent lives. That is why those who think that we can solve this problem through additional security and gun control alone are fooling themselves. Who knows when or where the next mentally ill killer will plot an attack? We live in a violent society with far too many guns, far too much anger and way too much alienation. The real problem is that the social contract is fraying. The bonds that should prevent individuals from harming one another have deteriorated. If all we do to seek solutions to the threat of violence is enact increased security measures, we continue to ignore the real source of our security -- civic solidarity. As we become more atomized as a society, as alienation grows, as the social bonds that give our lives meaning -- family, community and religion -- weaken and wane, we find ourselves at greater risk. Each of the assailants in these mass shootings was described as a loner. This is important to consider because human beings are inherently social beings. People need people to survive. We need contact with others to sustain ourselves and to remind us of what it means to be human. Schools are in some ways the most important social institutions in our society. Unlike families, social clubs and churches, which also play important roles in socializing us, public schools accept all children, regardless of background or need. Our schools teach our children how to be members of society, and while some of what is learned may be problematic, schools nonetheless play a vital role in a society as diverse and complex as ours. That is why when our schools are attacked and when the safety of children can no longer be taken for granted, it is devastating to the social trust that is essential to hold our society together. Some may react to the shootings at Newtown by calling for more security. Others may feel safer by homeschooling their children in the hope that this will shield them from harm. Unfortunately, the answer will not be found in either strategy. Instead, we must find ways to strengthen our bonds, to increase our connections to each other, to embrace the alienated and to care for the mentally ill. Our schools must lead the way in carrying out this work, just as they did more than a century ago when we struggled to integrate millions of new immigrants from Europe. We turned to our schools when our society finally came to the realization that legalized apartheid was morally reprehensible and had to cease. We must turn to our schools once again as we seek to find a way to restore and revitalize the bonds that protect us and should hold us together. There is safety in numbers. Not in mobs but in community, in solidarity and in affirming our dependence on one another. The president and Congress must act now to restrict access to guns, especially assault weapons, but each of us must also exercise leadership where we live and work to increase to strength our communities and rebuild bonds that hold us together. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Pedro Noguera.","Pedro Noguera says public safety can't rely on gun laws and police presence alone .

"(CNN) -- Thirty minutes into the movie ""Miami Connection"" the audience sees a classic '80s montage scene, except there's something a bit off. The film's heroes, a group of five University of Central Florida students who are martial-arts experts (and orphans), hit up the beach for some much needed fun in the sun. (They're in a band called Dragon Sound, which serves as a vehicle for their tae kwon do-inspired songs). As the band members drive along the shore, they catcall out to women with painful lines such as ""they don't make buns like those down at the bakery,"" trying to pick them up using phony French accents. The dialogue hardly matches up with the characters' mouth movements, and the scene ends with two characters making out in the tide, waves crashing down around them. In the context of the film, nothing about this scene really drives the plot, furthers the character development or makes much sense at all. Which is exactly why some fans consider it great. But the term ""great"" is relative. Originally made in 1987, ""Miami Connection"" was rediscovered in June 2009 when Zack Carlson, a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, came across it on eBay and made a blind bid on it. He won it for a mere $50, having no idea he was the first step in the film's unlikely comeback. ""We played a reel in the (Alamo Drafthouse), and the few people that were in the theater went bananas,"" Carlson said. ""We instantly scheduled the movie to play during our weekly exploitation series."" Though it's not always easy to figure out what exactly is going on in ""Miami Connection,"" the story follows members of Dragon Sound as they find themselves mixed up with a group of ninjas linked to the bubbling cocaine trade out of Miami. It stars Grandmaster Y.K. Kim, a central Florida martial-arts expert, who was pitched the idea of a feature-length film after director Richard Park saw him in the mid-'80s on the South Korean talk show ""Meet at 11 p.m."" Most of the actors and crew were Kim's tae kwon do students. With the assistance of funding from Kim and some investors, ""Miami Connection"" was filmed in Orlando and Miami. Kim said he had high hopes that his creative work would find a distributor and explode onto the national scene. ""When I finished the movie, I showed this to hundreds of different studios and distribution companies,"" Kim said. ""They all said, 'This is trash. Don't waste your time.' "" Still, Kim pressed on. The film opened in September 1988, limited to eight theaters in the Orlando area. He continued trying to get major distributors for a national release and even tried to rally Hollywood bigwigs at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. But the film bombed, and Kim saw his endeavor slip into obscurity (along with the roughly $1 million it cost to make). When Carlson got a hold of it, enough time had passed so that it was received as something wholly different. He screened it around Austin and noticed a huge, positive response. Moviegoers ate up the bad dialogue, laughed at the bad special effects and staged ninja fights, and reveled in a heavy dose of '80s cheese. Carlson pushed the film to Evan Husney, creative director for the Alamo Drafthouse's distribution arm, Drafthouse Films. In December, Husney called Kim and told him he wanted to rerelease the movie. Thinking it was some sort of cruel joke, Kim hung up several times. Husney courted him for months before the deal to resurrect ""Miami Connection"" was made. Now, decades later, thanks in part to the current love of irony and an enduring fascination with all things '80s, the film is enjoying an impressive victory lap. It screened at the New York Asian Film Festival in July and Los Angeles' Everything Is Festival in August, where the reaction was largely the same as Carlson witnessed when he first discovered it. ""What I'd like to think is that people really get enthusiastic about the sincerity in the movie,"" Carlson said. ""They initially get pulled in by the irony, the '80s fashion, but what's underneath it is very entertaining. People respond to many different things, but they start to like the characters."" ""Miami Connection"" is seeing the national rollout in theaters that Kim had always hoped would happen. DVDs, Blu-rays and soundtracks are available -- even vinyl singles for those wanting to keep things fittingly retro. Kim is going to a handful of showings and providing a martial-arts demonstration for moviegoers. The experience has taught Carlson that ""bad movies that people respond to aren't actually bad."" ""There's a sincerity within them that people latch onto,"" he said. ""There's not a lot of technique or talent behind 'Miami Connection.'

"(CNN) -- U.S. presidents should not be sworn into office with their hand on a Bible. At Monday's inauguration of his second term, President Barack Obama will raise his right hand and place his left on not one, but two Bibles: One owned by Abraham Lincoln and the other by Martin Luther King Jr. The Constitution requires he give this oath of office: ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."" You might recall that at his 2009 inauguration, President-elect Obama and Chief Justice John Roberts played some kind of ""mad libs"" with this oath during the swearing-in ceremony, muddling it so badly that they had to redo it a few days later.But why does the president swear on a Bible? Why doesn't he place his hand on the U.S. Constitution -- the very document he's promising to ""preserve, protect and defend""? Opinion: Learning from Lincoln, Wilson, FDR . The Constitution does not require that the president take the oath of office by swearing on a Bible. That would have been a very simple requirement for the constitutional drafters to include. To the contrary, the Founders wanted to ensure that Americans of any faith -- or no faith -- could hold federal office. They set it forth plainly in Article VI: ""... No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."" Placing a hand on a Bible while reciting the presidential oath is simply a tradition started by George Washington. Indeed, two presidents, Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams, did not use a Bible at their swearing-in ceremonies. Although Roosevelt's reasons are unclear, John Quincy Adams' reasons could not be more plain. Adams, the son of President John Adams, was a religious man. But he chose to be sworn in with his hand on a book of U.S. laws. He wanted to demonstrate that he recognized a barrier between church and state and that his loyalty was to our nation's laws above all else. Adams also refused to campaign for the presidency because he believed it was beneath the dignity of the office to make promises that might not be kept. Clearly, Adams was not a man who acted because of tradition alone. He had to truly believe in what he did. Opinion: Why 'Hail to the Chief' remains unsung . Some will argue that swearing on the Bible ensures the president adheres to his oath. But let's be honest: We have seen presidents and other elected officials swear to uphold the laws of our country with their hands on a Bible and go on to break many laws and ethical rules. It comes down to the person's moral code, not a 30-second oath. And just so it's clear, my objection is not only to the Bible. I would hold the identical view if it were the Quran, the Book of Mormon or any other religious scripture. The Founding Fathers made it clear that the U.S. Constitution, ""...shall be the supreme law of the land."" It is the living legacy they bestowed upon us. It is the framework for our government. And as such, that's the document our president should place his hand on. It should be clear to all that the president views the Constitution as our nation's genesis.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama once believed marriage was only between a man and a woman. He then backed civil unions for gay and lesbian couples, granting them many of the same rights and privileges as married heterosexuals. Now he firmly supports a constitutional right that has put him at odds with many social conservatives. It is a personal and political evolution that in many ways reflects the country as a whole. Shifting public opinion and old fights over judicial power are at the nexus of perhaps the most important social issue the high court has addressed in recent years: same-sex marriage. There about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples in the United States. Many thousands more seek the same thing. But it may be 10 people who have the power to force immediate, real change on this legal, political, and social issue: the nine justices and Obama himself. How U.S. political leaders and the Supreme Court act in coming months could set the template for years on a contentious topic that shows no sign of cooling. ""The argument that the Obama administration has made is the Supreme Court should look at these laws very carefully because gays and lesbians are a group that have been subject to discrimination in the past and will be subject to discrimination going forward,"" said Amy Howe, a legal analyst and editor of SCOTUSblog.com. Kevin has a family: A same-sex couple's remarkable journey . ""So the Supreme Court would need to subject these laws to what we call a very stringent standard of review"" balancing the government's justification for enacting them, she added. Two separate appeals to be argued Tuesday and Wednesday will once again put the high court at center stage, a contentious encore to its summer ruling upholding the health care reform law championed by Obama. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, including Washington, Maryland, Maine, Iowa, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York. Another nine have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws. The high court will consider two appeals. The first involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA is a 1996 law that defines marriage between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, family medical leave protections, and other provisions do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. Edie Windsor, an 84-year-old New York woman, is the key plaintiff. She was forced to pay more than $363,000 in extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse, Thea Spyer, died. The second case involves California's Proposition 8, a 2008 referendum that abolished same-sex marriage after the state's highest court ruled it legal. Gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court battle . The Supreme Court is being asked to establish same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, but could also decide a more narrower question: Whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized. Running for the Illinois state senate in 1998, Obama said he was ""undecided"" about whether to legalize same-sex marriage. Fast-forward six years to when he ran for U.S. Senate. He then declared a belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. The stance began an internal process over time that was by his admission, anything but smooth. ""My feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this,"" he said in 2010, two years into his presidency. ""At this point, what I've said is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have,"" Obama said at the time. Eight such states have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws-- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, and Rhode Island. But it is the California case that really has drawn the Obama administration into the fight. Obama signaled earlier this month he was prepared to assert a vigorous constitutional right to marriage, but confine it for now only to the Proposition 8 matter and perhaps to the seven other states with civil union laws like California's. The Justice Department argues civil union and domestic partnership laws may themselves be unconstitutional and that those states should go all the way and grant same-sex couples full marriage rights. It's called the eight-state strategy. ""The object of California's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same-sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple. But Proposition 8, by depriving same-sex couples of the right to marry, denies them the dignity, respect, and stature accorded similarly situated opposite-sex couples under state law,"" the Justice Department said in its brief on the case. Gay rights groups had privately urged Obama and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right, and come down ""on the side of history"" in this legal struggle. This was all set in motion in the heat of the president's re-election campaign in what government sources described as a quickly arranged political strategy. Married same-sex couple awaits epic appeal . ""At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" Obama told ABC News. Perhaps bowing to political caution in an election year, Obama explained he ""hesitated on gay marriage"" partly because he thought civil unions ""would be sufficient."" ""I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, the word marriage was something that invokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs,"" he said. A new national survey indicates a small majority of Americans backs such marriages but there are generational and partisan divides as well as a gender gap. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, 53 percent of the public think marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be legally recognized as valid, with 44 percent opposed. ""There are big differences among younger and older Americans, with the youngest age group twice as likely than senior citizens to support same-sex marriage,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Women are also more likely to call for legal recognition of gay marriage than men. And only three in ten Americans who attend religious services every week support same-sex marriage while six in ten Americans who don't attend church weekly feel that way."" Former President Bill Clinton, who signed the marriage law into effect 17 years ago, said this month he now backs the right of homosexuals to marry. So, too, does his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. But others on the right say society benefits from preserving a view of marriage that has been in place for centuries. The authors of a new book, ""What is Marriage? Man and Woman: A Defense,"" say, ""Redefining marriage would, by further eroding its central norms, weaken an institution that has already been battered by widespread divorce, out-of-wedlock child bearing and the like."" Academics Robert George, Sherif Girgis, and Ryan Anderson say marriage should be more than ""commitment based on emotional companionship,"" and has been practiced for a specific reason throughout this country's history. ""All human beings are equal in dignity and should be equal before the law. But equality only forbids arbitrary distinctions,"" they argue. ""And there is nothing arbitrary about maximizing the chances that children will know the love of their biological parents in a committed and exclusive bond. A strong marriage culture serves children, families and society by encouraging the ideal of giving kids both a mom and a dad."" Line forms days ahead of Supreme Court same-sex argument . The DOMA and Prop 8 cases will test the delicate line over constitutional limits from both congressional, presidential, and judicial power. All nine justices will have an equal voice in both oral argument and an eventual ruling, but it may be one member of the court whose views may count most in the high-stakes quest for five votes. Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the landmark 1996 Romer v. Evans ruling, striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment that forbid local communities from passing laws banning discrimination against gays. The moderate-conservative wrote for the 6-3 majority, rejecting the state's argument the law only blocked gay people from receiving preferential treatment or ""special rights."" In dissent Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the court for placing what he said was ""the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias."" In 2003, Kennedy authored the court's decision overturning state laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy. At the time though, he cautioned the court was not endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage, saying the private conduct case at hand ""does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter."" That caution was further articulated this month by Kennedy, when he said some issues are best left to the other branches. ""I think it's a serious problem. A democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say,"" Kennedy said. By patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same-sex marriage over the past decade, the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on tricky constitutional questions. Or not. The split 5-4 conservative-liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly-- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years, building political momentum and public confidence in the process. The Prop 8 case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144). The DOMA case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307).

"Washington (CNN) -- Tensions between the United States and Russia over the crisis in Crimea have exploded into an open row as Russia rejects U.S. diplomatic efforts to solve the impasse. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry postponed a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss American proposals, which Moscow has effectively rejected, on solving the crisis. The meeting, which Russia said was supposed to happen Monday, would have marked the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russian troops took up positions in Crimea, and would have come ahead of Sunday's potentially explosive vote on whether Crimea should split from Ukraine and join Russia. But Kerry told Lavrov he needed to know Moscow would engage seriously on a diplomatic solution before meeting with the Russian leader. He also wanted to see and end to Russia's ""provocative steps"" before traveling to Russia. Relations between Russia and the West have grown increasingly tense since Russian soldiers seized effective control of the pro-Russian region. The United States and other European powers have threatened possible sanctions in response to Russia's moves, but Moscow has shown little sign of backing down. A senior U.S. official said a proposal, which Kerry presented to Lavrov in Paris on Wednesday, summarized several rounds of talks Kerry and his counterparts from Britain, France and Germany held separately with Lavrov and Ukraine's foreign minister. Because Lavrov was not authorized to negotiate in Paris, Kerry gave him the list of ideas to take back to Putin. According to the senior U.S. official, the Kerry proposal calls for Russian troops to return to their barracks and for the disarming of so-called ""self-defense"" militias in Crimea who, although they don't wear insignia, are believed to be Russian. International monitors would be dispatched to Crimea and other parts of Ukraine as part of the proposed plan. Washington also insisted Moscow drop plans in the Duma to annex Crimea and end its support for next Sunday's referendum by Crimeans to join Russia. The U.S. also wants Russia to support a deal between the new Ukrainian government and the International Monetary Fund on a program to shore up the country's fragile economy. The plan hinges on talks between Russia and Ukraine on ending the crisis. Kerry and the British, French and German foreign ministers spent the better part of Wednesday trying unsuccessfully to get Lavrov to meet with Ukraine's foreign minister, who flew on Kerry's plane from Paris to Kiev. Russian lawmakers to debate bill on Crimea joining nation . Because Russia does not recognize the new Ukrainian government, Lavrov was reluctant to sit down with the foreign minister for direct talks. U.S. and its European allies have proposed the two sides could talk as part of a ""contact group"" which also includes the U.S., Britain, France and Germany . The Kerry plan also integrated some elements of the February 21 deal to end the standoff between protestors in Kiev and former President Viktor Yanukovich. Even though Moscow never joined Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom in signing the pact, it had some concessions to Russia, including a national unity government, a return to the constitution and early elections. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama and President Putin spoke by phone and agreed that Kerry and Lavrov will continue talking to try and find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Later that day, Lavrov called Kerry and invited him to Sochi for a meeting with Putin on Monday. Kerry said he would think about it, but that disturbing developments on the ground in Ukraine and Crimea were closing the space for diplomacy. When they spoke again on Saturday, Kerry told Lavrov he wasn't ready to meet with Putin. The two of them needed to make more progress on their own talks, Kerry said. Furthermore, Kerry said Russian military moves on the ground and discussions about the referendum in Crimea and the Duma's plans to annex the region would make negotiations difficult. Kerry sent a refined proposal to Lavrov after that Saturday phone call, described as a list of questions to get a better understanding of the Russian position. Lavrov traveled to Sochi on Sunday to discuss the one-and-a-half page document with Putin. The official said that the U.S. government has yet to receive an official answer from Moscow about the ideas. But Russia seems uninterested in the U.S. concept of sitting down with the Ukrainian government. In a televised meeting with Putin Monday, Lavrov said even Kerry's revised proposal still fell short and ""raises many questions on our side"" because the starting point is acceptance of the ""coup d'Ã©tat"" that overthrew Yanukovich. ""The document contains an approach which doesn't quite suit us, as the entire wording suggests there is a conflict between Russia and Ukraine,"" Lavrov said, adding that Russia would be submitting counterproposals to the American plan. ""We prepared, together with members of the Russian Security Council, our counterproposals. They aim to resolve the situation on the basis of international law and take into account the interests of all Ukrainians without exception,"" he said. The Obama administration seems reluctant for Kerry to travel to Russia for a meeting with Putin that could deliver very little. Kerry is prepared to take part in talks ""if and when we see concrete evidence that Russia is prepared to engage"" with Washington's proposals, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, adding that Russia must engage in talks with the Ukrainians. ""The point is we're not just going to walk into something, where they're just going to say `no, no, no' to everything and we've traveled all the way there. We're not going to do that,"" another senior U.S. official added. The White House said President Obama would meet Ukraine's new prime minister in Washington on Wednesday, warning Moscow would face even more outside pressure if it took any further steps toward annexing Crimea. Opinion: Russia is playing a weak hand very strongly .","Kerry postpones a meeting with Putin, says Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov .

"(CNN) -- Chances are if you bought your favorite coffee in a paper cup this morning, that cup cannot be recycled. 50 billion cups in the U.S. end up in landfills every year -- enough that if placed end to end, they would go to the moon and back roughly five times. British inventor Martin Myerscough was puzzled by this and has now come up with an alternative to make the recycling process easier. Most paper cups are made from cardboard with a thin layer of plastic tightly attached on to the cup. This keeps the drink warm and prevents the cardboard from becoming soggy. But it also makes the cup non-recyclable -- which comes as a surprise to many. A 2011 report by the UK-based consumer group Which? found that 8 in 10 people in the UK thought paper coffee cups could already be disposed of in paper recycling bins. The campaign group is now urging retailers to provide clearer information about recycling. Myerscough's Green Your Cup is different. ""We went back a step, what we'll do is make the cup out of cardboard, without any plastic on it and we'll put a plastic liner in it afterwards,"" he said. This way the plastic lining can then be easily separated in a recycling plant -- the liner gets stuck in the filters, while the cardboard goes through and can be recycled and used up to further seven times as newspapers. Myerscough said there will be no difference to the consumer. ""It will taste the same, it will look the same, you can put your lips to it the same. Instead of putting it in the general waste you put this in the recycling - that's it,"" he said. His company is now in talks with coffee shop chains and existing cup makers, in the hope the technology is adopted: ""It'll take us till next year to get going properly. So the idea is to license the technology to existing cup makers, they can use part of their existing machines and buy our machine and bolt it on as well."" Environment campaigners are praising the idea. ""This goes to the heart of sustainable business practice and gives us all the chance to make better choices when we buy our favorite drink,"" Rainforest Alliance's Stuart Singleton-White said.","50 billion paper cups end in U.S. landfills every year because they can't be recycled .

"(CNN) -- Walt Disney World is expensive. No two ways about it. Thirty years ago, when I was a kid, you could get into the Magic Kingdom for just $18. Now, tickets cost $99 and up. But if you want to take the plunge, you might find that a few splurges are worth it. If you can splurge a bit on the luxury details, you'll get the luxury benefits, which can really pay off. To Disney or not to Disney? Check in, stay in . It's long been the advice of every Disney travel guru on the planet that staying at a Disney World property improves your trip a thousand-fold. You get early access to the parks and easy transportation there, plus you're eating and breathing Disney 24/7, that wraparound experience that really makes it feel like vacation. Wanna go the extra step? Check out Disney World's newest on-site hotel, the Four Seasons Orlando. Opened in August, the gorgeous property blends Four Seasons luxury style and service with Disney fun. Rooms start at $545, pricey but only a small jump from other luxury Disney properties, and you're getting a much fancier room and hotel. Plus, the Four Seasons hotel has arguably the coolest swimming pool complex in the resort. Forget paying extra for the water parks. As a guest of the Four Seasons, you can take full, and free, advantage of a family pool, a castle-like kiddie pool with shooting jets of water and other surprises, an 11,000-square-foot lazy river, two water slides and an adult pool. There's also a supervised kid's club open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a clubhouse, well-thought-out games and activities and almost more staff than kids. My 6-year-old tried out the kids' program and didn't want to leave. And it's free with your stay at the Four Seasons. Book a stay before December 19, and you get your third night free. Certain restrictions apply. The most insane new U.S. roller coasters . Take advantage of valet parking . Maybe you can't spring for the Four Seasons or another luxury Disney hotel. But that doesn't mean you can't sample some of their offerings. If you have a car, you can book a massage at the glorious Grand Floridian hotel (where room rates start at $488 per night) or maybe even a reservation for the resort's princess tea party. It costs $20 to park for the day with the valet, and then you get the treat you book, plus you can wander around the lush hotel property and enjoy its other wonders. Monorail, kids? For another window into Disney luxe experiences, you might try dining at Todd English's high-end bluezoo restaurant at the Dolphin Hotel and then check out the rest of the joint, which is near Hollywood Studios and Epcot (plus, Swan and Dolphin hotel restaurants will validate your parking, making that part free). World's top 25 amusement parks . Take a private VIP tour . The cost of Walt Disney World is even more exasperating when you realize you've paid all that money just to wait in line for rides. The always-improving FastPass+ system helps, allowing you to make reservations for up to three rides per day. But who wants to go on just three rides? Paying for a Disney World VIP tour gives you all kinds of perks: door-to-door transportation from your hotel, preferred seating during select entertainment options and parades, and most important, what amounts to unlimited FastPass+ entries onto rides. Want to go on Splash Mountain six times? In a row? At the height of the season? Well, you can do it with a VIP tour. The various Disney World VIP tour options start around $299 per person. But look at it this way: You could pay for theme park tickets for three days (i.e., $300-plus a person) to go on only nine FastPass+ rides (plus wait in interminable lines for whatever else you choose). Or for roughly the same amount of money, you could buy a ticket for just one day and, for instance, pay for the ""Ultimate Day of Thrills VIP Tour"" a group experience with a Disney VIP tour guide, lunch at a table-service restaurant included plus automatic FastPass+ admission to 11 of the most exhilarating rides across three Disney World parks. Universal Orlando also has great VIP tour offerings, starting around $229 per person. In addition to priority entrance to rides, my family enjoyed having a knowledgeable guide walking us through the park, showing my daughter exactly how to use her wand in Diagon Alley, for instance, or how we could meet the minions without going on the Despicable Me ride.

"(CNN) -- U.S. military forces conducted an operation Monday in Somalia against the Al-Shabaab network, Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Here is a Q&A that looks at the al Qaeda-linked militant group: . What is Al-Shabaab and what are its aims? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has struck abroad, too. It was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, as they gathered to watch a World Cup final soccer match. How big is it? The total size of the group is not clear. A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country. A U.N. report identifies one insurgent leader who is ""believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of them Kenyans. And it has links to other groups. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. Though Al-Shabaab's size may be in doubt, its potential for sowing terror is not. ""I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,"" said Gen. Carter Ham in 2011, when he was commander of the U.S. Africa Command. Al-Shabaab's origins . Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist organization, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between IAIA's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members (Al-Shabaab, which means ""the youth""), who were seeking to establish fundamental Islamic rule. That led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. ""Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,"" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab ""regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy"" and feared for his life. He was reported to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once-ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating ""between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. A report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January 2013, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January last year, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government Friday defended its handling of James Foley's case after the slain journalist's mother told CNN that officials suggested the family could be charged if they tried to raise money to free him. Saying everything possible had been done to bring the journalist home, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters officials worked very closely with Foley's family and with his employer, GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni. ""Any advice that this department or other departments give to the families about what they should do in these situations is based solely on what is best for returning their loved one home, period,"" Harf said during a sometimes testy exchange with reporters. ""Any accusation to the contrary is flatly wrong."" Foley was beheaded in a video made public by ISIS on August 19. ISIS -- the terror group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Prior to Foley's execution, his captors demanded 100 million euros ($132.5 million) in exchange for his release, according to GlobalPost. The U.S.-based online news agency never took the demand seriously because ransoms paid for other hostages held by ISIS were dramatically less, Balboni has said. Harf cited Balboni's statement regarding the ransom demand, while reiterating that under anti-terrorism laws in the United States it is illegal to negotiate with terrorists, such as ISIS. ""It's part of our job to help the family understand what our laws are about ... "" she said. ""But this department would never, and did not ever, intend to, nor do we think we ever did anything that we would consider threatening"" the family over a possible ransom. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters Friday: ""Let me just say that I am really taken aback -- surprised, I guess, is the word, by this comment with respect to the Foley family."" ""I can tell you that I am totally unaware and would not condone anybody that I know of within the State Department making such statements,"" Kerry told reporters in Turkey, where he was working to build a coalition to battle ISIS. Foley's execution was cited by President Barack Obama this week as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. Even so, Foley's mother, Diane, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that officials asked family members to ""not go to the media."" She said they were told the ""government would not exchange prisoners,"" or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son. ""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, she said in the interview that aired Thursday. ""It didn't seem to be in (U.S.) strategic interest, if you will."" She said she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by the way the government handled the case. Kerry said he had worked on the effort to free Foley when he was taken hostage in Libya in 2011. ""Everybody is heartbroken that we were not able to do it"" this time, he said. U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could."" Rice also pointed out that hundreds of U.S. personnel were involved in a rescue attempt in Syria to free Foley and others. Official: U.S. attempt to rescue Foley, others in Syria failed . ""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home."" Diane Foley told CNN the location of the hostages was known for more than a year, and the rescue operation came very late. James Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- It was the middle of the night, Oscar Pistorius says, and he thought an intruder was in the house. Not wearing his prosthetic legs, feeling vulnerable in the pitch dark and too scared to turn on the lights, the track star pulled his 9mm pistol from beneath his bed, moved toward the bathroom and fired into the door. It was only after he called to girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp -- whom he thought had been in bed beside him after a quiet evening -- that he realized something horrible might have happened, he told Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair in a statement read by his lawyer during his bond hearing Tuesday. Prosecutors dispute the version of events that Pistorius detailed in his statement. Pistorius says he broke down the locked bathroom door -- at one point in the statement saying he kicked the door in, at another saying he used a cricket bat to break it down -- then scooped up the mortally wounded Steenkamp and carried her downstairs after for help. ""I tried to render the assistance to Reeva that I could, but she died in my arms,"" he said in the statement. ""I am absolutely mortified by the events and the devastating loss of my beloved Reeva."" Pistorius' affidavit in alleged murder of girlfriend . While prosecutors and defense lawyers agree Pistorius shot Steenkamp, the track star denied intentionally killing her, in the statement read Tuesday. Prosecutors say they believe Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, picked up his gun and walked to the bathroom where Steenkamp, 29, had locked herself -- apparently after a heated argument -- and shot at her four times. Three of the bullets struck Steenkamp, who died soon after. Her funeral was Tuesday. Pistorius spent much of the hearing sobbing and heaving at the mention of his girlfriend's name, at one point forcing Nair to stop the proceedings to ask him to compose himself. His family stood nearby, huddling during breaks and appearing to pray. During parts of the hearing, Pistorius' brother placed his hand on the suspect's back. During Tuesday's hearing, Nair upgraded the charge against Pistorius to premeditated murder, saying he could not rule out the possibility that the track star planned Steenkamp's death. But Nair said he will consider downgrading the charge later. The allegation of premeditation makes it more difficult for Pistorius' attorneys to argue he should be released on bail pending trial. To win bail, the defense must argue that ""exceptional circumstances"" exist that would justify Pistorius' release. The session ended Tuesday afternoon with no decision on bail for Pistorius, 26. Prosecutors said they needed time to study the affidavits read in court before deciding how to proceed. Opinion: What my son taught me about Pistorius . In the statement read by his lawyer, Pistorius said he would not try to flee or influence any witnesses if he is allowed out on bail, and argued that his release wouldn't be a danger to public order. The hearing is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning. A tragic mistake? In his statement, Pistorius said Steenkamp came over February 13, opting for a quiet dinner in over a night out with friends. They wrapped up the night with a bit of television in bed for him, some yoga for her. She had brought him a Valentine's Day present to open the next day. After the couple had gone to bed, he said he got up in the early hours of February 14 to close the balcony door in his bedroom when he heard a sound in the bathroom. Pistorius said he'd been a victim of violence and burglary in the past, and realized with terror that contractors who worked at the house had left ladders outside. Fearing someone had entered the home through the open bathroom window, moving in the dark on the stumps of his amputated legs, Pistorius grabbed his pistol from under the bed and yelled at the intruder to get out. ""I fired shots at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to phone the police. She did not respond and I moved backwards out of the bathroom, keeping my eye on the bathroom entrance,"" Pistorius said in his statement. ""Everything was pitch-dark in the bedroom and I was still too scared to switch on a light."" ""When I reached the bed, I realized that Reeva was not in bed. That is when it dawned on me that it could have been Reeva who was in the toilet. I returned to the bathroom calling her name,"" he said. He said he threw open the balcony door and screamed for help, put on his prosthetic legs and tried to kick in the door to the separate room inside the bathroom containing the toilet. Then, he said, he picked up a cricket bat, smashing panels out of the door before finding a key and unlocking it. ""Reeva was slumped over but alive,"" he said. Pistorius said he called for help and was told to take her to the hospital himself. He carried her downstairs and tried to help but, but she died. ""I cannot bear to think of the suffering I have caused her and her family, knowing how much she was loved,"" he said. But he said he did not mean to kill her, and protested the charges against him. ""I fail to understand how I could be charged with murder, let alone premeditated murder because I had no intention to kill my girlfriend,"" Pistorius said in the statement. ""We were deeply in love and couldn't be happier,"" he said.""I loved her and I know she felt the same way."" A premeditated murder? Prosecutors, however, painted a different picture. They rejected Pistorius' claim that he mistook her for a burglar, saying it would make no sense for an intruder to hide behind a locked bathroom door. Instead, they say Pistorius armed himself, attached his prosthetic legs and walked 7 meters (23 feet) to shoot Steenkamp through a bathroom door after a heated argument. Defense attorney Barry Roux questioned the state's argument, asking how prosecutors would know Pistorius had put on his prosthetic legs and walked to the bathroom before shooting his girlfriend. Police were alerted to the shooting by neighbors, and residents had ""heard things earlier,"" police spokeswoman Denise Beukes said. Authorities said there had been ""previous incidents"" at the home, including ""allegations of a domestic nature,"" but did not provide details. Detectives are investigating the blood-stained cricket bat found in the home, Johannesburg's City Press newspaper reported. They are trying to determine whether it was used to attack Steenkamp, if she used the bat in self-defense, or if Pistorius used it to try to break down the bathroom door, the newspaper said. Final farewells for Steenkamp . As the drama in court unfolded, friends and family mourned Steenkamp at a private funeral in her hometown of Port Elizabeth. ""There's a space missing inside all the people she knew that can't be filled again,"" her brother Adam Steenkamp told reporters outside. Steenkamp was a law school graduate whose modeling career was on the rise. She landed the cover of FHM magazine and recently appeared on a reality TV show. On Sunday, South Africans heard Steenkamp's voice one last time after her death, when the national broadcaster aired a pre-recorded episode of the show. The model talked about her exit from ""Tropika Island of Treasure,"" on which local celebrities compete for prize money. ""I'm going to miss you all so much and I love you very, very much,"" she said, blowing a kiss to the camera. Case rivets fans . The case of the global sports hero known as the ""Blade Runner"" has riveted stunned fans around the world. As he walked into court in a blue shirt and gray suit, frenzied photographers snapped away, prompting the judge to demand they stop. The scene was a far cry from the packed stadiums that erupted in applause whenever the double-amputee competed against men with legs. On social media, sentiment appeared to mixed. ""Oscar Pistorius is telling us rubbish,"" one Twitter user posted. But others were more supportive after hearing Pistorius' story. ""I for some reason believe Pistorius after reading his affidavit!!,"" another person tweeted. Robyn Curnow reported from South Africa; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse also contributed to this report.","Oscar Pistorius paints a detailed picture of his version of his girlfriend's death .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Wednesday night that all the 33,000 additional U.S. forces he ordered to Afghanistan in December 2009 will be home within 15 months. In a nationally televised address from the East Room of the White House, Obama said 10,000 of the ""surge"" forces would withdraw by the end of this year, and the other 23,000 would leave Afghanistan by September 2012. U.S. troop levels . Calling the deployment of the surge ""one of the most difficult decisions that I've made as president,"" Obama said the military campaign was ""meeting our goals"" in Afghanistan and the drawdown would begin ""from a position of strength."" ""Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11,"" Obama said. ""Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than half of al Qaeda's leadership. And thanks to our intelligence professionals and special forces, we killed Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known. This was a victory for all who have served since 9/11."" At the same time, Obama said the Afghanistan drawdown and the simultaneous winding down of the war in Iraq would help the United States begin to refocus attention and resources on efforts to resolve economic and other problems and to unify a politically divided nation. ""America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home,"" the president said. The troop withdrawals from Afghanistan will begin next month, as Obama promised when he ordered the surge in a speech 18 months ago at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. After the departure of all the surge forces, the total U.S. military deployment in Afghanistan will be slightly fewer than 70,000 troops. Obama's time frame will give U.S. commanders another two ""fighting"" seasons with the bulk of U.S. forces still available for combat operations. It also will bring the surge troops home before the November 2012 election in which Obama will seek a second term. Initial reaction was varied, with outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates supporting Obama's decision while congressional leaders were divided between those who wanted a faster withdrawal and others calling for caution in leaving Afghanistan. ""It's important that we retain the flexibility necessary to reconsider troop levels and respond to changes in the security environment should circumstances on the ground warrant,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in a statement. ""It is my hope that the president will continue to listen to our commanders on the ground as we move forward. Congress will hold the administration accountable for ensuring that the pace and scope of the drawdown does not undermine the progress we've made thus far."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was more blunt, saying: ""This is not the 'modest' withdrawal that I and others had hoped for and advocated."" Democratic colleagues of Obama expressed support for starting the withdrawal but said more troops should be included and they should depart faster than the president announced. ""It has been the hope of many in Congress and across the country that the full drawdown of U.S. forces would happen sooner than the president laid out -- and we will continue to press for a better outcome,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement. Trepidation about what's next . Two candidates for the Republican presidential nomination to run against Obama next year expressed reservations about the withdrawal strategy, but differed in their reasoning. ""We all want our troops to come home as soon as possible, but we shouldn't adhere to an arbitrary timetable on the withdrawal"" from Afghanistan, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said in a statement. ""This decision should not be based on politics or economics."" In his own statement, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, who was Obama's ambassador to China until recently, called for shifting the Afghanistan mission to ""a focused counterterror effort which requires significantly fewer boots on the ground than the president discussed tonight."" ""We need a safe but rapid withdrawal, which encourages Afghans to assume responsibility, while leaving in place a strong counterintelligence and special forces effort proportionate to the threat,"" Huntsman said. What happens to ""civilian surge"" as troops return home? According to senior administration officials, the troop surge fulfilled a strategy to refocus the U.S. war effort from Iraq to Afghanistan. Due to the surge, the officials told reporters, the military mission in Afghanistan has made great progress toward its objectives of dismantling and defeating al Qaeda in the region while stabilizing the country to prevent it from again providing a safe haven for the planning of terrorist attacks on the United States. The killing of bin Laden in early May and the success in reversing Taliban momentum in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar enabled the beginning of a troop withdrawal that will culminate with handing over security responsibilities to Afghan forces in 2014, the senior administration officials said on condition of not being identified. In the speech, Obama announced that Chicago will host a NATO summit in May 2012 to review the Afghanistan mission and strategy going forward. Gates -- along with Afghan war commander Gen. David Petraeus -- had pushed for an initial drawdown of 3,000 to 5,000 troops this year, according to a congressional source. Gates also urged the president to withdraw support troops only -- not combat troops. Obama, however, ultimately decided to adopt the more aggressive withdrawal plan. The senior administration officials said Obama's withdrawal schedule fell within the range of options presented to him by Petraeus. The general has been nominated to become CIA director to succeed Leon Panetta, who will take over as defense secretary when Gates steps down at the end of the month. In a statement after Obama's speech, Gates said it was ""critical"" that U.S. forces continue to ""aggressively"" carry out the surge strategy of degrading the capability of the Taliban while bolstering Afghan security forces. ""I support the president's decision because it provides our commanders with enough resources, time and, perhaps most importantly, flexibility to bring the surge to a successful conclusion,"" Gates said, signaling Pentagon control in deciding which U.S. forces to withdraw. This week, Gates acknowledged that the president must take into account public opinion and congressional support for further military engagement. ""Sustainability here at home"" is an important consideration, Gates said, noting that people are ""tired of a decade of war."" CNNMoney: The cost war in Afghanistan . Public exhaustion with the conflict is reflected in recent public opinion polls. Nearly three-quarters of Americans support the United States pulling some or all of its forces from Afghanistan, according to a June 3-7 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. That figure jumped 10 points since May, likely as a result of the death of bin Laden, pollsters said. Republicans -- who have been the strongest supporters of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan -- are shifting their opinion on the conflict. In May, 47% of Republicans said they favored a partial or full withdrawal of American troops. That figure rose to 60% this month. The sharp divisions have been reflected in Congress, where Democrats and Republicans are increasingly split. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, called Tuesday for a ""substantial and responsible reduction"" in troop levels, arguing the war has become fiscally irresponsible and more resources need to be focused on domestic problems. The United States has spent roughly $443 billion on the war in Afghanistan, according to budget analysts. According to Travis Sharp, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, the troop reductions Obama announced would bring a savings of about $7 billion in fiscal year 2012. Until Wednesday, Obama had said publicly only that troops would begin coming home in July, and he recently indicated the initial number withdrawn would be ""significant."" Senior administration officials told CNN that planning for the announcement began in January, when the president summoned top members of his national security team into the Oval Office and tasked them with coming up with a plan for the drawdown. The calculations that went into the drawdown decision included the fact that ""remarkable"" and ""unexpected"" progress had been made degrading al-Qaeda's infrastructure in its bases in the tribal regions of Pakistan over the prior 18 months, one of the officials said. Additionally, the Taliban have been rolled back from their heartland regions in southern and southwestern Afghanistan, both in northern and southern Helmand Province and around the key city of Kandahar, which had been their de facto capital. This progress fulfilled the administration's pledge to reverse the momentum of the Taliban, which had been one of the key rationales for the surge. Another factor favoring the drawdown was the growth in Afghan army and police forces of 100,000 men in the past year, the officials said. The military progress has enabled some political progress, with Afghan security forces preparing this year to take over seven areas in Afghanistan that are home to some 20% of the population. Special forces operations against the Taliban ""middle management"" in Afghanistan have put significant pressure on them and have opened up more opportunities for ""reconciliation"" with the Taliban, the officials said. A White House official said the administration is ""not starry eyed"" about the prospects of discussions with the Taliban and does not anticipate anything like ""the Treaty of Versailles,"" which ended World War I. However, the official said, there are now between ""10 and 20 leads"" that the United States is aware of that may lead to substantive talks with the Taliban. The official said the leads are in the ""exploratory"" phase and that the United States has briefed Afghan President Hamid Karzai about them. The deployment of U.S. forces hasn't been popular with many Afghan leaders, who criticize the presence of the Americans in their country. It's a message that's not lost on Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan. ""When we hear ourselves being called occupiers and worse, our pride is offended, and we begin to lose our inspiration to carry on,"" Eikenberry said Sunday during a speech at Herat University in western Afghanistan. ""At the point your leaders believe that we are doing more harm than good, when we reach a point that we feel our soldiers and civilians are being asked to sacrifice without a just cause ... the American people will ask for our forces to come home.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Borrowed place, borrowed time. That was the mantra in Hong Kong as the clock ticked down to the British colony being handed back to China in 1997. And as the handover loomed, Hong Kongers were frantic to make money to get a passport before the communist mainland reclaimed the territory. They feared an end to the free-wheeling ways of capitalism where money brought power, prestige -- and if needed, an escape route. But there was a small, vocal minority who talked instead about the tail wagging the dog. Far from being subsumed by China's political system, Hong Kong would in fact lead it towards democracy. Why? Because, if this handover worked, it could lure a much bigger prize in the form of Taiwan. If democracy, prosperity and personal freedoms flourished in this territory, Taiwan could be induced to rejoin China after its seminal split in 1949. Opinion: Why Beijing is courting trouble . But events of the past week have been a watershed in Hong Kong's political development. The ultimate goal of universal suffrage -- one person, one vote -- has been subverted. Yes, there will be one person, one vote, but Beijing has said they want to control who Hong Kong's voters are allowed to vote for. China's leadership has made it crystal clear that any form of democracy will only come attached to very powerful Chinese characteristics. Hong Kong's first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, who stepped down early after massive protests against his leadership, this week called Beijing's move towards democracy ""real and substantive."" It's hard to see how. If anything, Beijing has slammed the door on a true democratic process, one that allows anyone to stand for election. Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians have said they will veto any proposal that doesn't allow for full suffrage, leaving the Special Administrative Region back at square one. Muted reaction . Yet Hong Kong has hardly exploded in anger or frustration. In fact the reaction has been almost muted. Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a protest group committed to true universal suffrage, had threatened a campaign of bringing business in downtown Hong Kong to a standstill if China didn't allow for a more democratic process. In June, it conducted an unofficial referendum on the issue. Nearly 800,000 people out of a population of seven million took part despite, or perhaps because of, repeated and sophisticated cyber-attacks and overt criticism from Beijing. But the strategy of trying to win concessions from Beijing failed. And in an extraordinary admission just after Beijing made its ruling on Sunday, a leader of the Occupy movement, Benny Tai, in an interview with Bloomberg, conceded support for their cause was sliding. ""The number of people joining us (for a long-planned sit-in protest) will not be as big as we expect, because of the very pragmatic thinking of Hong Kong people,"" he admitted. In many ways it comes back that same mindset in the run-up to the handover. Pragmatism wins over idealism. Before 1997, the pragmatists were doing what they could to have a Plan B -- a way of getting out of Hong Kong if they needed to -- or working hard to ingratiate themselves with Beijing. Game of 'chicken' Today they are apparently not prepared to take on Beijing in an eyeball-to-eyeball standoff. As David Zweig, a professor of political science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said, ""If this was a game of chicken, the mainland has said: 'we'll drive straight through this' and Occupy Central has pulled aside and replied, 'we aren't willing to destroy Hong Kong.'"" But it may not be over yet. Hong Kong street demonstrations have a habit of morphing into a general protest against a range of issues from politics to working conditions to environmental concerns. Economics remain a powerful driving force. If the economy starts to fade, if unemployment starts to rise, it can become a catalyst for a much broader range of protesters. And neither Beijing nor Hong Kong's leadership can ill-afford to ignore them.","Beijing recently said no to Hong Kong voting for its leaders without approval .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The Israeli military's firing of white phosphorus shells over densely populated areas during the Gaza offensive ""was indiscriminate and is evidence of war crimes,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report on Wednesday. Human Rights Watch says Israel used white phosphorus shells over populated areas in Gaza. ""In Gaza, the Israeli military didn't just use white phosphorus in open areas as a screen for its troops,"" said Fred Abrahams, a HRW senior emergencies researcher. ""It fired white phosphorus repeatedly over densely populated areas, even when its troops weren't in the area and safer smoke shells were available. As a result, civilians needlessly suffered and died."" Entitled ""Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza,"" the 71-page report provides ""witness accounts"" and ""presents ballistics evidence, photographs, and satellite imagery, as well as documents from the Israeli military and government."" HRW is an independent international organization dedicated to defending and protecting human rights. The group urged Israel and the United States to investigate the attacks. Israel should prosecute those who carried them out and the U.S. government, which supplied Israel, should look into the issue. HRW said white phosphorous was a chemical substance dispersed in artillery shells, bombs and rockets, used primarily to obscure military operations. ""(While) it is not considered a chemical weapon and is not banned per se, it ignites and burns on contact with oxygen and creates a smokescreen at night or during the day to mask the visual movement of troops. ""It also interferes with infra-red optics and weapon-tracking systems, thus protecting military forces from guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles. When WP comes into contact with people or objects, though, it creates an intense and persistent burn. It can also be used as a weapon against military targets,"" the group said. In response, the Israeli military said ""smoke shells are not an incendiary weapon"" and defended its actions. The Israel Defense Forces said it was close to completing its probe into ""the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous."" ""(The invesitgation) is dealing with the use of ammunition containing elements of phosphorous, including, among others, the 155mm smoke shells which were referred to in the HRW report. This type of ammunition disperses in the atmosphere and creates an effective smoke screen. It is used by many Western armies. ""It is already possible to conclude that the IDF's use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law. These shells were used for specific operational needs only and in accord with international humanitarian law. The claim that smoke shells were used indiscriminately, or to threaten the civilian population, is baseless,"" the IDF said. It said  ""that weapons intended for screening are not classed as incendiary weapons."" But Abrahams said past IDF investigations into allegations of wrongdoing suggest their inquiry would be neither thorough nor impartial. ""That's why an international investigation is required into serious laws of war violations by all parties. ""For the needless civilian deaths caused by white phosphorus, senior commanders should be held to account,"" Abrahams said. The report said white phosphorus munitions weren't illegal when deployed properly in open areas, but it determined that the IDF repeatedly used them ""unlawfully over populated neighborhoods, killing and wounding civilians and damaging civilian structures, including a school, a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital. "" ""First, the repeated use of air-burst white phosphorus in populated areas until the last days of the operation reveals a pattern or policy of conduct rather than incidental or accidental usage. Second, the IDF was well aware of the effects of white phosphorus and the dangers it poses to civilians. Third, the IDF failed to use safer available alternatives for smokescreens,"" the report said. A medical report prepared during the recent hostilities by the Israeli Health Ministry said that white phosphorus ""can cause serious injury and death when it comes into contact with the skin, is inhaled or is swallowed."" The report said that the IDF could have used a non-lethal smoke shells produced by an Israeli company if it wanted to provide a ""smokescreen"" for its troops. Israel launched the offensive in late December to take on militants from Hamas, who had been shelling southern Israeli communities for months from Gaza. The offensive, called Operation Cast Lead, was launched December 27 and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, a U.N. report recently said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. HRW also said it found no evidence that the Hamas militants Israel was targeting in Gaza were using human shields ""in the vicinity at the time of the attacks."" Israel has said Hamas militants used civilians as human shields and fought from civilian locations, HRW points out.

"(CNN) -- Despite the fact that Republicans recently voted down the Paycheck Fairness Act (for the third time), no one dares to argue in favor of gender-based salary discrimination. No one, that is, except for ""pro-family"" activist Phyllis Schlafly, who has made a long career of telling women their place is in the home. In case you're not familiar with Schlafly, she's a veteran right-wing activist and founder 44 years ago of the Eagle Forum, a conservative interest group that, among other things, opposes abortion, vaccines and working mothers. On Tuesday in the Christian Post, Schlafly declared that equal pay is bad, widening the wage gap is good and that the entire institution of marriage depends on men continuing to earn more than women. Providing women with equal pay for equal work, she wrote, would lower their chances of finding a ""suitable mate,"" since, as Schlafly argues, women prefer to marry men who earn more than they do while men prefer to marry women who earn less. But do they? Or is it that neither gender has had very many choices to the contrary? Talking about the salary gap between partners is the least romantic thing in marriages. But the truth is that women have long married men who earned more than they did for one main reason: Men have long earned more than women. It's not about desire. It's about numbers. Schlafly says that ""men don't have the same preference for a higher-earning mate."" Maybe that's because until very recently, the chances that men meet higher-earning women were pretty rare. They still are. Schlafly doesn't stop there, though. She argues that beyond the case for ""saving marriage,"" women don't actually deserve equal pay because they ""work fewer hours per day, per week, per year."" While men work more than women in paid work, women work more than men if you account for unpaid work. She goes on saying that women ""place a much higher value on pleasant working conditions: a clean, comfortable, air-conditioned office with congenial co-workers"" -- as if A/C and friends to eat lunch with were not things that men like as well. She also ignores the reality that professional men and women do not receive equal treatment or consideration in the workplace. Women earn less than men -- about 84 cents to men's dollar. Although Schlafly proposes that the best way to empower women is to make job prospects better for men, that only works -- if it works at all -- for women who are able, or want, to marry. What about the rest of them? What about other choices? Simply put, even if every American man and woman wanted to marry, there are more women than men. Schlafly's math doesn't add up. She also says, ""Suppose the pay gap between men and women were magically eliminated. If that happened, simple arithmetic suggests that half of women would be unable to find what they regard as a suitable mate."" That is, the more men that out-earn women, the more men there are from which those women might choose. Reducing opportunity and financial independence for women does not empower them. In fact, the result is quite the opposite. Of course, Schlafly's latest manifesto isn't about making logical arguments. She has long been known for courting controversy with her anti-feminism, anti-liberalism, anti-equal rights advocacy -- it's no surprise that she'd latch onto equal pay to further her own platform. The truth is that a more likely deterrent to marriage is the higher tax burdens that married couples face. Under current tax codes, two-wage earning couples face higher taxes if they marry. This might be tolerable for middle class couples but is less so for those who earn less. Economically speaking, there's greater incentive for young couples of modest means to forgo marriage entirely in favor of what Schlafly might regard as (gasp!) living in sin. Schlafly's message is immensely disempowering for women, but what else would we come to expect from a woman who has made a career of telling women that their place is at home? Perhaps more importantly, Schlafly's just got the whole ""what women want"" thing all wrong. Studies show that women are increasingly marrying men who are less educated and who earn less, too. Could it be that these women are just taking what they can get? Or could it be that there's a new norm in town?","Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly says equal pay is bad for women .

"(CNN) -- A 27-year-old man protesting unemployment set himself on fire in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, authorities said Tuesday. The man suffered third-degree burns, Tunisia's national civil protection and civil defense authorities said. He was taken to the same hospital where Mohamed Bouazizi was taken in December 2010. Bouazizi, who died after setting himself on fire, was widely credited for spurring Arab Spring uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. The 26-year-old street vendor earned about $10 a day selling fruit. But after a municipal inspector seized his belongings, Bouazizi -- in an act of economic despair -- doused himself with fuel and set himself ablaze in front of a government building. The fatal protest unleashed a wave of regional dissent against oppression, government corruption and stifled freedoms. Self-immolation has since become more common in the Arab world, with people setting themselves on fire in Tunisia, Jordan, Bahrain and Morocco.","The man is taken to the same hospital where Mohamed Bouazizi was taken .

"(CNN) -- That was an interesting week! On Wednesday, Google Alerts brought me a piece of startling news: A lawyer speaking to a tribunal of the Supreme Court of Pakistan had accused me of acting as a paid agent of the government of Pakistan. No, seriously, that's what the man said. From Pakistan's Daily Times on May 23: . ""Counsel Akram Sheikh had claimed in a statement that a Pakistani embassy provided funds to Harlan Ullman and David Frum for damage control after the memo controversy."" I was so taken aback by the claim that I telephoned Sheikh to ask whether it was true. We had a short but intense exchange. Sheikh flew immediately into a rage at me, accused me of harassing him, insisted that I was somehow violating Pakistani law by telephoning him, refused to confirm or deny the Daily Times account and ended by inviting me to sue him for defamation. My confidence in the Pakistani system of justice not being very high, I declined the latter invitation. But given that Sheikh's charges have gained a hearing inside Pakistan, some kind of answer seems due. Sheikh's charges are false, of course. Duh. More surprising than the falsehood, though, is the sheer laziness of the charge. Where is the fake evidence? The forged check, the bogus wire transfer, the suborned courier? Money always leaves a record. Can you really stand up in front of a Pakistani tribunal and spout whatever fool nonsense pops into your head? Apparently so. Yet as ludicrous as are Sheikh's statements about me -- I'll leave Ullman to speak for himself -- this small comedy is a piece of a much larger drama. On October 10, Britain's Financial Times printed an opinion piece that contained an arresting claim: The author said he had personally conveyed a memo from the Pakistani Embassy in the U.S. to the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, requesting U.S. help to prevent a military coup. The story was dramatic and important, but there was one troubling element: the byline on the piece. The author was Mansoor Ijaz, a writer with a long, long history of discredited assertions. Remember the story about the Clinton administration rejecting a 1996 offer by the government of Sudan to extradite Osama bin Laden? That story, investigated and debunked by the September 11 Commission, continues to circulate among the American right to this day. That story was the work of Ijaz, the first -- but not the last -- of his disproven allegations. (Click here for a comprehensive list by CNN's Peter Bergen and by Andrew Lebovich.) Yet despite the dubious source, the Financial Times story ignited a firestorm in Pakistan. Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S. was forced to resign. Not content with his first success, Ijaz added further allegations, including one that the government of Pakistan had been tipped off the to bin Laden raid. That latter claim was even more explosive:Â Only last week, a Pakistani court sentenced to 33 years in prison a local doctor convicted of helping the United States track bin Laden. Mansoor Ijaz: Pakistan is stronger after 'memogate' Now to my part in the story. Writing here at CNN.com in December, I ridiculed Ijaz's suggestion that the U.S. government would ever have shared such information with the government of Pakistan, and reminded readers of Ijaz's history of unreliability. This column caught the attention of authorities inside Pakistan. Pakistan had convened a special commission of its Supreme Court to investigate Ijaz's memo allegations. On March 15, that commission asked Ijaz to answer my column. Ijaz, who was under oath, told the tribunal that he had sued me for libel. He said, ""In view of the fact Mr. Frum defamed me, my lawyers in Washington informed him that if he does not retract, I will be taking legal action against him."" (You can read the transcript here. This exchange is on page 43.) This statement was untrue. No lawyer for Ijaz had ever contacted me, I was never threatened with legal action over the column, and I did not retract it, points I made in a follow-up column March 21. Sheikh is Ijaz's counsel before the investigating commission. I surmise it was irritation with my March 21 column that led Sheikh to concoct the new accusation that I was a Pakistani government spy. My sense, from the distance of Washington, is that Pakistanis are slowly coming to the realization that the memo controversy was a hoax. Yet as with the false charges against Clinton, the damage to Pakistani civil institutions from the memo controversy will not soon be undone. Those Western media organizations that enabled the hoax have a reckoning to do. Ijaz has a long and proven record of false reporting about some of the most serious issues of international security. It seems only elementary editorial prudence to decline to put media institutions ever again at risk of publishing further false stories, by closing their pages and their TV studios against such a man with such a record. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Lawyer in Pakistan accused him of being a paid agent of that country .

"(CNN) -- As Formula One racer Jules Bianchi continues to fight for his life in a Japanese hospital, his Marussia team says it has been angered by ""a number of media reports"" into the cause of the accident. The French driver spun off in rainy conditions in the closing laps of the Japanese Grand Prix and collided head-on with a recovery vehicle. The vehicle was removing Adrian Sutil's Sauber which had left the track on the preceding lap, prompting double yellow flags to be waved to warn drivers to slow down and be prepared to stop. Various reports suggested that Bianchi did not slow down and that the team had actively encouraged him not to do so. ""The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations,"" said the statement. ""At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules' accident. ""However, given that these allegations are entirely false, the team has no alternative but to address these. ""Regarding point 1, Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags. That is an irrefutable fact, as proven by the telemetry data, which the team has provided to the FIA (world motorsport's governing body.) ""Regarding point 2, an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team, and a written transcript, were provided to the FIA. ""It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules' accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so."" The FIA is investigating the accident and is considering implementing a system which will automatically slow down the cars following a crash. Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director and safety delegate, gave a briefing to media in Sochi in which he outlined these plans. He also indicated that Bianchi had slowed down prior to his accident. Bianchi's family issued an update on the 25-year-old's condition Tuesday, nine days after his accident at Suzuka. ""As a consequence of the accident at Suzuka a number of medical challenges have needed to be overcome,"" the statement issued by Marussia said. ""The situation remains challenging due to the diffuse axonal traumatic brain injury Jules has sustained. ""Jules remains in a critical but stable condition in the Intensive Care Unit of Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. ""The Bianchi family continue to be comforted by the thoughts and prayers of Jules' man fans and the motor sport community."" There was a moving show of support for Bianchi before the drivers resumed racing for the first time since the accident at the Russian Grand Prix. The Frenchman's 21 fellow Formula One racers gathered together at the front of the grid in Sochi for a minute's silence. Earlier, Bianchi's Marussia team made its own tribute with its sole driver in the Russian race, Max Chilton, holding a pit board which read, ""Racing for Jules."" Lewis Hamilton, who won the race for Mercedes to extend his lead in the drivers' championship, later dedicated his win to Bianchi.","Marussia says it is ""shocked and angered"" by speculation into cause of Jules Bianchi's crash .

"(CNN) -- If the old saw about houseguests being like fish is true -- after a few days they begin to stink -- imagine what it must smell like in poor Cory Tschogl's 600-square-foot condo in Palm Springs, California. Tschogl entered into an agreement through the popular Internet site Airbnb to host a man and his brother for a 44-day period from May 25 through July 8. (Airbnb connects travelers looking for low-cost accommodations with locals who in turn rent them rooms in their homes.) The man, identified in various reports as Maksym Pashanin and whose Airbnb ""verified ID"" says he's from Austin, Texas, paid for the first 30 days in advance. He and his brother moved in, but after 30 days they refused to pay out the balance of their account. What's more, upon the July end of their rental agreement, they simply refused to leave the condo. MORE: Pushy guests and porn: Confessions of an Airbnb hostess . Squatters protected under California law . So, if unwanted strangers won't leave, just call authorities and have them booted out, right? That's where Tschogl's nightmare really begins. In California, renters who occupy a property for more than 30 consecutive days are considered full-time tenants on a month-to-month lease with rights to occupancy protected under the state's tenant law. To persuade Pashanin and his brother to leave once the Airbnb reservation contract had expired, Tschogl informed him that she intended to cut off the condo's electricity. ""The guest texted back saying he was legally occupying the condo and that loss of electricity would threaten the work he does at home that brings in $1,000 to $7,000 a day,"" reported the San Francisco Chronicle. Pashanin reportedly works as a video game developer. Tschogl says her electricity bills have tripled or even quadrupled since the men moved in. ""The texts threatened to press charges for 'blackmail and damages caused by your negligence and malicious misconduct, including $3,800 PID Espresso machine as well as medical bills for my brother's hospital visit after he got sick here drinking unfiltered tap water,'"" reported the Chronicle. Time to lawyer up . Realizing her legal options were limited, Tschogl contacted Airbnb for help. According to a Chronicle story on July 19, Tschogl said her numerous email and telephone appeals to Airbnb met with no success. ""I have professional scammers squatting in my condo,"" an exasperated Tschogl tweeted, while also creating a hashtag #airbnbsquatterswontleave. Tschogl eventually hired a lawyer and the bizarre story has since gained national attention. As well as Airbnb's. According to a July 22 story in USA Today, an Airbnb spokesman says the company now plans to pay Tschogl ""the full cost of the reservation and is working with her to provide additional legal support."" Whoever pays, those legal fees may be costly. Eviction procedures in California can be lengthy and complicated, often taking three to six months to evict a tenant.","Airbnb guests at a California condo have refused to leave .

"(CNN) -- There's presumably no going back this time. Jay Leno is leaving the ""Tonight Show"" on Thursday after nearly 22 years as host. Jimmy Fallon, with less than five years on NBC's follow-up ""Late Night"" shift, takes over on February 17. His successor, ""Saturday Night Live"" mainstay Seth Meyers, is set to step in a week later. It's still not clear exactly why NBC is dumping Leno, the king of late night in all key audience measurements, including advertiser-prized 18- to 49-year-olds. He's well ahead of Fallon, David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. NBC programming executives' only explanation, in the network's initial April 2013 announcement, was that ""Jimmy Fallon is a unique talent and this is his time."" But Leno does leave a legacy, and it's not just repeatedly taking it on his ample chin from both NBC and countless detractors. Nor is it the fact that his departure will likely set off a wave of new tensions in the late-night landscape (more on that later). I think Leno's stature slowly will improve with age as the undisputed ""people's champ"" in times when TV critics for the most part dismissed him as a lightweight. Letterman, O'Brien and Kimmel have been deemed the ""smart,"" inventive late-night hosts, but Leno has arguably been the hardest-working man in late night -- even if as a plodder, not a craftsman. And ratings don't lie. Jay Leno's farewell: His best punchlines . Leno's principal strength, as was Johnny Carson's, has been his extended monologues. He can reliably reel off jokes in assembly line fashion, making ""Tonight Show"" an easy, effortless tune-in. Follow-up segments such as ""Headlines"" and ""Jaywalking"" also have kept audiences from going elsewhere or going to bed. But the second half of Leno's ""Tonight Show"" has been the show's soft midsection. His patter with guests invariably feels preordained. Jack Paar, who had a comparatively short run in the ""Tonight Show"" chair in the years before Carson, was the show's pre-eminent conversationalist. As guest Betty White noted this week, nothing was rehearsed or prescrubbed with Paar. You winged it, and you'd better have something to say. Carson relied far more heavily on ""blue card"" crib notes that have become talk show staples during interview segments. But his big, boisterous laugh could break out at any moment -- infectious for viewers and the sound of music for any guest who could get a rise out of Johnny. Leno mostly titters under his breath, more schoolgirl giggler than full-throated bonhomie. Still, he has kept the ratings singing for NBC, and in a much more crowded late night universe than Carson ever experienced. Leno, of course, can't touch Carson, the program's acknowledged ""gold standard."" And Carson made it no secret that he wanted Letterman, not Leno, to succeed him. All these years later, Letterman in reality is the only late night host who even belongs in the same conversation with Carson. For his part, the 66-year-old Letterman is good to go through at least 2015 via a recently signed deal with CBS. But I wouldn't particularly want to be him once Fallon takes over ""Tonight Show."" For the first time in his long tenure at CBS he'll have to compete directly against a New York-based host who also happens to be a generation younger. That could be a serious problem when it comes to attracting a more contemporary collection of guests during the New York legs of their publicity tours. (Justin Timberlake, for one, already is basically a member of Fallon's repertory company.) But it could work quite well for Kimmel, who now will have the West Coast all to himself opposite his NBC and CBS rivals. Letterman also will be the last of the late night ""social media"" Luddites after Leno walks the plank. In contrast, Fallon is a skilled Twitter practitioner with 11.4 million followers. Fallon is also a deft impressionist and accomplished sketch player; neither are Letterman strengths. What Fallon doesn't have so far is Leno's monologue gene. He'll have to lengthen his joke-telling segment, which could ripen in time. For now it's easily the weakest part of his game, giving both Letterman and Kimmel the openings they might need -- both literally and figuratively. Fallon's big plus is a big kid likability that makes him easy to root for. His humor can be barbed, but he clearly aims to please. In contrast to Letterman and Kimmel, he always wants to be his guests' -- and his audience's -- very best friend. But there's no discernible edge. Even Leno throws an occasional jab. In truth, NBC's latest late night moves could and probably should have waited a few more years. Leno has done nothing but win and win again with no signs of weakness. As a further indignity he's being sacked as a 63-year-old even as NBC is developing a new sitcom for the 76-year-old Bill Cosby. Out with the old, in with the older. One more intriguing thing: Meyers, at age 40, is a year older than Fallon. NBC's later slot historically has gone to a host who's a generation younger, with the idea of grooming him for the ""Tonight Show"" desk. But if Fallon succeeds -- and that's certainly what his network wants -- might NBC in effect be showcasing and setting up Meyers for a jump to a rival network someday? After all, he presumably wants to move up at some point, too. But where would he go? Pardon NBC for just not wanting to think about that right now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Bark.","Ed Bark: Jay Leno, inexplicably dumped as ""Tonight Show"" host, has final show Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Actor Edward James Olmos wishes he could trace his family's Mexican history back 100,000 years, but he'll have to settle for 1930 for now. In what one online genealogy firm say is an extraordinary trove of data for American families of Latino descent, the complete 1930 Mexican census is being distributed publicly for the first time. It's considered a rich mine of information because that year's census is Mexico's earliest, most accurate accounting of its population, with 90% of its people counted, according to the firm Ancestry.com. That sort of family lore -- compiled just after Mexico recovered from its tumultuous, bloody Revolution of 1910-20 -- not only piques the interest of prominent Latinos such as Olmos but also stands to sate the curiosity of 31.9 million U.S. Hispanics of Mexican descent. America's own 2010 census just elevated Latinos to the No. 2 group for the first time. The 1930 Mexican census is so antique that it consists of nearly 13 million hard-copy pages, with rows and columns filled out by hand in florid penmanship. The handwriting evokes a bygone era dramatically at odds with the digital age that is making those documents available for free on Ancestry.com. Other genealogy firms have put pieces of the census online, but Ancestry.com says it's providing the entire 1930 census online for the first time, spokesman Sean Pate said. ""This is the most important document we have for Mexican-American people in this country,"" Olmos said in an interview with CNN. The Oscar-nominated actor is working with the online firm to trace his family's Mexican history. Like the waves of European immigrants before them, many Latinos have only oral histories of their origins, Olmos said. The 31.8 million Americans of Mexican descent account for most of the country's 50.5 million Hispanics, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. ""Short of the verbal history that went from person to person, family to family, we really never knew more than that,"" Olmos said. ""This is the first time we've had a document. ""For me, it's building my self-esteem and self-respect as to who I am and for the people who sacrificed for me to be where I am. Now I know who they are and what are their names. Now you want to know more about those people. I would like to go back 100,000 years if I could,"" Olmos said. Mexico's 1895 census is considered the country's first national census, but those records aren't available to the public and aren't considered as complete as the 1930 census, said representatives for Ancestry.com, which claims to be the largest online family history resource. The 1900, 1910 and 1920 censuses aren't regarded as complete and reliable as the 1930 census -- officially called ""El Quinto Censo General de Poblacion y Vivienda 1930, Mexico,"" or the Fifth General Census of Population and Housing, according to Ancestry.com's representatives. The 1930 census doesn't include citizens from the federal district, which includes Mexico City, but it's historically significant because it marks how federal officials sought to make it a vehicle for national unity, said officials with the online firm. An ""aggressive propaganda campaign"" emphasizing the civic duty to participate in the census resulted in the ""extremely high participation rate,"" and that's why the 1930 count is considered the best Mexican census of the 20th century, the online firm said. The records list the names of persons in a household and contain many fields of information: Name, age, gender, birthplace, address, marital status, nationality, religion, occupation, real estate holdings, literacy, any physical or mental defects and even any Indian language spoken. Ancestry.com says the 13 million records reveal several facets about Mexico in 1930: . The most common female name was Maria, and the most common male name was Juan. The three most common surnames were Hernandez, Garcia and Martinez. Famous Mexicans in the census include Maria Felix (1914--2002), who was among the best-known Mexican actresses, and Carmello Torres Fregoso (Bernardo del Carmen Fregoso Cazares; 1927-2003), a renowned bullfighter who later became a successful businessman, the company said. Nearly 18% of the population were recorded as ""soltero"" (single); 11% were ""casado por lo civil y la iglesia"" (civil and church marriage); 10% were ""casado por la iglesia"" (church marriage); and 8% were ""union libre"" (free union, or living together without marriage). The four most populous Mexican states were Puebla, Veracruz, Jalisco and Oaxaca. ""As the United States is home to the second-largest Mexican community in the world, Mexican-Americans comprise 10% of the total U.S. population. Therefore, it is fitting that the world's largest online family history resource now has an expansive collection to serve this important demographic,"" said Josh Hanna, Ancestry.com executive vice president, in a statement. The firm announced the free availability of the documents on its website this month because it's National Hispanic Heritage Month. Olmos said the 1930 census would make genealogical research easier and more reliable -- especially because records haven't been evenly maintained in Mexico's history. For example, Olmos spent eight years trying to find his father's birth certificate in Mexico, he said. In the end, he never found the birth certificate, but he did find ""a birth memoir inside a hospital"" that noted his father's birth in Mexico City in 1922, Olmos said. ""He walked out of the hospital and someone marked it down. That's how we got him,"" Olmos said of his father's birth. Olmos, who himself was born in Los Angeles in 1947, used that hospital memoir for his father's birth to obtain dual citizenship with Mexico several years ago, he said. Olmos' mother was also born in Los Angeles, so securing his father's Mexican birth record was critical to Olmos' quest to obtain a second, Mexican citizenship, he said. The 1930 census could streamline such family research, he said. ""This is where I believe people will gain strength. As soon as you start to investigate, it's like a mystery,"" Olmos said. ""My mother, who's 85, knows quite a bit, but we're now finding about aunts and uncles and grandparents. That's exciting. It really empowers us.""","The 1930 census is Mexico's best of 20th century, online firm says .

"Editor's note: Toben F. Nelson and Traci L. Toomey are members of the faculty of the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health and of the staff of the Alcohol Epidemiology Program. Their co-authors are listed at the end of this article. Toben Nelson, co-authors say there's strong evidence a lower drinking age would cause deaths and injuries. (CNN) -- The national policy that set a minimum legal drinking age of 21 is being questioned by a group of 135 college and university presidents through an effort called the Amethyst Initiative. In a September 16 commentary on CNN.com, Amethyst Initiative leader John McCardell, a former president of Middlebury College, proposes lowering the drinking age, which he suggests will lead to less drinking and related problems among college students. History and a comprehensive review of the research tell a much different story. The evidence is clear, consistent and compelling: A drinking age of 21 has led to less drinking, fewer injuries and fewer deaths. In the 1970s when many states reduced their drinking ages, drinking-related deaths among young people increased. When the drinking age of 21 was restored, deaths declined. This effect is not simply a historical artifact explained by advances in safety technology and other policies. New Zealand recently lowered the drinking age based on many of the same arguments advanced by the Amethyst Initiative. The result was more alcohol-involved traffic crashes and emergency room visits among 15- to 19-year-olds. New Zealand is now considering raising its drinking age. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that setting the drinking age at 21 saves the lives of 900 young people each year and has saved more than 25,000 lives since 1975. It was on the basis of compelling research evidence about its lifesaving benefits that a bipartisan effort created Public Law 98-363, ""The National Minimum Legal Drinking Age Act"" in the first place. Subsequent research has strengthened the evidence. College students who are underage, for example, binge drink less than students aged 21-23. Underage students who attend colleges that rigorously enforce the drinking age, and who reside in states that have more laws restricting access to alcohol for those under the legal age, are less likely to binge drink. Another myth promulgated by the Amethyst Initiative is that European young people are taught by families to drink responsibly because of the typically lower legal drinking ages there. The reverse is the case. Surveys of youth in multiple European countries show that rates of frequent binge drinking among adolescents are higher in Europe than in the United States. Panels of experts, convened separately by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have studied the evidence on the age-21 law and concluded that it is effective public policy. Rather than lowering the drinking age, they recommended bolstering the law by closing loopholes in state law and strengthening enforcement. There is a silver lining to the call for reopening discussion on the minimum legal drinking age. While some college presidents have signed on to the Amethyst Initiative, most have not. College presidents acknowledge that a serious problem exists on their campuses and that something needs to be done. Working effectively with their communities and states to address student drinking is the place to start, not with a discussion about lowering the drinking age. College presidents must show leadership by promoting solutions recommended by a report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism College Drinking Task Force released in 2002. These recommendations for college and community leaders included creating systems for reaching individual students with effective interventions, implementing, publicizing and enforcing laws to prevent alcohol-impaired driving and underage drinking, restrictions on alcohol retail outlets, increasing prices and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, and responsible beverage service policies at on- and off-campus venues. Few colleges and their communities have even begun the steps needed to enact these efforts. These recommendations will be difficult to implement and significant barriers exist, including resistance from the industries that profit from selling alcohol. College presidents cannot accomplish this alone. They need the support of students, regents, parents, alumni and their communities. State and local legislators need to pass tougher restrictions and provide resources for enforcement. Lobbying legislators to dismantle the effective drinking age law is a step in the wrong direction. So rather than try the approaches advocated by the Amethyst Initiative that have no foundation in research, let's be clear about the issues. College student drinking is a serious problem. Each year more young people are injured, sexually assaulted and die as the result of drinking. These statistics would be even worse without the age-21 law. Lowering the drinking age will not save lives or make our campuses and communities better places to live. It will increase heavy drinking and the problems that accompany it in college communities and push the problem back into high schools. Real prevention requires constant vigilance, dedication and the courage to implement difficult solutions. Other co-authors: John R.

"(CNN) -- U.S. and allied warplanes hit sites near the northern Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab, the scene of fighting between ISIS and Kurdish forces in recent days, U.S. Central Command confirmed Saturday. A video released by the U.S. military shows a missile hitting a building. U.S. Central Command said it was taken from an F-15E fighter jet that struck an ISIS compound near Kobani, the Kurdish name for Ayn al-Arab. In other airstrikes near Ayn al-Arab, coalition forces hit two armed vehicles at a border crossing with Turkey, the military said. Syrian Kurdish fighters in Alishar, a village a few kilometers from Ayn al-Arab, said the airstrike hit an unofficial border crossing near the village. The strikes are believed to be the first known coalition attacks near the border with Turkey. That country is not participating in the airstrikes and has repeatedly pressed for an international buffer zone separating the combat in Syria from the Turkish border. A London-based monitoring group also claimed Saturday that other airstrikes may have also resulted in the deaths of six civilians near the Syrian city of al-Hasakah. CNN could not independently confirm the report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. U.S. Central Command did say Saturday that airstrikes hit an ISIS vehicle and several buildings that were part of an ISIS garrison near al-Hasakah. A purported video statement posted online Saturday by Al-Nusra Front, the al Qaeda franchise in Syria, condemns the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. A man identified as Abu Firas al-Souri, spokesman for the group, denounced the participation of Muslim countries in the coalition. In addition to U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft, warplanes from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE participated in strikes in Syria, which also targeted ISIS forces in several other locations, Central Command said. A Kurdish fighter in the region and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had earlier reported airstrikes in the vicinity of the village of Alishar, west of Ayn al-Arab. Coalition airstrikes also destroyed ISIS vehicles and a fighting position near Erbil, Iraq, Central Command said. Kurdish forces have been battling ISIS for days to prevent the fall of Ayn al-Arab. It is the last Kurdish-held city in that region of northwest Syria following a swift ISIS assault that sent some 200,000 people running for their lives to Turkey. Opinion: Airstrikes will not beat ISIS . At least four mortar rounds believed fired by ISIS forces have landed in Kobani, according to to Alan Minbic, a Syrian Kurdish soldier who was fighting in an area between Ayn al-Arab and Aidek. A CNN crew witnessed the Kurdish fighters using artillery and heavy machine-gun fire to drive the ISIS fighters back from the ridge line they were occupying. The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run, from oil to beheadings . The developments come as the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS continues to grow. On Saturday, U.K. defense officials announced British fighter jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq less than 24 hours after Parliament voted to approve the country's involvement. Denmark and Belgium also signed up on Friday, adding to a list of more than 50 European, Asian and Arab countries that have joined the fight, according to U.S. officials. Anti-ISIS coalition grows, but that doesn't mean victory is near . U.S. forces continue to hunt targets in Iraq and Syria, with aircraft taking off from the USS George H.W. Bush as often as every 55 seconds, according to CNN's Becky Anderson, who is aboard the aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf. The United States launched airstrikes against ISIS in August in an effort to stem the group's breathtaking advance across Iraq. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, routed Iraqi forces and took over vast swaths of the country. Some analysts warned Baghdad was at risk of falling to the well-armed, organized and funded extremist group without Western involvement. While the most dramatic advances have been halted, Western leaders have warned of a long fight against ISIS, saying it could take years before the group is fully dislodged.

"(CNN) -- Azerbaijan will make its Formula One debut in 2016 as the latest venue for the Grand Prix of Europe, it was announced Friday. The race circuit will weave through the medieval streets of the capital city Baku. An oil-rich nation situated on the western shores of the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan had been mooted as a venue for next season by F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. However, this would have pushed the number of races on the calendar above the agreed limit of 20 unless others were dropped, thus requiring the consent of all F1 teams. ""We are very happy Baku has joined the Formula One family,"" Ecclestone said in quotes carried by UK news agency, the Press Association. ""This will be a street race, which will pass through interesting and picturesque parts of Baku, and will meet the current Formula One criteria."" The F1 brand has been pushing into Eastern Europe recently with Russia due to host its first race at a circuit built around the Sochi Olympic Park in October. ""Our location at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia is a new frontier for Formula One racing,"" said Azerbaijan's minister of youth and sport Azad Rahimov. ""Azerbaijan is a modern European country that has established a reputation as a center of sporting excellence. ""The deal to bring Formula One to Baku is a very significant new chapter in our ongoing success to attract the world's largest sporting events to our country. ""The course we are planning to design will be similar to leading street circuits already on the calendar."" The event will become F1's latest street race, joining mainstays Monaco and Singapore already on the roster. Friday's announcement also follows confirmation earlier this week that Mexico will be added to the F1 calendar for the 2015 season. Previous hosts of the Grand Prix of Europe -- which was held as a standalone race between 1983 and 2012 -- include Spain, Germany and the UK. The event was last staged in Valencia, also a street circuit. Hungary practice . Meanwhile, Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton edged out teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg to clock the fastest times in both of Friday's practice sessions for this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix. The British driver clocked a time of one minute 25.814 seconds in the first session when the medium-compound Pirelli tire was used, 0.183 seconds ahead of championship leader Rosberg. When the drivers were allowed a run on the soft rubber, the quicker of the two choices this weekend, Hamilton improved to one minute 24.482, with Rosberg down by 0.238 seconds. There were concerns for both drivers, however, with 2008 world champion Hamilton at one stage complaining of a loss of braking and his German colleague reporting issues with his car's engine. Hamilton has a joint-record four victories at the Hungaroring, along with Michael Schumacher, and a repeat of last year's success on Sunday will help him cut Rosberg's 14-point advantage in the drivers' championship standings. Only two drivers managed to get within a second of the all-conquering Mercedes duo in the afternoon session. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel was 0.629 seconds off the pace in his Red Bull followed by Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who was 0.955 seconds adrift. McLaren's Kevin Magnussen was fifth fastest followed by the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, the latter fully 1.5 seconds down on Hamilton. Raikkonen and Alonso had been third and fourth fastest in the morning. Interactive: Take a trip around the Hungaroring .","Azerbaijan will host a Formula One race for the first time .

"(CNN) -- ""Theatre of Dreams"" reads the plaque on the classroom door of Manchester United Soccer School in Mumbai. Nutritional advice and tactics are scribbled on the whiteboard and a Wayne Rooney portrait hangs on the wall. But if the future of the domestic sport lies at the feet of new talent, youngsters are dreaming of playing in stadiums abroad, not at home. Endemic problems over the last four decades have slumped the nation to a low 149 out of 209 in FIFA's world rankings, moving FIFA president Sepp Blatter to describe Indian football as a ""sleeping giant."" However, the arrival of Dutch coach Robert Baan as the nation's first technical director signals a possible revival of a country with a 1.2 billion population. Appointed in October 2011, Baan was previously the technical director in the Netherlands and caretaker coach for the Australia Under 23 team. In India, he says he had spotted about five boys aged below 10 whose skills were on par with European youngsters of that age group. Qualifying for the World Cup . It is still early days, but Baan believes with continued development of India's grassroots, the country might be ready to participate in the 2022 World Cup. ""Or more realistically, 2026 or 2030,"" he adds. ""As India has just started to implement grassroots football it will take 10 years or more to get these players to the same level as in Japan, Korea, or Europe and South America."" This grassroots project involves the All India Football Federation (AIFF) opening residential academies all over the country, free to athletes and providing education alongside football training. These are different to the academies run by overseas clubs such as English Premier League champion Manchester United, which require fees and are non-residential. The first AIFF academy opened in Navi, Mumbai in May 2012, the second in September 2012 in Pailan, another recently in Goa, with a fourth coming soon in Bangalore. ""We already have our under-19 boys in Goa and that will now be our elite academy, possibly moving to Pune in the coming months,"" said Baan. Sunando Dhar, CEO of the AIFF's domestic I-League, has high hopes for this new development. ""I think this is the first positive step that Indian football and the AIFF have taken in the last 30 years,"" he said. Up until the 1970s, India, which has long been one of the world's top sides at cricket, was among the best sides in Asian football and the national team was even invited by FIFA to play in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. In the end India failed to make it to Brazil. According to football historian and statistician Gautam Roy, the journey by ship was too expensive and the players were unable to fulfill the compulsory requirement to wear football boots, as they usually played with bare feet. The AIFF has governed football in India for 75 years and was responsible for appointing Baan. Located in Dwarka in southwest Delhi, the AIFF's headquarters is an impressive building crowned with a huge football. Is India a sporting country? Despite that bold architectural statement, Dhar is more downbeat in his assessment of the country's competence: ""India lacks sporting passion and is not really a sporting country."" That surprising admission provoked astonishment from two Indian football experts. ""India has been playing football, as well as cricket, for over 100 years,"" Roy told CNN. ""There are so many individuals in cricket, football, athletics and hockey. ""We've won gold medals and been world champions, despite being amateur players. If India is not a sporting nation, then why are there so many people playing sport on the ground?"" Former Indian soccer star Baichung Bhutia, who briefly played for English lower division team Bury FC in 1999, added: ""If the AIFF says India's not a sporting nation, then what are they doing there? You have to make it a sporting nation!"" Dhar defends his view and says India does not have a strong presence at the Olympics. Referring to how interest in cricket soared after the first World Cup win in that sport in 1983, he says: ""If the national team does well, it suddenly changes the equation completely."" India's national captain Sunil Chhetri believes the AIFF's criticism of the team dampens their confidence and argues everyone should be working together. Chhetri gave India a sign of hope when he joined the reserve side of Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon in July last year, with Indian football pundit Arunava Chaudhuri describing the move as the ""biggest ever transfer of an Indian footballer."" But the main goal should be for Indians to renew national pride in their home game, which currently rejoices in its past. Beating the British . British soldiers introduced the sport to the country in the 19th century and an Indian team even beat them at their own game to win a domestic tournament in 1911. Roy says this victory gave India the confidence to make the move towards independence, which finally happened 36 years later. However the influence of England -- or rather the English Premier League -- still hangs heavy over Indian football. At Bhutia's academy in Delhi, 14-year-old Somil, Vansh and Tannay say they stay awake until the early hours to keep up with the European Championships and the World Cup. And they all wish to go to Europe to play professionally. ""In the English Premier League, I support Chelsea. And for La Liga, it's Barcelona,"" says Somil, without hesitation. ""But I don't really know much about Indian football."" In December 2010, AIFF signed a 15-year lucrative seven billion rupee ($1.3 million) marketing deal with India's IMG Reliance --- a world-leading sports management company -- to boost the promotion of domestic football. Dhar says revamping the I-League is a priority. But that was over two years ago and experts say little improvement has been made since. The Indian Football Association (IFA), which manages football in West Bengal, organized the country's first international friendly between the hugely popular Venezuela and Argentina in 2011. Crowds packed out the 120,000-capacity Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata for a glimpse of Argentina's superstar Lionel Messi. But while tickets were in short supply to watch arguably the world's best player, local matches remain abandoned on unpopular television channels and without effective promotion. Last year, private company Celebrity Management Group organized a Premier League Soccer, spending almost $7 million bidding for retired World Cup players, including former France international Robert Pires. However, the stadiums were not ready in time, which led to an indefinite postponement and players left in limbo without their wages. Again, these efforts, independent of the AIFF, did not make noticeable improvements to the home game. Kolkata-based Mohun Bagan A.C. and East Bengal F.C. are the biggest Indian clubs with a historical 86-year long rivalry, comparable to the Scottish clubs Celtics and Rangers. In fact, a derby match can attract a crowd of 100,000 people. ""These clubs don't know how lucky they are because they did absolutely nothing to get this kind of commitment from fans,"" says Hindustan Times sports journalist Dhiman Sarkar. Anjan Mitra, general secretary of Mohun Bagan A.C., boasts about the club's ""worldwide"" following. But when asked about the lack of merchandise available for fans, he says they have run out and will re-order soon. Sarkar says: ""Mismanagement is a huge part of the problem."" Bhutia now co-owns the United Sikkim club, which has risen to the I-League's top division just five years after its formation. He argues that AIFF should be working with and advising clubs on management, attracting investors and developing players. ""The AIFF doesn't help club owners who aren't as knowledgeable as me,"" he said. ""Football hasn't changed; it's still the same from the '60s and '70s. It hasn't caught up with world football and where it's gone. ""That's the story of India itself."" 'Unclaimed territory' However Roy feels worldwide perceptions are changing. ""Everyone's looking towards India,"" he said. ""Here you have over one billion people; if you can make football popular, it will be one of the most popular things."" The scope for development is also being keenly monitored by some of Europe's leading clubs. Along with Manchester United, Liverpool and Barcelona have also opened football academies in the country. Dhar describes India as ""unclaimed territory."" Former Liverpool player Steve McMahon began the Steve McMahon Football Academy in October 2011 in New Delhi. Anshuman Tripath, supportive father of 12-year-old Utkarsh who attends the school, says it has ""the best facilities and training, much better than government facilities"" and that ""British coaches also bring a completely different perspective."" Education, education, education . But these initiatives still have to overcome the emphasis Indians place on education, which has traditionally overshadowed sports. Shaji Prabhakaran -- FIFA's South Asia development officer -- says schools in India should give sport as much importance as math and promote its health benefits. Baan says children aged between six and 12 years old need to be offered a weekly program of fitness and sports run by quality coaches at all schools. ""Let the child learn to play all kinds of sport and find out for which he has most talent."" According to Baan, Indian children are increasingly able to tell their parents ""what they want."" In addition, attractive salaries, and the opportunities to become a coach or a physio, are incentives for parents to allow their children to pursue football. In fact, Roy says I-League players earn more than cricketers: ""The prize money is low at five million rupees ($93,000) but the clubs are paying a lot because they're sponsored."" Last year, India placed a bid to host the FIFA Under-17 World Cup tournament in 2017, and would be given automatic participation if it is successful. Das points out that this would be the first time that India would play in a World Cup. But FIFA is demanding certain guarantees from the Indian government, such as security, tax and foreign exchange inflow, and acceptance of the bid is uncertain. However, Baan is hopeful: ""It will give Indian football a big boost."" Ultimately, heroes are made, not born. ""The Messis of the world only come through if we create the right kind of environment,"" Prabhakaran argues. ""If Messi was growing up here, he may not have been so successful."" .","India's national football team ranks 149 out of 209 FIFA member nations .

"(CNN) -- The former mayor of a Florida city that successfully fought back an attempt to dissolve it over corruption has been found guilty of possessing and distributing oxycodone while he was in office. A jury deliberated for about 90 minutes Tuesday evening before finding Barry Layne Moore, 52, guilty of obtaining and selling the prescription narcotic, said Brad Smith, a spokesman for the Bradford County Sheriff's Office. Moore is being held without bail and will be sentenced June 10. Moore had been mayor for just a few weeks when he was arrested November 25 after selling a single 30-milligram oxycodone pill, known on the street as a ""blueberry,"" to an undercover informant for $20. He said he had known the informant for years and denied accepting any money for the pill, which was prescribed to him by a doctor for chronic back pain. He acknowledged being addicted to pain medication. Florida legislators had sought to dissolve Hampton, a city of 477 residents off U.S. 301 between Jacksonville and Gainesville, after an audit (PDF) uncovered financial irregularities, mismanagement and a police force that had grown out of proportion with the size of the city. Accused of corruption, threatened with extinction . For years, Hampton was a notorious speed trap. The legislators agreed to spare Hampton after Moore and other city officials resigned and the city agreed to dismantle its police force, abandon the speed trap and allow the sheriff to assume responsibility for public safety. City 'too corrupt for Florida' is spared . City officials also agreed to hold special elections in September to tweak the city's 1925 charter and elect a new mayor and city council.","Mayor Barry Layne Moore was arrested in midst of city's corruption scandal .

"(CNN) -- The streets of Manila can be an unforgiving place for the city's taxi and public transport drivers. Chronic traffic jams and badly maintained roads are part of the daily grind but add in the possibility of floods during the annual typhoon season and a strong constitution is needed. But Josefina Barandon doesn't mind, and as one of the city's few female drivers will happily take to the streets in her electric jeepney as long as she is able to, come rain or shine. Barandon is one of three women driving Manila's 20-strong fleet of electric public vehicles that ply the streets of Makati, the capital's central business district. If her vehicle is a rare sight among the traditional diesel-spewing jeepneys on the roads, even rarer is seeing a woman behind the wheel of a vehicle of any description. ""All our passengers are happy if they see women drivers because they think the lady drivers are honest,"" says Barandon. ""Our jeepneys are better taken care of, we clean our own and decorate them at our own expense."" Barandon was a taxi operator and then driver before switching from her petrol-powered cab to an electric jeepney in March. It was her good fortune that one of the fares she picked up from the airport last year was Yuri Sarmiento, CEO of Ejeepney Transport, who suggested she swap her taxi for an electric jeepney and with it gain a steady form of employment. Like other drivers of taxis and jeepneys, Barandon regularly used to work shifts of up to 24-hours in order to pay for the hire of the vehicle and then make enough money to support her family. Being an electric jeepney driver is the first time that Barandon has had the benefits and security that most people expect with a job -- a daily shift of eight-hours, health insurance and a weekly paycheck. The e-jeepneys of Makati are still officially a pilot initiative, but only bureaucratic red tape has prevented it from becoming commercial and charging passengers 8 pesos ($0.20) per ride, says Reina Garcia, project coordinator for the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities, which organizes the Makati-based project. ""As well as the environmental impact, we wanted it to help women to have the same opportunity as male drivers,"" says Garcia. ""Economically and socially women are one of the most vulnerable sectors in society, we wanted them to enjoy the same benefits from the electric jeepney project, such as increased income."" Statistics suggest that women in the Philippines have been successful in gaining ground against men. Ranked eighth on the World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index, the Philippines outperforms the U.S., Germany and all other Asian countries in terms of gender equality in economic opportunity, health, political participation and education. According to the figures, women outnumber men in the field of senior officials, managers and professional and technical workers, but still lag behind men in terms of equal wages. Despite some gains for women in the workplace there are plenty of hurdles still to overcome, believes Florencia Cabatingan, chair of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines Women's Committee. ""Discrimination in hiring is something we're aiming to work on. While jobs won't officially advertise for a man, there will be criteria which points to men and not women, like 'we need someone six-feet tall,' or request a qualification that makes it clear men need to be hired."" Notions that traditional diesel jeepneys are too heavy for women to drive are slowly being eroded, or completely bypassed with lighter electric versions, although Barandon says that even her family still finds it funny she drives a jeepney. Macho attitudes from male drivers could also still deter other women from wanting to get behind the wheel. ""Sometimes the male drivers, like taxi drivers, they bully women drivers, overtake unnecessarily and think that women drivers can't do what they are doing,"" says Barandon. But when it comes to fare-paying passengers, Barandon believes most would like to see more women on the roads. ""Attitudes have changed. Our passengers are comparing women drivers in other countries, and society in the Philippines already accepts that women drivers are much better (than men),"" she says with a smile.","Women driving new electric jeepneys on streets of Manila .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's almost crunch time. The midterm elections are a little less than seven months away. Up for grabs in November's midterms is control of the U.S. Senate, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November, with half of those seats in red or purple states. Democrats need a net gain of 17 seats this November to win back control of the Republican-led House of Representatives, a feat that political handicappers say is unlikely in part because of the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts. And don't forget the battle in the states, where three dozen governorships are at stake. The GOP is defending 22 of the 36 seats up for grabs in November. Key races to watch in 2014 . Here are seven important dates and times between now and November that could affect the midterm elections: . • Mid-April: Obamacare numbers -- The Department of Health and Human Services will release its last enrollment report for the Affordable Care Act's first year, including key demographic information. The key number that will affect the political arguments over Obamacare will be the percentage of younger people who have signed up for health insurance through the federal and state exchanges. Republicans, who oppose the federal health care law, are attempting to frame the midterms as a referendum on the sweeping measure, which is President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. • May 20: Kentucky and Georgia primaries -- Seven of the 12 Republican senators running for re-election this year did face, or still are facing, primary challenges from the right. The most high-profile of that group is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He's being challenged by Louisville businessman Matt Bevin, who enjoys the backing of some tea party groups and other conservative organizations. McConnell's considered the overwhelming favorite to win the primary, but his margin of victory may tell us a lot about his prospects in the general election, where he'll face off against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. Georgia is one of five other states holding primaries on May 20. All eyes are on the GOP battle to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Along with Kentucky, Georgia is the only other state where Democrats right now hope to go on the offense in the battle for the Senate. There are five major candidates fighting for the GOP nomination, and if one of the more conservative contenders wins, Democrats think their candidate, Michelle Nunn (daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn), may have a good shot at winning the seat. If there's no outright winner on primary day, a runoff for Georgia's GOP Senate nomination will take place on July 22. • June 3: Mississippi and Iowa primaries -- Of the Republican senators facing primary challenges, Thad Cochran is the most threatened. The six-term senator from Mississippi is being challenged by state lawmaker Chris McDaniel, who enjoys strong backing from conservative groups and tea party activists. And last month, McDaniel landed the endorsement of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee still carries a lot of pull with many on the right. If McDaniel wins, it could be one of the few victories this year for the grassroots in their battle with the party establishment. ""McDaniel has the best chance of any anti-establishment Senate hopeful to knock off an incumbent, and the defeat of Thad Cochran would send shock waves through both the national media and the Republican Party,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Iowa is one of seven states holding primaries on June 3. Several GOP candidates are vying for their party's Senate nomination in the race for the seat of retiring five-term Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. The outcome of Iowa's Republican primary could determine how good a chance the GOP has in November against Rep. Bruce Braley, who hopes to keep the seat in Democratic hands. • Late June: All eyes will be on the Supreme Court as it is likely to issue what may be a major ruling on the Affordable Care Act. The justices will rule on a lawsuit, brought against the federal government by the family-owned arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby, over a requirement under the health care law that certain for-profit corporations provide contraception coverage to their workers. At issue is whether secular, private corporations can claim a religious exemption from federal laws. There's a companion appeal from Conestoga Wood Specialties, owed by a Mennonite family in Pennsylvania. The rulings in these cases could clarify whether some businesses have a religious liberty right, or whether such constitutional protections apply only to individuals. The rulings will also put Obamacare right back in the political spotlight, giving either Democrats or Republicans some bragging rights. • June 30: The last day of June is also the last day of the second quarter of fundraising. Starting July 1, campaigns and party committees begin reporting their cash hauls to the Federal Election Commission (the filings are due by July 15) and in many cases publicize their fundraising figures in the media. The numbers will be scrutinized, as campaign cash is one of the key indicators of a candidate's or party's strength. • Late summer/early fall: Some states will begin to announce how much health insurance premiums will rise in 2015 for policies acquired through the Affordable Care Act. Even though health insurance premiums tend to rise every year, big jumps in premiums could damage Democrats who defend the health care law. • October 3: The Labor Department releases the September unemployment report, the final jobs numbers before midterm elections. While Obamacare is an important issue in the 2014 contests, the economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters, and the top economic concern remains jobs. Just as the final jobs report before the 2012 presidential election was in the spotlight, this report will also face a lot of scrutiny. CNN White House Producer Adam Aigner-Treworgy and CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","The midterm elections are just seven months away .

"(CNN) -- We have all succumbed to city noise: A 5 a.m. call to prayer courtesy of a mosque after a lengthy flight, a late-night New York bar crowd living it up in the wee hours, a raucous Carnival scene in Rio during an important business trip. Whatever the scenario, even the loftiest skyscraper accommodations can't always escape the din. Thankfully, the age of ultra-quiet hotels -- tranquil urban cocoons that are ideal for guests in search of an escape or simply a space to rest and concentrate -- is upon us. The party hotels of the 1990s gave rise to the sleep-friendly accommodations of the 2000s, which prioritized high-end amenities for comfort. Money-saving hotel tips . But there is a more scientific approach that involves innovations you don't necessarily see, like triple-paned windows, extra-thick walls and cork floor layers. The true measure of a hotel room's soundproofing is evaluated by how well it deflects its cacophonous surroundings. Yet few major booking sites offer visitors the opportunity to single out quiet hotels in notoriously noisy cities like Cairo and Tokyo, relying instead on user-generated feedback. This is where brand recognition comes in. Soundproofing styles have become proprietary secrets among hoteliers. Lavish hotel breakfasts start the day out right . All Four Seasons hotels must meet the approval of an acoustics consultant. Some properties rely on white-noise removal systems, like the Sound+Sleep machines found in rooms at several Fairmont properties, including the Heritage Place in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square. Others, such as the Tribeca Grand in New York, outsource soundproofing to companies like K.R. Moeller Associates, which has installed LogiSon sound-masking devices in rooms. ""In the J.D. Power Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index, guest-room noise has repeatedly topped the list of complaints,"" says Niklas Moeller, K.R. Moeller Associates vice president. ""But noise complaints are rarely resolved to the guest's satisfaction, and new approaches are definitely needed that tackle the problem from a different angle."" Technology aside, one of those angles can be as simple as choosing a quiet neighborhood, like those where several of our top choices reside. Consider it the ultimate do-not-disturb sign. Departures: Memorable hotel arrivals . Casa Gangotena, Quito, Ecuador . Quito is home to hundreds of colonial churches, many with bell towers that clang and echo across the bowl-shaped valley in which the city sits. Finding a soundless refuge for a mid-afternoon nap or business briefing can be tricky, but the double- and triple-glazed windows in the 31 rooms at Casa Gangotena, a converted 1920s mansion that opened in 2012 in the city's Plaza San Francisco, make it easier. Luxury Rooms and the garden-view Junior Suite are the quietest, but thick Egyptian marble and dense leather also help absorb noise in the plaza-facing accommodations. The Tokyo Station Hotel . This Tokyo landmark hotel, which closed for six years during an extensive renovation before reopening in October 2012, resides in the Tokyo Station Marunouchi Building, which was designed by Meiji-period architect Kingo Tatsuno. It sits near the Shinkansen bullet-train lines of Tokyo Station, but not a sound is heard from the plush goose-down-swaddled beds in each room. Two layers of double-paned windows and thick blackout curtains keep out the Marunouchi street noise, while steel-framed concrete walls, exterior brick-wall claddings and rubber seismic-isolation units allow guests to put Tokyo on mute as they listen to the clink of ice cubes in Schott Zwiesel Tritan crystal glasses filled with Hibiki Japanese whiskey. The Dorchester, London . Draft-free windows and soundproofed walls constructed with reinforced concrete and terracotta tiles were part of what made this property such a bastion of tranquility when it first opened in 1931. Several renovations later, guest rooms feature solid mahogany doors, dense triple curtains and thick luxurious fabrics, all of which absorb sound. Triple-glazed windows in bedrooms and suites facing busy Park Lane block any additional noises. Departures: World's top walking cities . Green T. House Living, Beijing . China's buzzy, crane-lined capital city sees new skyscraping hotels climb high nearly every month. But situated in a lush walled garden in the suburbs of Beijing, the Green T. House bucks the city's sky-rise tendencies. Its 9,000-square-foot Bath House Residence (which sleeps eight guests) is inspired by a Tang Dynasty emperor's bathhouse and is flanked with nearly inch-thick glass windows. It is also home to an open fireplace and a large, granite spoon-shaped bath, which is filled with green tea at night. Peninsula, Shanghai . This elegant Shanghai newcomer is a favorite of visiting noise-sensitive musicians because of its intensely soundproofed rooms, each -- whether facing the interior gardens of the former British consulate or the bustling Bund -- featuring thick curtains and triple-glazed windows. The property takes things a step further by adding discreet bed-and-bath-side buttons, which dim the lights and activate the do-not-disturb function on the phone and doorbell, and a signature valet box that allows housekeeping to quietly pick up and deliver shoes, laundry and dry cleaning without entering. Departures: 10 outdoor dining destinations . Hôtel de Nell, Paris . Location, as we know, can make all the difference. And while many luxury hotels in Paris are adjacent to the sirens and traffic of the Champs-Élysées, this Design Hotel newcomer is nestled on the especially quiet Rue du Conservatoire in the Ninth Arrondissement. It features triple-glazed windows, weighty 175-pound doors, wood floors topped with thick carpets, dense velvet blinds and wood ceilings with micro holes that absorb noise. The Prestige Room's Japanese tubs made of marble and Oregon myrtle wood are an excellent way to capitalize on the silence. Departures: Top Italian hotel suites . Hôtel Americano, New York . Hôtel Americano, Mexican hotelier Grupo Habita's first foray into New York, ditched its usual Latin party hotel atmosphere for a relaxing ""urban ryokan"" vibe on a quiet side street in Chelsea's extreme west end. Some of the property's 56 rooms feature double-glazed windows, deep soaking tubs, hanging fireplaces and low platform beds placed inside large wooden cubbies that create a thick sound shield. The rooftop pool doubles as a hot tub in the winter. Departures: Las Vegas boutique hotels . © 2010 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"(CNN) -- Like many people in the media and political world, I first heard from Twitter the news that Mitt Romney had chosen Paul Ryan as his running mate. The information appeared between 11 p.m. and midnight on a Friday night. The alert was quickly confirmed by multiple news sources on my Twitter feed: TV networks, newspapers, wire services. Like many journalists, I stayed up late that night to write about the decision, filing copy over the next three hours. I was so weary the next morning that I very nearly slept through the broadcast of the actual announcement event in Norfolk, Virginia. I didn't, quite. And so it was a little less than 12 hours after the breaking of this important political story that I first switched on my TV. Things move fast in the modern world, so let's cut straight to the point: Cable TV is no longer the place where news breaks, and has not been so for years. Social media have done to cable TV news what cable news, in its day, did to the afternoon editions of big-city papers: shouldered aside its slower and less adaptable predecessor. In this new world, the distinction between reporters and sources, between media and everybody else, begins to fade away. The correspondent who calls an expert for analysis may find himself on hold while the expert posts her thoughts to her blog for all the world to read. For more than a century, journalists have mediated between knowledge-holders and information consumers. But the Internet is bringing producers and consumers ever more directly into contact, whether the product is steel girders, home mortgages, or breaking news. What cable news does do, unrivaled, is broadcast images of events to a large global audience. When there's a crowd protesting in Tahrir Square -- or a wildfire raging in southern California -- viewers still turn to cable. Yet how often do such events occur? And how much longer will even that advantage hold? In a world of camera phones, everybody becomes a video journalist. Our images of the violence in Syria all come from locals -- and are available to any media organization that will buy or barter for them. So what should cable do in such a news environment? Three things: . 1) Accept that the days of ""the news is the star"" are over. Generic news moves too fast for cable. Nobody will tune to a cable news network unless there is a very compelling reason to tune to that specific network at that particular time. There's only one such reason: ""People like to watch the people they like to watch."" Everything else is just filler. Like it or not, TV is for personality, not only for information. 2) Go upmarket. Cable news is inescapably a niche market. There are 311 million people in the United States. Even at peak hours, 306 million of them are not watching cable news. At nonpeak hours, 309 million of them are not watching cable news. The 2 million- to 5 million-person cable news audience is made up of unusually smart and curious people, and they should be served appropriate content. The people who can be reached by ""dumbing down"" TV have already been successfully reached by the Kardashian family. 3) Go deep and long. ""'Time, time,' said old King Tut, 'is something I ain't got anything but.'"" That funny little poem by Don Marquis also aptly describes cable news. It's got acres and acres of time to fill, 52 minutes an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As it is, cable news treats that time as a problem to be overcome with sound and visual effects intended to create a feeling (almost always false) of immediacy and urgency. Those effects long ago lost their credibility. Meanwhile, every day on YouTube some amateur documentarian shows that video can be used to convey ideas and information in interesting and entertaining ways. See the TED lectures, and the Big Think series, and the contrasting videos produced by Paul Ryan for the House budget committee and Austan Goolsbee for the Obama White House. The website SecondDraft.org uses video to correct deceptive reports from the Middle East. The Academy Award-winning documentary ""Inside Job"" effectively used video to unpack the 2008 financial crisis for a general audience. Cable TV relishes the confrontation interview. But the public figures that TV wants to interview usually have the poise and practice to sidestep such confrontations. Longer and less confrontational interviews -- such as those Brian Lamb used to do for C-SPAN -- reveal much more than cable TV's mostly misfired attempts at gotcha moments. In their business-book classic ""Barbarians at the Gate,"" authors Bryan Burrough and John Helyar quote a lament for the Nabisco company. ""Some genius invented the Oreo cookie. We're just living off the inheritance."" As tough as it is to found a great industry or great company, it is -- in its own way -- even tougher to adapt that industry or company to a new era. It can be done. It has to be done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says he heard about Paul Ryan pick on Twitter, didn't switch on TV for many hours .
He says cable no longer has corner on breaking news; social media scooping it more and more .
He says cable news must face new reality, get more personality-driven, seek upmarket niche .
Frum: Cable should skip fancy effects, go deep and long in reports, find new relevance ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- A bizarre mountain retreat built on top of a 26-floor Beijing residential building faces demolition after complaints by residents. The rooftop structure is covered by fake rocks, trees and bushes, and can be clearly seen from one of Beijing's busiest commuter roads in one of the city's more upmarket areas. A CNN crew who visited the building on Tuesday saw an official government order stuck to the door giving the owner 15 days to demolish 800 square meters of the structure that have been deemed illegal. No one answered when they knocked. Locals say the unusual high-rise retreat has been slowly taking over the rooftop for years -- construction is said to have started in 2007 -- but is only now receiving attention after images of the unlikely extension went viral on social media. World's tallest building bring China to its knees? ""A lot of people have moved out from the top floors. They were afraid. They sold their apartments and got out,"" said Zhang Li, who lives in an apartment on the 25th floor -- one floor below the construction. The owner of the rocky outcrop has been identified as Professor Zhang Biqing, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine who owns a national chain of acupuncture clinics, and is a former member of a district People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), according to the South China Morning Post. ""I used to worry that the house might be too much but I never expected this much attention,"" Zhang is reported to have told The Beijing News. His neighbor, Zhang Li, said residents had complained many times to officials, but nothing was done to stop construction. China bans building projects to curb Versailles-esque excesses . ""It's very noisy and they are always bringing rocks and things up the elevator,"" she said. ""It's definitely not safe. With all those boulders up there, what would happen if there was an earthquake?"" Other residents claimed the retreat had caused cracks in their walls which leak when it rains. CNN spoke to a number of people on the street who sympathized with Zhang's neighbors and suggested the professor was allowed to build with impunity because of his links to influential officials. ""It's obvious he is powerful, there's no way he could do illegal building like that without knowing people,"" one said. Another added,""If I had that kind of money, I would do it too."" ""It doesn't just take money,"" Zhang Li said. ""Even with money, but no connections, you wouldn't be allowed to build things like this."" Zhang is reported to have said he would demolish the villa if requested. 25 of mankind's greatest engineering achievements .

"(CNN) -- In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. At that time, 60% of Americans opposed the idea and the move provoked an immediate backlash. In the next year, 12 states passed constitutional amendments outlawing same-sex marriage. Eventually 30 states, including traditionally liberal California, passed such measures. But since then there has been an astounding transformation of public opinion and legal thinking. Support for gay and lesbian civil rights, starting from a much lower base than support for racial and gender equality, has risen with stunning speed. Between 2003 and 2013, the proportion of Americans supporting same-sex marriage rose 21 points nationwide, from 32% to 53%, writes Robert P. Jones in The Atlantic. Even in the socially conservative South, support more than doubled, increasing from 22% to 48%. By contrast, in 1978, 11 years after the Supreme Court struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage, only 36% of Americans supported such unions. This rapid and massive change in public attitudes toward same-sex marriage undercuts the argument that ""judicial activism"" has frustrated the will of the American people. But the legal tide has certainly turned as well. In the past year and a half, 42 separate court rulings have upheld marriage rights for gays and lesbians. Because of this month's Supreme Court decision not to hear appeals of such rulings, 24 states and the District of Columbia now permit same-sex marriage. Today more than 50% of Americans live in places where it is legal for gays and lesbians to wed. That will soon rise to 60%, because the Supreme Court's actions affect six other states in the judicial circuits overseen by the same appellate courts. Many factors have contributed to these changes in public and legal opinion. One is the increased visibility of gays and lesbians across the culture, as more come out of the closet. Three-quarters of Americans now say they have a relative, friend or co-worker who is gay and millions have become used to sympathetic gay and lesbian characters on television and to openly gay talk-show hosts and entertainers. It is harder to deny rights to people who are no longer faceless ""others."" Another factor in the rapid acceptance of marriage equality is the success the civil rights and feminist movements have had in establishing social equality as a moral and ethical principle. Fifty years ago, when the Civil Rights Bill was introduced in Congress, congressional opponents openly vowed to resist anything that might ""bring about social equality."" No public figure would say that today. Even politicians who oppose measures to protect the rights of minorities, women or gays and lesbians now frame their opposition as a defense of equality against ""special privileges.""  So when advocates for social change can claim their goal is a simple matter of equity, they have an advantage they lacked in the 1960s and even the 1970s, when substantial numbers of Americans were still willing to admit to opposing gender and racial equality. A third factor behind changing public opinion has been the growing tendency to treat freedom of choice in marriage as a basic right. This was not the case historically. Before the late 1960s, a majority of states had laws prohibiting marriage of whites to blacks, Asians or Filipinos. Twelve states forbade ""drunks"" or ""mental defectives"" from marrying. Several states denied marriage to any person with tuberculosis. Prisoners had no right to marry, and employers were legally entitled to refuse to hire a woman who was married, or to fire her if she married after getting the job. But in 1967, invalidating anti-miscegenation laws, and in 1987, ruling that prisoners could not be denied marriage rights, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not prohibit marriages just because they disapproved of the partnership. Once it became a violation of individual rights to prevent prisoners, inter-racial couples, flight attendants, and female teachers from marrying, gays and lesbians could argue that they, too, should have the right to marry a partner of their choice. Ironically, the most important factor in persuading many Americans to support same-sex marriage may have been the dramatic changes heterosexuals have made in their own marriages. For thousands of years, marriage was defined as the union of two individuals who had different and unequal rights and responsibilities based on their gender. Until the late 1970s, husbands -- but not wives -- were legally obliged to support their families, while wives -- but not husbands -- were legally obliged to perform services (including providing sex) in the home. This is why the legal definition of rape was a man's forcible intercourse with a woman not his wife. It is also why a husband could sue for the loss of companionship, affection and sex (when the actions of another deprived him of the relationship benefits he was due), but a wife, who was not legally entitled to such services, could not. In the past 30 years, however, as Americans have rejected such rigid gender roles, the courts have redefined marriage as a union of two individuals who have equal rights and responsibilities, and who can organize their marital division of labor on the basis of personal inclinations rather than pre-assigned gender roles. As late as 1977, two-thirds of Americans believed that the man should be ""the achiever outside the home"" and the woman should take ""care of the home and family."" Today 62% of all Americans prefer a marriage where husband and wife share breadwinning, child care, and homemaking. The more that heterosexual couples organize their own marriages without regard to gender roles, the less reasonable they find it to deny marriage to two people who happen to be the same biological sex.","Stephanie Coontz: Since first same-sex marriage state, U.S. attitudes have changed fast .
Number of Americans living where gay marriage legal will likely soon reach 60%, she says .
Coontz: More high profile gays in culture; plus civil rights, feminism widened view on social equality .

"(CNN) -- Officials in the tiny east Texas town of Tenaha are accused in a federal lawsuit of stopping African-Americans driving through town and seizing their money and property by threatening them with criminal prosecution -- or worse. Tenaha, Texas, has about 1,000 residents and is about 60 miles southwest of Shreveport, Louisiana. Among the plaintiffs are two African-Americans who claim they forfeited more than $50,000 under threat of money-laundering charges, and a biracial couple who gave up more than $6,000 after officials threatened to put their children in foster care. No one was charged with a crime. The lawsuit, filed in July 2008, has 10 plaintiffs, said attorney Timothy Garrigan, one of the attorneys who filed the suit. But he told CNN Wednesday that ""we get more inquiries every day."" Attorneys are seeking class-action status for the suit, he said. The suit names as defendants Tenaha's mayor and deputy city marshal, plus several Shelby County officials, including the district attorney. It alleges that the officials ""have developed an illegal 'stop and seize' practice of targeting, stopping, detaining, searching and often seizing property from apparently non-white citizens and those traveling with non-white citizens.""  Watch Garrigan explain the lawsuit » . ""The defendants undertake this practice without legal justification, in violation of the citizens' rights, not for any legitimate law enforcement purpose but to enrich their offices and perhaps themselves, by seizing and converting cash and other valuable personal property they can find during the course of the illegal stop and seize practice,"" the suit claims. City and county officials, however, maintain they are doing their jobs along the highway through Tenaha. They say the road is a known route for drug traffickers between Shreveport, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas, according to The Chicago Tribune, which first reported on the lawsuit Tuesday. Tenaha, which had just more than 1,000 residents in the 2000 census, is about 60 miles southwest of Shreveport. ""The police and local district attorney there say they're operating within the law, and it appears as if they are,"" said Howard Witt, the Tribune reporter who wrote the story. ""Texas has an asset forfeiture law similar to many other states, and it basically allows police to seize assets [that] are used, or suspected in being used, in commission of a crime."" The law as it currently exists does not mandate that a person be convicted of a crime or even charged with one before the police can seize the assets, Witt said. A bill was introduced Tuesday in the state Legislature to close that loophole, he said, because of the alleged goings-on in Tenaha. ""We are in the business of enforcing the law,"" Tenaha Mayor George Bowers told CNN in a written statement. ""We send our officers to school and train them well. All we've done is enforced the law."" In court documents filed responding to the suit, several defendants have denied some allegations and said they did not have knowledge of others. Each maintained they were doing their jobs. Garrigan told CNN the plaintiffs he represents are not drug traffickers, and their criminal histories contain ""nothing that would suggest it was appropriate for them to be pulled over and robbed this way by police."" ""Typically, these people are stopped, no drugs are found and only their money and valuables are taken,"" he said. ""We don't think they should be able to get away with that."" He said he didn't know if the route was known for drug trafficking, but ""I don't think that justifies what they've done."" The suit's plaintiffs all were traveling through Tenaha in rental vehicles or in cars with out-of-state license plates, according to the suit. In each case, they were stopped and ordered out of their cars. In some cases, officials searched their cars. But all the plaintiffs claim they were asked if they had any money, and coerced into giving up cash, cell phones and other property. All of the plaintiffs were threatened with arrest and prosecution for money laundering. The couple, Jennifer Boatright and Ronald Henderson, were threatened with another charge concerning their children. Boatright told the Tribune that police stopped them for driving in a left-turn lane. During a search, she said, police found a gift for Boatright's sister, an unused glass pipe similar to those used to smoke marijuana. No drugs were found, but police seized the $6,037 the couple was carrying to buy a car. After they contacted an attorney, the city returned the money, but offered no explanation or apology, she said. ""It was give them the money or they were taking our kids,"" she said. ""They suggested that we never bring it up again. We figured we better give them our cash and get the hell out of there."" In 1997 Louisiana lawmakers reformed that state's asset forfeiture law after a report on NBC's ""Dateline"" alleged that law enforcement officers in Calcasieu and Jefferson Davis parishes were stopping motorists without cause, particularly out-of-state drivers and minorities, along Interstate 10 and seizing their money and property from them, according to an article on the National Drug Strategy Network's Web site. The television show used hidden cameras to record such incidents, the article said.","Lawsuit, filed in federal court, seeks class action status .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group of pro-Hillary Clinton super PACs had it all figured out a few months ago: One would handle the email list, another the rapid response and another would spearhead the big-dollar fundraising. Strategists touted their cohesion and efficiency, two attributes they admitted were not usually applied to Democratic groups. But the excitement they created around a possible presidential bid had a somewhat unintended byproduct when a few eager and ambitious young politicos with no connection to Clinton or her aides realized that they, too, could get in on the early organizing game by starting their own super PACs. So that's what they did. And while these organizers feel they are just adding their voice to the chorus of pro-Clinton groups, representatives from those PACs with longstanding ties to the former first lady and secretary of state see the new entries as an uncontrollable variable. Inside Politics: Rubio gives Clinton an 'F' as secretary of state . And these organizers feel that could siphon attention from other efforts to get Clinton to run. Right now, there are at least eight pro-Clinton super PACs registered with the Federal Election Commission. The highest-profile groups -- Ready for Hillary, American Bridge and Correct the Record -- have deep connections to the Clintons and are staffed by longtime confidants who regularly attend Clinton events and receptions. But then there are the unaffiliated groups -- Hillary 2016, Hillary Clinton Super PAC, Hillary FTW, Hillary PAC, Madam Hillary 2016 and more. Not only are these unaffiliated groups created out of the excitement stirred by the larger PACs, but they are also, in some ways, copying the message that is working. Making strategic sense . ""I entirely believe that with so much support from so many young politicos, this is really shining a light at the importance of young progressives,"" said Eric Williams, the co-founder of Hillary 2016 PAC, who has zero ties to Clinton-land. ""We like her and I feel like that is going to encourage her decision."" That grassroots mission statement is similar to what Ready for Hillary founders said when in 2013, strategists talked about getting young progressives so excited that their enthusiasm would compel Clinton to run. And the similarities aren't lost on the more established groups. Clintons in Oxford for Chelsea's graduation . ""A bottom-up effort like Ready for Hillary won't discourage any grassroots supporters from expressing their enthusiasm or organizing,"" said a person familiar with Ready for Hillary's view of other super PACs. ""At the same time, it makes more sense strategically to have one vehicle and build one massive list of supporters, because that's what will put Hillary in the strongest position possible should she decide to run."" The issue isn't that these groups are stepping on fundraising toes. Since organizing earlier this year, Hillary 2016 has gained fewer than 100 followers on Twitter and has raised a total of $0, according to the group. Despite that start, Williams says they will bank a decent amount after their first fundraiser in June and plan to have one each month after that. His attitude is that you have to start somewhere and his PAC is in the beginning of the building process. By comparison, Ready for Hillary has raised nearly $6 million from more than 55,000 donors since organizing in early 2013. While many of these donors come from small, grassroots events that cost $20.16 (get it?) to attend, a number have been high-profile Clinton supporters and confidants. The group has also begun moving into the endorsement game, securing Clinton support from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia in the past week. 'We kind of roll our eyes' when another super PAC emerges . That hasn't stopped some from worrying, though. ""Legitimately, I can understand why it concerns people,"" said a source close to a pro-Clinton super PAC who asked not to be identified in order to speak more candidly. ""We don't know who these people are. ... The good thing about Ready for Hillary is they channel all the excitement. It seems to me it would be more beneficial to have Ready for Hillary be the mother ship."" The source added, ""We kind of roll our eyes every time we see a new super PAC has filed."" Representatives from Ready for Hillary said they have not yet reached out to the founders of Hillary 2016 PAC. In the past, the group has reached out to other pro-Clinton super PACs to talk about possibly working together. Williams said that he didn't start the group to get pulled into Ready for Hillary because he wants to lead his own organization. ""We all have different political idea and idea for political success,"" Williams added in an apparent knock on Ready for Hillary. Biden takes shot at Clinton White House . ""To be honest with you, I don't think I expect it,"" Williams added about meeting with Ready for Hillary. ""It wasn't an expectation of mine."" The concern among the super PACs close to Clinton is twofold. One, they worry that these groups will make mistakes and muddy what they had hoped would be a clean and efficient effort. Even if these groups are small, they say, their impact on that front could be outsized. ""Anyone can start one of these organizations and raise money and then eventually, if they are successful, start running ads,"" said Alan Abramowitz, an except on super PACs and campaign finance laws. ""Having these super PACs support you is a double edged sward. ... The problem is that you can't control their message, so someone could go out there and start running ads who thinks they are helping Hillary Clinton, even though she might not like the message."" Secondly, some representatives from organization's closer to Clinton also question the motives of the smaller groups, especially the idea that starting a super PAC is a way to get possible get a job with a hypothetical presidential campaign. Angling for campaign jobs? Representatives for Hillary 2016 PAC played coy about whether they would want campaign jobs. ""At this current moment, that is not an interest of ours,"" Williams said when the group launched in April, pausing before he added this caveat: ""But of course we are always open to anything. Times change and things change."" Not all agree that the proliferation of pro-Clinton groups is a bad thing, though. To some, including Burns Strider, a senior adviser to Correct the Record, the process is ""healthy and uniquely ""American."" ""As long as Americans are looking to support her and promote her and encourage her, that is a great thing,"" Strider said. He added, however, this caveat: ""When all of this filters out, the pretenders will be outed and they will be out of the way and those who are for real will be there to the bitter end. They will be right there at the end."" On the other side of the spectrum, anti-Clinton super PACs are both experiencing their own splintering and watching the pro-Clinton side with amusement. Although America Rising PAC has become the top Republican super PAC against Clinton, there is also Stop Hillary PAC and a handful of other small groups. Garrett Marquis, the spokesman for Stop Hillary PAC, said while his group isn't focusing on what the pro-Clinton groups are doing, he does find it comical that random efforts are beginning to sprout up. ""It is interesting watching all these groups build up around Hillary,"" Marquis said. ""It is quite curious, if not comical."" He added that he hopes more Republicans will begin to organize anti-Clinton efforts and said it will make the overall campaign against her better. ""Time will filter out those that are inferior,"" he said. ""This is the same with pro-Hillary groups."" Rubio puts himself back into 2016 conversation .","Some with no connection to Clinton have started their own super PACs .
Organizers of established PACs feel upstarts are uncontrollable variables .
Anti-Clinton groups are also springing up around more established super PACs ."
"(CNN) -- A week, as they say, is a long time in football. By that reckoning, six weeks is almost an eternity. For fans of one of English football's oldest clubs, it certainly feels that way. On Boxing Day 2012, former European champions Nottingham Forest lined up to play Leeds United in a second flight match in the English Championship. After going a goal behind, Forest roared back to an emphatic 4-2 victory that had a certain swagger about it. Watching at the time, it was hard to escape the feeling that things were finally coming together for a side that has come to embody the term 'sleeping giant'. One point and one place outside the playoffs, that afternoon Forest fans would have tucked into their turkey sandwiches with a sense of satisfaction and thoughts of good things to come. But just hours after the final whistle the club's Kuwaiti owners, the Al Hasawi family, fired the club's quietly progressive manager, Sean O'Driscoll. Baffling decision . For fans and observers alike it was a baffling decision. ""We cannot speak highly enough of Sean as a man,"" said Chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi. ""He was appointed at an extremely difficult time for the club and can count himself unlucky to have lost his job with the team just one point away from the top six. But we have a responsibility to look to the future for this great Club because we have huge ambitions for it."" Fast forward just a few weeks, and O'Driscoll's replacement, Alex McLeish, has followed his predecessor to the exit. January had also seen the sudden and unceremonious exits of Forest's CEO, its head of recruitment, and the popular club ambassador (and former player and manager) Frank Clark. McLeish departed 'by mutual consent' after just one win in seven games and a transfer window that bordered on farcical, as key target George Boyd's switch to the club foundered after the player apparently failed an eye test. Forest fans took to social media once more in a bewildered daze as headlines painted a picture of a shambolic club in disarray. Days later another former Forest manager, the combative Billy Davies, was reinstalled in this hottest of managerial hot seats. But before he could properly take charge his team duly lost 2-0 to a Bristol City side now, somewhat poetically, managed by none other than Sean O'Driscoll. Blackburn woes . This odd story will have particular resonance in England's north west, where another of English football's most venerable institutions, Blackburn Rovers, has collapsed from mid table comfort in the English Premier League (EPL) to relegation and ignominy. The club's owners, India's Venky's Group, began their tenure by sacking the widely respected Sam Allardyce in December 2010. Since then they appear to have embarked on a kamikaze PR strategy, which has led to ridicule off the pitch and confusion on it. In the latest chapter, Shebby Singh, the former TV pundit brought in by Venky's as the club's 'global advisor', is reportedly at loggerheads with managing director Derek Shaw, amid allegations of interference with football matters and disputes over players' contractual deals. The culture clash between the old and the new sides of the club looks wider than ever. Rovers are now onto their third manager of the season and a swift return to the EPL looks wildly improbable. Venky's and the Al-Hasawi family are the latest in a wave of foreign owners taking control of clubs in the English leagues. Few on the growing list are strangers to controversy. Mixed feelings . Cardiff City's new Malaysian owners changed the club's colors from blue to red, causing outrage -- but perhaps they will be forgiven as they are currently well set for promotion to the EPL. The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United sparked a supporter's revolt that saw the formation of a completely new team -- FC United of Manchester -- by fans alarmed at the level of debt (currently around Â£360million - $550m) foisted upon the club. Then there's Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, whose phenomenal success has been tempered by the owner's propensity to fire managers; and Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City, whose investments in the club stretch UEFA's concept of Financial Fair Play to the limit, and very probably beyond. The attitude of football fans to these types of investor is pretty schizophrenic. On the one hand the very prospect of a new owner, awash with cash, coming in and transforming a club's fortunes would get many salivating, regardless of where the money is from and who is taking the reins. English football, or at least the Premier League, is an enormously attractive stage and clubs make for interesting playthings for the super-rich. Meanwhile, fans are attracted to the idea of quick-fix success. Community connection . On the other hand, with spiraling ticket prices driven largely by players' wages and the increasingly erratic pictures being painted by some of these new owners, there is a sense that clubs' connections with the communities in which many have existed for over a century are being undermined. Then of course there's the idea of what constitutes super rich in the context of football. Away from the financial machinations of the Glazers, Randy Lerner's more straightforward commitment to Aston Villa appears to have run dry, with the team staring at a relegation battle and the purse strings tied tightly shut. In the Championship, Watford's owners have enjoyed remarkable success by filling their side with loan signings from another club, Italy's Udinese, which they also own. And then, in England's League One, there's Portsmouth. If the Glazer's ownership of Manchester United appears complex, the background to Portsmouth's stewardship is positively arcane. An excellent blog by Portsmouth fan SJ Maskell recently dissected the baffling raft of creditors currently being pored over in the English courts. The club, which enjoyed a Premier League berth and an FA Cup win just five years ago, is facing relegation to England's fourth tier and possible ruin. It has seen a succession of owners, offshore companies, and paper trails leading all over the world drive it into successive demotions and financial collapse. Wayward club . A group of fans has formed the Portsmouth Supporters' Trust, which is looking to gain control of this wayward club and finally wrestle it back from a course to apparent doom. All logic points to their being given the chance to do so, but this is a club that has defied logic for years and a decision in their favor is by no means certain. The Portsmouth Supporters Trust faces a battle, but it is perhaps this kind of institution that points to a more stable future for clubs and the sport of football in England. The problem with many of the new wave of owners in English football is not that they are foreign. Football is a global game, and the EPL is filled with players from all over the world, so it would be illogical to deny owners from overseas the chance to take part too. But the disconnect between the fans that pay to watch these clubs, the communities in which they operate, and even the armchair fans that follow them from afar, is an issue. A report launched this week by the football community trust Supporters Direct outlines a range of measures primarily focused on the physical manifestations of clubs -- the stadia in which they play, and the various off-shoots of these buildings. At the report's core are recommendations designed to protect the relationship between clubs and their communities, including joint ownership of stadia, 'golden shares' to be held by supporters collectively, and clubs that are owned by or formed as so-called Community Benefit Societies. In essence, it is about taking a degree of control into the hands of supporters. The sentiment behind this applies not just to the bricks and mortar of a football stadium. Clubs like Barcelona in Spain and throughout Germany's Bundesliga are protected from extreme and erratic behavior by the fact that fans are directly involved in a democratic ownership arrangement. The worst excesses of owners, who can act on a whim to often disrupt and damage the course of some of the long established institutions at the heart of communities, can be curbed by what is basically a democratic, rather than autocratic structure. Allied to initiatives such as UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, perhaps this will see a game in England that is balanced less precariously, and fit for a long term and sustainable future. For now, however, English football fans should perhaps be careful what they wish for.","Foreign ownership of UK football clubs a mixed picture .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. has increased embassy security worldwide after the assault that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens and three other consular officials, and violent protests at U.S. embassies in Egypt and Yemen. Protesters have been angered by a film that mocks Islam's Prophet Mohammed. The online film ""Innocence of Muslims"" has attracted widespread condemnation including remarks from Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and Pakistan's foreign ministry. Violent protests erupt at embassies as U.S. seeks killers . The tension has also provoked comment throughout the press in the Arab world. CNN samples some of the commentaries: . Lebanon Daily Star . In an editorial in the online English language version of the Lebanon Daily Star, the paper is critical of the violence but adds ""... after a number of similar reactions in recent years to depictions of Prophet Mohammad far less offensive, it should no longer be a surprise . ""More efforts must urgently be made to contain the spread of such hateful media. ""While the violent outbursts were the work of a small group of religious extremists, the authorities in the United States must also bear some responsibility for what happened, and for the ability of the attackers to breach embassy security in both countries. ""It is also vital to view the events in Libya and in Egypt within a context, one in which people's wider anger, religious fervor or boredom -- or a combination of all three -- has been manipulated by a fifth column to further its own interests. ""If we are to learn anything from these tragic events, it is that greater religious understanding is needed now more than ever."" The Kuwait Times . Badrya Darwish, writing in the Kuwait Times, focuses on the upset caused by the film-maker and calls on the U.S. government to act. ""Of course, the producer of the film and the actors taking part in the movie knew exactly what they were doing and knew exactly what the result of this would be -- violence and riots,"" she says. ""I call this insinuation of hatred and an act of terror that is wrapped in velvet. And do not say that it is about freedom of speech because it is not! ""After 9/11, the U.S. has new laws. Let's see the American government use those against non-Muslims too."" Asharq Al Awsat . Tariq Al Hameed, writing in the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, says: ""Since the fall of the Mubarak regime, the real problem in Egypt has been having double standards with the street, which is moving without leaders of public opinion. ""There are leaders who act as political men, not listening to the demands of revolutionaries in the streets, media, and social platforms. There, innocent becomes guilty without trial. This is the problem with Egypt today, and it is the obstacle that will stop it from heading towards the future. ""Countries are not constructed on screams, chaos, or revenge, but they are built on wisdom, thinking, and tolerance. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Egypt, and that is evident in demonstrators against the U.S. embassy, who were Islamists, Christians, and even a group of soccer fans."" The Jordan Times . Under a headline of ""Nothing justifies murder,"" an editorial in The Jordan Times condemns the perpetrators of the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi and the film-maker ""whose sinister objectives are very clear."" It says: ""The intentions are to denigrate Islam, the faith of more than 1.5 billion people, or around one quarter of the world's population, most of them living peacefully with followers of other faiths. The movie certainly targets these people in a manner that aims to disrupt their relations with others who might view them in a negative light. ""Unfortunately such [a] job is made easier by a very small minority of Muslims who advocate violence or the use of force to impose their views on others -- others here being not only non-Muslims, but also Muslims who do not agree with them, meaning the vast majority of the followers of the faith. ""In Islam and for Muslims, nothing justifies violence and spilling blood of innocent people."" Addustour . In Jordan, Hilmi Al Asmar writes that the West should take action against the film-maker. In an editorial in Addustour, the paper says: ""We appreciate all those who repudiated the film's director ""Sam Bacile"", whether Copts or otherwise. His destiny is to live hiding like the non-believer Salman Rushdi, and likewise. ""We hope the West will discipline their ribald, and stay away from our religion and honor, and they should understand very well that Muslims left the ages of humiliation and degradation, and started their journey to gain their dignity and wealth back. ""These are not holy words, as whoever reads what their scholars write knows what this means exactly."" Al Hayat . In the pan-Arab newspaper Al Hayat, Zuhair Qsaibati says malice breeds malice. ""In the age of hatred that erases all logic, it is not a coincidence that a mosque has been desecrated in France, and Muslims in the U.S. have been warned of a 'holocaust'. ""This film is just one of the many weapons of mass destruction that threaten the Arab Spring. Malice brings malice, and if revolution is a fair game then its enemy will be always ready to spread discrimination in the region: among Muslims and Christians, Muslims and Copts, Sunnis and Shiites, Sunnis and Alawites."" The Egyptian Gazette . An editorial in the English language Egyptian Gazette assesses the way anti-U.S. hostility has created a leadership test for both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney ahead of the presidential election. ""Obama, appearing in the White House Rose Garden, somberly condemned the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, projected presidential dignity, called on Americans to unite and promised action to protect diplomats in the Arab world,"" it says. ""But the president's unspoken political mission was to exploit and enhance perceptions of him as a steely global leader and to shield his own election prospects from immediate damage from any voter outrage at home."" It said Romney ""unloaded on the administration over a statement issued by the US embassy in Cairo which effectively condemned a film by a US director deemed offensive to Islam which sparked the riot.""","""More efforts must be made to contain spread of hateful media,"" says Lebanon's Daily Star .
The Jordan Times concludes: ""In Islam and for Muslims, nothing justifies violence and spilling blood of innocent people.""

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the environment, aviation has a rather dirty reputation. The industry produced 689 million tons of CO2 in 2012, according to Air Transport Action Group (12% of global transportation's carbon dioxide emissions) -- a number that is sure to grow as global demand for flight continues to skyrocket. ""Aviation will double in size worldwide in the next two decades, and if we're not able to provide a sustainable means to fly, we will create a ceiling for growth in the industry,"" says Ignaas Caryn, director of innovation at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. As a result, it looks like the aviation industry is ready to green up its game. In January, Boeing announced a new initiative to build a biofuel supply chain in the United Arab Emirates, as well as research it's conducting into biofuels made from salt water-consuming desert plants. Airbus has similarly partnered with local producers and airlines to sniff out sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. To name just a few partnerships, the airplane manufacturer teamed with Virgin Australia Airlines to to produce sustainable aviation fuels from eucalyptus mallee trees in Australia. Airbus has also joined other aerospace companies in launching the ITAKA initiative, a collaborative project funded by the European Union to produce and test the use of sustainable jet fuel. Frederic Eychenne, Airbus' head of new energies, notes that no single crop will do the job for biofuels, and that to achieve true sustainability, biofuel -- like food -- is best when it's locally-sourced. ""Different countries grow different crops. They have different refineries in place. Sustainability isn't just about reducing emissions in the air. We have to consider the whole life-cycle in terms of production,"" he notes. Going the distance . Long-haul flights make up 80% of aviation's CO2 emissions. As a result, cutting down the carbon footprint for these flights is extra important. In May, KLM took the first step and launched a new series of flights traveling between Amsterdam and Aruba that use a 20% biofuel blend. The flight is part of KLM's short-term goal to integrate 1% of biofuel into all its flights by 2015. The main barrier to using biofuel on a larger scale, says Caryn, is the price. ""Today, bio jet fuel is still three to four times more expensive than fossil fuel, because there's no continuous production. There's a demonstrated hole in the value chain,"" he notes. To solve the problem, in 2010 KLM became a joint founder of SkyNRG -- a major supplier of eco-efficient jet fuel. ""We believed the development of bio jet fuel was important, and that we couldn't keep it within the boundaries of KLM, so we decided to come up with a new company. In the last five years, SkyNRG have supplied approximately 25 airlines,"" he says. SkyNRG is also working with airlines and airports around the world to create bioports -- or supply chains of sustainable jet fuel -- in a bid to ultimately bring down the price. ""With an increase volume, we could see price parity within the next ten years,"" says Caryn. Other steps . Depending on the source of jet fuel and how it's cultivated, Caryn estimates using biofuel could reduce carbon emissions between 50 and 80%, depending mainly on the feedstock and conversion process. He notes that there are other methods currently in use to drop that percentage even further. ""The way of taking off, the way of landing, and the route you choose to fly can all impact emissions,"" he notes. Planes that make a continuous ascent or descent when landing or taking off -- instead of the more traditional ""step-down"" approach -- he says burn less fuel. Eychenne also notes that Airbus is slashing emissions by switching to more innovative materials. ""We use a lot of composite materials now, which are lighter, and by bringing the weight down, you bring fuel consumption down,"" he says.","KLM recently flew from Amsterdam to Aruba using sustainable jet fuel .
The 10-hour flight was the longest to ever use biofuel .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood's newest slate of projects is being sourced directly from '80s cartoons. The ""Care Bears"" are making a return over on Netflix, ""Jem"" is being turned into a live-action movie, and now Rainbow Brite, the spunky animated savior of all things colorful, is making her own comeback. The on-demand subscription service Feeln has revived the memorable cartoon, which was created by Hallmark in 1983 and spawned a TV series, a movie and of course millions of dollars worth of merchandise. ""The most colorful hero ever returns to protect Rainbowland from the forces of darkness,"" Feeln proclaimed. Feeln's return to Rainbowland will star actress Emily Osment (""Young & Hungry"") as Rainbow Brite and '80s screen star Molly Ringwald as the villain, the Dark Princess. Osment, who hadn't been born when ""Rainbow Brite"" was introduced, said in a statement that she's looking forward ""to connecting with the audience, old and new."" ""Being cast as the voice of Rainbow Brite for the relaunch of this iconic show is truly an honor,"" added the actress, who's shared a photo of one of her scripts on Instagram.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An anti-drone activist and journalist from Pakistan is missing after being abducted from his home, his lawyer said Monday. Kareem Khan was seized from his home in Rawalpindi on the night of February 5th, according to attorney Shazad Akbar. He was picked up by 20 men, some of them dressed in police uniforms, Akbar said. ""Kareem Khan was my first client in 2010 against U.S. drone strikes in the tribal areas of Pakistan,"" Shahzad told CNN Monday. Shahzad said he lodged a complaint with local police but they denied having picked him up. Khan hails from the tribal area of North Waziristan. He was due to travel to Europe this week to speak to German, Dutch and British parliamentarians about his personal experience with drone strikes, according to Reprieve, a UK-based charity that provides legal support to prisoners unable to pay for it themselves. Khan was also involved in legal proceedings against the Pakistani government concerning its failure to investigate the deaths of his son and brother in a drone strike, the charity said on its website. ""We are very worried about Mr Khan's safety,"" writes Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve. ""He is a crucial witness to the dangers of the CIA's covert drone programme, and has simply sought justice for the death of his son and brother through peaceful, legal routes."" Khan spoke to CNN in December 2010 about the airstrike a year earlier that had targeted his home in Machikhel, a village in North Waziristan. Khan said the missiles killed his 35-year-old brother, a teacher with a master's degree in English literature; his 18 year-old son, and several others. He filed a $500 million lawsuit against the U.S. government. Khan was one of the first people to raise awareness about drone strikes, said Noor Behram, a journalist based in North Waziristan. He said it was a great setback that he had disappeared just before he could raise the issue on an international forum during his Europe trip. Behram said a protest against what describes as Khan's arrest would be held Tuesday at the press club in the town of Miranshah.

"(CNN) -- Soulja Boy faces three felony charges stemming from an early morning traffic stop in which police say they found ""a felony amount"" of marijuana, firearms and ""a substantial amount of cash."" The 21-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday afternoon after spending about a dozen hours in the Carroll County, Georgia, jail, according to a police spokeswoman. Soulja Boy was riding in a rented Black Cadillac Escalade with four other men on Interstate 20 about 50 miles west of Atlanta when they were stopped for a routine traffic violation at 2:30 a.m., according to Temple Police spokeswoman Dana Rampy. Temple Police Officer Lat Gray arrested all five men after he found the pot, cash and firearms, Rampy said. The men were ""very cordial"" and cooperative with police, she said. Each faces three felony counts, including possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm in commission of a crime, Rampy said. Soulja Boy's representatives did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.","NEW: Soulja Boy posts $10,000 bond Tuesday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a Georgia toddler who died after being left in a car for hours in the sweltering heat says she is a grieving mother caught up in ""the storm around my family."" ""The rush to judgment by the public and the mainstream media has left me with little confidence in our legal system and our society,"" Leanna Harris wrote in a victim impact statement obtained by CNN's Victor Blackwell. Police say Harris' husband, Justin Ross Harris, left 22-month-old Cooper strapped into a car seat in his SUV for seven hours while he went to work on June 18. Records show the temperature topped 92 that day, and police say it was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father's workplace. Justin Ross Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty. Leanna Harris has not been charged, but her attorney, Lawrence Zimmerman, said Friday that ""she is concerned that the district attorney's office may try to level a charge against her."" Police said Harris behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her son. For example, one detective testified that she asked her husband, ""Did you say too much?"" in a police interview room after he was arrested, and that she also insisted to employees at her son's day care that ""Ross must have left him in the car,"" when they told her Cooper had not been dropped off that morning. Police also said both parents conducted Internet searches about how hot a car needed to be to kill a child. Zimmerman, however, wants the world to know his client is suffering. The Atlanta defense attorney provided the victim impact statement that was filled out by Leanna Harris, ""with help from my attorney,"" she wrote. The form, which lists Justin Ross Harris as the defendant and cruelty to children and second degree murder as the charges, asks the person filling it out to state their relationship to the victim of the particular crime. Leanna Harris wrote, ""self,"" not the name of her son. ""Sure, she's a victim,"" Zimmerman said. ""She's lost a child. She's a victim of public perception thinking that she had something to do with it."" The Cobb County District Attorney's Office said the forms are standard practice. ""We are required by the Crime Victim's Bill of Rights to send those forms to all victims or a victim's next of kin,"" said Kim Isaza, spokeswoman for the Cobb County District Attorney's Office.","Lawyer shares victim impact statement in hot car death case .

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas is still grappling with an Ebola scare, and Gov. Rick Perry -- faced with a test of his leadership ahead of a possible 2016 presidential bid -- is in Europe. In the lead-up to an election that will determine his successor, the three-term Republican governor left this week for a pre-scheduled economic development trip that will include stops in England, Germany, Poland and Ukraine. His trip comes after a Dallas nurse became the second person diagnosed with Ebola in the state, and as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors dozens more doctors and nurses who treated the first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died last week. Perry's absence has raised eyebrows: Texas Democrats pounced on Perry, saying the episode is characteristic of a governor they've long accused of being too focused on his own political fortunes. Obama steps (cautiously) back into campaign mode . Perry is ""an irresponsible leader who's not paying attention to Texans,"" said Will Hailer, the Texas Democratic Party's executive director. He said departing for a trip just months before Perry's term ends and he departs the governor's office is ""Aspiring Politics 101."" ""An economic development trip two months before the end of your term, in between jet-setting to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, clearly shows that this is a development trip for Perry,"" Heiler said. Read more - Rick Perry in London: You always sound so smart . Though he struggled in a 2012 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination, Perry is widely expected to run again in 2016. The state's response to the Ebola outbreak could be his last high-profile act in the governor's office and potentially shape national perceptions about his capabilities as an executive. Perry's office defended the timing of his trip, saying he's still engaged in the Ebola response and is using the European trip to talk with officials overseas about the global response to the outbreak in Africa. ""State, local and federal officials continue to manage the response to Dallas' Ebola cases, and the infectious disease task force that Gov. Perry created to review the state's preparedness and response efforts will conduct its first public hearing this month,"" Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Monday. ""Earlier today, Gov. Perry and Chancellor George Osborne discussed the global repercussions of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and the governor offered to share what we've learned in Texas with the United Kingdom, which is also preparing for the possibility of an Ebola case,"" she said. Perry has been publicly involved in the Ebola response. He opposed banning travel between the United States and West Africa and has praised the CDC's involvement in efforts to prevent the disease from spreading.","Texas Gov.

"(CNN) -- An angry bunch of Americans has taken to the streets to protest government spending and the direction of the nation, and judging by the massive media coverage, it's as if we have been invaded by a foreign entity, marching on state capitals and Washington ready to lead a coup d'état against our elected officials. The rise of the Tea Party is being chronicled as a threat to democracy, or a grassroots collective unlike anything we have seen in many years. As Public Enemy wisely put it with their hit song in 1988, ""Don't Believe the Hype!"" First, let's deal with the Tea Party haters. Please, shut up. How can any liberal, progressive, moderate or conservative be mad about a group of Americans taking to the streets to protest the actions of the country? What they are engaged in is constitutional. The freedom to assemble, march, walk, scream and yell is right there in the document we all abide by. Do I object to idiots holding up clearly racist signs, as well as the stupidity of images of President Obama as Hitler? Of course. That ignorance detracts from whatever commentary they are trying to make on the status of the nation. When I debated Tea Party leader Mark Williams on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 show a few months ago, I was appalled when he was unwilling to say that if someone came to one of his rallies with a racist sign, he would tell them to take it down. He tried to invoke the First Amendment, but he was clearly offering people comfort for such shenanigans. But it's clear that most of the folks attending Tea Party rallies are not bigots and homophobes. There are ignorant fools in all groups, and the Tea Party is no different. If anyone wants to oppose the Tea Party for spreading misinformation, do that. But to assert that it's wrong to take part in civic engagement is utterly silly. The best of this country came out of the action of those in the streets. For those who oppose the Tea Party, you have every right to gather with those who agree with you and take to the streets. If they oppose the policies of President Obama, and you support them, demonstrate your support for his agenda. Don't whine about someone else making noise. Men and women, stand up and be heard. And if you want to oppose the Tea Party, do so on the facts. It's laughable when a Tea Partier laments taxes in the U.S. when, for the middle class, they are virtually at their lowest level in more than 50 years. To suggest that 95 percent of Americans didn't get a tax cut in President Obama's first year is just dead wrong. The reality is that the Tea Party is more aligned with Republicans. According to a CBS News/ New York Times poll released last week, 18 percent of Americans say they view themselves as a member of the Tea Party; 54 percent are Republicans; and 89 percent are white. Sen. John McCain received 59 million votes to Obama's 69 million votes. Those 59 million voters didn't move to Canada or Mexico, so they are predisposed to oppose the president's agenda. So what we really have here is a group of people who are more likely than not to support GOP candidates nationwide. I don't view the Tea Party as being some new entity that is drawing out disenfranchised voters who have long been absent from the process. They are no different in 2010 than what MoveOn.org was in 1998: a group of disgruntled Americans operating outside of the traditional two-party apparatus and expressing their own self-interests. I more than welcome the Tea Party folks. Protesting is America at its finest. But I'm also not fooled one bit by them. They are a rowdy, loud and forceful bunch filled largely with Republicans who oppose the policies of the president. Nothing wrong with that. There were a bunch of rowdy, loud and forceful liberals and progressives taking to the streets to oppose the policies of President George W. Bush. Folks, this isn't a radical transformation of the nation shaping up. It's the latest effort by citizens primarily in one party or professing one ideology to rise up and allow their voices to be heard. And that's a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Tea Party supporters have protested against taxes, big government .
Roland Martin says their protests should be welcomed as expression of basic rights .
He says Tea Party supporters should note taxes on middle class are at historically low levels .

"(CNN) -- By tradition, Drama is represented by two masks: the happy face of the comic muse Thalia and her sad counterpart, the tragic muse Melpomene. If Drama were Robin Williams, you'd need a million more. He was a mask of howling laughter, a mask of wide-eyed innocence. A sneer. A frown. Even, at times, a blank. If it seemed like we knew what went on behind the many masks, it was because Williams' quicksilver mind and boundless talent possessed enough energy to blow them right off his face. He WAS Mork. He WAS Adrian Cronauer of ""Good Morning, Vietnam."" He WAS Patch Adams, and ""Aladdin's"" genie, and Mrs. Doubtfire. But he was also the restrained Garp in ""The World According to Garp,"" and the creepy Seymour Parrish in ""One Hour Photo,"" and the firm but compassionate Sean Maguire in ""Good Will Hunting,"" the performance that won him an Oscar. It was that side of Williams -- something raw and vulnerable, not something manic and boisterous -- that made you wonder: who was he when he took off the mask? On Monday, Williams was found dead in his home in Tiburon, California. He was 63. Coroner investigators suspect ""the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia,"" according to a statement from the Marin County, California, Sheriff's Office. It's a clichÃ©, of course, the clown who laughs on the outside while crying -- or dying -- on the inside. It's Pavarotti's Pagliacci and Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp; Willy Wonka and Laurence Olivier's Archie Rice. Show business history is filled with stories of comic kings who fought against depression and substance abuse, not always successfully. Jonathan Winters, Williams' hero, was institutionalized for a time. The effortless Dick Van Dyke once said he was ""mostly drunk for 15 years."" John Belushi and Chris Farley died of overdoses. Mitch Hedberg, Freddie Prinze, Richard Jeni -- all funny men, all gone before their time. There's no question that comedy can be a form of escape -- and recognition. Richard Pryor, one of the most brilliant comedians who ever strode on stage, was raised in a brothel, married multiple times, struggled with demons both societal and personal. He was ruthless -- especially on himself. Yet he was scathingly, mercilessly funny. It was comedy that drew blood, comedy as catharsis. Chris Farley, on the other hand, grew up in a close-knit, comfortable clan -- but also sometimes seemed to be running from something. His immersion in Matt Foley, the divorced motivational speaker who lived in a ""van down by the river,"" was both hilarious and a little scary. ""We lose at least one great comic to suicide or ODs every year,"" tweeted comedian Michael Ian Black on Monday. ""Our jobs are to communicate, but we seem to not know how to ask for help."" Williams, the son of an auto company executive and a model, was remarkably open about his own battles. He was a chubby, bullied child who found he could make others laugh. Later, on talk shows, he could be outrageously stream-of-consciousness, a bicycle careening down a hill without any brakes -- and, just as quickly, brutally honest, admitting to sadnesses and abuses and mistakes. ""His bearing is intensely Zen and almost mournful, and when he's not putting on voices he speaks in a low, tremulous baritone -- as if on the verge of tears -- that would work very well if he were delivering a funeral eulogy,"" wrote Decca Aitkenhead, who interviewed him for the UK Guardian in 2010. Inevitably, he'd make light of the problem -- the great line, ""Cocaine is God's way of telling you that you make too much money,"" is his -- but underneath there was a sense of a man wrestling with demons, a man wishing to put on another mask in an attempt to scare them away. It is a mask that perhaps only the most blameless of us have never tried on. But if it's another clichÃ© that comedians hide anger under all those laughs, Williams didn't fit the stereotype. With him, what was underneath was compassion. It showed in his performances, notably the therapist in ""Good Will Hunting."" It showed in his participation in such causes as Comic Relief, which raised money for the homeless, and in his USO tours, entertaining troops in Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq. Celebrities remember Robin Williams . He'd had open-heart surgery several years ago, and it made him reflect on mortality. ""It breaks through your barrier, you've literally cracked the armor. And you've got no choice, it literally breaks you open,"" he told the Guardian. Sure, there were performances in which he seemed less than kind -- whether on screen, as a villain in ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" or in his real life, with messy divorces that he described, with perhaps a touch of bitterness, as ""ripping your heart out through your wallet."" Given all that, who wouldn't want to put on Thalia's mask, with laughter riding across the audience in waves, approval on demand, smiles all around? Robin Williams wore it well. It's sad that, in the end, he exited with Melpomene. Complete coverage on Robin Williams .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Navy has already relieved so many commanding officers of duty this year that the chief of naval operations has written an unusual memo to all potential commanders reminding them of their responsibilities. So far this year 14 commanding officers have been relieved of duty, compared to 17 officers during all of last year. The highest number was in 2003 when 26 commanding officers were relieved of duty. The memo provided to CNN heavily emphasized professional ethics and personal accountability. ""Included as part of your responsibilities is the charge that you will be held accountable to the highest standards of conduct,"" said Adm. Gary Roughead in a memo sent out last month. In the most recent incident this week, a squadron commander was relieved of duty for being drunk in Bahrain. ""We expect our commanding officers to uphold the highest personal and professional standards and a alcohol-related incident is not what we expect from them,"" said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Danny Hernandez . While the cause of some of the commanders being relieved of duty was stated by the Navy as ""loss of confidence in ability to command"" without specific details, other cases included allegations of drunk driving, inappropriate personal relationships, mistreating sailors, and failing to properly handle a loaded weapon. The officers ranged in rank from commanders to captains to one rear admiral, who was relieved of command for ""failing to ... hold himself responsible for the professional decorum of the ship and with it, the obligation to play an active role in the command climate for the crew ... provide adequate guidance and oversight; and ... take prudent measures to ensure compliance with Navy standards,"" according to the Navy. One of the more public cases this year involved Capt. Owen Honors, commanding officer of USS Enterprise, who was relieved of command for demonstrating poor judgment while serving as executive officer of that ship. Honors is trying to remain in the Navy although a Navy investigation found he made inappropriate videos while serving as Enterprise's executive officer from 2006-2007. A Navy official confirmed Roughead, the senior officer in the Navy, wrote the four-page memo because of the number of officers relieved of command for a wide variety of reasons ranging from personal misconduct to poor performance. The official said the Navy does not believe there is any one reason for the number of cases. He declined to speak on the record, citing Roughhead's memo as the public accounting of the matter. ""Authority, responsibility and accountability are three essential principles which are the heart and soul of command. Effective command is at risk if any of these principles are lacking or out of balance,"" Roughead said. The Navy calculates there are more than 1,500 commanding officer jobs in the Navy and that less than 1% of the officers in those jobs have been relieved of command since 2005.","So far this year, the Navy has relieved 14 commanding officers of duty .

"London (CNN) -- David Bowie will release another album featuring new material, his long-time producer Tony Visconti has told CNN, in a revelation that will delight the singer's legions of fans. Bowie last year released ""The Next Day,"" his first new music for a decade, without any warning, electrifying music lovers who assumed the reclusive legend had retired. Critical acclaim for the album was followed by rave reviews for the ""Bowie Is"" retrospective exhibition at London's V&A Museum, which is now touring the world. And earlier this month the 67-year-old star announced that a career-spanning greatest hits package due out before Christmas would feature one new song, called ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)."" Visconti, who produced the ""The Next Day"" and the forthcoming single, said a further collection of original music would be released. ""There's gonna be another album, definitely. I think he talked about, although actually he didn't really say anything. He's announcing, he announced to his fans recently that there's gonna be more music soon. That obviously means another album,"" the producer said -- although he didn't say when the new music would be released. Visconti played down any suggestion that Bowie might tour the new material. ""I don't think he's gonna busk in the Tube ... on the Underground. As far as a concert is concerned I have no idea. ""He clearly didn't promote 'The Next Day' with a concert and whether he does for the next one I don't know and I couldn't predict that -- it's up to him. It's whatever takes his fancy."" In the meantime a performance by Visconti and drummer Woody Woodmansey, the last surviving member of Bowie's famous Spiders from Mars backing band during his Ziggy Stardust breakthrough years, is as close as fans will get to experiencing Bowie's music live. The pair will perform Bowie's 1970 album ""The Man Who Sold the World"" in London, Glasgow and Sheffield, starting on Monday. Heaven 17's Glenn Gregory takes on the task of replacing Bowie's vocals on the songs that helped to launch a unique musical talent. The announcement effectively quashes fears that ""The Next Day"" would be Bowie's swansong, and he said he hoped to continue to work with the London-born singer, whose work has spanned almost five decades. Visconti also rubbished suggestions that Bowie, who had heart surgery in 2004, was unwell. ""I saw him in the 10-year period when we didn't work together and he was really happy about taking a break. He was in fine health. ""There were all kinds of rumors flying around and he wasn't upset that people thought he was in ill health ... he said, 'Nah I'm just not inspired and I'll wait till I feel it.'""","David Bowie will release another album featuring new material, producer Tony Visconti reveals .

"(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines flight landed safely at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, on Friday with what passengers described as a 3-foot hole in the fuselage of the Boeing 737. ""I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us,"" passenger Greg Hansen told CNN. ""(Then) a big explosion happened. A big noise, and from there, you felt some of the air being sucked out. It happened right behind me, in the row behind me and it covers about two and a half rows,"" he said from seat 11C. Hansen, 41, a regional sales manager for a biotech company, was flying home to Sacramento from a business trip. Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in mid-flight, he said. ""Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests. The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level,"" he said. But just behind him, Hansen says he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be. ""You can see the insulation and wiring. The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air,"" he said. ""It was surreal, when you're riding in a modern aircraft. You're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down,"" he said. Hansen described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide. Hansen said that he and the rest of the passengers were still on board Southwest Flight 812, after making an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 7:07 p.m. ET. The FAA said the captain made a rapid controlled descent from 36,000 to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure. Investigators are en route to the base, the FAA said. ""We do not know the cause of the decompression,"" said Ian Gregor of the FAA. Southwest said in a statement that the flight crew ""discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft."" A new aircraft is en route to the base with maintenance, ground crew and customer service agents ""to assess the damaged aircraft and support the 118 customers aboard."" Hansen said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight. He says that it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open. ""The crew was pretty calm about it. They walked around and checked on everyone,"" he said. ""But it wasn't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole, but you could feel it and hear the noise."" Hansen said that most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent. Southwest Airlines said only one injury is being reported. ""There are no reported customer injuries,"" reads a statement released by the airline. ""One of the flight attendants, however, received a minor injury upon descent."" Hansen said one male flight attendant appeared to fall, and was bleeding from a facial injury. An airport official told CNN that passengers will remain on board the damaged plane to ensure their safety, until the new replacement plane arrives. ""They have been tended to and are being given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac is near 100 degrees,"" said Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse. One of the passengers told CNN affiliate KOVR that the incident occurred shortly after flight attendants took drink orders. ""I heard a huge sound and oxygen masks came down and we started making a rapid decent. They said we'd be making an emergency landing,"" said the passenger, identified only as Cindy. ""There was a hole in the fuselage about 3 feet long. You could see the insulation and the wiring. You could see a tear the length of one of the ceiling panels."" A spokeswoman for Boeing declined to comment on possible causes of the incident. ""The 737 has an outstanding safety record,"" said Julie O'Donnell. ""We are in communication with the (National Transportation Safety Board) and stand ready to assist.""

"(EW.com) -- The challenges involved in bringing ""Men in Black 3"" to the screen -- the ever changing script, the production delays, the budget that reportedly soared past $215 million -- are not exactly a secret. If the thing had been a cakewalk, odds are we wouldn't be sitting here 10 full years after the last installment of the sci-fi-comedy series, gearing up for the new film's May 25 release. But co-star Josh Brolin had his own personal slice of misery to contend with in the making of ""MiB3"": honing his impression of Tommy Lee Jones. The film's storyline has Will Smith's Agent J traveling back in time to 1969 to prevent an alien baddie named Boris (played by Jemaine Clement) from assassinating Jones' Agent K -- and the critical job of playing that younger incarnation of K fell to Brolin. ""That was the toughest thing I'll ever do,"" Brolin tells EW. ""I'm literally reliving it with you right now, and I'm so happy to be able to laugh about it."" Brolin had worked with Jones twice before -- in the 2007 films In the Valley of Elah and ""No Country for Old Men"" -- and gotten a chance to study the actor's very specific and sometimes, shall we say, prickly vibe up close. ""The ambiance that Tommy creates on a set is just unparalleled,"" Brolin says, laughing. ""The tension is f***ing amazing. I just found it fascinating. I grew up with a lot of cowboys, so it doesn't affect me as deeply as it would the urban norm. I just laugh at it. But it's still uncomfortable. That's his genius: 'How can I make this the most uncomfortable moment anybody has ever had in the world?' There's no way he's thinking it -- it's just intrinsic."" From observing Jones, Brolin had developed a decent impression of the actor's deadpan, laconic, staccato way of speaking that, by chance, he shared with ""Men in Black 3"" director Barry Sonnenfeld one night at a dinner with the Coen brothers during the ""No Country"" shoot. It was good enough to convince Sonnenfeld that Brolin was the only choice to play the young Agent K. Still, Brolin wasn't initially convinced he quite fit the part: ""It's like, 'Why me?' I don't know if it's the Americana people see in me and Tommy. Or if it's the size of our skulls. Or if there's a Cro-Magnon feeling when you look at us -- sort of a silverback thing."" Whatever their resemblance, the prospect of going from a casual impression of Jones to a full-fledged performance as young K was terrifying, Brolin says. ""I did lots and lots of practicing [in the months leading up to production],"" he says. ""I was just sitting there with Garage Band [recording myself] going, 'Hey, how ya doin'? Hey, how ya doin'?' --- over and over, for days and months, thinking, 'I'm going to sound like an idiot in this film.' I was down in Mexico at one point with a buddy of mine and I was so frustrated, I got so drunk -- the stress level was just so high. I never felt like I had it, and I still don't."" By all accounts (and judging from the movie's trailer), Brolin nailed the performance, much as he did with his well-received turn as George W. Bush in Oliver Stone's ""W."" ""You don't want it to be showboat-y,"" Brolin says. ""The hope is after five minutes everyone will forget they're watching me doing Tommy playing K and just kind of lend themselves to the story."" But what was Jones' own take on Brolin's performance? Brolin isn't quite sure. ""I didn't ever do Tommy in front of Tommy,"" he says. ""I know Tommy just saw the movie -- and his only comment was that he really liked [actor Michael Stuhlbarg's character] Griffin."" He laughs. ""Tommy's tough."" See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- On the eve of the Grammys in 2009, when news surfaced that singer Chris Brown assaulted his girlfriend, Rihanna, the cruel reality of violence against women came to the forefront. Police reports, narrative accounts and photographs told a chilling tale of what happened that night. In the ensuing months, Rihanna's responses to the violence she received faced public scrutiny. Everyone hoped that she would do what most of us believed was the right thing to do: Leave the relationship. When she did eventually leave, there was a collective admiration for her ability to move on, which sent a clear message that violence against women is wrong. She was lauded as a role model to women and young girls, and became a celebrity symbol of strength and survivorship. Fast-forward to today. Rihanna is collaborating with Brown again. Some people are mad and disapprove of her decision to let Brown back into her life, especially given the ""role model"" status that had been assigned to her. Personally, I am not outraged. Before you think I'm a fan of Brown (I'm not), here's my rationale: Rihanna did not ask to be a role model, no more than she asked to be abused. In the United States, one in three women experiences violence. Rihanna is unfortunately one of these women. Like other abused women, she is being judged unfairly for her relationship with her abusive former partner. One of the first things people ask after learning that a woman has been abused is, ""Why don't you just leave?"" While this is a seemingly innocuous suggestion, it really isn't that simple. When a woman leaves and then returns to her partner or tries to stay on amicable terms, she can elicit a backlash. No wonder some people have commented that Rihanna must ""enjoy being abused."" I don't know anyone who enjoys being abused. What I do know is that domestic violence is a vicious cycle. Leaving an abusive partner is a process that can take months, if not years. One woman I know stayed in her relationship for almost 25 years before she was able to finally leave. Moreover, most women leave their partners more than once. Studies have indicated that a woman leaves her abuser an average of eight times before leaving permanently. We cannot be certain, but it is possible that Rihanna is still in the process of leaving. Thus, the fact that she and Brown are working together now after the incident of three years ago is not surprising. However, the bigger issue is Brown's lack of accountability in all of this. Even in a society where many of us would agree that violence against women is wrong, we hold strong patriarchal values where males are seen as more dominant and privileged than women. We hold Rihanna fully accountable as a role model and place her decisions under harsh judgment. Yet Brown is not held as accountable for his ability to influence young men. Granted, even though he issued a public apology to Rihanna a few weeks after he assaulted her, his motives are less probed (certainly not by the same people who believe that Rihanna likes to be abused). So the question everyone is asking should not be: ""Why is Rihanna going back to (or working with) Chris Brown?"" Rather, it should be: ""What kind of messages are we sending our children when we focus on and denounce the decisions of women who have been mistreated but spare perpetrators the same level of scrutiny?"" This blame-the-victim mentality has got to stop somewhere. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than a year since Haiti was rocked by an earthquake, leaving about 230,000 people dead, hundreds of thousands injured and more than a million homeless. The international community was quick to provide aid, especially in the first few months after the earthquake. But the devastation didn't end with the natural disaster. Haitians are still dealing with a cholera epidemic that killed more than 2,000 people at the start of the year. Here are five ways you can help alleviate some of the Haitian people's suffering: . 1. Donate money  You can make a difference by donating to one of the many organizations providing relief. Most nonprofits make it easy to send money -- via text message, online, on the phone or through the mail. Organizations such as the Clinton Foundation break down how your money will be spent. On the foundation's website, you will see that $35 could provide six mosquito nets to help prevent the spread of malaria and other illnesses; $55 could buy life-saving medical supplies; $125 could purchase a tent to provide shelter for a family of five; and $600 could provide two portable toilets for use in crowded camps. One hundred percent of the donations made to Haiti through the Clinton Foundation go directly to recovery efforts. 2. Make personal hygiene kits  If you're looking for something more hands-on, several organizations, such as Heart to Heart International, allow you to make personal hygiene kits that will be shipped to Haiti. Close to 82,000 kits have been mailed through Heart to Heart in the past year. Instructions on what to put in the kits -- hand towels, toothbrushes and soap -- and where to send them can be found on the group's website. ""Hygiene is one way to fight disease, especially in a cholera-induced environment,"" said Pete Brumbaugh, a Heart to Heart International executive. ""There's also a benefit to the person making the kit. It gives them something hands-on that they can do to make a difference in Haiti, even though they are not able to be there."" 3. Volunteer  Another way to help is through volunteering. Many of the volunteers in Haiti are medical aid workers who are sent to Haiti through organizations such as Doctors Without Borders. But organizations such as MedShare also offer volunteer opportunities for nonmedical aid workers in the United States. Since the earthquake, MedShare has shipped 28,000 boxes of surplus life-saving medical supplies and equipment to needy hospitals and clinics in Haiti. But they can't do it without the help of volunteers who sort and package the supplies. The organization will be making at least three more large shipments in the coming months and needs volunteers around Atlanta and in the San Francisco Bay Area. Visit medshare.org for more information on how to sign up. 4. Be an advocate  An easy way to spread the word about the organizations you support is to ""like"" them on Facebook or follow them on Twitter. If you want to take it a step further, some organizations such as J/P HRO, founded by actor and humanitarian Sean Penn, also have instructions on how to set up your own personal fundraising page to collect donations for the organization. Once it's set up, you can e-mail your friends and spread the word on social networking sites. There are also ideas on how to plan an event to go along with your fundraising page. 5. Help rebuild  With more than a million people still displaced from their homes, there is still a great need for rebuilding efforts. In most cases, the best way to help is through donations to various organizations such as Habitat for Humanity. While this organization is currently not sending volunteers to Haiti, money raised over the past year has helped close to 24,000 families through emergency, transitional and permanent housing. Another organization, ShelterBox, relies on donations to send emergency shelter and other life-saving equipment to families in Haiti and other areas hit by disaster. ShelterBoxes include a disaster relief tent for a family of up to 10 people; a children's pack containing coloring books, crayons and pens; a range of other survival equipment, including mosquito nets to prevent the spread of malaria; a basic tool kit; and a wood-burning or multifuel stove.","Groups providing cholera treatment supplies and rebuilding efforts in Haiti still need money .
Locally volunteering and advocating for aid groups can also make a big difference .
There are hands-on ways to help: Hygiene kits are desperately needed ."
"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- In case you plan to see Wednesday's GOP debate, allow me to offer up some crib notes so you don't get lost. First, when you hear the candidates talk about ""job creators,"" that's just another way of saying ""rich people"" or ""the guy bankrolling my super Pac."" When someone says ""family values,"" that's to remind the audience that they don't like gay people; ""religious freedom"" means ""Christianity""; and it's not really a GOP debate until a candidate attacks the ""liberal media"" for asking questions they're too afraid to answer. Now there will be plenty of other buzz words and euphemisms that will be tossed around during the debate, but since it is being held in Arizona, chances are the most popular phrase will be ""secure the border."" We must secure the border. The candidates will argue that it's a matter of national security. That it isn't just the friendly illegal immigrants looking for work we must worry about, but terrorists, drug lords and other criminals who seek to make their way through our porous border. They will say if they were president they would build walls, add troops, even commission a Death Star to keep this country safe. Newt Gingrich has promised to build a double fence along the entire southern border, adding, """"The United States must control its border. It is a national security imperative,"" Ron Paul said ""If elected president, I would move to quickly end foreign nation building efforts and use many of the resources we waste playing world's policemen to control our southern border."" They all will receive applause, and it will all sound great ... until you realize that ""secure the border"" is slang for ""keep the Mexicans out."" Oh boy, here comes the black guy playing the race card again. Yep, that's me -- pointing out that the Canadian border is largely ignored in this dialogue despite being more than twice the size of the Mexican border and less than 1% secure, according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office. Even if we were to disregard the 1,538 miles between Alaska and Canada, the 3,987 mile border connecting the lower 48 to our neighbors up north is still much larger than the 1,933-mile stretch that connects us to Mexico. And yet the attention we give the northern border is miniscule at best when compared to the resources we allocate to the south. There are definitely reasons for serious concern about safety along the Mexican border, but according to our own intelligence, Mexico should hardly be our only concern. You would think presidential hopefuls genuinely concerned about our safety would remember that just four years ago, Michael Chertoff, President Bush's Homeland Security secretary, said he was more afraid of terrorists coming into the country from Canada than Mexico and that his department arrested more people connected to al Qaeda and Hezbollah trying to come in from up north than down south. This is not to perpetuate the myth that the September 11 terrorists came through Canada or defame our northern neighbors. But rather to point out the glaring disconnect between some of the crowd-pleasing rhetoric the GOP candidates like to deliver about ""securing the border"" and the more nuanced reality. For example, did you know reports show that from 2007 to 2009, the amount of marijuana seized at the Canadian border jumped 22% and that Homeland Security has seen a sharp increase in the trafficking of more dangerous drugs such as heroin, cocaine and ecstasy? Yes, there are drug tunnels along the southern border, but the Drug Enforcement Administration also found a 360-foot drug tunnel from a hut in Canada to a house in the state of Washington as well. We know an estimated 350,000 people trying to come in through Mexico in 2011 were stopped. We also know that number is down from the 447,731 arrests made in 2010 and that is significantly less than the 1,643,679 people stopped in 2000. What we don't know is how many people are illegally trying to get in from Canada, because less than 1% of the world's largest border is secure. Conversely, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the Mexican border is as secure as it has ever been, adding, ""It is clear from every measure we currently have that this approach is working."" Still, judging from the tone of the immigration talk so far in this campaign, no one debating in Arizona on Wednesday really seems to care about either point. Why? Last year a group of senators had to petition the Obama administration for military assistance to catch the drug traffickers who were using low-flying planes to move their products from Canada into the United States. Ten years after 9/11 and we still had undetected aircraft crossing the border because it wasn't the border we're scared of. You know, this whole immigration discussion would be a lot more productive if the people leading it would be more honest and stop pretending as if it's only about national security. It's a part, but the larger truth is that nonwhite people will be the majority in this country by 2040 and this browning of America scares the hell out of a lot of people, particularly some white people. The thinking goes that if the country can deport the Mexicans who are illegally here and stop new ones from coming in, maybe that trend will slow down or even reverse. That sentiment is at the core of the racial profiling laws started in Arizona and is at the core of the entire illegal immigration conversation. It's a clumsy attempt to talk about race without mentioning race so as not to appear racist . But the dialogue is transparent because if it was really about ""securing the border,"" the facts suggest Canada would be a big part of the conversation and not just an afterthought.

"(CNN) -- He won the World Cup with Italy in 2006 -- now Gennaro Gattuso is being investigated on match fixing charges. The 35-year-old was an integral part of Marcelo Lippi's squad, playing all 180 minutes of the final against France, which Italy eventually won on penalties. But on Tuesday he was named in a statement on the official website of the Italian Football Federation that provided an update into an ongoing match fixing investigation by prosecutors in Cremona. It said that four men had been arrested over matches that were allegedly fixed in Italy's top tier three seasons ago. Gattuso, as well as another former AC Milan star, Cristian Brocchi, who also played for Inter and Lazio, were not detained but had their homes raided as part of the probe which is focused on games in the 2010-11 season. The combative midfielder spent 13 years at Milan, winning two European Champions League titles, two Serie A crowns and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007. He was also part of the victorious Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany, defeating France on penalties in the final. Gattuso turned to management after his playing career ended, taking charge at Swiss club Sion before he was relieved of his duties. His next appointment saw him take the reins at Palermo prior to the start of the current league season in Italy but he was sacked after winning just two games and replaced by Giuseppe Iachini. These allegations are the latest in a long line of stories that have plagued Italian football over recent years as prosecutors continue their probe into illegal betting and match fixing. Juventus manager Antonio Conte was handed with a 10-month suspension, later reduced to four, for failing to report match fixing while in charge of Siena, who then played in the Italian second tier. Former Lazio and Italy striker Giuseppe Signori was banned for five years while Stefano Mauri, and ex-Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni have also served suspensions. Back in 2005 the Calciopoli scandal resulted in Juventus being stripped of their 2005 and 2006 Serie A titles as well as being demoted to Serie B, Italy's second league. Elsewhere, earlier this month 11 men in Estonia were charged with fixing 17 matches, including three in the Europa League -- Europe's second-tier competition -- to the tune of 108,000 euros ($146,730). In November, seven arrests were made in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into match fixing in English professional football's lower levels. An investigation by British newspaper The Daily Telegraph said one of the arrested individuals claimed that matches could be fixed for Â£50,000 ($81,500) and correctly forecast the outcome of three games played by the same team.","Former AC Milan and Italy star Gennaro Gattuso investigated in match fixing probe .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's single white glove was his trademark -- an iconic image for a performer whose career constantly set, then redefined, pop culture trends. Michael Jackson's single glove, a trademark image, started as a way to hide his skin condition, friends say . But it also was an early effort to mask a skin condition that he would struggle with for the rest of his life, say some who were close to him. Actress Cicely Tyson, a friend of Jackson's, said the two shared a fashion designer in the 1980s. ""All of a sudden, he said, 'I'm doing this glove for Michael,' "" she said. ""Michael was beginning to develop the vitiligo and it started on his hand. ""The glove was to cover the vitiligo; that's how that glove came into being."" The glove design and reason for it were not just hearsay for Tyson, she said. ""I was there when he was creating it,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon. More than the black fedora, the white socks and loafers or the red leather jacket, the solitary glove -- made famous in the music video for ""Billie Jean"" -- became a Jackson trademark. He was dubbed ""The Gloved One,"" by media and a sequined glove he wore during his 1984 Victory tour was expected to fetch more than $60,000 in an upcoming auction, even before his death. Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnie Klein, told CNN that Jackson suffered from vitiligo, a disease that causes blotches of lightening skin, as well as a form of lupus that led to rashes and flaking of skin on his scalp.  Watch Jackson doctor talk with Larry King » . ""His was bad because he began to get a speckled look over his body,"" Klein said. ""All over his body -- but on his face and hands, which is hard to treat."" It's a report that rings true to others with the disease. ""I have to wear sleeves and carry an umbrella,"" said Lee Thomas, who wrote a memoir called ""Turning White,"" which discusses his physical and mental struggles as an African-American man whose skin changes because of vitiligo. ""It totally makes sense to me."" Thomas, an Emmy-winning television journalist in Detroit, Michigan, told CNN that he shares a habit with Jackson. ""I got [white spots] on one of my hands, so I used to wear a glove to hold a microphone,"" he said. Dr. James Norlund, a dermatologist, never treated Jackson, but said the singer's use of the gloves and lipstick was consistent with the patterns of vitiligo, since the spots frequently first appear on the hands and face, including the lips. Klein said he treated Jackson's vitiligo with a cream that eventually bleached Jackson's darker pigmentation to even out his skin color. He said it was that treatment -- not a once-rumored desire by Jackson to be white -- that lightened his skin over the years. ""Michael was black,"" Klein said. ""He was very proud of his black heritage."" Regardless of its origins, the glove was never viewed as anything other than fashion by Jackson's fans, some of whom donned gloves to impersonate him. At Jackson's memorial service Tuesday, actress Brooke Shields, a close friend of Jackson's, remembered the glove in a light moment during an otherwise emotional eulogy. ""When he started wearing the glove, I was like, 'What's up with the glove?' "" she said, drawing laughter from the crowd. ""I was like, 'If you're going to hold my hand, it better be the nonglove one because sequins really hurt me.' It would dig in. ""He'd just shake his head and he would just smile.""","Single glove became a trademark, one expected to sell for $60k plus .

"(CNN) -- Those aboard an American Airlines airplane from London got to see a little more of America than they expected Friday, after their flight was diverted to Tulsa, Oklahoma, due to engine trouble. Flight 79 took off from Heathrow Airport at 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), destined for Dallas, Texas, according to American Airlines' website. The Boeing 777-200 airliner made it over the United States, but not to its final destination. It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. She did not specify what the issue was. Its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at Tulsa's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. CT (7:30 p.m. ET). One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. That means the aircraft's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport's tarmac, according to Masvidal. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa. According to American's website, it should have Flight 79's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs Oklahoma at 10 p.m. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport a few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. For those keeping score at home, that amounts to 14 hours after Flight 79's passengers first took off from London. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","American Airlines Flight 79 took off from London, destined for Dallas .

"Farmington Hills, Michigan (CNN) -- Insane Clown Posse knows you hate them. They know you don't get their makeup, that you've never heard their songs on the radio, that their fans don't look or act like anybody else's. They're OK with that. Actually, they kind of love it. ""We may never be understood till we're dead and gone,"" Joseph Bruce, known as Violent J, said last month, sitting among stacks of vinyl in the band's warehouse outside Detroit. ""Once we're gone, people will take a look at the whole picture and say, 'What the f*** was that?'"" For now, though, they're not OK with anybody taunting or discriminating against their fans, known as Juggalos. ICP founders Bruce and Joseph Utsler, or Shaggy 2 Dope, announced last weekend they plan to file a lawsuit against the FBI for labeling their fans a gang. They made the announcement during the Gathering of the Juggalos, an annual music festival that draws thousands of ICP fans to rural Cave-In-Rock, Illinois. Watch: Insane Clown Posse to sue FBI . ""This is the government's way of telling us what you can listen to, what you can wear,"" Violent J told a crowd in a video posted online. ""They're telling you that 'if you listen to this music and you support this music, you are going to be committing a crime in our eyes.'"" An Insane Clown Posse spokeswoman said the band's lawyers are deciding how to proceed, but they are asking Juggalos to visit juggalosfightback.com to report ""any negative consequence with an employer or governmental representative, including law enforcement, border patrol, airline security, or other local, state or federal governmental agency or employee as a result of their status as a Juggalo."" The FBI called Juggalos a ""hybrid gang"" in its 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment, a designation ICP's members call ""insanely ridiculous."" The report mentions a January 2011 case in which a ""suspected Juggalo member"" shot a couple in King County, Washington, and a January 2010 case in which two ""suspected Juggalo associates"" beat and robbed an elderly man. ""Most crimes committed by Juggalos are sporadic, disorganized, individualistic, and often involve simple assault, personal drug use and possession, petty theft, and vandalism,"" the FBI report said. ""However, open source reporting suggests that a small number of Juggalos are forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang-like criminal activity, such as felony assaults, thefts, robberies, and drug sales."" That's not how Violent Jay and Shaggy 2 Dope see it: ""At any of our shows, it's all love, total strangers high-fiving,"" Violent J said. ""It's the camaraderie that can't be defined or explained."" The ICP founders have seen their fans act out. At the 2010 Gathering, Juggalos lobbed rocks and bottles at singer and former Playboy model Tila Tequila, leaving her bloodied and bruised. Shaggy and Violent J take some of the blame; they say they shouldn't have invited her to the Gathering, and when they realized how negative the reaction would be, they asked her not to take the stage. Tequila was injured, they said, because she insulted the Juggalos, then wouldn't leave the stage. Even after the onslaught of press coverage that followed, they do not blame their fans. From the archives: Tila Tequila wants to end juggalos gathering . ""Juggalos come from all walks of life, man,"" Violent J said. ""This is an acquired taste, what we do. We're not on the radio. It's not something where you're going to pull up at a red light and the dude next to you is going to be bumping our s***, too... Our fans like a little background, a little story. They don't want to see us wearing what they're wearing. They want to see us jump out with fire and f****** strobe lights and confetti. ""They bought a ticket, they want to see the circus."" Starting in the 1990s, the self-dubbed ""scrubs"" quietly amassed a devoted following of fans that spans ages and backgrounds. If there's a common theme among them, it's this: The fans were outsiders who finally found a community in the hip-hop, wrestling, Faygo pop-loving pack of 'los and 'lettes. They rely on their label, Psychopathic Records, and the devotion of their fans, to advertise and distribute their music. News of the possible lawsuit came days before the release of the band's new album, ""The Mighty Death Pop,"" a multiyear effort with editions that include cover tunes that originated with Michael Jackson, Christina Aguilera and ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"" ""We're really high on things right now, not substance-ly high. We're high on ourselves right now,"" Violent J said. ""I know we're a joke to the mainstream world, but the love we get from our fans is solid and real."" They say the new album is their best work, an album of songs that took years to write and record. With so many fans, it's not the same as it was in the early years when they boasted and lied about who they were and what they were about. They can't even remember why, only that they saw themselves more as actors than artists. They still love wrestling and rap, but they started getting real about a message after Violent J's 2003 autobiography, ""Behind the Paint,"" a book he said exposed the dark truths about divorce, abuse, poverty and drugs in his life. ""We came from broken homes, but it almost feels stupid to sit here and talk about that because we had a great childhood,"" Violent J said. ""My childhood was incredibly awesome, filled with imagination, fun, adventure..."" ""Backyard wrestling,"" Shaggy added. From the archives: Charlie Sheen heckled by Juggalos . ""The poorer I was,"" Violent J continued, ""that made me who I am today. Nowadays, it doesn't take a lot to impress me because I never had s***, you know what I mean?"" ""We got to be broke as you can possibly be together, and we got to appreciate everything that happened since then together... Not a day goes by we don't sit there and analyze this, and say, 'Man, you know, we're living our dream.' ""We still get to hang out with the same people we hung out with when we were 15 and 16. They work in this building. We get to travel the world with them. And most people you know, they have their high school years, their college people, and after that, they become family people. That's all gravy, but they can't say they don't dream about what it was like when they were running around with all their friends."" After 20 years, they said they're just hitting their stride. They're sober, and never got into hard drugs, they said, but both talked about medication to stabilize their moods, to keep the pressure from overwhelming them, to keep them away from bad habits from the past. ""I love coming up here and doing what we do, then I love going home,"" Shaggy said, holding an electronic cigarette. ""It's such a blessed life."" They say they'll keep going ""till the wheels fall off."" ""Some people listening actually give a f*** about what we have to say and that feels good. I can't front about that. It feels good to have people care what's on your mind,"" Violent J said. ""We get to rock stages. I've f***** some beautiful women in my life. Straight up, two or three chicks at once. Who gets to do that s***, man? Especially scrubs?"" Want to see the real ICP? You must watch the video .","Insane Clown Posse's new album, ""Mighty Death Pop"" was released August 14 .

"(CNN) -- If Oprah Winfrey were a close friend and you had a secret to tell, she'd be an obvious choice to go to for some relief. Not necessarily because she wouldn't broadcast it, but because she'd probably hold your hand, ease the tension, listen sympathetically and not make you feel too bad about yourself if the secret's more like a skeleton. You both might even shed a few tears. In essence, this is the persona that Winfrey has crafted over the years as she's moved from newcomer host on ""AM Chicago,"" to the queen of daytime TV with ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" to the current chief executive officer of OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network. She's relatable, but still inspiring; candid without being crass; and about as vulnerable as a billionaire media titan can be. ""One of Oprah's major products is redemption,"" Kathryn Lofton, a professor of religious and American studies at Yale University, told The Globe and Mail. ""She sold the experience of confession -- of hearing somebody's darkest story, and offering to them the possibility of relief from its articulation."" As a result, Winfrey has inspired her fair share of televised confessions, from everyday guests to high-profile names. If you need to come clean and find a new path, Winfrey's the one to show you how to do it. Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong is the latest celebrity to sit down with Winfrey for a ""no-holds-barred"" two-part chat set to begin airing on her network Thursday night. In the pre-taped ""Oprah's Next Chapter"" interview, Armstrong is expected to admit to using performance-enhancing substances during his heralded career -- a sharp about-face after he steadfastly denied doping allegations. Stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from the sport, Armstrong is not only facing a mountainous public relations hurdle, but also possible legal ramifications. While Winfrey has said she's never had an interview this big in terms of exposure, she does have a reputation as a go-to for the celebrity confessional interview. In the past, we've seen notable guests drop by ""Oprah"" when they needed to get something off their chests, address missteps, overhaul their images, or all of the above. After a video appeared to catch Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, getting money for access to her ex-husband, Ferguson went to Winfrey. Ellen DeGeneres was sure to hit the ""Oprah"" show when she made the decision to come out in 1997. DeGeneres even invited Winfrey for a cameo appearance on her prime-time comedy, ""Ellen."" There was also former track and field star Marion Jones' post-prison talk with Winfrey in 2008 -- memorable for the athlete's tears -- and Whitney Houston's frank and at turns unsettling discussion of drug use with Winfrey in 2009. ""Oprah is known for giving the interviewee fair time and creating a relaxed environment,"" Sean Cassidy, president of public relations firm DKC, said via e-mail of Winfrey's draw. ""She gives the subject a lot of rope and room to talk."" These sit-downs don't always yield the answers the audience is looking for, but Winfrey has a knack for creating a rapport with her guests that makes it, at the very least, a riveting watch. (Exhibit A: Tom Cruise getting so comfortable with Winfrey that he thought it was OK to jump on her couch while professing his love for Katie Holmes.) For example, David Letterman opened up to Winfrey last week about suffering from depression and the 2009 scandal he caused when he admitted to sleeping with staffers on his late night show. ""I have no one to blame but myself,"" Letterman told Winfrey, expressing the kind of self-reflection viewers at home want to see. ""In Letterman's case -- and certainly with Lance Armstrong -- she is probing very uncomfortable, damaging and embarrassing behavior,"" Cassidy continued. ""Individuals facing these situations are uncomfortable with a rapid-fire line of questioning -- they shut down, act stiff or stick to a script. Oprah is able to create an atmosphere that is conducive to these types of uncomfortable interviews."" Part of that could be because of her brand's emphasis on renewal and transformation, with some of her content instructing participants on how to repair past damage to move forward and clear room for one's ""best life."" ""This idea of the confessional as a way of apologizing, as a way of transforming yourself ... and mak(ing) things better is something that Oprah really banks on,"" said Catherine Squires, the Cowles professor of journalism, diversity and equality at the University of Minnesota. ""All of the celebrity advice people that she's spawned like Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz, it's all about saying you take personal responsibility for yourself, and focusing on this idea that everyone has to figure out some magic formula to make themselves a better person."" Indeed, the best outcome for anyone walking through Winfrey's confession session would be the opportunity to hit the restart button -- a goal that may have factored into Armstrong's choice to come forward now and talk to Winfrey. In an interview with ""CBS This Morning"" on Tuesday, not even Winfrey could say definitively why Armstrong decided at this point to come forward, but she did say it was a difficult interview and that Armstrong ""brought it."" That euphemism may not have satisfied the skeptical, however, who have pointed out that talking with Armstrong about his transgressions wouldn't be the same as exploring a slip-up by a pop star. ""The major criticism with her interviews is that she's a soft-baller,"" said TVGuide.com staff editor Joyce Eng. ""When it came out that Lance was going to do this interview, it was like, 'Of course,' because she's not going to be hard-hitting with him. You watch 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' and Rihanna's crying on it. There's that expectation that she's going to go a little easy on him."" Winfrey herself has said that she prepared for this interview as if it were a college exam, and walked into it with 112 questions to ask -- although she didn't get to all of them. But perhaps Winfrey's CBS interview was the most interesting confession of all in this scenario, suggested the University of Minnesota's Squires. After all, it can't be ignored what a great opportunity this is for the media mogul to expose -- and, really, just help viewers find -- her new cable network. ""The fact that she did interviews about getting the Armstrong interview is interesting. ... When she had her own daytime show, she wouldn't need to do any pre-press or pre-publicity, because everybody would know that Lance Armstrong was going to be on 'Oprah,'"" Squires said. ""Her network does not get the viewership that her show got, so for her to get the Lance Armstrong interview is as much about proving she has still has it as anything about whether Armstrong is going to be forgiven by the public, or get a 'get out of jail free' card from the people who are investigating him.""","Oprah Winfrey has a reputation for being a master of confessional TV .
Stars turn to her because she creates a comfortable atmosphere .
The idea of confession and renewal is also a part of her brand .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan must report to jail by June 17 to begin serving a 120-day sentence for a necklace theft charge, a judge ordered Wednesday. After her sentencing, the court released a probation report that said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" Lohan was not at the hearing, but her lawyer entered a no contest plea -- equivalent to a guilty plea -- to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf Wednesday morning. ""I am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career,"" Lohan said in a written statement released Wednesday afternoon.  ""I support the judge's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation."" Early release formulas, required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding, will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days in jail, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said after the hearing. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" Whitmore said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner said the discounts on the sentences ""seems to be like shopping at Costco."" Lohan likely qualifies to serve her sentence in home confinement, instead of a jail cell, but the probation officials will decide that, Whitmore said. A report prepared by Lohan's probation officer and released Wednesday said, ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Despite several months in court-ordered drug rehab last year, Lohan ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" She tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines. Sautner ordered that Lohan remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service included in her punishment . But the judge rejected Deputy City Attorney Melanie Chavira's request for substance abuse counseling for Lohan.  Sautner said drugs and alcohol are not the root of Lohan's legal troubles, but  ""she's got other problems for which she self-medicates."" Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007.  Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehab. Lohan is already two days into completing her 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center. ""I have already started my community service at the Downtown Women's Center and thank everyone there for their warm welcome,"" Lohan said.  ""I hope to be able to fulfill my obligation without any press attention. I think the media spotlight should be on issues such as homelessness and domestic violence instead of on me."" Sautner said she's asked Los Angeles police to keep the paparazzi away from the center while Lohan performs her service.","NEW: Lohan: ""I am glad to be able to put this past me""

"(CNN) -- We're often told that sharing our feelings could save our relationships from sliding into emotional breakdowns -- perhaps talking it out could also shield us from the traveling blues too. A group of UK transport and technology experts has come together to create a new digital platform that would map the emotions of people using different types of public transport in real time in the hope of improving daily journeys. Whether it'd be gridlock traffic, delayed buses and jam-packed trains -- or even a stress-free and smooth trip -- the goal is for passengers to be able to use a bespoke app to say how they feel about their travel, make suggestions, highlight disruptions and see what other travelers say. The plan is to combine this data with information collected from various social media channels, like geolocated tweets, to build an intelligent tool that would offer live feedback about all kinds of journeys in different locations. Ultimately, developers say, the aim is to use a number of sources, including weather data or information about events, to help bus and rail customers plan their journeys better and save their money and time -- and frayed nerves too. ""Being able to distil useful, actionable information from a large amount of data -- it's extremely exciting,"" says Mike Saunders, co-founder of Commonplace, a UK-based social enterprise startup working on the project. ""It really puts passengers right at the center of the operation of existing services and the development of new ones -- not just in the sort of traditional customer service sense, but actually having customer-led services which are being responded to in real time."" Know your customers . The developers say the ""sentiment mapping"" project would also provide transport operators with a better understanding about the needs of their passengers and enable them to respond better in emergencies. But more importantly, they say, it would help providers to devise more effective future strategies and make bigger decision about infrastructure investments. ""What would emerge from that analysis is extra information that would allow people to develop a long term plan,"" says Stephen Boyd Davis, research leader at the Royal College of Art in London, who is also working on the project. ""In five or 10 years' time, I think people will look back at transport providers -- rail, bus, maybe road services as well -- and say how could you possibly run a business without knowing what your customers were doing and thinking?"" Smart transport . While the project is still in its infancy, the team unveiled Thursday morning a live tool mapping passengers' sentiment based on Twitter. Covering the area between London and Milton Keynes, the visualization uses a mixture of glowing green and red blobs of different sizes to showcase the sentiments of the train, bus and tube passengers traveling through the region. Every few seconds, tweets located in place pop up to unveil messages such as, ""Ridiculously hot in the tube this morning,"" or ""My bus is 15 minutes late. Hurry up bus."" The ""demonstrator"" went live at the opening of a UK government-backed innovation center aimed at exploring how to use emerging technologies to improve future transport systems. Based in Milton Keynes, the Transport Systems Catapult's space will bring together innovators, research and entrepreneurs to trial and develop smart mobility solutions ranging from sentiment mapping and driverless vehicles, intelligent traffic lights and improved airport data systems . ""This is about how to improve journeys in the future,"" says David Reid, a spokesperson for the Transport System Catapult. ""The way you get from A to B often involves loads of different methods of transport -- you might walk, take the bus, train, bicycle; how do you make all those different modes of transport more connected, how do we use emerging technologies like GPS, satellite technology, mobile phones, open data or sentiment mapping and how do we use these technologies to improve transport systems."" Looking ahead, Saunders says the sentiment mapping team is now in talks with interested parties about taking the project forward and potentially developing an early-stage tool within the next months. ""What's really interesting and exciting is the opportunity for technology to empower citizens to have a more effective voice in the way cities develop around them to meet their needs,"" says Saunders.

"(CNN) -- A line of law enforcement vehicles stretched for a mile along a rural Pennsylvania road Tuesday as the hunt for suspected cop-killer Eric Matthew Frein entered its 11th day. Area schools opened for the first time since the middle of last week, although school buses were kept off roads because of the heavy police activity. There was increased security throughout the Pocono Mountain School District, and students would remain indoors, according to the district website. ""This is an extremely difficult situation for our community,"" the school district website said in announcing schools reopened Tuesday. ""Schools will be in session but, ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school. The District will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student's perfect attendance."" For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock-down since Frein -- a 31-year-old self-styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer September 12 during an ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, attendance in the 9,800-student district was down about 30%, a school official said. After-school athletic practices were moved indoors, and home athletic competitions canceled. ""It's a difficult time for our parents,"" district spokeswoman Wendy Frable told CNN. ""A lot of parents are still a little nervous."" The shooting unleashed a massive manhunt involving hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement agents. Life in the otherwise quiet community in the Pocono Mountains was disrupted as thousands of residents were under lock-down, and schools and some roads closed near the densely wooded search area. On Tuesday, two days after authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe Frein is hiding, the search moved slightly north, police said. ""He's out in those woods right now,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters a day earlier. State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who joined the governor, said, ""I do believe that we are close to him at this point."" Tracking dogs had indicated ""we're on the right trail,"" Bivens said a day earlier, adding that thermal imaging technology was being used to find Frein, who authorities believe had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years. Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. When asked why investigators concluded that, Corbett answered that the night of the barracks shooting, Frein had the opportunity to shoot civilians and didn't take it. As to the rifle that was found over the weekend, it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen, though the items were partially concealed, Bivens said. ""Frein obviously knows we're there"" searching, he said. Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles from where Frein allegedly shot the police officers. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Opening of roads and school brings relief to those near Pennsylvania manhunt .

"(CNN) -- The pilots hardly had time to react. Two streaks of light shot past their plane as it climbed into the skies above Mombasa in Kenya. Fortunately for the hundreds of tourists on board, the two SA-7 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) fired by terrorists from a hillside close to the airport missed their target. Minutes later and thousands of feet below, more than a dozen people were killed in a bomb attack on an Israeli-owned hotel, the second part of a coordinated attack carried out by al Qaeda in November 2002. It remains the only record of al Qaeda firing SAMs on a passenger jet. But if the president of Chad is right, the terrorist group may just have acquired another batch. President Idriss Deby has told the magazine Jeune Afrique (Young Africa) that al Qaeda's North African affiliate -- Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) -- has taken advantage of unrest in Libya to seize SAMs from military stockpiles in rebel-held areas. He claimed that the missiles had already been ""exfiltrated"" by the AQIM from Libya and taken to the group's sanctuaries in the Ténéré region of north and northwestern Niger. ""It's a very serious situation,"" he added. ""AQIM is on the way to becoming a veritable army, the best equipped in the region."" Deby said he was ""100% sure"" of the information, but U.S. military officials have not publicly weighed in on the claim. When asked about the reports during testimony before Congress Tuesday, Adm. James Stavridis, the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, said he would respond in closed session. There are certainly plenty of SAMs in Libya. Video and photographs have shown rebel fighters posing with shoulder-fired surface to air missiles including SA-7s, the same type fired in Kenya. The SA-7 is a 1960s-era Soviet-made missile, later distributed to insurgents fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan by the CIA in order to disguise their true origin. But analysts doubt that AQIM has obtained such missiles. Deby offered no concrete evidence -- in public at least -- to back up his claims. He may also have an interest in playing up the al Qaeda threat in his own backyard. Counterterrorism analysts say that Deby did not add to his credibility when he said there was some truth to Moammar Gadhafi's assertion that al Qaeda was orchestrating the Libyan rebellion, a claim for which no evidence has surfaced. Stavridis said in his testimony that only ""flickers"" of al Qaeda activity had been detected in eastern Libya. Given relatively high rates of Islamist radicalization in eastern Libya in recent years, it is possible that al Qaeda sympathizers in rebel ranks could have transferred weapons to AQIM. But it seems unlikely because the rebels' overwhelming motivation is to topple the Gadhafi regime. A more plausible scenario sees AQIM buying missiles on the very substantial black market in weapons in Africa. According to Andrew Lebovich, a researcher at the New America Foundation who closely tracks AQIM, the organization's significant revenues from kidnapping, drug smuggling and human trafficking mean that it has the money to buy SAMs. ""If, and it's a big if, AQIM really did get hold of surface to air missiles and transport them all the way down to Niger, their main rationale would likely be to use them to defend against helicopter raids on their camps by French and other special forces teams in the area."" he said. AQIM appears to have already acquired some anti-aircraft weapons. Geoff Porter, an expert on AQIM, wrote in the February edition of CTC Sentinel, published by West Point's Combating Terrorism Center, that AQIM has used its rising revenues to purchase DSHK (Dushka) .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns on the black market, possibly from West Africa. AQIM has been traditionally weak in Libya, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist who is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a UK-based counterterrorism think tank. The group's leadership is mainly Algerian, and its foot soldiers are being increasingly drawn from the Sahel region of Mali, Niger and Mauritania. But there are signs that its horizons are broadening. According to a recent briefing paper on Libya co-authored by Benotman, up to 40 Libyans have joined the group in the last two or three years. And in 2009, Saif al Islam Gadhafi, one of the Libyan leader's sons, told CNN's Nic Robertson that several Libyans had joined AQIM's ranks in Algeria and Mali. According to Benotman, AQIM decided to start infiltrating Libya after the fall of the Tunisian regime in January, after years of avoiding the country because of Gadhafi's intimidating security apparatus. He wrote that ""in early January 2011, two Libyan AQIM members left their bases in northern Mali and travelled via southern Algeria into Libya. Arriving in Ghat, a remote desert city in Libya's extreme south-west on 15 January, they were involved in a shootout with Libyan security forces, killing one policeman, before being killed themselves. This is AQIM's first known armed operation in Libya."" CNN has not been able to independently verify the incident. Last week Sheikh Abu Musab Wadud, the head of AQIM, reacted to Western airstrikes by issuing a video statement denouncing the intervention as a ""modern crusade"" and promising to work to remove it. The SA-7 may not be state of the art, but it has proven crudely effective over the years. SA-7s were among the weapons deployed by Iraqi insurgents to bring down several U.S. military helicopters in Iraq. While most military aircraft are equipped with counter-measures, civilian planes generally are not. Western counterterrorism officials say they are concerned about the flood of weapons from Libyan garrisons now in circulation and the difficulty of tracking them. Most are not as dangerous as SAMs, but some just may be.","Chad president claims North African affiliate has stolen some SAMs .

"(CNN) -- My son Cole died two and a half years ago from neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, after suffering through multiple surgeries, chemotherapy injections and painful radiation therapy. These treatments (while standard for this type of cancer) were so barbaric and horrifying I would not wish them on my worst enemy. Nor would I wish him or her to have to live with the image of their child experiencing their gruesome side effects. Cole was just 5 years old. He left behind my wife Michelle and I, a heartbroken twin brother named Troy and his loving big sister Tara. Our family has been devastated by this loss. I miss my son every second of every day. By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone. A week before Cole died in our arms, he looked up at me and said, ""I'm not going to grow up to be or do anything."" Can you imagine hearing your child speak such words? Fighting back tears, I promised my son he would do ""something big"" someday. For two years now I have been fighting around the clock to fulfill my promise to my son. I do this in hopes that greater awareness will lead to desperately needed funding and research, so children can receive more humane treatments and have a better chance of survival, with fewer future complications. Pediatric cancer kills more kids in the United States than any other disease. And more than 11,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. Yet the National Cancer Institute devotes just 4% of its budget toward pediatric cancer research. Surely these statistics speak of the dire need for increased funding to fight pediatric cancer. I began my mission to increase childhood cancer awareness in August 2012. My dream was to see as much gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as there is pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The awareness generated by the breast cancer community has led to earlier detection, newer and improved treatments, and higher survival rates for those fighting breast cancer. I just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer. I started reaching out to officials at bridges, buildings and landmarks across the United States, asking that they light gold in September to help increase awareness. I was successful in getting many to agree: the Prudential Building, the Zakim Bridge and the TD Garden in Boston; the battleship New Jersey and the Liberty Bridge in Greenville, South Carolina. Many others across the United States began to reach out to structures in their hometowns. Our movement to go gold in September even took root in countries such as Ireland, Australia, Canada and Switzerland. Last year, there was more gold displayed in September across the world than ever before, and we are just beginning. Please display gold this September to help shed light on the monster that afflicts so many of our children. Lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer -- awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding, which will lead to more research, that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer. But there is another reason to light gold: It helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer. It lets us know our children did not die in vain. It shows us our kids are not forgotten. My son received most of his treatments at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. After my son died, I had a difficult time going back to Boston; there were too many painful memories there. But last September, I returned to see many of the landmarks we had crossed and passed by so often illuminated with gold lights. I smiled, with tears streaming down my cheeks, looking at the buildings and bridges shining gold and thought: . You are doing ""something big"" Cole!","Tony Stoddard's son Cole died at age 5 from neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer .

"San Diego (CNN) -- For many children fighting cancer, it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments. Two-year-old Sisi Johnson has neuroblastoma and must travel as much as six times a week to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. But her mother doesn't have a car, and Sisi's compromised immune system means public transportation is off-limits. That's where Richard Nares comes in. Nares, who lost his son, Emilio, to cancer in 2000, started a program called ""Ride With Emilio"" to provide transportation for low-income families and their children battling cancer. ""No child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation,"" Nares says. Sisi is now one of hundreds of patients who receive free rides to and from treatments. ""They help me out so much,"" says Silvia Johnson, Sisi's single mother of two who receives eight to 10 rides per week. ""They're very clean, they're sanitized ... they are always organized and on time. I don't know what I would do without them."" Nares knows firsthand what these families are going through. In March 1998, his 3-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, thrusting the family into a world of constant treatments, hospital visits and tests. Fortunately, he and his wife had a large support system, flexible jobs and understanding employers. ""We had rides to the hospital to bring Emilio,"" he said. ""We had our brothers and sisters and neighbors bring us hot meals."" But Nares met many families along the way who didn't have such support: Single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay, kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments, siblings left home alone. Nares said it broke his heart. ""It's extremely tough, not just emotionally, but now financially,"" he said. ""Sometimes, both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely. Some ... don't have (an) extra $10 to pay for cafeteria food."" When Emilio died, his father decided he had watched too many people struggle. He went back to Rady Children's Hospital, where Emilio had received most of his treatment, and asked how he could help. ""Transportation,"" they said. So Nares started picking up families in his old Buick. ""I was going every day, picking up families all over the county,"" he said. Soon, however, Nares couldn't handle the number of requests that were coming in. So he teamed up with nurses and social workers from Rady to create a formal transportation program. He hired a driver, formalized a schedule for pickups and drop-offs and started the Emilio Nares Foundation in 2003. One of the first children Nares helped was a 1-year-old boy with a brain tumor who required frequent chemotherapy treatments. With no car, the boy's mother had to leave her home at 4 a.m. and take four buses to get her son to an 8:30 a.m. appointment. ""It was over four hours one way by bus,"" Nares said. ""And after the whole day of chemotherapy, it was the same amount of time back."" Nares and his foundation stepped in, saving them a significant amount of travel time each day. Today, Nares' group provides more than 2,500 rides a year, traveling more than 70,000 miles. It operates out of Rady and Orange County Children's Hospital. In addition to the free rides, Nares' nonprofit provides support services and assistance to its clientele, many of whom do not speak English. Nares' group offers translation services and an on-site resource center at Rady to help them navigate the often-complex insurance systems, legal issues and medical diagnoses. ""Most of the families that we're dealing with are not just low-income, but they are living in poverty,"" Nares said. On Saturday, Nares will begin his ""Richard Runs California"" fundraiser to help children fighting cancer. He will run 700 miles over 30 days, starting in San Francisco and ending in San Diego. He says his work not only saves children's lives, but it keeps Emilio's memory alive as well. ""He really is the force,"" Nares said. ""Even though he's been passed away almost 13 years, it's still like he's with me. Like he's still on my shoulder or still pulling my ear like he used to."" Want to get involved?

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration wants to fine commuter jet operator Colgan Air for flying planes three years ago without giving crew members enough rest. In a letter to the airline released Friday, the FAA lays out 17 instances in which pilots or flight attendants flew without the required amount of off-duty rest time. It proposes a fine of $153,000. FAA regulations require the airline to give each crew member 24 consecutive hours off every seven days. The FAA says that between June 14, 2008, and February 23, 2009, Colgan scheduled flight duty time for two captains, two first officers and six flight attendants on a seventh day after they had been on duty for the previous six days. The FAA said one of the captains operated four flights without adequate rest. Each of the other flight crew members operated one flight without meeting this rest requirement. Crews are also required to get time off after eight hours of flying. The FAA says that in 2008 Colgan had three flight attendants and one first officer work without this required time off. ""Colgan's actions in assigning flight crew members and flight attendants to duties in scheduled air transportation without required rest ... were careless or reckless so as to endanger the lives and property of others,"" writes Christian Lewerenz, an attorney for the FAA in the letter to Colgan. Last year, the FAA proposed fining Colgan nearly $1.9 million for allegedly allowing 84 flight attendants to fly for a week after the airline was informed they had been trained on fire extinguishers that were different from those used on their aircraft. In 2009, Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing 50 people. The National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash cited pilot error as a factor, adding, ""the pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined."" One of the crew rest violations cited Friday by the FAA took place the day after the crash. ""Safety is the top priority at Colgan,"" wrote Joe Williams, spokesman for parent company Pinnacle Airlines in a statement to CNN. ""The proposed fine is based on actions that occurred more than three years ago. We believe we complied with all applicable duty and rest rules and will respond accordingly."" The airline has 30 days to reply to the FAA. The FAA in December announced new pilot flight, duty and rest rules that will go into effect in December 2013. Colgan is a subsidiary of Pinnacle Airlines and flies small commuter jets for US Airways Express, United Express and Continental Connection. CNN's Lizzie O'Leary contributed to this report.","Commuter jet operator Colgan Air did not give crews enough rest, the FAA says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed and scores were wounded in overnight airstrikes by the Pakistani military on areas in the country's northwest where militants are based, a senior military official said Tuesday. Later Tuesday, in southwestern Pakistan, an explosion on a bus carrying pilgrims killed at least 22 people. The airstrikes in the northwest came after recent militant bombings that struck military targets. The strikes by fighter jets and helicopter gunships targeted areas in North Waziristan, a Taliban stronghold bordering Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It was unclear whether there were any civilian casualties in the attacks. The military official said the dead and wounded were militants. The strikes follow two recent deadly attacks claimed by the Pakistani Taliban that targeted military areas. On Sunday, a blast at an army checkpoint in the northwestern city of Bannu killed more than 20 people and wounded dozens more. And on Monday, a suicide bombing at a market near the Pakistani army's headquarters in Rawalpindi left 13 people dead -- some of them military personnel -- and more than two dozen wounded. After the Bannu attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was canceling a planned trip to Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum takes place this week. Also in Pakistan on Tuesday, at least 22 Shia Muslim pilgrims from neighboring Iran were killed in an explosion on the bus that was carrying them in the southwestern province of Balochistan, a local official said. More than two dozen others were injured in Tuesday evening's blast in the province's Mastung district, said Shafqat Anwar, an assistant commissioner for Mastung. Women and children were among those killed and hurt, he said. Details about what caused the blast weren't immediately available. Saima Mohsin reported from Islamabad, and Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar, Pakistan.","NEW: Explosion on bus kills 22 in southwestern Pakistan .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Democrats head into the last throes of the campaign season, the party and the president are facing some of their lowest favorability and approval ratings, respectively, according to two new surveys. President Barack Obama hit his lowest point in the eyes of the public according to that poll, with just 40% of Americans approving of his job performance, the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll released Wednesday shows. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll also released Wednesday handed Obama a similar 42% approval rating. And Obama could be pulling down his party as just 39% of Americans hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, the lowest in modern history according to the Washington Post/ABC News poll. Obama steps (cautiously) back into campaign mode . That's a ten-point drop for Democrats from the same poll in August and the decline comes in part from a dropoff among African-Americans and women -- two key voter blocs Democrats will need to turn out on Nov. 4. The numbers come less than three weeks before Election Day in a cycle where the President's sagging approval numbers have been blamed for impacting Democratic candidates, especially in crucial toss-up Senate races that could help Republicans take full control of Congress. Republicans have picked up on the President's low approval ratings in battleground states by linking Democratic -- and even independent candidates in Kansas and South Dakota -- to the president. Chamber ad seeks to tie independent to Obama . And Obama has mostly avoided the campaign trail this cycle, particularly Senate contests. But Obama will hit the road to help seven gubernatorial candidates mobilize supporters in the final weeks of campaigning. Some Democratic Senate candidates have attempted to deflect Republican attacks throughout the campaign by distancing themselves from Obama policies on key issues. Kentucky's Alison Lundergan Grimes, for example, declared in an ad that she's ""not Barack Obama."" And a range of issues could be shaking Americans' confidence in the President and his party: from the ISIS threat to the public fears over the Ebola disease that has made it onto U.S. soil. Republicans continued to register lower favorability marks than Democrats with just 33% expressing a positive view of the GOP. And among independents, Democrats also edged out the GOP with 33% favorability compared to 28% for Republicans. But the public doesn't parse on partisan politics when it comes to rating Congress, slamming the legislature with an 83% disapproval rating according to a September CNN/ORC poll.","Democrats hit a 30-year low in favorability ratings .

"(CNN) -- A man has died after being attacked by a pale-headed saltwater crocodile nicknamed ""Michael Jackson"" in Australia's Northern Territory. The 57-year-old man was fishing with his wife on the bank of the Adelaide River Monday when his line apparently became snagged, Northern Territory Police said. ""It appears he has entered the water and tragically was taken by a crocodile while retrieving fishing equipment,"" they said in a statement on Facebook. Parks and Wildlife Rangers and members of the Water Police Section subsequently shot and killed the 4.5 meter (14.7 foot) crocodile, they said. The man's body was found nearby. The incident is believed to have occurred about 5.30 p.m. local time Monday (4 a.m ET, 8 a.m. GMT), police said. Peter Saltmarsh, from Spectacular Jumping Crocodile Cruise, told CNN it was the first time in his 20 years working as a guide on the river that such an incident had occurred. ""There are plenty of crocodiles up here and we don't have many problems as a rule. There are lots of signs, there are lots of cruises, there are lots of warnings and there's lots of knowledge,"" he said. Five companies operate crocodile cruises in the area with the giant reptiles distributed about one every 100 meters along the river, on the banks of which they could sometimes be spotted, Saltmarsh said. ""They normally eat fish and kangaroos and other things -- they're not after us. They're very timid and elusive animals, they're very lazy and very rarely seen."" He said crocodiles could stay underwater for up to four hours. ""Michael Jackson"" was recognizable for its pale head and had been known to locals for about 10 years, Saltmarsh said. The late pop singer Michael Jackson had suffered from the skin condition vitiligo, which caused parts of his skin to lighten. Saltmarsh said it was unfortunate that the victim had apparently entered water inhabited by big crocodiles at dusk to retrieve his lure. ""The crocodile could have thought he was any sort of an animal. It's just really, really unfortunate. This person's made a tragic error of judgment."" Recognizable crocodile . Dr. Adam Britton has been researching crocodiles in the Northern Territory for about 18 years and was familiar with ""Michael Jackson."" ""What made that particular animal special was that it had a very light colored head, so it was very recognizable,"" he said. ""It was missing part of its tail, two limbs and had a big scar on its belly. ""He was an old, beaten up, battle-scarred crocodile that everyone knew,"" Britton said. ""When this report of someone being killed came in, people knew he was pretty much the only crocodile that lived in that territory,"" he said. ""A lot of people didn't want to see him shot."" But Britton said that it was a legal requirement that the crocodile be killed so that the coroner could confirm the cause of death by, for example, matching bite marks and examining the reptile's stomach contents. Evidence also suggested that if a crocodile successfully took a human it would be more likely to do so again in the future, he said. ""Crocodiles learn patterns and routines and we know from their wild behavior that they'll actually come back to the same spot to catch a prey animal."" Britton said that he had heard of other people previously fishing from the same area where the man was taken. It had better access than most of the Adelaide River, which is mainly edged by muddy mangroves, he said. The fact that others may have fished there without incident could have created a mistaken sense of safety, Britton said. ""One of the things that makes crocodiles so dangerous is that you can do things like that and get away with it. Because crocodiles don't always attack,"" he said. ""That leads people into a false sense of security about how risky it actually it is."" In the wrong place at the wrong time, tragedies like this could then happen, he said. ""Often crocodiles will hone in on people who are actually fishing,"" Britton said. ""There have been examples of crocodiles sneaking up and stealing fish. Likely when [the victim] stepped in to get his lure back, it was right there under the water -- probably expecting a fish. As far as the crocodile was concerned that was potential food for it."" Worldwide attacks . ""It's just a tragedy on every level, there are no positives that can possibly come out of this,"" Britton said, adding that someone shouldn't have to lose their life to drive the safety message home. While ""Michael Jackson"" was not actually an Albino -- a genetic mutation -- it was rare to see crocodiles with its coloring, which likely resulted from temperature changes during its incubation, he said. ""It doesn't happen very often. But if you hatch out thousands of eggs you'll see a few examples every few years,"" he said. Britton said Michael Jackson was probably 40 to 50 years-old, meaning he would have hatched at a time when the number of crocodiles in Australia was low. Declining numbers led to their protection in Australia in 1971, but the population is now regarded as being almost fully recovered, he said. The species was found throughout South East Asia, Britton said and a database -- Crocbite -- had been created to record confirmed attacks across the world going back to the 1800s. Prior to Monday's fatal attack, the most recent suspected attack in the Northern Territory was on Melville Island, where Australian Broadcaster ABC reported that ""biological remains"" had been found inside a crocodile after a man had gone missing earlier this month.","A man, 57, has died after being attacked by a crocodile in Australia's Northern Territory .

"(CNN) -- Democratic candidates who run from President Obama in red states where he is unpopular are making a big mistake. Their holding Obama at arm's length deprives voters of a clear choice at the ballot box. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is a great candidate for the U.S. Senate and is running a solid campaign. But she made a mistake when she refused to answer the question from the Louisville Courier-Journal about which presidential candidate she voted for in 2012. Grimes should have said she voted for President Obama and then gone on to explain her policy differences with him. By ducking the question, all she did was make news out of her refusal to give a routine answer to a routine question. If Grimes doesn't care for Obama or what he stands for or has accomplished, just say so. Like most Democrats running this fall, Grimes cannot win the election without the support of the Democratic base, and the Democratic base expects her to vote for a Democratic president against his Republican opponent. Having forthrightly identified herself as a Democrat, Grimes can go on to explain what kind of Democrat she is -- a Clinton Democrat, a moderate Democrat, a Kentucky Democrat, a Blue Dog Democrat, or simply a woman who has shown voters that she is wise and if elected, will work hard to put their interest first -- not simply try to score partisan points. Grimes is more than a match for incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell. She is every bit as tough as him, without his baggage of government shutdowns, his focus on making Obama a one-term president (and failing at it), and his love of extreme partisan politics. She hit hard in the only debate of the race. ""Sen. McConnell's 30-year recordâ€”it's gridlock, it's obstruction, it's extreme partisanship that's cost this nation a 16-day government shutdown. We can't afford to go in that direction. My record speaks for itself. I'm an independent thinker who does what's right for the people of Kentucky, not partisan politics."" The best McConnell seemed to be able to do was to mock her criticism of fabulous wealth: ""Let me tell you: Her family has made more off the government in the last 10 years than I've been paid in a salary in all my time in the Senate,"" he said. OK, they are both wealthy, but what about the voters in Kentucky. Who's looking out for them? McConnell, who is the self-acknowledged ""Proud Guardian of Gridlock,"" tried to make his gun-to-the-head negotiating (My way, or I shove the U.S. over the fiscal cliff) appear as compromising. It didn't work, and that's largely why he's in trouble now. Voters truly want to believe that candidates will attempt to find common ground. Grimes, by contrast, forthrightly supported Obamacare and Kentucky's governor, calling him ""heroic"" for taking on McConnell so Kentuckians can have the financial security and health care they need. If there is one rule for Democrats this year it is, ""Don't demoralize and demobilize the Democratic base."" She may, in fact, never tell anyone her ballot vote. But, Grimes does herself, and her party, no good by sidestepping her party's leader. By electing the libertarian Rand Paul to the U.S. Senate and a Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, who has implemented health care reform on the state level, Kentucky voters have proven that they are willing to elect politicians with a wide array of views. Prior to the debate and Grimes' refusal to answer the question about who she voted for in the last presidential election, the polls have seesawed between McConnell and Grimes, but McConnell never breaks 50%. For an incumbent to be stuck below 50% is a danger sign, and Mitch McConnell is the ultimate incumbent -- a figure of Washington, D.C., not Kentucky. If she is to survive the final weeks of campaigning, Grimes must pivot back to the issues and perhaps even make some real news by saying what she will do for six years if elected versus trying to compete with McConnell on what to do to stop President Obama from doing his job for two more years. Grimes is 35 with a long career ahead of her. If she doesn't win this time, does she want the Democratic base to boycott her for decades to come? Bill Clinton started in Arkansas as a supporter of George McGovern, proving that a progressive Democrat can win in a conservative border state. She is a fiercely independent, tough candidate and is capable of providing a positive case for how she will lead. But it's past time for Democrats running in these so-called red states to positively make a case for voters to elect them based on their agenda and priorities -- and not get caught up in trying to play these distancing games that could alienate the base voters they need to turn out on Election Day.","Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate from Kentucky refused to say if she voted for Obama .

"(CNN) -- Arianna Huffington is fed up with the trolls. The founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post says that starting next month, she will require readers to identify themselves by name in the comments sections of her eponymous news site. Huffington made the off-the-cuff comment in a Q&A session after a speech Wednesday to a crowd of 4,000 at a conference in Boston, according to spokeswoman Katie Burke of HubSpot, a marketing software company that hosts the conference. ""Freedom of expression is given to people who stand up for what they're saying and who are not hiding behind anonymity,"" Huffington told the audience. ""Maintaining a civil environment for real conversation and community has always been key to the Huffington Post. ""From day one, our comments were pre-moderated, and we invested in the most advanced moderation technology along with human moderators,"" she said. ""Now we want to go a step further to evolve our platform -- which has always been about community and engagement -- to meet the needs of the grown-up Internet."" In other words, the Internet ""trolls,"" or nasty anonymous commenters, have gotten worse. The Boston Globe, which covered Huffington's speech, quoted her as saying that ""trolls have become more and more aggressive and uglier."" Websites have long grappled with how to police users who hijack comment threads with posts that range from snarky to untruthful to downright vicious, their animosity protected by anonymity. Sites like JuicyCampus and CollegeACB got the ax after existing for several years as hosts for anonymous gossip. In recent years the problem has taken tragic turns, as cyberbullying on social media and other platforms has been blamed for several suicides. A Huffington Post spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the site's new policy will be implemented next month. The spokesperson would not elaborate on specifics of the plan other than to say, ""Our engineers are working on the exact implementation plan and we will share that as soon as it is finalized."" Many news sites have moderating systems that remove offensive comments, and some sites have sought to make commenters more accountable by requiring them to register via an account on Facebook or other social platform. CNN requires people to create accounts to participate in discussions on CNN.com, but it's not a foolproof system, says David E. Williams, community manager for CNN Digital. ""We think it's really important to listen to the conversations our stories start on CNN. There are a lot of smart people in our audience with unique perspectives, so their comments can be a valuable resource,"" Williams said. ""Trolls are pretty unpleasant, but the bigger problem is that they make it harder to find and surface interesting conversations,"" he added. ""We are always looking for ways to improve the quality of the conversations on our sites."" Since its launch in 2005, the Huffington Post has garnered 260 million comments from its online community of readers, according to the spokesperson. The site's current comment policy is clearly stated online, with guidelines for users that include ""Be yourself, only yourself, and just one of yourself"" as well as ""If your comments consistently or intentionally make this community a less civil and enjoyable place to be, you and your comments will be excluded from it."" Huffington's decision to prohibit anonymous comments is better than banning all comments, said Sarah Sobieraj, a media expert and sociology professor at Tufts University in suburban Boston. ""It's valuable that she is not shutting down comments altogether, though it's sort of a Pandora's box,"" said Sobieraj, who believes that people who really want to post offensive messages will still find a way to do that make other efforts to post their opinions. In the digital age it's not difficult to create a pseudonym tied to a secondary e-mail address. ""The ability to speak anonymously online is not just for trolls,"" Sobieraj added. Many people turn to the anonymity of the Internet for meaningful dialogue about sensitive topics, such as politics or impropriety in the workplace, that prove difficult to discuss face to face, she said. Huffington's views on news-site commenters seem a little less charitable than they were in 2010, when she told CNN, ""As a writer, I love the instant feedback. It makes the site a two-way experience. People no longer want to just passively sit back and be served up information. We now engage with news, react to news, and share news. News has become something around which we gather, connect, and converse."" So what do you think about Huffington's efforts to rein in abusive commenters?

"(CNN) -- The news that a U.S. nurse tested positive for Ebola has heightened concerns about the virus. Health officials are moving quickly to increase monitoring of hospital workers treating Ebola and ensure the deadly virus does not spread. The World Health Organization described it as ""unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times."" ""I have never seen a health event strike such fear and terror, well beyond the affected countries,"" Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO's director-general, said Monday. With multiple developments under way, here's what you need to know Monday to get caught up on the latest: . U.S. DEVELOPMENTS . Nurse who treated Duncan is infected: . CNN affiliate WFAA has identified the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse who has Ebola as Nina Pham. On Monday, she got a blood transfusion from American Ebola survivor Kent Brantly, according to Jeremy Blume, a spokesman for Samaritan's Purse. Brantly was working for Samaritan's Purse in Liberia when he contracted the virus. The nurse had numerous contacts with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there may have been a ""breach in protocol."" It didn't say what the possible breach was. Duncan died last week. The nurse is ""clinically stable,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday. The CDC said others who cared for Duncan could have been infected, but so far no other health workers are showing symptoms. Tom Ha, a family friend, described Pham as a devout Catholic who always ""puts other people's interests ahead of her own."" It's a philosophy she shares with her family, he told CNN. ""They always helped other people and they take pride in helping other people. That's what this family's all about."" U.S. nurses union calls for better preparation: . The National Nurses United union says 76% of nurses it questioned in 46 states said their hospitals have not communicated a policy on the potential of admitting patients infected by Ebola. The union is asking for immediate upgrades to Ebola emergency preparations that include hands-on training and enough protective gear. The CDC said Monday it is ""doubling down"" on training and outreach to make every hospital ""think Ebola."" Ebola patient's waste disposal: . A judge granted a temporary restraining order blocking the disposal in a Louisiana hazardous waste landfill of incinerated waste from the Texas apartment where Ebola patient Duncan stayed, Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell said Monday. Caldwell had said earlier he would seek to keep the incinerated waste from crossing state lines. The company that incinerated the waste told CNN it had followed CDC guidelines and had no plans to move the waste to Louisiana. Burning is one way to dispose of Ebola contaminated items safely, according to the CDC. The virus becomes inactive once it's burned. Cameraman's condition improves: . Doctors at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha are pleased with the progress NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is making. He contracted Ebola while working in Liberia and is receiving the experimental drug brincidofovir, or CMX001. ""Feeling like I'm on the road to good health. Will be posting some thoughts this week. Endless gratitude for good vibes,"" a tweet on Mukpo's Twitter account said Monday. ""Now that I've had first hand exp with this scourge of a disease, I'm even more pained at how little care sick west Africans are receiving."" Crew breaks its word: . The NBC crew that had been with Mukpo -- and had made a voluntary agreement to self-confine -- apparently broke its word. The New Jersey Department of Health has issued a mandatory quarantine order to make sure the crew remains confined. 'At risk' patient hospitalized in Kansas: . A medic who'd been working on a ship off the coast of west-central Africa came to the University of Kansas Hospital on Monday with possible Ebola symptoms. ""He's a suspect case. We don't know if he has it. I think overall, given that he hasn't worsened today, it would make me think that he would be low risk,"" said Dr. Lee Norman, chief medical officer at the hospital. Doctors expect to get test results Tuesday, he said. ""It's really about abundance of caution,"" he said. ""We're going to keep our vigilance up."" The medic started experiencing some symptoms on the ship before flying to the United States last week, Norman said. He said he wasn't sure whether the medic flew on a commercial or private flight. Massachusetts patient doesn't have Ebola: . Testing ""determined with certainty"" that a patient at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston does not have Ebola, the hospital said. The patient had been to Liberia and complained of headache and muscle aches. Travel screening begins: . People arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- started getting screening, including having their temperatures taken, at New York's John F. Kennedy International on Saturday. Washington's Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta airports will begin screening Thursday. Cuban doctors train, then fight Ebola in Africa . WEST AFRICA DEVELOPMENTS . No relief in sight: . The number of deaths attributed to the current Ebola outbreak has climbed to 4,033, the World Health Organization reported Friday. The tally brings the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola to 8,399. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. Obama speaks with U.N. leader: . U.S. President Barack Obama and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke about the need for ""more robust commitments and rapid delivery of assistance by the international community,"" the White House said Monday. Complete coverage on Ebola . U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Spain's Ebola patient is stable: . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, is doing better after taking a turn for the worse last week. She remains in critical condition. ""There are signs of hope,"" said Dr. Fernando Simon, spokesman for the government's special committee for Ebola. In a scathing letter, Romero's husband said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister over how the case has been handled.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Music producer Phil Spector was sentenced Friday to the maximum sentence of 19 years to life for the murder six years ago of actress Lana Clarkson. Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict. That means Spector, 69, would be 88 before he would be eligible for parole. Slumped, stone-faced and wearing a dark suit and bright red tie, he sat silently throughout his sentencing by Judge Larry Paul Fidler. Spector's lawyer gave a $17,000 check to Donna Clarkson, the victim's mother, to pay for her funeral expenses -- part of the court-ordered sentence. ""All of our plans together are destroyed,"" the mother said, reading a statement on behalf of her family. ""Now, I can only visit her at the cemetery."" Fidler denied a motion for a new trial by defense attorney Doron Weinberg, who said he would file an appeal. ""The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson,"" Weinberg said.  Watch Spector receive his sentence » . ""Obviously, he's not very happy,"" Spector's wife, Rachelle, told reporters about her husband. ""I'm going to stand by him and get him out of that awful place so he can come home where he belongs."" Clarkson, 40, was found dead -- slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth -- in February 2003.  View a timeline of the case » . Spector's trial, which began in October, ended last month when jurors deliberated for 30 hours and then announced a guilty verdict on the second-degree murder charge. Fidler had ruled jurors also could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations. Jurors then were deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long ""pattern of violence"" involving firearms. ""This was not an isolated incident,"" Fidler said, noting Spector's two firearms-related convictions from the 1970s. ""The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that."" In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector ""a very dangerous man"" who ""has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth."" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out to jurors, however, that Clarkson had bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something he said a suicidal woman would not have done. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. ""This entire jury took this so seriously,"" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that ""it's tough to be in a jury,"" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie ""Barbarian Queen"" and appeared in many other films, including ""Deathstalker,"" ""Blind Date,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and the spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector's professional trademark was the ""Wall of Sound,"" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called ""little symphonies for the kids"" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" and the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, ""Let It Be,"" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.","NEW: Music producer sentenced for 2003 slaying of Lana Clarkson .

"(CNN) -- It might be a case of illegal clipping. An American Airlines charter plane carrying the Miami Dolphins home from a losing 30-13 game against the Dallas Cowboys clipped the tail of a parked plane at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport early Thursday morning, forcing both planes out of service and prolonging the team's return. According to the Federal Aviation Administration and the airline, the incident occurred as the jet was being pushed back in the west cargo area of DFW -- a pad used for sports charters. The winglet of the Dolphins charter plane -- a Boeing 767 -- clipped the tail of an empty MD-80 aircraft, causing minor damage to the 767's winglet. ""That was the biggest hit the Dolphins had all night,"" quipped one commenter on CNN affiliate WPLG-TV's website. There were no injuries and both planes were taken out of service for inspection, American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN. American brought a replacement plane and the charter left around 4 a.m., arriving in South Florida at 7:20 a.m. Thursday.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police arrested more than 200 people in downtown Moscow Wednesday and seized weapons in a bid to prevent clashes between ethnic Russians and members of Caucasus ethnic groups, Russian news agencies reported. Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti and Interfax quoted Moscow police spokesman Col. Viktor Biryukov. CNN's repeated calls to Biryukov went unanswered. Most of the arrested men are from North Caucasus, Biryukov told the agencies. ""All the detainees have been taken to the closest (police stations) for investigations,"" he said. Police seized non-lethal weapons, knives, and tasers from some of those arrested. The police spokesman said that by and large, the situation in the Russian capital was quiet and under police control. He said police and Interior Forces soldiers were patrolling streets in the central part of the city, and that large police details were posted on squares outside Kiyevsky Station and other railway terminals in the Russian capital. Interfax reported that some 3,000 Moscow police officers were deployed to maintain order after reports of possible clashes between ""radical youths"" and members of Caucasian ethnic communities. The agency said about half of those officers were deployed in the area of Kiyevsky Station. Police were checking people's papers ""as a preventive measure,"" Biryukov said. Interfax reported that despite their efforts, police failed to prevent a number of small-sized scuffles fueled by ethnic hatred in parts of downtown Moscow. Security was heavy in most large streets and squares across Moscow on Wednesday in anticipation of possible illegal rallies and demonstrations in the follow-up of large-scale clashes that took place in Moscow and some other cities across Russia over the weekend.","Police arrested them in a bid to prevent ethnic clashes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Colgan Air, a regional airline, faces a nearly $1.9 million fine after it allegedly allowed 84 flight attendants to fly for a week after the airline was informed they had been trained on fire extinguishers that were different from those used on their aircraft. The alleged infraction occurred in November of 2009, at a time the airline was under additional scrutiny because of a fatal crash of a Colgan Air jet near Buffalo, New York, nine months earlier. But it was unclear whether it was the additional scrutiny, or a routine inspection, that led to the discovery about the improper training. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, government inspectors discovered that new Colgan crew members were trained using a type of halon fire extinguisher found on Saab 340 aircraft, instead of the type installed on the Q400 planes they were staffing. On November 2, 2009, the FAA notified Colgan that crew members were not trained as required, but Colgan used the 84 untrained crew members on 172 flights during the next seven days, the FAA said. The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it is proposing to fine Colgan $1,892,000. Colgan said it intends to appeal the fine. ""We hope the facts presented in our response result in the proposed fine being reduced or removed,"" said Eric Epperson of Pinnacle Airlines Corp., Colgan's parent company. ""Colgan Air was using the same type extinguisher for both the Saab 340B and Q400 training, although the Q400 extinguisher has a hose,"" Epperson said. ""Upon notification and out of an abundance of caution, Colgan updated our training manuals and retrained all flight attendants to ensure full flight attendant understanding,"" he said. ""Safety is a top priority at Colgan."" Colgan Air operates primarily in the northeastern United States. It operates as Continental Connection and United Express.","FAA says flight attendants flew after training on wrong extinguishers .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Federal police have arrested a man they believe is responsible for coordinating the kidnappings of more than 70 migrants later found dead in northern Mexico last year, authorities said Friday. Edgar Huerta, 22, was arrested with his girlfriend Thursday in the central northern state of Zacatecas. Huerta told authorities he was responsible for the August abductions of more than 70 undocumented immigrants, later found dead in the northern border state of Tamaulipas, authorities said after his arrest. He also reportedly told officials that he had killed 10 people. Violence is common in Tamaulipas, where authorities are battling rival drug cartels. The Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel used to work together, but split more than a year ago and are now fighting for control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States. Huerta is accused of running with the Zetas and reportedly told authorities that he had directed the kidnappings of passengers on at least six buses near San Fernando, a town in Tamaulipas. The passengers were then allegedly taken to area safe houses and tortured to see whether they belonged to the rival Gulf cartel. The growing reach of the cartels has increased the risk for migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights has said. An investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from September 2008 to February 2009, or about 1,600 per month. The bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were discovered at a ranch near San Fernando in August. In the same area, authorities found mass graves this year, containing the remains of nearly 200 people. They began finding the graves while investigating the kidnapping of passengers from a bus in late March. The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the 72 migrants found last year. Nationwide, there have been some 35,000 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on the cartels in December 2006, the Mexican government says.","Edgar Huerta was arrested Thursday with his girlfriend .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Six weeks after announcing an indefinite medical leave, Apple CEO Steve Jobs surprised a lot of people when he took the stage Wednesday to unveil his company's next-generation iPad. The audience at Apple's event gave him a standing ovation and tech bloggers immediately and breathlessly tweeted out the news. ""That he came out on stage will go down in history as a big deal,"" said John Jackson, a CCS Insight analyst. ""It's a significant gesture."" Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He had a liver transplant in 2009. On January 17, he took his second leave from the company in the past two years. Speculation about Jobs' health had increased in recent weeks, with tabloids weighing in with unsubstantiated reports. Some of those rumors were tempered when Jobs was photographed in February attending a private dinner with President Barack Obama and other Silicon Valley elite. Still, many observers had expected another Apple exec, possibly COO Tim Cook or marketing chief Phil Schiller, to fill in for him Wednesday. But there was Jobs, looking thin but happy and vigorous. Whatever health concerns prompted his most recent leave didn't seem to affect his flair as an Apple pitchman. ""We've been working on this product for a long time, and I just didn't want to miss the day,"" Jobs said. He smiled often throughout his presentation, paced back and forth on stage and cracked jokes about the white iPhone that Apple has yet to sell. He also characteristically took jabs at competitors such as Google, saying Android tablets lack enough apps. Afterward, Jobs didn't venture out to the demo room, where he sometimes greets reporters and guests who are getting a first look at new products. Apple executives Schiller, Jony Ive and Scott Forstall were there instead. Several observers noted that Jobs added a black belt to his trademark black-mock turtleneck-and-jeans ensemble, which either makes him a ninja or a man wearing loose-fitting pants. The Apple co-founder's current leave has sparked concern among his cult-like followers and even spooked some investors. A proposal for Apple to outline a succession plan for its executives failed to pass at a shareholders' meeting at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters last week. Jobs didn't attend. But the health of Apple's chief, who runs the most highly valued tech company in the world, is more important to shareholders than it is to most of its customers, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst focusing on personal computing. ""I don't think the average person cares what's going on with Apple's leader,"" she said. Jobs' appearance threatened to overshadow the iPad 2 launch and may alleviate some criticisms that the tablet computer isn't a major upgrade over the original. He said the similar-looking iPad 2 has ""an all-new design,"" among other improvements. All Things D's Kara Swisher broke the news late Tuesday that Jobs was considering an appearance at the event. ""What would be a welcome change in the coverage of Jobs' personal struggles would be to show a level of respect to him by paying more attention to what bells and whistles the iPad 2 has rather than to how his jeans are fitting,"" she wrote. ""That's the truly dramatic story to watch here, rather than needlessly rubbernecking about the struggles of one man -- albeit, a very significant man -- to regain his health."" Jobs concluded Wednesday's presentation with a touch of sentimentality that also graced his January statement in announcing his medical leave. ""As always, I'd also like to thank everyone's families because they support us and let us do what we love to do,"" he said.","Many observers had expected another Apple exec to fill in for Steve Jobs on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Marissa Tarabocchia, a student at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, says she doesn't subscribe to any newspapers. Instead, she gets her news from the Web. ""I can go [online] and find out what's happening in a matter of minutes,"" she says. ""It's definitely more convenient and accessible -- and fast, easy and free."" Print newspaper subscriptions have declined for years as younger readers increasingly turn to digital sources for news. And surveys have shown that more younger readers are getting their news not through traditional news sites, but from Facebook and Twitter. That is why Tarabocchia is exactly the type of reader newspapers are trying to seduce with a saucy new marketing campaign. Dubbed ""Smart is the New Sexy,"" the campaign by the Newspaper Association of America seeks to promote the value of newspapers through several digital and social media outlets. The campaign encourages consumers to share their personal connection to newspapers through the papers' Facebook and Twitter accounts -- with the hashtag #smartsexy -- to spark conversations online. That's right: Newspapers, threatened by emerging technologies, are now learning how to embrace them. ""We want to generate a national dialogue about the value of newspaper media,"" said Cheryl Sadowski, vice president of communications for the NAA. ""We're doing this by asking consumers their thoughts on how being smart can be attractive."" The ""Smart is the New Sexy"" catchphrase promotes the idea that gaining knowledge from reading newspapers makes people more attractive -- as an NAA tagline explains, ""because a little depth looks great on you."" Three different ads will run for six weeks in more than 1,000 member newspapers, digitally and in print. The campaign launches at a time when more Americans are reading news online. Traffic to newspaper websites was up 20% in September from a year ago, according to Internet tracking firm comScore. ""The newspaper brand remains very strong in the hearts and minds of consumers,"" Caroline Little, NAA president and CEO, said in a statement. ""The campaign speaks to the many reasons people value their newspapers, and to the various platforms through which newspapers deliver that value."" Early reaction to the Smart/Sexy campaign, which some see as a desperate attempt to reinvigorate a struggling industry, has been mostly positive. ""It made me laugh when I first read it,"" said Stephanie Taylor, a senior at Oklahoma State University. ""The saying 'sex sells' has always proven to be true. Even though it isn't selling sex per se, the word 'sex' in and of itself will attract young people. Once you draw them in with the catchphrase and they read what it is really about, then it will get them thinking."" To create more consumer engagement, the campaign also encourages readers to submit videos about what their newspapers mean to them. The best ones are showcased on NAA's YouTube and Facebook pages. ""As long we can spark a conversation and get a national dialogue, that's all we hope to expect,"" Little said.","Newspaper Association of America has a new ad campaign to raise newspaper awareness .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that federal investigators' seizure of drug-test results of more than 90 major league baseball players five years ago was illegal. Alex Rodriguez has admitted using a ""banned substance"" during the 2001-2003 seasons. The decision recommended new guidelines for computer searches to prevent investigators from using information about people who are not named in a search warrant but whose private data is stored on a computer being searched. Investigators looking into steroid use by professional baseball players obtained search warrants and subpoenas for the drug tests results on 10 major league players, but they took the results on 104 players. The Major League Baseball Players Association sued for the return of the seized results, while the government argued investigators should be able to use them since they were ""in plain sight"" along with the other results during the search. The appeals court's decision says such a standard for computer searches would be dangerous to everyone's privacy as protected by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. ""Seizure of, for example, Google's e-mail servers to look for a few incriminating messages could jeopardize the privacy of millions,"" wrote the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges. The judges noted that ""some players appear to have already suffered this very harm as a result of the government's seizure."" The decision referred to news reports published earlier this summer that quoted ""lawyers with knowledge of the results"" saying that players Sammy Sosa, Manny Ramirez, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz were among those testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has admitted using a ""banned substance"" during the 2001-2003 seasons. The tests were conducted in 2003 under a collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the players' union. ""Urine samples were to be collected during the first year of the agreement and each sample was to be tested for banned substances,"" the court said. ""The players were assured that the results would remain anonymous and confidential; the purpose of the testing was solely to determine whether more than five percent of players tested positive, in which case there would be additional testing in future seasons."" The test results were taken in 2004 during searches in California and Nevada of Comprehensive Drug Testing -- the company that kept the results -- and another company that stored the urine samples.","Court rules investigators' seizure of drug-test results five years ago was illegal .

"(CNN) -- Legend has it that when Napoleon's second-in-command asked his boss if he preferred a courageous general or a brilliant general he replied: ""What I want is a lucky general."" Napoleon knew what others have noted -- on a rapidly changing battlefield, there are the things you know you know, the things you know you don't know, and the things you don't know you don't know. It's in this last category that fortunes are so often made or broken. And so it is in our careers. The big events that matter most are often those that we can least predict. You take a course in college that inspires you to change your major. You get a new job after a friend of a friend refers you to a company you'd never heard of before. You propose a process innovation that occurs to you in the shower while thinking about building a tree house for your daughter. Serendipity is the ability to take a chance occurrence -- a surprising idea, person or event -- and make creative use of it. Yet serendipity can be exceedingly difficult to pull off in the midst of our busy work lives. Why? Because we are psychologically wired to find the things that match our expectations and discount what doesn't. For most of us, our education and work environments only reinforce this behavior. We are tunnel-visioned. Yet the benefits of having a robust peripheral vision are overwhelming. Besides being responsible for so much of our innovation, peripheral vision is how we discover new opportunities and adapt to a rapidly changing world. Find the people that matter . In business we are often at the mercy of chance to locate the people that we should be working with. There was no matchmaking service that brought together Lennon and McCartney, Jobs and Wozniak, or Ben and Jerry. Each of these people put themselves in motion -- they escaped their isolated environments or routines long enough to bump into others. Circumstance brought these personalities together, but to achieve success they had to connect, see something in each other and ultimately take the initiative in pursuing the partnership. How many collaborators, new hires and customer prospects do we miss because we aren't looking for them when they appear in our lives? If the answer is ""more than a few,"" it's a good time to develop your skill of motion. Get out of the cubicle, and work for a few hours in the lobby, cafe or cafeteria where visitors are coming in and out all day. You might also attend local meetups or conferences, but rather than targeting other people based on where they work or their job title, avoid looking at nametags altogether. The people who seem least likely to be able to help you (e.g. that crazy guy in the tie-dye t-shirt) might just be the most helpful of all. See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' Use surprise events . When 29-year old Howard Schultz was sent to Milan on a business trip his bosses gave him a very focused goal -- buy wholesale beans for the coffee-bean shop he worked for. Yet he found something that deeply surprised him. On every corner of the city there were espresso bars that both served amazing coffee drinks and acted as social meeting places. He had never seen anything like it before, and he suddenly knew in his bones that this concept could be huge in America. He pitched his bosses on the idea, but they rejected him out of hand. They had no interest in becoming a ""restaurant"" business. Instead he pursued the idea on his own, ultimately creating the global phenomenon known as Starbucks. Schultz was able to see beyond the task he'd been assigned and imagined a future where the coffee-bar phenomenon had transformed the entire industry. Like Schultz, we must foster our peripheral vision to rise above our to-do lists and be ready when a surprise event occurs. Dedicating time to non work-related interests helps us distance ourselves from our primary tasks. This distance allows us to make the connections across domains that lead to insights and innovations.

In 1979 Sir James Dyson was obsessed with the idea of building a better vacuum cleaner, but it wasn't until he stumbled on an industrial cyclone at the local sawmill that he came up with an idea for how to solve the technical problem. Having an overriding purpose affects how we see the world. Dyson was committed to improving on the vacuum design, and this gave him eyes to see the solution embedded in the cyclone machine. Another engineer without this obsession never would have connected the cyclone to a consumer vacuum. By developing a strong perspective we increase the likelihood we'll run into the very things that will be most helpful to us, wherever they emerge from. Put simply, we can learn to harness serendipity as a rigorous business practice.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- It's impossible to rule out the possibility that an actress committed suicide in music producer Phil Spector's home, and that he is being unjustly accused in her death, Spector's defense attorney told jurors in closing arguments Tuesday. Phil Spector's retrial in the 2003 slaying of actress Lana Clarkson is winding down this week. ""This is a circumstantial-evidence case ... no one can tell you, 'This is what happened,'"" Doron Weinberg told the jury of six men and six women. But, he said, Spector ""did not kill Lana Clarkson, that's what the evidence shows."" Spector, 69, is charged with second-degree murder in Clarkson's death. The 40-year-old actress was found dead of a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003 at Spector's Alhambra, California, home. A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating for a total of 15 days, jurors were unable to reach a verdict, telling Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler they were split 10-2. An unnamed court official told CNN at the time that a majority of jurors voted for conviction on the second-degree murder charge, and jurors said two holdouts believed the defense's assertion that Clarkson's death could have been a suicide. Prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments Monday that Spector was ""a very dangerous man."" deputy district attorney Truc Do told jurors Spector ""has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth."" But Weinberg said everything prosecutors have done since 2003 is aimed at proving Spector killed Clarkson, and there was no ""independent investigation"" of the evidence. The prosecution, he said, was ""so focused on making this a homicide"" that everything they've done was an effort toward making that appear true. The real question, Weinberg said, was whether prosecutors ""unquestionably and clearly"" excluded the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide. ""On the basis of the evidence, you cannot say that has been excluded,"" he said. Weinberg said he believes Spector is innocent, but even so, the only issue for jurors is whether ""the government has proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt."" The case, he said, hinges on science. ""The prosecution has a story. We are telling you about the facts."" In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson, who starred in 1985's ""Barbarian Queen"" and the 1987 spoof ""Amazon Women on the Moon,""  was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself. Several people identifying themselves as Clarkson's friends testified for the defense, portraying her as a suicidal has-been despondent over her failing career. Clarkson was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death . But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand to tell harrowing stories of Spector threatening them with firearms. Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, ""I think I killed somebody."" Spector arrived at court Tuesday with his wife, Rachelle, on his arm. The courtroom was packed, with many disappointed spectators waiting in the hall for someone to give up their seat. Spector's second trial began in October. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler ruled on Friday that jurors can consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector. If convicted of second-degree murder, Spector could face a prison sentence of 15 years to life, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. A conviction on involuntary manslaughter could bring a prison sentence of up to four years. Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death. In the 1960s, he became famous as the man behind the ""Wall of Sound,"" an instrumentally dense swirl of melody and percussion underlying such tunes as the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby,"" the Righteous Brothers' ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling"" and Ike and Tina Turner's ""River Deep, Mountain High."" He later produced the Beatles' ""Let It Be"" album, John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and the Ramones' ""End of the Century.""

"(CNN) -- Viral videos of assaults on a mentally disabled Delaware man have led police to identify two teenage suspects accused in the attack, and a third suspect to turn himself in. A 14-year-old boy from Newark, Delaware, turned himself in to New Castle County Police Monday night, and officers arrested two other teen boys over the weekend in connection to the assaults. The three teenagers have been charged with misdemeanors, according to department spokesperson Sgt. Jacob Andrews. Because of their age, the youths' names are not being made public. The beatings occurred several weeks ago, but recently angered viewers across the nation after they were posted on social media using the hashtags #JusticeForCoran and #TheBullyProject.

"(CNN) -- The men jumped at the Craigslist ad for work on an Ohio cattle farm. In tough economic times, it was a job they desperately needed, a chance to pick up some needed cash. Instead, it cost them their lives. A Summit County jury opined Wednesday that the man responsible for their deaths -- 53-year-old Richard James Beasley -- should meet the same fate. After convicting Beasley last week on 26 counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and more, they unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death. Summit County Judge Lynne S. Callahan will issue a formal sentence next Tuesday, which could be death if she determines ""beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors,"" according to Ohio state law. Beasley was the man, the jury determined, who pulled the trigger, killing Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio. Scott Davis apparently was in his cross hairs, too. After answering an online ad for work on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio, the South Carolinian in November 2011 told a deputy sheriff how he'd met with two males, then drove toward Stock Township. Told a road was closed due to a landslide, Davis got out of the car and started walking through a heavily wooded area toward what he was informed was where he'd be working. He turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head,"" Noble County Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum later explained. Shot in the arm, Davis ran and hid in the forest for seven hours. Eventually, he got the nerve to go to a house and ask for help. After he told his story, authorities began to connect it with that of other missing persons. One of them was Kern, killed one week after Davis's escape. All these men were ""down on their luck"" and yearning for ""a better life,"" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said. Ironically, authorities say that one of Beasley's motive was to steal from them. He didn't act alone. Brogan Rafferty was 16 at the time of Kern's death and Davis's escape. His father, Michael, told CNN affiliate WJW in late November 2011 his son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted"" when he paired up with Beasley, insisting the teenager was a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The Stow, Ohio, resident was convicted in October on charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings, WJW reported. He is facing three life sentences without the possibility of parole -- one each for the deaths of Geiger, Pauley and Kern. All three victims' bodies were found in different shallow graves, in Kern's case behind an Akron mall with a gunshot wound to the head. Michael Rafferty said his son had unwittingly dug the graves at Beasley's direction. ""Beasley is a master manipulator. He manipulated his victims, and then he tried to manipulate the jurors into believing his incredible story of innocence and tales of woe in an effort to spare his life,"" Summit County Prosecuting Attorney Sherri Bevan Walsh said in a statement. ""I am glad that the jury was able to see through his lies and recommend an appropriate punishment.""
