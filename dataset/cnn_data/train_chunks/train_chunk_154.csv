"(CNN) -- Microsoft's rebranding of the widely used but culturally fading Hotmail service is off to a big start. More than 1 million people signed up for e-mail accounts with Outlook, the new service to which all Hotmail users will eventually be transferred, in its first few hours of existence Tuesday. But one important person apparently didn't, at least not using his full name in his address: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Staffers at the PC Pro website were able to register steveballmer@outlook.com. They weren't the only ones to notice the apparent quirk. One Twitter user also claims to have secured donotreply@outlook.com. ""[C]an't wait to see all the spam I get,"" he wrote. But it was the Ballmer grab that turned heads. It quickly led to the parody Tumblr account, Ballmer on Ballmer, on which spoof e-mails from the CEO are posted. In one, the phony Ballmer sends a photo to an account made to look like it belongs to the former Microsoft CEO, philanthropist Bill Gates. The fake Gates' response? ""Would you please not bother me with this s---? I am trying to cure Malaria."" The jokes do highlight at least one positive for Microsoft, though: People in the tech world are talking about Hotmail (or at least its replacement). The e-mail service has long remained the world's most popular, largely due to it being bundled with the near-ubiquitious Windows operating system. But it had long since lost its cachet with younger or tech-industry users, and by some accounts has been surpassed by Google's Gmail. But some early reviews of the new Outlook e-mail service have been glowing. ""After a decade as a punchline, Hotmail just pulled off the biggest victory in the inbox game since Gmail. And it might just get you to switch,"" wrote Sam Biddle on Gizmodo. Shortly after 3 p.m. ET Tuesday, the Outlook Twitter account posted a chart showing the million sign-ups. Right now, switching to Outlook is voluntary for Hotmail users. They'll eventually have no choice, although Microsoft has not disclosed a timetable for that move.","Microsoft's new Outlook e-mail service gets 1 million sign-ups in a few hours .

"(CNN) -- The rush to be the first kid on the block with the latest iPhone is on. At midnight on Thursday, the new iPhone 5 became available for pre-order online through the Apple, Verizon, Sprint and AT&T sites. On Friday, major online outlets had already moved their estimated shipping dates back, indicating a large volume of orders or limited supply of iPhones ready to ship next Friday, September 21. In the U.S., Apple says new iPhones pre-ordered online now will ship in two to three weeks. AT&T is estimating that all versions of the iPhone 5 -- black and white; 16GB, 32GB and 64GB -- will start shipping in 14 to 21 business days, which is the first week of October. Verizon is listing its delivery date as Friday, September 28. As of this writing, Sprint was the only outlet still posting the September 21 shipping date, and that was only for the two larger models. The 16GB iPhone 5's shipping date is listed as ""up to two weeks."" Hands on with the new iPhone 5 . The shipping times began shifting back just an hour after the phones first became available, according to the MacRumors blog. Apple and other outlets are not yet sharing numbers for how many units have been pre-ordered. A Verizon spokesperson told CNN only that ""Dates are based on order volumes so customers have a realistic expectation as to when they will get their new iPhone 5."" An Apple spokesperson told AllThingsD that the company was ""blown away"" by the response. Eager iPhone fans who simply must get an iPhone on day-one might have better luck with one of the stores offering in-store pre-orders. Best Buy isn't taking orders for the iPhone 5 online before its Sept 21 launch, but customers can go into a Best Buy location to pre-pay for the device and return to pick it up on launch day. The advanced difficulty level -- standing up, getting dressed, leaving the house, commuting to a Best Buy -- might mean less competition for pre-order units. A Best Buy in San Francisco had between 40 and 50 people walk in and pre-order the iPhone 5 on Friday. Walmart is offering in-store pre-orders for the first time, Bloomberg reported, but it appears the retail giant is only selling the 16GB iPhone 5, not the larger capacity versions. There's also the often overlooked Radio Shack. Radio Shack locations are taking pre-orders in person, but the locations usually only get a small number of units on the first day. Target typically carries the iPhone, but at this time the site makes no mention of the iPhone 5. The iPhone 4S is still listed as available. A final option is to wait in line on September 21 to buy a unit. iPhone launch days tend to draw lines of enthusiastic Apple fans to Apple stores around the country, many camping out overnight. Some entrepreneurial types offer their line-standing services on Craigslist, making as much as a few hundred dollars holding the spot for someone else.","Vendors offering iPhone 5 pre-sales online are moving back estimated shipping dates .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, I wrote a story arguing that smartphones have the potential to make us ""superhuman."" Commenters on the article sure didn't like that phrasing. ""Smartphones also make us SuperStupid,"" wrote one commenter, WWWYKI. ""Just watch somebody with kids in the backseat as they text 'lol wut' and run red lights."" Fair point. For all of the benefits of an always-connected society -- one where phones help people in rural areas get information they never had access to, or bring medical professionals, at least virtually, into difficult-to-reach locations -- there are plenty of drawbacks, too. As the commenters pointed out, these include physical dangers. ""The next time a teenager almost kills you while they are texting little love letters while driving you better hope you are superhuman!"" wrote open400. In 2010 in the United States, more than 3,000 people died in crashes that involved distracted driving, which includes sending texts and using the phone, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. And more than one in 10 fatal crashes involving people younger than 20 were reported to be related to distracted driving. So, clearly, there is room for concern on this front. Other commenters brought up the potential impact of smartphones on our brains. A 2011 World Health Organization report found that radiation from mobile phones that are held up to a person's ear can possibly increase the risk of cancer. The group placed these risks in the same category as those from lead, engine exhaust and chloroform. One possible solution: Some cell phone users increasingly use their phones as everything but. ""There are so many ways of keeping in constant touch with people that voice calls are almost too invasive now,"" one woman told CNN last year. Then there were complaints about what phones are doing to society. This was a big part of the online conversation. ""Smartphones have created a generation of narcissistic snobs who think they know everything,"" wrote Chemtrailed. ""Instead it's created a bunch of Google heads who wouldn't know how to blow their nose without 'Googling' how."" Here's another, from jimmy619: ""Superhuman? Really? I look around and see people getting fatter, dumber, poorer (not to mention ruder) in spite of all their gadgets. Not my idea of superhuman."" And one more, from Robert Thompson: ""One of the most disturbing things about cellphones, is that now people can't even sit at a stoplight without hitting the feeder bar that is their phone. In social situations, instead of striking up a conversation with a stranger, people now just delve into their phones. You cannot tell me that is a good thing."" The persistent pull of smarpthone technology is a common complaint. Some tech writers have addressed this by saying that smartphones, like all pieces of technology, are tools. They have to be controlled by the people who use them. But having all-the-time access to the Internet on a mobile phone can be a bit overwhelming for some people. I'll give the last word to perhaps the funniest comment of the bunch. ""The author makes a very good point,"" the commenter wrote (my inner monologue: ""Wow, one person likes me!""). ""Before I owned an iPhone, I wasn't able to destroy a single structure built by evil pigs using only a slingshot and a few live birds."" (Me: ""Oh."")","Readers react to a CNN story on the powers of smarpthones .

"(CNN) -- One of the more striking things about holding a new iPhone model is how your old iPhone, which seemed perfectly sleek and adequate just an hour earlier, can suddenly feel slow, clunky and heavy. It's a neat trick, one that Apple is betting on to help it ship new units to existing iPhone owners in the coming year. After Wednesday's Apple media event, we were given some hands-on time with the upgraded iPhone 5, as well as the iPod touch and iPod nano. Here are our first impressions of the taller, lighter iPhone 5, which we tested next to a crusty, practically fossilized iPhone 4. Opinion: The iPhone is not our savior . The iPhones and iPods were laid out on tables in the dim, windowless hall at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. Protective Apple employees made sure the devices weren't pilfered, wiped off journalists' fingerprints and visibly flinched every time someone dropped a phone (which happened quite a few times while we were there). From the front, the iPhone 5 looks just like the iPhone 4 and 4S. It actually takes a moment to register that it's taller (holding it next to a previous iPhone model helps bring it home). The display is the same retina display found in the iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S and now, the new iPod Touch but is now 4 inches instead of 3.5 inches. Then you pick it up. The phone is incredibly light, and that weight is its most striking and memorable feature. It feels almost delicate in the hand, naked without some sort of protective case to prevent it from snapping in half. Of course, the iPhone is not nearly that fragile. The body is made out of the same aluminum found in MacBooks, as well as glass. It feels expensive, not like a plastic device that could break easily. (We look forward to the inevitable drop tests.) 2007: Jobs unveils the first iPhone . On their own, thinner and lighter are interesting selling points. Yes, it feels incredible in the hand, but the iPhone 4 wasn't exactly weighing anyone down, and consumers weren't clamoring for a thinner smartphone. On the other hand, Apple prides itself on delivering features people will want before they know they want them. There has been demand for more screen real estate, and on that front the iPhone 5 delivers, but it might still not be enough for those hoping for a 4.5-inch screen, which is found on many Android devices. The new iPhone has a faster A6 processor. It did feel zippy as we flipped through the new Passbook feature, watched movies and scrolled through websites; however, these tasks weren't exactly lagging on the iPhone 4. Games were a great place to see the processor in action, where detailed graphics are rendered incredibly fast. Also noticeably speedy was the new panorama feature in the camera app, which processed a 360-degree image of the room almost instantly. For many similar third-party apps, there's a short wait time while the images are stitched together. The demo devices were all running the new version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 6, which has Apple's first Google-free maps app. The Flyover feature turns cities into interactive, 3-D images. You can drag a finger to spin around a skyscraper and zoom in and out of the city from any angle, not just the straight-down satellite view. There is a bit of lag on the loading time when you move to a new area, but somehow the features still feel shockingly fast. Flyover is more fun than functional, but perhaps the stunning graphics and turn-by-turn directions will distract consumers from what's newly missing from the Maps app, like the very useful public transit directions feature. The room was too loud to test out the Siri voice assistant, which has turned to third-party services to improve results. Restaurant results are now powered by Open Table, movie times and reviews by Rotten Tomatoes. It has also added Facebook integration. And the devices were all connected to WiFi, so tests of the new LTE cellular connections will have to wait until we have devices in hand. Apple refreshes the iPod . We also spent a bit of time with the iPod touch. The iPod touch is like the iPhone's kid brother, always inheriting old clothes and toys. It has Siri and the 5-megapixel camera from the last version of the iPhone, as well as the A5 processor. The last generation iPod touch got the retina display and front-facing camera already available on the iPhone. But this time, the iPod touch got two of the iPhone's most stunning new features at the same time: the taller screen and crazy thin and light body (the iPod touch is actually .06 inches thinner and weighs 0.85 ounces less than the iPhone 5). The choreography of an Apple event . During the hands-on time, Apple executives milled about the room, including smiling CEO Tim Cook, who was shaking hands and giving a lot of hugs. He had good reason to be happy; the phone appears to be top-notch, its new body an impressive feat of engineering. It may not be the most mind-blowing upgrade, but that doesn't diminish its level of quality.","Most striking feature of the new iPhone 5 is how light and thin it is .

"(CNN) -- Mobile technology is critical at the airport. Yet, a new survey shows that most travelers (58%) are not satisfied with airport Wi-Fi. And beyond that, airports are missing opportunities to offer vital mobile services that could vastly improve travelers' experiences while they're in transit. This 2,700-person survey was conducted earlier this year by FlightView, which makes a popular app that provides flight and airport information. The survey shows mobile devices frequently accompany travelers: Four out of five airport travelers use a smartphone, one-third use tablets and one-fifth use e-readers. Surprisingly, fewer than one in five travelers reported using a laptop computer at the airport. FlightView predicts that by next year tablets will outnumber laptops at the airport. As a frequent traveler, I'm often frustrated by how little my smartphone and Macbook Air can help me at the airport. Sometimes it seems like the airports and airlines want to thwart me. Some airports charge fees through third-party providers (like Boingo.com or AT&T) simply to get Wi-Fi access -- and entering my credit card number over an open Wi-Fi network makes me shudder. Citing a recent New York Times story, FlightView reports: ""Many airports, including Denver, Las Vegas and San Francisco, are actually choosing customer satisfaction over ancillary revenue opportunities -- by providing airport visitors with free Wi-Fi access."" Once you manage to get on the airport Wi-Fi, access is often spotty and slow. Many airports force travelers to sit through a video commercial or other ads before they will let you access the Internet. Worse, some airports insist on placing a ""frame"" around your Web browser window with airport-related ads, limiting valuable screen real estate. That's annoying on a laptop; it's intolerable on a small cell phone screen. Speaking of cell phones, airports are huge facilities that, I've found, often have cell phone ""dead zones"" -- even for major carriers like Verizon. I'm surprised that wireless carriers don't seem to be making a concerted effort to ensure good data network coverage at airports, especially at airports with lousy, unreliable, or paid Wi-Fi access. Imagine the effectiveness of their ads displayed in those locations! One of the main things travelers want information about is the airport itself. Unfortunately, FlightView estimates that only half of U.S. airports currently have mobile-friendly websites. When your plane's about to board and you're trying desperately to find which gate your flight was switched to (because the announcement over the public address system was, of course, unintelligible), that's not when you want to be pinching, zooming, and scrolling on your phone. What do mobile users want at the airport? According to Flightview, the overwhelming majority (94%) want flight status and gate information pushed promptly to their phones. Also, nearly three-fourths want boarding alerts sent to their mobile device. Nearly 40% would like mobile coupons for restaurants and shops on the terminal and concourses, and about 30% would like information on easily accessible food and beverages. More than one-third of travelers also want to be able to book ground transportation via mobile, and nearly as many would like to use their mobile devices to share flight information easily via social media, text and e-mail, the survey found. Nearly two-thirds of travelers told FlightView that they would value mobile access to walking directions from to their departure gate, especially when changing planes on a connecting flight. Demand for this service is highest among leisure travelers (71%), who are often less familiar with the layout of the airport. Personally, I'd also appreciate estimates on the time it will take to walk to my next gate. At Chicago O'Hare, especially, I've ended up jogging for the better part of a mile, carry-on bag in tow, on more than one occasion. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Survey finds traveler dissatisfaction with mobile services at airports .

"(CNN) -- The reviews of the new Kindle Fire HD are in and many, including one from widely respected Consumer Reports, sound a similar theme: The tablet is quite good -- better than the original Kindle Fire -- but still no iPad. Consumer Reports tested the 7-inch Fire HD, which is the same size as the current Kindle Fire and is scheduled to ship on Friday. They didn't get their hands on the bigger, 8.9-inch version that ships on November 20. ""The Amazon Kindle Fire HD may not meet the company's goal of creating 'the best tablet at any price,' our tests suggest. But it's a fine performer that improves markedly on the first-generation Fire,"" reads the site's review. Kindle Fire HD vs. IPad: A comparison . Leading the CR review was a positive take on the tablet's new screen. ""In particular, glare is reduced over the HD's predecessor, creating a screen that's among the easiest to read in bright light among tablets we've tested. Color fidelity is also a step up on the old Fire, though it's still a little behind the third-generation iPad screen, which has the highest color accuracy we've measured on a tablet,"" it read. Also earning high marks were its 8 hours of battery life, improved access to cloud storage, and the addition of a physical volume button and camera -- two knocks against the original Fire. Like its predecessor, the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD sells for $199; the bigger version will go for $299. That's $200 less than the similarly sized iPad and $100 less than Apple is currently asking for a version of the iPad 2. Consumer Reports said it found ""no major flaws"" with the new Kindle tablet. But what it called ""quibbles"" included the lack of a fully stocked app store, lack of a memory card to add to its 16GB or 32GB of memory and the fact that the advertised prices are for a ""special offers"" version that includes ads. (Ad-free versions are available for $15 more). ""While our tests continue, the Kindle Fire HD shows every sign of being a very worthy tablet. It's also attractively priced (despite our quibbles), costing less, for example, than a 16GB Google Nexus 7, even if you add the cost of a charger and the no-Special-Offers upgrade,"" CR said. Hands-on with the new Kindles . The Consumer Reports review is in line with many others published since Amazon introduced the device last week. Joshua Topolsky of The Verge called the tablet a definite step forward from the original Fire. ""The original Kindle Fire felt like an experiment, a 'can we do this?' moment for Amazon,"" he wrote. ""The new, $199 Fire HD feels like something very different. A product with an attitude, a directive, a plan. And that plan seems to be something like this: hit them on price, hit them on ecosystem, and hit them where it hurts the most -- product design."" But like others, he notes that, when stacked up against the iPad and Google's Nexus 7, the device ""still has a long way to go."" ""I think it can get there, but it isn't there yet,"" he wrote. At Mashable, Lance Ulanoff called the Fire HD ""a great tablet and a great value"" while David Pogue of the New York Times said the device is ""not a disappointment"" but falls well short of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' lofty goal of creating ""the best tablet at any price."" ""The Kindle Fire HD models are attractive, confident viewers of movies, TV shows, Web pages and books. They tap into Amazon's increasingly appealing online world of entertainment and information stores. And above all, they make the Kindle Fire's industry-leading features-per-dollar ratio even more top-heavy,"" he wrote. ""But 'the best tablet at any price? Hmmm. Somebody should put a call in to the Seattle water inspectors.""","Reviews: The Kindle Fire HD is a good tablet but not the ""best at any price""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As mobile games migrate to powerful smartphones and tablets that are becoming direct competition to portable gaming devices such as Nintendo 3DS and PS Vita, the E3 convention has become a prime stage for game publishers to showcase new titles. Mobile games are becoming a bigger part of many game makers' plans as gamers will soon be able to access game franchises through multiple screens. According to the new study ""The Evolution of Video Gaming and Content Consumption"" from PricewaterhouseCoopers, gamers -- like the general consumer population -- are becoming multitaskers. Respondents who play mostly on consoles reported spending time on mobile phones as the activity that most frequently occupies their time while gaming. Sneak Peek: The evolving universe of ""Halo 4"" The rise of mobile experiences such as Rovio Entertainment's ""Angry Birds Space"" and Disney's ""Where's My Water"" has introduced a whole new audience to gaming. Here are five games worth checking out when they hit mobile devices later this year: . 'Reign of Amira,' Snapdragon, 2012 . The mobile technology company has developed this third-person perspective fantasy action game to showcase its Snapdragon S4 Pro processor. The game puts players in control of the sexy boots of Princess Amira, who's out to hack and slash her way through enemies to retain the lost glory of the Desert Kingdom. The Android game, which plays like a console arcade experience, will be available for free later this year. 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' Gameloft, summer 2012 . Gamers will be able to swing into action this summer as Spider-Man in the first open world mobile game. Although it's licensed from the Sony Pictures 3-D movie, the developer has crafted a solid follow-up to ""Ultimate Spider-Man: Total Mayhem,"" which is also worth checking out. Fans of the PlayStation 2 ""Spider-Man 2"" game will see how far mobile has come as they seamlessly maneuver Spidey through the city, battling super villains and thugs along the way. 'Infinity Blade: Dungeons,' Epic Games, 2012 . The latest installment in the iOS ""Infinity Blade"" franchise, which has already raked in more than $30 million, is actually a completely original undertaking. From the development team behind ""Gears of War,"" ""Dungeons"" is a combination dungeon crawl and fantasy action game. With an overhead perspective that will be familiar to ""Diablo III"" fans, players seek revenge on the deathless by learning how to build an Infinity Blade. Along the way there are dozens of different types of enemies to kill with simple touch controls and a very deep customization offering. 'Dead Trigger,' Madfinger Games, summer 2012 . The developer behind the ""Samurai"" and ""Shadowgun"" franchises turns its attention to horror with a first-person shooter perspective. After a virus has turned the world into zombies, the only way to survive is with bullets. With a pedigree of fun action arcade experiences, Madfinger Games continues to blur the line between mobile and console experiences. From its spectacular environments to its frenetic action pace, gamers will be coming back for more undead fun while on the go. 'Demons' Score THD,' Square Enix/iNiS . Developer iNiS continues to explore new mobile ground with truly unique interactive experiences such as the strategy game ""Eden to GREEEEN."" Its latest offering, ""Demons' Score,"" is a rhythm action shooter. Players will take control of Serenity, a college girl who can be possessed by various demons. With the ability to fly through levels, players will shoot at various creatures to the tune of original music. It's an interesting blend of genres that serves up short bursts of addictive fun.","E3 is becoming a prime stage for game publishers to showcase new mobile titles .

"(CNN) -- Embattled New York Gov. David Paterson vowed Sunday he won't give in to White House pressure to drop out of next year's election, insisting, ""I am not failing to stand up for my party."" New York Gov. David Paterson, right, with President Obama last week in Albany, New York. The nation's first legally blind governor is facing approval ratings dipping below 20 percent. ""I'm blind but I'm not oblivious,"" he said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I realize that there are people who don't want me to run."" Last Sunday, The New York Times reported that the White House was urging Paterson to withdraw. The White House neither confirmed nor denied that to CNN. But informed sources told CNN that White House political director Patrick Gaspard met with Paterson to let him know about the administration's concerns he could not win the governor's race next year. That loss could affect races down-ticket, including the Senate seat now held by Kirsten Gillibrand. ""I have spent a whole life being told I couldn't do things. I was told by guidance counselors I shouldn't go to college,"" Paterson said on Sunday. ""I was told when I was minority leader of the Senate that we couldn't win the majority. We won eight seats in four years and won the majority."" The governor also noted that a court this week upheld his appointment of a lieutenant governor, disproving those who said it would not be upheld. The message to him, Paterson said, ""was that you don't give up."" In the NBC interview, Paterson left his descriptions vague about discussions with the White House, saying he would not detail ""confidential conversations."" He said ""the president has never told me not to run for governor"" and that he's ""never gotten an explicit indication authorized from the White House that I shouldn't run."" ""They certainly sent a message that they have concerns. And I appreciate that,"" he said. He acknowledged that it has been ""a difficult week."" Asked about his wife's remarks to the New York Post that he had been ""stunned"" by the message from the White House, Paterson responded, ""Michelle is very protective of me. I don't know that I was stunned."" ""I am not failing to stand up for my party -- I fight for the priorities of my party,"" he said, adding that he is ""fighting for the people of the state of New York. ... So I'm not going to run away from a fight when I know who I'm fighting for."" Throughout the interview, Paterson cited the economic crisis and his need to cut $30 billion in spending. He said the cuts have brought on ""a hail of criticism"" from special interests, ""and that is what accounts for the low poll numbers."" One of only two African-American governors, Paterson said he does not believe race has been a factor in the poll numbers. Paterson was lieutenant governor when a scandal led to then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer's departure from the office in March 2008.","David Paterson's approval ratings are below 20 percent; he met Obama last week .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A year ago, Nintendo announced the Wii U, the next generation of its massively popular gaming system that incorporates a handheld controller with its own video screen into play with the more traditional Wii console. On Tuesday, at the world's largest video-game gathering, the company was still explaining it -- and not sparing any superlatives in doing so. ""It changes your gaming. It changes how you interact with your gaming friends. And it changes the way you enjoy your TV,"" said Reggie Fils-Aime, president and CEO of Nintendo of America. ""It's not just intuitive, not just accessible to everyone, but it stands to revolutionize your living room."" Having showcased the Wii U hardware at last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the focus at Tuesday's Nintendo event was on games: 23 of them, to be exact. They ranged from ""Super Mario Brothers U,"" the inevitable arrival of Nintendo's most enduring and beloved character, to ""Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition,"" a new take on the popular action franchise. But while the titles were plentiful, the real focus was on how the Wii U will make them different. At the forefront is what the company is calling ""asymmetric game play."" What that means is that a player using the system's new handheld controller -- it looks like a tablet computer, with a screen and buttons -- can share the same game with other players who are using traditional keypads. But that player's objectives and experience will be different than the others. ""The player with the game pad takes on a special role,"" said Katsuya Eguchi, the developer of ""NintendoLand,"" a game that will combine characters and settings from 12 Nintendo titles into one ""greatest hits"" game. ""It's playing the same game world as the other players, but with a different perspective, different information and a completely different role."" In one of those mini-games, ""Luigi's Ghost Mansion,"" up to four players using traditional controllers play as ghost hunters, while another with one of the new game pads is the ghost. The ""ghost"" sees more than the other players on the pad's video screen and plays against the others. In turning to Eguchi to create ""NintendoLand,"" the company is hoping to answer any lingering questions about whether the Wii U is simply a handheld gaming device attached to a Wii. He developed ""Wii Sports Tennis,"" the game the company credits with most clearly and easily showcasing what the Wii could do when it was released six years ago. ""For Wii U, 'NintendoLand' does the same thing,"" Fils-Aime said. ""Play it, and you begin to understand."" The game will be released at the same time as the Wii U this holiday season, Fils-Aime said. No price for the system has been announced. The Nintendo event marked the second straight day that one of the three major gaming console makers used the big stage of E3 to focus on ""second screen"" gaming. On Monday, Microsoft unveiled its SmartGlass system, which lets players use their tablets or smartphones in conjunction with its Xbox 360. Other titles announced for the system included ""Wii Fit U,"" a new version of the exercise program that has sold more than 43 million copies; ""Sing,"" a karaoke game that lets players user the new game pad to read lyrics; and, in a nod to hard-core gamers, ""Mass Effect 3,"" the latest in the acclaimed role playing-game series. On its Twitter feed, game creator Bioware noted that the title represents its debut on the Wii and that the game will be available when the Wii U launches. But ""Mass Effect"" and ""Arkham City"" weren't enough to please some hard-core gamers, many of whom are down on Nintendo for what they see as its focus on games geared toward a more casual, family-friendly audience. ""I'm not really sure what Nintendo wants to be ... ,"" said Morgan Webb, host of G4 network's X-Play. ""Nintendo has abandoned the core gaming audience even though they like to pretend they're not."" For the handheld Nintendo 3DS, the company announced upcoming titles, including ""Disney Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion"" and ""Paper Mario: Sticker Star.""","Nintendo rolls out 23 titles for the upcoming Wii U .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- With a nod to the future, Sony paid tribute to the gamer and revealed new, power-packed and very bloody titles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on Monday. Promising ""next generation experiences,"" Sony Computer Entertainment of America president Jack Tretton introduced new games aimed at mature audiences: ""The Last of Us,"" ""God of War: Ascension"" and ""Beyond: Two Souls."" Each featured video and game play that was evocative, brutal and bloody with action that drew gasps and cringes. ""This is the Super Bowl for those of us in the game industry,"" Tretton said. ""This year, Sony wants to pay tribute to the gamers."" There were no great reveals or announcements about new hardware, despite persistent rumors that a new PlayStation 4 might be on the horizon. Much of the event focused on integration between the current PlayStation 3 and the handheld PlayStation Vita and the mention of a new service called PlayStation Mobile that will bring the PS experience to mobile phones and tablets. Tretton said there will be 60 new titles for the Vita next year and PlayStation 1 titles will also be available for play on the handheld console. One new title, ""PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,"" can be played on the home console and the Vita at the same time. ""We are investing heavily (in) cross-play (playing on PS3 and Vita simultaneously),"" Tretton said. ""People can play whenever and wherever they want with cross-play. The Vita also becomes an enhanced controller for the PS3."" There will also be exclusive titles for the Vita, like ""Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified"" and ""Assassin's Creed III: Liberation,"" featuring a female lead assassin. Jessica Chobot, correspondent for G4TV's ""Attack of the Show"" said she was really impressed with the new game play for ""Assassin's Creed III."" ""I'm the kind of gamer that looks for story. I'm a big RPG (role-playing game) fan so things that have a really good story for me carry more weight for me as a gamer,"" she said. ""The fact they have a sea battle is really cool."" Sony's new offerings weren't all for adults, however. The company also unveiled WonderBook, a new accessory for the Move controller that helps bring stories to life using augmented reality. The first release for Wonderbook will be ""Book of Spells,"" a Harry Potter-themed title with content by J.K Rowling, creator of the blockbuster book series. In his remarks Monday, Tretton praised Sony's ""passionate"" fans and implored them to ""never stop playing.""","Sony introduced several new titles during E3 event Monday night .

"(CNN) -- If you've seen ""The Social Network"" or taken a few minutes to really look at your Facebook page, you may have started to figure out that what you get out of Facebook and what Facebook gets out of you are very different things. As a MetaFilter commenter once said, ""If you're not paying for something, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold."" This week, Facebook acquired the hugely popular 2-year-old photo-sharing site Instagram, paying an astounding $1 billion. Even though it was available only on Apple devices until last week, Instagram has attracted 30 million users who upload about 5 millions photos every day. With its filters and other features, Instagram helped make amateur photography a lot better-looking. Aside from picking up a bunch of snap-happy users who'll push their Instagram photos to their Facebook timelines, what is it that Facebook really gets from its big purchase? After all, Facebook already has smart ways to display pictures, and users are uploading 250 million of them each day. So it's not more pictures that Facebook needs. Sure, the deal will help Facebook get a hook in the mobile market. That's important because Apple hasn't made it easy for Facebook to move its empire onto smart phones despite a fairly snazzy app. Facebook only has to look at the numbers to know that more and more people are doing what Steve Jobs once referred to as ""interpersonal computing"" on their handheld devices. That's all good stuff for Facebook. But there's something Facebook gets from buying Instagram that could be even more valuable in the long run. When you are the product, Facebook needs to sell you to somebody; namely, the advertisers. It's a pretty straightforward transaction: Someone pays Facebook and uses the copious and detailed information that Facebook has gathered about you to stick a targeted message into the ""sponsored"" message area of your screen when you log in to your account. The problem is that right now, most of those ads feel like spam, or at least slightly improved versions of those horrifying ads for miracle creams and belly fat reduction that have been all over Internet. To help make those ads more interesting, Facebook has come up with something it calls ""Sponsored Stories."" You may have seen them show up. They're your friends' posts being repurposed as ads and placed straight into the sponsored section of your Facebook page. Posts as ads may sound scary, but in a world where we're constantly being bombarded with advertisements, there's something almost comforting in knowing that your friends are slowly becoming a more powerful tool for advertising than many of those million-dollar ad agencies pushing Budweiser or insurance policies at you. Certainly, you're more likely to care more about the endorsements of your friends than any celebrity, even if it's Angelina Jolie. But so far, most of those ""Sponsored Stories"" are primarily made from words. With only a tiny bit of space for a sponsored ad, a picture can be worth a thousand words. And here comes Instagram's role: By allowing people to push their images straight into their Facebook feeds (and straight out again as a commercial), Facebook has a unique powerful tool for integrating images in a way that were only dreamed of before. How would it work? Imagine that I take a picture of a new Fiat 500 through Instagram and posted it to my Facebook timeline along with my text. ""Just saw the new FIAT 500. Looks cool! (Like!)"" Facebook will want to sell that post back to Fiat as something the car company can promote on my friends' pages. Turning that image into an advertisement means that my endorsement stays on my friends' pages long after the original post has been topped by other updates. Because Facebook usually gets paid only if someone clicks on an ad, this kind of advertisement works to its advantage, since it is way more personal, is way less spammy and adds genuine value to your experience. (""Andrew is into Fiats? I'll have to call him up when I buy mine."") Like it or not, brands are something that have been deeply integrated into the fabric of our lives (as has Facebook). Facebook's success proves that most of us don't mind sharing our lives directly with our friends. After all, it's a less lonely life when you know that your friends have something to say about everything you do. By using Instagram's images to sell that feeling of personal connection directly to advertisers, founder Mark Zuckerberg can grow Facebook's ad revenue while creating a marketing experience that seems more personal and seamless to the users. For a company that's about to go public and already competing head to head against brilliant, powerful businesses like Apple and Google, adding the power of images to its mix of personal stories and marketing seems like a smart move. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Mayer.","Facebook acquired the popular photo-sharing site Instagram for $1 billion .

"(CNN) -- The Army is conducting ""a wholesale re-examination"" of soldiers whose post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis was reversed by the military hospital at Joint Base Lewis McCord, Army Sec. John McHugh said Wednesday at a Senate hearing. The review comes after revelations that a significant number of diagnosis had been reversed. Statistics showed staff at Madigan Medical Center on JBLM had reversed the PTSD diagnoses of 40% of the troops they'd evaluated, according to Sen. Patty Murray, Washington-D, who raised the issue at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Lewis-McChord is the home base of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, the soldier who is in custody for allegedly killing 16 Afghan civilians earlier this month. There's no evidence that Bales had been diagnosed or treated for PTSD or that his case had been reversed, though his attorney suggested Tuesday that he would make PTSD an issue in the case. ""Anybody that has seen what he's seen and done what he's done at the request of the military ... I think, would have PTSD. I don't know, I'm not an expert in that arena,"" said his attorney John Henry Browne. When that statistics came out, the Army started investigating, McHugh said. ""Clearly when you have those kinds of data we want to make sure that everything is appropriate,"" McHugh testified Wednesday at a Senate Appropriations committee hearing. He said the Army Surgeon General, Lt. Gen. Patricia Horoho, immediately asked the unit at JBLM that was evaluating PTSD cases to step down and the reversed diagnoses are being re-examined. In some cases, PTSD findings have been reinstated, McHugh said. Gen. Horoho is also investigating whether PTSD evaluations at other Army medical facilities are being done properly. Results of that investigation are not complete. Some concerned soldiers said the JBLM re-evaluation was based on the extraordinary cost of potential lifetime care for a soldier diagnosed with PTSD. McHugh said that should not be a factor in such considerations . ""Fiscal considerations are not in any way a part of the evaluation. It's simply unacceptable,"" McHugh said. ""We're doing everything we can to make that clear system-side.""","Army examining PTSD diagnosis reversals at Joint Base Lewis McCord .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- What if your video-game console, TV, tablet and smartphone all worked together to enhance gaming, movies and TV shows for you? That's what Microsoft envisions with Xbox SmartGlass, a system introduced Monday at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles. The system is the most visible iteration yet of the future Microsoft hopes to build around Windows 8, its new operating system that promises to run seamlessly on PCs, tablets and smartphones. SmartGlass is an app for Windows 8, which is currently available in a preliminary beta version. But the system will also work with mobile devices running Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. ""Xbox is on a mission to make the entertainment that you love even more amazing,"" Don Mattrick, president of interactive entertainment for Microsoft, said at a media event kicking off E3, the world's largest gathering for the video-game industry. ""With Xbox SmartGlass, we are lighting up entertainment across your phone, tablet, PC and TV in a completely new way. If you love to play games, watch TV and movies, surf the Web or listen to music, there has never been a better time to be on Xbox."" Among its features demoed at the event: using a tablet to call plays on ""Madden 2012"" and viewing maps of the fantasy land of Westeros on a tablet or smartphone while watching ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO. The technology also was used to pause a movie on a Windows tablet and then send it to an Xbox to continue watching -- and as a way to use a smartphone as a remote control. Industry veteran Adam Sessler, a former G4TV host, thinks SmartGlass could be a savvy move for Microsoft. ""They read the reality of the landscape and realized they can't compete in the tablet market. This allows them to get their stamp on every device with no risk,"" he told CNN. ""It shows a maturity at Microsoft about how people are handling their games and entertainment. I don't think [SmartGlass] works right now for gaming, but I have a few ideas on how it might work for the future."" As gaming shifts, developers scramble to adapt . SmartGlass was the highlight of a list of features emphasizing that Microsoft wants the Xbox, and its Xbox LIVE network, to be far more than just a way to play games. Saying Web browsers on other networks are ""painfully slow,"" Mattrick announced that an integrated version of Internet Explorer will be coming to the Xbox this fall. And he announced Xbox Music, a service that will bring millions of songs to the console and devices running Windows 8. But, this being E3, the big excitement at the convention was about the games. Microsoft began the event with a part-gameplay, part live-action movie trailer for ""Halo 4,"" the latest in the beloved shooter series that has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. The game is due in November. That game and other previewed titles like ""Splinter Cell: Blacklist"" and ""Madden 2013"" will use the Kinect system's voice controls to let players speak, instead of fiddling with buttons, to give certain commands. Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana was brought out to play some ""Madden,"" calling plays and audibles in real time as he guided the San Francisco 49ers offense. Other celebrity highlights included Usher demonstrating dance moves he helped craft for ""Dance Central 3"" and ""South Park"" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker talking up ""South Park: The Stick of Truth,"" a video game due to be released in March. In the game, the player is a new kid in town trying to join the foursome of Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny. The results, of course, are ridiculous. ""The only thing that really interested us was if we could make a game where it felt like you were in an episode of 'South Park,' "" Stone said. Former TV host Sessler said he was impressed with the ""really strong"" lineup of Xbox games previewed Monday. ""They [Microsoft] were showing that they aren't changing their brand. When the next-gen console comes out, the early adapters are going to be the hardcore gamers,"" he said. ""Those titles spoke directly to them."" Microsoft's presentation was the first from the three major video-game console makers. Nintendo and Sony will have similar events at E3, which runs through Thursday.","Xbox SmartGlass joins Microsoft's game console with phones, tablets, TVs .

"Loxahatchee, Florida (CNN) -- Senior citizens are common in Florida but one 74-year-old is in a class of her own: ""Little Mama"" is believed to be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity. Born in Africa, she was one of the first residents at Lion Country Safari theme park in Loxahatchee, Florida, about 20 miles west of West Palm Beach. ""She came here when the park opened in 1967,"" said Lion Country Safari Wildlife Director Terry Wolf, who has been with the park just as long. Wolf said the park's owners bought her from a pet dealer. ""It was a whole different world then,"" explained Wolf. ""Chimps in pet shops that were babies at that time could go for 10 grand."" Wolf doesn't know how much the park's owners paid for Little Mama, who was certainly no baby when she came to Lion Country Safari 45 years ago. The owners said that Little Mama was part of the Ice Capades, a traveling variety show that performed on ice across the United States, before she was acquired by the pet dealer, Wolf said. ""She was very sweet, very good with people,"" recalled Wolf. ""Obviously somebody treated her nicely."" Laboratory chimps get a new lease on life . When world-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall visited the theme park in 1972, Wolf was anxious to introduce her to Little Mama. At that time birth records for chimpanzees were not kept so Wolf did the next best thing: He asked the expert to estimate Little Mama's age. Goodall determined that the chimpanzee was between 30 and 35 years old. Splitting the difference, the park decided to put her age at 32. Claim of octogenarian chimp prompts questions . Caretakers decided to mark Little Mama's birthday each Valentine's Day, since she has a sweet tooth: Cakes, pies and sodas are among her favorite foods. She may be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity but she does not look her age when compared to other chimpanzees. Little Mama is petite, weighing about 100 pounds, and the only physical indication of her age are the gray hairs on her chin. ""Look at Cooper,"" said Wolf referring to the chimpanzee in the cage next to Little Mama. ""Cooper probably looks to you, after seeing some other chimps, like he's 900 years old (but) he's 35."" Cooper was born in Sierra Leone and spent his early years as a research test subject in New York state. ""Before he was 5 years old, he had probably 70 liver biopsies and they knocked him down with some horrific drugs,"" said Wolf. ""Right now he's suffering with severe arthritis in his hips."" Although more than twice Cooper's age, Little Mama's last physical showed her in good health with clean lungs and a strong heart. Wolf believes that excellent care in the pet industry may be the reason she is healthy at her advanced age. The life span for chimpanzees is 40 to 50 years in the wild and for those in captivity it is 50 to 60 years, according to the Center for Great Apes. When asked about Little Mama's life expectancy Wolf responded, ""I'd like to think she will be around longer than me.""","""Little Mama"" has been at Florida's Lion Country Safari park since 1967 .

"(CNN) -- The number of lightning-related injuries and fatalities has been rising in recent weeks as stormy weather sweeps across the United States. Ten spectators were struck by lightning Sunday in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, at the NASCAR race at Pocono Raceway, leaving one man dead, a track official said. Another man died in Florida Monday after being hit by lightning as he sought shelter from an oncoming storm, local media reported. According to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, an average of 54 people are killed by lightning in the United States each year. The peak month is July, with an average of 16 deaths, and June and August see about 12 deaths each. So far this year, 20 lightning-related deaths have been recorded, including the latest two fatalities -- a figure that's below average for this time of year. Texas has had the most lightning-related deaths so far in 2012, with three people killed across the state. Data shows that 85% of lightning strike victims yearly are men. At least 60% of those killed are between the ages of 40 and 69, and the day of the week when most people are killed by lightning is Saturday. Lightning Safety Tips . If you are making outdoor plans, or if you're caught in severe weather while outside, you should have a plan to protect yourself and your family. Here are some lightning safety tips: . -- If you can hear thunder, you're close enough to be struck. Seek a sturdy shelter immediately. -- If you find yourself caught in a thunderstorm in an open area, do not allow yourself to be the tallest object. -- Avoid tall trees, towers, utility poles, water, and any metal objects. -- Stay away from windows and don't use corded phones if inside during a thunderstorm. If you're attending an organized outdoor event, you should still plan ahead for inclement weather. Here are some steps you and your family should take to prepare: . -- Check the weather before heading out. -- Once you arrive at the event, familiarize yourself with the area and check with event organizers or look for signs that may instruct you where to seek shelter during bad weather. -- Designate a group meeting place for you and your family in case of an emergency. -- Use smartphone apps or a weather radio to monitor developments of severe weather, and know what county you're in in case a warning is issued. If bad weather is heading your way, you should seek shelter as soon as possible. Although the heavy rains, wind, or hail associated with a severe or non-severe thunderstorm may not have reached you yet, lightning can occur within a several-mile radius of a storm.","National Weather Service: ""When thunder roars, go indoors!""

"(CNN) -- Based on Mick Jagger's serious expression and Keith Richards' focused stare, it was clear the pressure was on. It was the summer of 1972, and the Rolling Stones were on their American concert tour for their acclaimed ""Exile on Main Street"" album. But when they were not onstage and rocking out with their fans, they were hard at work remixing tracks at the Sunset Sound studio in Hollywood. It was a heady time filled with parties and recording sessions and only one person was there to capture it all intimately -- famed music photographer Jim Marshall, who was covering the tour for Life magazine. Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book ""The Rolling Stones 1972"" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15. There will also be a show at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from July 5 to September 8, and an exhibit at EMP Museum in Seattle, opening on July 14. Some of these frames are being displayed exclusively on the CNN Photos blog. The release couldn't have had better timing as the Rolling Stones recently announced plans to mark their 50th anniversary this year. Amelia Davis, a photographer who worked as Marshall's assistant, is the sole owner of Jim Marshall Photography. (Marshall died in 2010.) Working with Marshall to archive his work allowed her to listen to Marshall's many stories and delve into his memories. Davis told CNN that what made Marshall's shots unique was that he always demanded total access to the rock stars. ""He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage,"" Davis said. ""He always had his camera with him. People ignored the camera in a sense. It was an extension of him. He had the ability to be a fly on the wall."" Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said. ""It really set the precedent for the rock star concert tour,"" she said. ""They had their own plane, lots of drugs, lots of alcohol. It was just crazy. There was a lot going on."" Davis said that Marshall's strong personality, fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as Richards. ""He was their friend,"" she said. ""He partied with them. He had their trust. As Keith said in the foreword of the book, on the tour he was like another Rolling Stone."" But Marshall most enjoyed capturing those quiet moments, when the musicians took off their performer masks and were just themselves, she said. One only has to look at photos of Jagger onstage and off it to see the different personas. ""Mick was very business-oriented,"" Davis said. ""Mick was much more serious than Keith. That's what a lot of people don't realize is that he was the businessman of the band."" Davis said that while Marshall spent a short time following the Stones, it was enough to create a bond with some of the members, especially Richards. But the most important task for Marshall during his career, whether it was the Beatles' final concert in 1966 or Jimi Hendrix's performance during the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, was to capture the feeling of music, a task that could seem quite impossible. ""Jim was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed,"" Davis said. ""He shattered stereotypes of what rock stars are supposed to look like. He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.' He was photographing pieces of history.""","Jim Marshall photographed the Rolling Stones during their American concert tour in 1972 .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Some people just aren't hardwired for the traditional workplace. If you get bored easily, have many interests, like to take risks and prefer to make your own rules, then you may be one of them. So what's an unconventional worker like you to do? Well, you can either suffer through decades of being someone's employee, unfulfilled and bored, or you can take a risk and create your own path to success by working for yourself. Wayne Rogers, an entrepreneur, businessman and actor (famous for his roles on television series like ""M*A*S*H"" and ""House Calls"") did just that. In a career that epitomizes the word ""unconventional,"" Rogers has been involved in everything from the wine-making and bridal businesses, to acting on stage and owning a film-distribution company. In his new book ""Make Your Own Rules: A Renegade Guide to Unconventional Success,"" Rogers details how he was able to triumph in such a wide variety of business endeavors, all of which were independent pursuits. Here are some of his top tips for finding success through working independently, as discussed in his book: . 1. Don't limit yourself: Many people believe that because their educational background or work experience lends itself to a particular field, that their career choices must lay within that field. Not so, says Rogers. ""This will surprise you, but the common thread to the various businesses in which I have been involved is that I had never previously been in them."" While many would see a lack of experience as a deterrent to entering a particular business, Rogers saw it as a benefit. ""It was an advantage that I had no rules to follow, no premade decisions, no 'books' to tell me how to find success. This allowed me to take a creative approach rather than an administrative approach,"" he says. ""It is my belief that the best results in business come from a creative process, from the ability to see things differently from everyone else, and from finding answers to problems that are not bound by the phrase 'we have always done it this way.'"" 2. Get comfortable with ""red tape:"" These days, even small businesses are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations, so if you want to start your own, these regulations should be learned and lived by. ""Your ability to comply with the blizzard of paperwork and reports required by various rules that come down from Washington, D.C., your state capital or your local zoning board may mean the difference between success and failure,"" Rogers says. 3. Remember that bigger is not better: Fight the urge to make growth and size the overarching goals of your business. ""Size is not efficient,"" Rogers says. ""Not that long ago, there were several automobile manufacturers, including Nash, Kaiser, Hudson, Studebaker and Packard. They had to compete with one another. Was it difficult? Yes, but it led to innovation."" By contrast, he says, today's Big Three automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- have become complacent with their products; so much so that they were overtaken by foreign competitors and forced into their respective financial crises. Keep your business small, and you keep your business innovative, he says. 4. Work with good people: Choose the people you bring into your business wisely, Rogers says. ""Pick partners and associates you trust and have them trust you. Both of these processes will almost certainly affect the outcome of what you are doing,"" he says. ""Picking whom to trust ... is based on using your instinct, observing people's behavior and judging the consequences of their actions."" In addition to being trustworthy, your business partners and employees should also share your mindset. ""I have found that it is always easier for me to understand someone who operates outside the mainstream and who looks at things differently from others in his field,"" Rogers says. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration's breach of religious freedom and freedom of conscience through the Health and Human Services agency's contraception mandate has reignited the national conversation about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare."" Obamacare encapsulates many of the major conservative objections to President Barack Obama's presidency: the vast and costly expansion of government, increased taxes and regulations and the infringement of personal and religious liberties as is now being litigated in the federal and Supreme Courts. The latest contraception mandate is only a precursor of what could come once Obamacare is fully implemented. The law itself grants the Health and Human Services Secretary -- an unelected bureaucrat -- far reaching powers. One breakdown of the law found more than 700 mentions to instruct that the secretary ""shall"" take action and more than 200 cases in which the secretary ""may"" issue regulations. We won't know the full extent of the secretary's power until Obamacare is enforced, but if the contraception mandate is any indication, the secretary could have the power to regulate what health care Americans receive, what doctors they see and what insurance coverage they are eligible for. Therefore, the Republican message in 2012 shouldn't focus singularly on the economy. Politically, that would be unwise. Even just the rumblings and perception of an economic recovery could be enough to carry President Obama to re-election. Instead, Republicans should get back to the message of 2010, the year of the tea party and the retaking of the House of Representatives. For Republicans, the stakes are economic liberty and the integrity of the Constitution. Thus, the message of the tea party is more relevant now than ever. There are many Americans who see past the Obama administration's rhetoric. They understand that a right created by the government, free access to birth control, does not trump the First Amendment and the freedom of religion or conscience. A new CNN poll, indeed, shows that half of all Americans disapprove of this new policy, while 44% approve. I believe the more this policy is explained, the more the former number will increase and the latter contract. The contraception mandate is reason alone that Obamacare should be repealed, but the list doesn't stop there. In 2013, Obamacare will unleash an avalanche of taxes on individuals, businesses and insurers. (The list is quite long.) Individuals and families who do not purchase the qualifying government health insurance will be forced to pay an income surtax, and employers who do not offer insurance will be penalized through additional taxes. Highest earners will be hit with new surtaxes on investments and an increase in the Medicare payroll tax. The medical business will bear the brunt of a new 2.3% excise tax on medical device manufacturers and importers. Already, Obamacare has stifled job creation and economic recovery. In a recent Gallup survey, nearly half of all small business owners who aren't hiring cite health care costs and government regulations as the reasons why. Stryker, the maker of artificial hips and knees, already announced it would lay off 5% of its global workforce because of the medical device tax. Furthermore, Obamacare will dramatically increase the cost of government health care and welfare programs while growing the national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office's estimates and budget outlook for the next decade, by 2022, spending on federal health care programs across the board will more than double. In particular, federal outlays for Medicaid will double, and spending per beneficiary in Medicare Part D will also double. The shellacking that Democrats took in the 2010 elections was largely a referendum on Obamacare. Today still, the president's landmark legislation remains a winning issue for conservatives. The latest Rasmussen poll shows that 53% of Americans at least somewhat favor repeal of the health care law and 38% oppose it. Regardless of what the Supreme Court rules in the spring, Obamacare is indelibly symbolic of President Obama's record. Conservatives are economically, morally and philosophically opposed to Obamacare. Yet until now, there has been low turnout in some of the recent GOP presidential primaries and caucuses. To reverse that, Obamacare, representing all that it means, should be the rallying cry that will reinvigorate and enlarge the base of opposition to the president -- again.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- For years, China has been pumping billions of dollars across Africa to build large-scale infrastructure projects and grant cheap loans in exchange for access to the continent's natural resources and growing markets. And lately, along with its economic and political engagements, Beijing has also been making significant strides in expanding its media engagements in Africa. In January, the Chinese Central Television (CCTV), a state-owned news behemoth with bureaus all over the world, chose the Kenyan capital of Nairobi as the location of its first broadcast hub outside its Beijing headquarters. Analysts say it's all part of efforts to win the hearts and minds of people in the continent and create a more fertile business environment. ""CCTV's expansion in Africa is mainly one step of this whole national engine into Africa,"" says analyst Jinghao Lu of Frontier Advisory. ""China's investment in Africa has increased several folds in the last several years and the trade between China and the whole continent has reached $166 billion, so China really has a very significant show up at this continent."" Read related: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? Over the last decade, China, Africa's largest trade partner, has quietly invested significant sums in building communications infrastructure across Africa, providing technical upgrades for state broadcasters and training journalists from across the continent. At the same time it has been rapidly expanding its presence on the continent's media landscape. Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, is leading Beijing's inroads with more than 20 bureaus in the continent. In 2008, it launched the China African News Service while in April last year it teamed up with telecommunications firm Safaricom to start a mobile newspaper in Kenya. And now, China's media strategy in Africa has taken a step further by providing customer-oriented news offerings and poaching some of the best journalistic talents to bring African news to the continent and to the world. Mark Masaai, the Kenyan anchor of CCTV's flagship show ""Africa Live,"" says the mission of his program is to change the narrative about Africa. ""Of course, it goes without saying, it's war, it is about hunger, we have all of that, yes, but tilt the scale and if you can show the potential and the solution to these and not just point out blatantly the bad side, the problems, the crises that we have,"" he says from the state-of-the-art CCTV studios in Nairobi. Read related: The Africans looking to make it in China . Pang Xinhua, managing editor of CCTV, says existing coverage is often one-sided. ""We have the news of what is happening in Africa. We tell a positive story of African people,"" he says. But analysts say that CCTV's expansion in Africa is a way for Beijing to change the narrative of China's involvement in Africa from one of exploitation to one of opportunity -- China's deepening engagement with Africa is often portrayed as pillaging the resource-rich continent, giving very little in return. For Yu-Shan Wu, a researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, the efforts by the Chinese state-owned media to increase their influence in Africa and other parts of the developing world are part of a bigger soft power drive. Such initiatives, she says, are aimed at building a positive image in areas where Beijing is economically and politically active. ""China is actively introducing its culture and values, and distributing favorable images through its media to achieve its goals of reducing fears of its military strength, developing closer relations with developing nations and expanding its international influence,"" Wu wrote in ""The Rise of China's State-Led Media Dynasty in Africa"" paper, published in June. Read related: Asian interest means Africa needs new economic vision . The establishment of Nairobi's CCTV hub, media analysts say, is a way of challenging negative perceptions and make investment possibilities seem more attractive. ""There's no doubt that a Kenya office being set up shows a lot about China's interest to also spread its own voice around the world to maybe counter what the Western media has promoted about China,"" says Lu. But for that voice to be heard, CCTV's journalists know that they need credibility. Pang acknowledges that ""CCTV is media by the Chinese government"" but says that says that there is no censorship from Beijing. He points to the broadcaster's editorial board, which is dominated by Kenyans who make most of the decisions on the coverage. Read related: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . But Lu says that China's record of media control at home signals that Beijing will still have a say on what is being broadcast by CCTV Africa. ""I still believe the state will play a large role in selecting what information will be shown on TV,"" he says. ""It has been done in China for a long time."" For Masaai, It is a given that he can't say anything that is damning to the Chinese government. But the CCTV anchor is quick to point out that at his previous Kenyan employer, certain subjects were also off-limits. He says that CCTV's expansion is a pioneering project worth standing up to. ""In the bid to compete with the other big headers and big shots in the international sphere, they have to also go as far as the others are going. Of course, there are limits, yes.

"(CNN) -- Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who preliminary results show has easily won election to a fourth term, praised police actions in dispersing post-election demonstrators and castigated the protesters as ""vandals and thugs."" ""What (protesters) tried to carry out in Minsk yesterday is not democracy, it is banditism,"" Lukashenko said in a news conference Monday, according to Belarusian Telegraph Agency, or BelTA, the country's state-run news agency. ""Vandals and thugs lost their human faces. They went utterly wild."" After the announcement that Lukashenko had prevailed with 79% of the vote Sunday, according to preliminary election results, opposition candidates and their supporters took to the streets in Minsk, the capital, and clashed with police. Lukashenko said Monday that 639 people were arrested Sunday and remain in custody, according to BelTA.Those detained include presidential candidate Vladimir Neklyaev, he said. The Russian news agency Interfax earlier reported that Neklyayev was hurt in clashes with riot police. Lukashenko told reporters that Neklyayev and Vitaly Rymashevsky, another candidate, were removed from a hospital and interrogated by authorities, Interfax said. He said he was told by Health Minister Vasily Zharko that Neklyayev's injuries were not serious, and that Rymashevsky ""rushed to take shelter in a hospital"" after being struck in the head. Another candidate, Nikolai Statkevich, told state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he, too, was beaten. The country's Central Election Commission told BelTA that the voter turnout was 90% and that it had not received any complaints. However, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that while the election showed improvement, ""Belarus still has a considerable way to go in meeting its OSCE commitments."" However, Belarus' Interior Ministry, in a statement on its website, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of those arrested were ""drunk unemployed people and students of various schools and universities, some of them under age."" ""Actions like those wouldn't have been tolerated in any civilized country,"" Lukashenko told reporters Monday. ""Nobody in the West would have been soft toward those thugs. Water cannons, tear gas, mass arrests of hooligans -- and they'd be done away with in no time."" The president said most of those arrested were under the age of 21. He said the court will decide their fate. ""They will be imprisoned only if the courts decide that, according to the law,"" Lukashenko said, according to BelTA. ""I am not the one who puts people into prison. I have only one right -- to pardon people."" Lukashenko called the elections free and transparent, and he added police restored acted strictly according to the law, restoring order in seven and a half minutes. Referring to the demonstrations, he said, ""I did warn you that if any mess started, we'd have enough resources (to handle it),"" BelTA and Interfax reported. ""You guys took on the wrong person. I won't hide in a cellar. So let's put paid to it. There will no longer be any brainless democracy. We won't have the country torn to pieces."" One demonstration was in support of Neklyaev, who received 1.77% of the votes, according to the election commission. The election commission numbers, cited by BelTA, put the number of votes Statkevich received at 1.04%. The OSCE has repeatedly expressed concerns over the status of civil and political rights in Belarus. It noted in its statement Monday the detention of candidates as well as activists, journalists and others. ""While voting on election day was overall assessed positively, the process deteriorated significantly during the vote count, with observers assessing almost half of vote counts monitored as bad or very bad,"" the organization said. ""This undermined the steps that had been taken to improve the election."" ""This election failed to give Belarus the new start it needed,"" said Tony Lloyd, who leads a short-term OSCE mission and heads the delegation of the organization's Parliamentary Assembly. ""The counting process lacked transparency. The people of Belarus deserved better. And, in particular, I now expect the government to account for the arrests of presidential candidates, journalists and human rights activists."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice once called Lukashenko ""the last dictator in Europe."" The president told reporters Monday that under his leadership, Belarus will drastically improve its economy in the next five years, and its standard of living will closely approach that of Europe. Authorities used stun grenades on the demonstrators as they headed toward October Square in downtown Minsk, Interfax reported. However, several thousand people gathered in the square, chanting ""For Belarus!"" Some of them waved flags with the symbol of the Christians Democratic Party, led by Rymashevsky. The Interior Ministry said authorities knew in advance that some presidential candidates planned to ""stage unsanctioned mass rallies."" The gatherings at first seemed peaceful, according to the ministry statement, but ""turned into an attempt to seize the government building where the Central Elections Committee was located."" The building was attacked with sections of water pipes, stones and pieces of ice, breaking several windows, the ministry said, and protesters stormed inside. Police are working on identifying the organizers and participants, ""as well as documenting their crimes and estimating the inflicted damage,"" the ministry said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking at a news conference broadcast on Russian state television Monday, said that Moscow expects Belarus to continue ""to develop as a modern state based on democracy"" after the election. ""No matter who the leader is, Belarus will always be one of the states closest to us,"" Medvedev said. Lukashenko, who has been in office since 1994, was running against nine other candidates, the election commission said. None garnered more than 2.5% of the votes, BelTA said. Andrei Sannikov, a former diplomat who wants to see Belarus as a member of the European Union, was one of the main opposition leaders. The two others are Yaroslav Romanchuk and Neklyaev. Economist Romanchuk, a candidate from the United Civil Party, has been prolific in publicizing his views on economic reforms. Meanwhile, Neklyaev ran a social campaign, ""Tell the Truth!"" He was arrested for participating in public protests earlier this year and later released. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Mila Sanina contributed to this report.","NEW: Lukashenko says there will be no more ""brainless democracy"" in Belarus .

"(CNN) -- The nation of Greece has come to a screeching halt again. Unions have called for a 48-hour general strike beginning Tuesday ahead of an anticipated vote by the Greek government on yet another round of austerity measures the following day. Protesters filed past parliament, their banners and Greek flags flapping in the air over their heads. Greek media are expecting a cliffhanger in parliament late Wednesday night, with passage of the austerity measures by just a handful of votes. Analysis: Greece's misery won't end with bailout . If legislators do not pass the measures, it will endanger the payout of the next international bailout installment of 31.5 billion euros, which the government desperately needs to stay in operation. Without the funds, it says it will run out of money by mid-November. But Greeks are furious about the effects of multiple rounds of belt-tightening, which have resulted in cuts to pensions and pay and seen unemployment in Greece's fifth year of recession soar to over 25%. More than one-fifth of the population could face poverty, defined as a family of four on an income of 13,842 euros (about $17,500) per year, state news agency AMNA has reported. Critics of austerity have called for economic stimulus programs instead, like those implemented in the United States. The two-day general strike will shut down transportation across the country, including ships and taxis, said AMNA, which is joining the strike along with other media outlets for four and a half hours Tuesday. Hospitals are striking both days, and pharmacies will close all day Wednesday. Government offices are shuttering for the extent of the strike. About 35,000 demonstrators turned out in Athens, Greek police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos said. The street protest remained peaceful, without any of the disturbances that have marred other demonstrations in recent months. Wednesday is expected to draw the larger crowd of demonstrators as the vote approaches. If Greece is to stay the course laid out by the so-called troika -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- more budget cuts will be necessary, as the country's debt woes are worse than previously believed. Recent budget projections for the Greek government exceed the worst-case scenarios envisioned by international lenders when they agreed to a bailout, according to a Financial Times report published by CNN. The hardship many Greek people are suffering has resulted in dogged opposition in parliament to deeper cuts, including within the ruling coalition. The Democratic Party of the Left, or DIMAR, one of three parties making up the coalition headed up by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, has said it will abstain in the vote on the new round of austerity measures, turning in blank ballots. But it plans to vote Sunday to approve the government's new budget. Samaras' own center-right New Democracy party is expected to vote in favor of the package. Although the third coalition member -- the socialist party Pasok -- supports the cuts, individual party members have come out against them and could defect, putting the vote in jeopardy. Radical leftist party Syriza, bitterly opposed to austerity and closely connected to Greek unions, calls on its website for Greeks to demonstrate against the ""rape"" of democracy and the dashing of the hopes of the people. Samaras warned that if the measures don't pass and international funds don't arrive, the nation could plunge into chaos. He is pushing for Greece to receive more than the 31.5 billion euros expected in the latest installment ""so that there is a significant effect on the real economy."" Greece, and particularly Athens, has seen repeated street demonstrations against the austerity measures imposed on the nation, some of which have turned violent. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: Police estimate 35,000 people turned out for a peaceful protest in Athens .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan, the world's newest nation, turned one year old on Monday, but its anniversary comes amid high tensions with its northern neighbor and economic concerns. With its capital in Juba, South Sudan became independent last year following decades of civil war. Its arrival in the international community was celebrated at the time, but conflict with the Sudanese regime soon resumed. Border clashes have brought the countries to the brink of war and left South Sudan coping with a massive humanitarian crisis as people flee the fighting. The South Sudan state of Upper Nile has been flooded with refugees crossing the border from Sudan. In total, aid agencies estimate that at least 150,000 refugees from Sudan are currently in South Sudan. The humanitarian problems have coincided with economic woes. The South Sudanese government lost 98 percent of its revenue when it halted oil production amid a dispute over transportation and processing fees with Sudan. South Sudan obtained around 70% of the formerly united country's oil reserves when it became independent last year. But the countries have been unable to agree on how much the landlocked South should pay to use infrastructure that remains in Sudan. South Sudan shut down production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its oil. Sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees. The shutdown has sent the economies of both countries reeling, but South Sudan has been hit particularly hard by the loss of income from virtually its only export. The young nation has also wrestled with corruption in its first year. In May, South Sudan's president wrote to more than 75 government officials and eight foreign governments in an attempt to recover $4 billion lost through corruption.","South Sudan became independent last year following a two-decade civil war .

"Washington (CNN) -- GOP tempers flared during a routine conference call when House and Senate leadership aides confronted Republican National Committee staffers over recent comments by party chairman Michael Steele. At issue was Steele's prediction earlier this week during his nationwide book tour that the Republican Party would not take back the House in November -- comments that infuriated Republican strategists on Capitol Hill, who decided to broach the topic during the Wednesday call. The dispute -- first reported by Hotline On Call -- occurred on a daily strategy call with aides from Republican leadership offices in the House and Senate, along with RNC officials. According to a senior House aide who was on the conference call, a Senate staffer said the chairman was trampling on the GOP's message in a week that saw several high-profile Democratic retirements. The Senate aide told RNC staffers to do a better job controlling their chairman. ""He is digging himself deeper,"" the Senate aide griped about Steele, according to the House source. ""He's got to stop and put an end to this thing."" RNC Research Director Jeff Berkowitz jumped in and ""offered a hard defense of Steele,"" according to the senior House aide. Berkowitz shot back that the Senate official was ""out of line,"" which then set off a round of ""bickering,"" the House aide told CNN. A House aide chimed in to express sympathy with the plight of Steele's advisers but said the chairman's remarks could do serious damage to fundraising, candidate recruiting and voter motivation ahead of the midterm elections. ""You guys got to tell us how long this is going to last,"" the House aide said. ""Our phones are ringing off the hook. He is putting our bosses in difficult positions."" The call ended shortly thereafter. Asked for comment on the flare-up, RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho e-mailed: ""Not commenting on staff calls."" The senior House aide later told CNN that congressional Republicans have ""confronted"" Steele over the past year about some of his comments. ""He has been confronted numerous times by Senate leaders and House leaders over the last year,"" the aide said. ""They have confronted him about speaking about things he shouldn't be speaking about, whether it's Senate policy or House policy."" ""Today, he threw a temper tantrum and told people to shut up,"" the aide said, referring to an ABC interview in which Steele lashed out at his critics. ""At this point, he needs to look in the mirror.""","Steele's prediction that GOP wouldn't take back House infuriated GOP strategists .

"(CNN) -- Edward Dolman is Christie's first chief executive officer to have been a specialist, who understands the pressure and the nature of valuing art. Part of his mission is attracting other highly motivated specialists into their business. A Christie's employee stands beside a painting  at Christie's auction house in London on July 4. Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University. He later completed a degree at the Study Centre for Fine and Decorative Arts, which had a close relationship with the Victoria and Albert Museum. Not being of blue-blood birth, he joined Christie's because of the link with Christie's South Kensington, starting out as a porter in the furniture department. After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years. Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture. At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales. Finally in 1995, he decided he wanted to become a manager and took a course at the Institute of Directors in the Mall to learn the language of business and the motivation of people. Dolman was subsequently made Managing Director of Christie's Amsterdam, applying new techniques and marketing to enhance interest in high-quality art. Twenty months later he returned to Christie's London on King Street as the Commercial Director to run Christie's Europe. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director. In 1999 Dolman moved to New York as the International Managing Director and later as Chief Executive. Together with Christie's International Management Group, they developed an intensive five-year business plan, and Dolman took over from Christopher Davidge, as approved by Francois Pinault.","Dolman was specialist in furniture department of South Kensington for 10 years .

"New York (CNN) -- Jeremy Lin, the 23-year-old point guard of Taiwanese descent who has come out of nowhere to guide the New York Knicks to seven straight wins, has left many wondering if he can also help his team gain ground among Asian consumers. ""Jeremy Lin is a marketing dream come true,"" said Ronn Torossian, chief executive of New York-based 5W Public Relations. ""If somebody had a checklist of what a brand should be, Jeremy Lin hits every one."" It has been only 10 days since the Harvard graduate was called off the bench, immediately becoming the Knicks' unlikely savior. In his first game, he scored 25 points to help his team beat the New Jersey Nets, and last Friday, his 38 points outscored Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers for another Knicks win. New York media have dubbed the phenomenon ""Linsanity,"" and the previously unknown economics major has exploded on social media, reaching more than 300,000 followers on Twitter. His last-second heroics Tuesday, sinking a game-winning 3-point shot against the Toronto Raptors, have only added to the buzz. On Wednesday, Lin had a career-best 13 assists to lead the Knicks past the Sacramento Kings. ""He's made the Knicks relevant again,"" said Larry Dimitriou, manager of a Modell's Sporting Goods store in Manhattan. Dimitriou started selling Lin's No. 17 jersey last week and said he has since had trouble keeping them in stock. ""We constantly get Lin jerseys every day,"" he said. ""I put one in the window to show people we have them. A short time later, they're gone."" President Barack Obama is also apparently ""very impressed"" with the NBA's new star, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday. But some say Lin's appeal and market potential aren't unique. Chinese national Yao Ming, who at 7 feet, 6 inches burst onto the scene during the 2002-03 NBA season, helped his Houston Rockets expand merchandise sales and viewership in Chinese markets over his eight seasons with the team, analysts say. Whether Lin could fill the void left by Yao's retirement is unclear, though some appear cautious. ""We have to remember, it's only 10 days in,"" noted Roman Garcia, director of digital strategy at Taylor Strategy, a public relations firm. ""We know Lin is really good at pushing the ball down the court but we have yet to see if he's good at pushing a brand, or a community."" What's most important, Garcia said, is whether Lin has that potential.","Lin is a ""marketing dream come true,"" one PR executive says .

"(CNN) -- Emerging from victory, Park Geun-hye who will become the next president of South Korea -- the first woman for the Asian nation -- pledged to ""take care of our people one-by-one."" In a speech made at the headquarters of her Saenuri political party Thursday morning, she invoked a phrase coined by her father, Park Chung-hee, who also served as president in an era when he was encouraging people to pull South Korea out of poverty. ""I would like to re-create the miracle of 'let's live well' so people can worry less about their livelihood and young people can happily go to work,"" said Park. Park, 60, will assume office in February, in a country grappling with income inequality, angst over education and employment prospects for its youth, and strained relations with North Korea. South Korea is also a strategic Western ally and the fourth-largest economy in Asia. Park won 52% of the vote, compared with 48% for her rival, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party, according to the country's National Election Commission. Both the president-elect and Moon, the liberal candidate, had similarly moderate plans, addressing income inequality, reigning in the power of family-owned conglomerates and improving relations with North Korea. ""This wasn't the knockdown, drag out, left-against-right type of campaign,"" said David Kang, professor of international relations and business at the University of Southern California. ""There's a surprising consensus about taking a more moderate stance."" ""I think Park won by acting to the center. Her claims are that she's going to moderate many of the policies of the previous administration."" Park acknowledged Moon and his supporters Thursday. ""I believe there is common ground between myself and Moon Jae-in,"" she said. ""We are both willing to work for the country and for the people of South Korea. ""Whether you were for or against me, I want to hear your opinions. I will try to stop the separation and conflict that has been going on for the last half century through reconciliation and harmony."" Park of the Saenuri party, won the highest office in a conservative Asian nation with traditional gender values. Read more: South Korea's election paradox . Just because a woman has won the presidency, it doesn't mean South Korea has achieved everything it needs in terms of gender equality, said Kang, who is also director of Korean Studies Institute at USC. ""That a woman could be elected in South Korea is historic and important. At the same time, what you basically have to do is be political royalty. So I think gender roles are changing in South Korea. It's a step forward, but let's also remember how unique she is as a person."" Park is the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, whose legacy left the Korean public divided. Some claim he was a dictator who ignored human rights and cracked down on dissent, while others credit him with bringing economic development to South Korea. Her father was assassinated in 1979. On Thursday, she paid her respects to her parents by visiting their graves at the National Cemetery in Seoul. As in many other elections around the world, the economy reigned as the No. 1 issue for South Korean voters. Park has made ambitious promises to address those anxieties. ""I will create a society in which no one is left behind and everyone can share the fruits of economic development,"" she said. ""I believe that only this can bring unity, economic democratization and happiness for people. She also mentioned North Korea describing its recent rocket launch as a ""serious security situation."" Park received congratulatory messages from Korea's outgoing President Lee Myung-bak as well as one from U.S. President Barack Obama. Read more: Pocket, not rocket, worries Koreans . The United States and South Korea enjoy ""stable relations,"" Kang said. ""Park is going to have to weigh U.S. as its main security ally and China as its main economic partner.

"(CNN) -- A firefighter shot by a sniper in upstate New York calmly described his wounds as ""eventually mortal"" unless he got medical help soon, although paramedics were kept away because the shooter could still be near Monday morning. ""Be advised I am struck in the lower leg, knee area, and the lower left back,"" volunteer firefighter Joseph Hofstetter told a Monroe County, New York, dispatcher as he used his firetruck for cover Monday morning. ""Brother, hang tight,"" the dispatcher told Hofstetter. Two firefighters lay dead on the street near Hofstetter, not moving since they were shot, he said. ""I am in the danger zone right now,"" Hofstetter radioed. ""I need EMS or I'm going to be joining them."" The recorded emergency radio traffic from the incident is archived at the website radioreference.com. The shots came across the street from the burning house and car that were set on fire by the shooter, 62-year-old William Spengler, police said. He was aiming at a West Webster Fire Department truck that answered his call to 911, they said. But ambulances were kept away because police didn't know if the shooter was still there, hidden behind a tree on a hill above. While he waited and bled, Hofstetter made a request. ""Is it possible to notify my next of kin and apprise of the situation? I have a hysterical mother."" With the help of two residents of the neighborhood, Hofstetter eventually left the scene in his Chevy Trailblazer, the vehicle he drove there in response to the initial fire call 35 minutes earlier. Spengler, who was convicted of killing his grandmother decades ago, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours later. Hofstetter and firefighter Theodore Scardino survived their gunshot wounds and were ""convalescing and doing as well as I would expect at this stage,"" a doctor at University of Rochester Hospital said Wednesday. ""Mr. Scardino and Mr. Hofstetter are both receiving supportive care and are making small steps on their long road ahead,"" Dr. Nicole Stassen, a trauma surgeon said. ""It is critical that they remain in an environment where they can focus on rest and recovery."" The men will start physical therapy Wednesday and their conditions should be upgraded to ""satisfactory"" later in the day, Stassen said. The two firefighters killed -- Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka -- will be buried after separate funerals Sunday and Monday. ""Calling hours"" -- a time for mourners to gather and remember them -- will be held at Webster Schroeder High School Friday evening and Saturday afternoon and evening, according to a school official. Chiapperini's funeral will be held at the high school on Sunday, while Kaczowka's funeral is scheduled for Monday at the St. Stainslaus Kostka Church in Rochester. Chiapperini, named ""Firefighter of the Year"" for his West Webster Fire Department just two weeks ago, was also lieutenant with his town's police department. His 19-year-old son, Nick Chiapperini, was on the job in the Monroe Ambulance Company dispatch center when the call for help came in, according to West Webster Fire Department spokesman Al Sienkiewicz. ""Nick was in the dispatch center and heard the entire ordeal play out over the scanners,"" Sienkiewicz said. ""It's something no one should have to hear."" The son is ""doing as well as expected for a 19-year-old man who just lost his father,"" he said. ""Nick was undoubtedly following in his father's footsteps and admired him very much."" Kaczowka, who was also a 911 dispatcher, had been with the West Webster Fire Department for just more than a year, Sienkiewicz said. Spengler used a .223-caliber semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle -- the same caliber and make used in the recent Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut, police said. He was also armed with a 38-caliber revolver and a 12-gauge shotgun, they said. ""He was equipped to go to war,"" Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said Tuesday. Spengler left a typewritten note behind saying he hoped to burn down his neighborhood and kill as many people as possible, Pickering said. ""I still have to get ready to see how much of the neighborhood I can burn down and do what I like doing best -- killing people,"" it said. A charred body, believed to be his sister's, was found in the burned house she shared with him, police said. It will be a challenge for the medical examiner to determine if William Spengler's sister -- 67-year-old Cheryl Spengler -- was killed before the fire was set, because it was a ""raging inferno,"" Pickering said. Spengler was convicted in 1981 of first-degree manslaughter in the death of his grandmother and had been released on supervised parole, Pickering said. Spengler was especially attentive to his mother, who passed away in October, a former neighbor, Roger Vercruysse said, visiting her every day in a nursing home until she died. Contacted by CNN by e-mail, Spengler's cousin, Shirley Ashwood, responded in an e-mail that her family had distanced itself from him after he killed his grandmother. She had only seen him in the past year while visiting her aunt and briefly at the funeral. He should have stayed in prison, she wrote. ""The system failed all of us again,"" she said, adding that her family grieved for the fallen firefighters -- one of whom her two daughters knew from school -- and Cheryl Spengler. Seven houses were destroyed and several others damaged by the fire, which investigators believe spread from a car parked next to the home where Spengler lived, Pickering said. CNN's Steve Brusk, Kristina Sgueglia and Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","NEW: Cousin says system failed by letting killer out of prison .

"(CNN) -- Big company. Big salary. Big sendoff. Jason Shellen says he left Google because the chance to build something new ""outweighed the need for stability."" That's the formula millions of American workers used for years to map their career trajectory. Conventional wisdom advised workers to land a job with a big company and retire with generous benefits. But there's a new breed of worker who is making that formula seem as quaint as a VHS tape. They are the ultimate risk-takers -- they leave large, successful companies to pursue their own dreams even though the economy is reeling. They are people like Jason Shellen, who resigned as Google's manager of new business development in 2007 to launch Plinky.com, a startup that's designed to inspire bloggers and users of social media sites. Shellen says he was getting complacent working at Google, despite the company's domination of the Web. He says he decided to leave Google despite a shaky economy because he wanted to force himself to change. ""Being an entrepreneur is all about risk and innovation, not timing the market,"" Shellen says. ""A good idea doesn't wait for the perfect time to emerge. The ability to build something new outweighed the need for stability."" iReport.com: Are you striking out on your own and starting your own project at home? Why leave a sure thing? Stability, though, seems to be a rare quality in the workplace. Those who contemplate leaving the corporate cocoon can't help but pay attention to the constant news about corporate layoffs. Their challenge: Why leave a comfortable position in corporate America when there seem to be so few? Michael Rhim had to face that question. He says he was a regional vice president at TIAA-CREF, a company that provides retirement plans for nonprofit groups. He says the company had 5,000 employees, $400 billion in assets and 17,000 clients at its peak. But Rhim says he started contemplating a change because TIAA-CREF's corporate culture was changing. He started talking with a friend who ran a consulting firm, and he started paying attention to his emotions. ""It was getting more difficult to get up in the morning,"" he says. ""I wasn't enjoying my old job as much as I used to. The more I talked about the job with my new partner, the more excited I got."" Rhim left TIAA-CREF in March of 2008. He is now an executive at a new company, PRM Consulting, which has 25 employees. Now he does much of his own typing. He can't take clients to fancy restaurants. He even uses recycled paper for scrap paper to save costs. Though Rhim misses the perks of a large company, he says he received a lot more in return. ""There's much quick decision making,"" he says.

Shellen, who resigned from Google to start Plinky, says the large resources of a company can actually slow down the creative process.

""At my new company, Plinky, we sometimes dream things up in the morning and by the afternoon have it live on the Web. That never happens at a big company."" Greater freedom is also what inspired Vanessa Fox to resign from her position at Google, where she helped build Webmaster Central, one of the company's most successful projects. Today, Fox is the founder of ""Jane and Robot,"" which helps Web site developers ensure their sites can be found by potential customers, and ""Nine By Blue,"" which helps businesses use online data to better understand their customers. Fox says the challenge of creating something in an evolving space like the Internet was too great to pass up. ""As hokey as it sounds, there's more to life than money,"" she says. ""As much as I loved working at Google, I am really enjoying the flexibility I have now, as well as the ability to really make a difference in the direction I choose to go in."" Planning your exit . Those who leave the security of corporate life should not do it without research and a plan, some say. The notion of suddenly bolting a cushy corporate dream to follow one's bliss may seem romantic. But some who've done it say those thinking about making a change should make a frank appraisal of their talents and latch onto something unique that they have to offer. Rhim, the retirement planning consultant, says he knew the IRS would soon change the retirement plans for nonprofit groups. He knew his expertise would be in demand. ""I sat down and put together a three-month planning process,"" he says. ""I knew there was going to be a market out there where firms needed additional guidance."" All the careful planning, though, didn't remove his fear, Rhim says. But he discovered something remarkable. Once he committed to leaving, doors suddenly opened for him: People materialized to help him and amazing coincidences led to business opportunities. Rhim, a devout Christian, says it seemed like his leap of faith was being rewarded. ""No question, it was a scary proposition,"" Rhim says. ""But my pastor preached about when you do the right things, the Lord will bless you as he sees fit."" Yet Rhim says he knew he couldn't just lean on faith. ""If you realize that you have some skill sets that are valuable, you can market yourself accordingly,"" Rhim says. ""If not, you're sitting there, waiting to see if you're going to be downsized."" Rhim says he's happy with his move. He sometimes misses having the muscle of a big company behind him, but he no longer feels he's being controlled by larger forces. He may have to do his own typing now, but at least he is writing his own script, he says.

"(CNN) -- The text messages address various issues and come from all over the African continent. President Obama greets people Saturday during breakfast at Osu Castle in Accra, Ghana. From the personal: ""Obama, as a young lady I dream of being the president. U r a huge encouragement."" To cries for help: ""Dear president, Darfur firing again...waiting for peace through the change u promised."" To calls for intervention: ""Encourage African leaders to improve the quality and access to education for citizens."" The messages, from Ghana, Sudan and South Africa respectively, were among more than 5,000 sent to Barack Obama during his first visit as president to sub-Saharan Africa. Obama, accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters arrived in Ghana on Friday night, sparking excitement in the west African nation.  Watch how Ghana is celebrating Obama's visit » . Despite being home to some of the world's poorest nations, Africa has a vibrant cell phone market, considered by industry analysts as among the fastest-growing worldwide. Administration officials said they set up different numbers across the continent for citizens to communicate with Obama, whose father was from the east African nation of Kenya. ""Over the past week, we have been collecting questions, comments and words of welcome for President Obama via SMS, Twitter, Facebook and from newspapers across Africa,"" the White House said on its Web site. Three journalists from South Africa, Senegal and Kenya will vet the questions and provide a few to Obama, who will address them on African radio stations and via a Web video Monday, the White House said. Peter Kimani, a senior associate editor for a Kenyan daily, The Standard, is one of the three. ""The U.S. Embassy picked and vetted the journalists, and we are getting the questions, then it is up to us to determine what questions we will forward to the president,"" Kimani said. ""It is our judgment call on what to pick."" Most of the text messages were coming from South Africa, according to a log on the White House Web site. Obama's one-nation visit has generated envy among Ghana's neighbors, who considered it a message from the White House to governments that have poor records of stability. Citizens of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nations, and Kenya were the most vocal in their concerns over the choice of Ghana. ""We r disappointed that you have not chosen Nigeria as your first African point of call,"" one text said.","More than 5,000 messages sent to Obama during his visit to Ghana .

"(CNN) -- Call it the ultimate in military logistics. As land routes from Pakistan into Afghanistan are cut, sabotaged or otherwise interrupted, the U.S. military has developed alternative railroad routes that make the Orient Express look like a branch line. They are called -- rather prosaically -- the Northern Distribution Network, or NDN. The main route begins at the port of Riga in Latvia, from where freight trains roll across Russia, and continues along the edge of the Caspian Sea. It crosses the deserts of Kazakhstan and into Uzbekistan. About 10 days after beginning their odyssey, the containers cross into Afghanistan, carrying everything from computers and socks to toilet paper and bottled water. Other routes begin at the port of Ponti in Georgia on the Black Sea and at Vladivostok in the Russian Far East. The Russians first offered transit for nonlethal equipment bound for Afghanistan in 2008. According to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, it took nearly a year for the U.S. and NATO to negotiate transit rights with central Asian governments such as Uzbekistan, although two-thirds of jet aviation fuel bound for Afghanistan was already transiting Uzbekistan. The first shipment of supplies crossed Russia in May 2009; just in time, because the ""surge"" meant that even more U.S. troops needed resupplying, and transit routes through Pakistan were about to become a pawn in the deteriorating relationship between the two countries. Use of the routes has since grown rapidly; the NDN now carries 40% of the supplies U.S. forces in Afghanistan need (while Pakistani routes see 30%, according to the Department of Defense). It doesn't carry ammunition or weapons, which are flown in to airbases such as Bagram and Kandahar. But airlifting cannot be much expanded; the U.S. Military Airlift Command is already stretched, and air transport is much more expensive (about $14,000 per ton of freight, according to NATO estimates) than overland transport. NATO estimates the cost of moving supplies overland is one-tenth that of airborne freight. The NDN poses challenges of its own. Ships have to use Riga because other ports in the Baltic are not reliably ice-free in winter. There are bottlenecks, especially at the Afghan border terminus at Hairatan. And there have been allegations of ""improper payments"" made for fuel in Uzbekistan to keep the trains running and for preferential treatment to ensure that supplies get across the border as quickly as possible. Rules change frequently, according to one contractor involved in getting freight into Afghanistan. And one diplomatic cable about negotiations to use Uzbek territory in 2008 noted that ""corruption remains endemic throughout all levels of the economy."" But with U.S. lobbying, funds from the Asian Development Bank enabled Uzbek engineers to extend the line last year to the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. As one Uzbek official puts it: ""Afghanistan is the only country in the world without railways; that's why it's not developed."" (A historical aside: The Mazar route is the first working railway line in Afghanistan since 1929, when there was a line all of four miles long out of Kabul. Only recently, NATO helped move one of the historical locomotives from that line to the National Museum in Kabul.) The NDN may seem a daunting and expensive challenge, but as U.S. relations with Pakistan have frayed, the northern option has proved good insurance. Land convoys through Pakistan from the port of Karachi travel nearly 1,000 miles to reach Afghanistan, with the last part of the journey often being a painfully slow trek through the Khyber Pass. There is the added risk of ambush -- many tankers and trucks have been attacked and destroyed in the last two years. In one incident alone in December 2008, the Pakistani Taliban set ablaze 100 trucks at a rest stop near Peshawar. The Pakistan routes are also vulnerable to the vagaries of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. For 10 days last year, Pakistan closed the overland routes (via Tulkarm on the Khyber Pass and Chaman south of Kandahar) into Afghanistan in retaliation for U.S. air attacks that mistakenly killed Pakistani soldiers. The northern routes are safer and more reliable, but not entirely immune to disruption. Relations between the U.S. and Russia are sometimes tense (over such issues as the ballistic missile defense shield), and central Asian states have taken offense at U.S. complaints about their human rights record. Even so, Russia gains advantages from allowing its territory to be used; it doesn't want Afghanistan sliding into chaos. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at the U.S./Russia summit 2009: ""We value the efforts that are being made by the United States together with the other countries in order to prevent the terrorist threat that was emanating and still coming from the Afghan soil."" The NDN benefits plenty of other parties. For Uzbekistan, it helps defray the heavy cost of investment in its railway network, largely with loans from Asian banks, and increases demand for local goods. For Riga and other ports, it provides income at a time when economic growth is weak. And most of all, Afghanistan stands to benefit from the ""transformational potential"" (in the words of one U.S. diplomat) of a rail network that could make it an Asian transport hub. As the U.S. drawdown gathers pace next winter, the NDN may acquire another role: helping to remove the vast amounts of equipment invested in the decade-long mission in Afghanistan. The irony is that tracks now carrying supplies to U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan were first built to resupply Soviet forces when they occupied the country in the 1980s.","The U.S. military has developed an alternative railroad into Afghanistan .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting between two militias erupted at the building that previously housed Libya's intelligence agency in central Tripoli early Sunday, sources said. One of the militias was recently ordered dissolved for violating rules, including torturing a detainee to death, the chief of Libya's temporary supreme security committee told LANA, the state news agency. At least one person was killed in the battle and another was seriously wounded, according to a medical source. Three other people were treated for wounds, the source said. The gunfire and explosions, intense at time, were heard by a CNN producer. The interior ministry ordered the militia, identified as the 8th Support Brigade, to be evicted from the building, according to Hashim Bishr, the supreme security committee chief told LANA. Also Sunday, Libya's General National Congress voted Sunday to stay in it's Tripoli headquarters and not move to the eastern city of Bayda. The parliament building in Tripoli has suffered several security breaches, including an incident last Wednesday in which protesters stormed it. Tripoli's gas stations ran low on fuel Sunday, forcing some to shut down their pumps, because of a strike by refinery workers who were previously rebel fighters, LANA reported. The striking workers at the oil refinery in the city of Zawiya are demanding better medical treatment for their wounds suffered during the recent civil war, LANA reported.","One of the militias was recently ordered dissolved for violating rules, official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Video showing Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl, captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan, is just another example of how captors use the medium for psychological warfare. U.S. Army Spc. Shoshana Johnson, who was held by insurgents in Iraq, prepares to enter a plane to safety. The latest video shows Bergdahl, of Ketchum, Idaho, looking comfortable and eating food. While he expresses concern about not seeing his family and girlfriend again, he does appear to speak calmly and has no visible signs of abuse. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says in a 28-minute video released by his captors. ""I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them."" But that is in stark contrast to the well-publicized captures of U.S. servicemen and women in conflicts past. Vietnam . Sen. John McCain, whose plane was shot down during a combat mission over Vietnam in 1967, is considered one of the most famous prisoners of war. He was captured by the Communist Viet Cong and spent nearly six years in a prisoner of war camp, where he was often tortured. A grainy black-and-white film released by his captors showed a severely injured McCain talking on camera in the so-called ""Hanoi Hilton."" McCain later refused to be released before other prisoners. He eventually returned to the United States in 1973. ""During the years, we were kept in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell because they didn't want us to see each other. We'd spend all our time tapping on the walls to each other and encouraging each other and organizing, organizing, organizing with our chain of command. The days and hours go by,"" McCain told CNN's John King last year. Iraq . And most recently, in 2003, video from Iraq painted a picture of an unruly and chaotic terror organization holding U.S. soldiers captured in the Iraq military theater. Army Spc. Shoshana Johnson was shown on videotape being interrogated -- with five other soldiers including Pfc. Jessica Lynch, who was badly wounded and was held prisoner at a separate location. Nine of their fellow soldiers were killed when their convoy was ambushed. Johnson appeared frightened, with her eyes darting quickly left and right. ""I was terrified. I didn't know what was going to happen to me,"" Johnson said in a past CNN interview. ""And I was in a lot of pain."" Lynch's videotaped rescue made her a celebrity, and she was used by the Pentagon to put a face on the men and women who were fighting the war against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Johnson and the other POWs spent 22 days as prisoners until Marines rescued them. Chris Voss, a former lead international kidnapping coordinator for the FBI, says that as a lesson from the Johnson video, the Taliban may have learned to try to appear more political than radical. ""They're hoping that ... this gets to other media outlets that will make them appear so that they are a reasonable political force,"" he says. ""There is very much a lack of overthreat in the [Bergdahl] video, and they clearly thought this through ... specifically strategic for these purposes."" Somalia . Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant, a Black Hawk helicopter pilot, was shot down in 1993 during a combat mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. The body of one of his fellow pilots being dragged through the streets was captured on video. After the crash, he was captured by a mob and held for 11 days. Durant suffered several serious injuries, including a broken back and face and leg wounds. He was later released. His bloodied and bruised face was splashed on the covers of several national magazines, including Time and Newsweek, and on TV networks. His story later inspired Mark Bowden's bestseller ""Black Hawk Down"" and a movie by director Ridley Scott. Voss says his image was depicted in a different way than others had been. ""The media picked that up and ran in a way that was very accusatory towards the United States,"" he says. ""There were pictures of Mike Durant in a clearly beaten-up condition, and the captions in the various national magazines were, 'What in the world are we doing?' "" Voss says that from that incident, the United States may have learned to apply the mostly mum stance it's using during the Bergdahl capture. ""The U.S. government gave a knee-jerk reaction to that, which I think they've learned from,"" he says. ""So how this plays out in the media, the Taliban is being very cautious to appear to be reasonable ... because they don't want to make themselves look like they're fanatical. They are trying to be very reasonable.""","Army Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl was captured nearly three weeks ago in Afghanistan .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- From big balloons at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade to a big Christmas tree at Manhattan's Rockefeller Center, the Big Apple is known for going big around the holidays. And on Tuesday, the first night of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, New Yorkers went big again, lighting a massive menorah outside the south side of Central Park. The nine-branched candelabra is 32 feet tall, 28 feet wide, weighs 4,000 pounds, and is considered the world's biggest, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Rabbi Shmuel M. Butman, director of the city's Lubavitch Youth Organization, said the gold-colored steel structure is equipped with oil lamps and has special glass chimneys to protect the flames from wind. The Brooklyn-based group has coordinated the lighting ceremony since it began in 1977, then coinciding with the administration of Abraham David Beame, the first Jewish mayor of New York City. The massive structure was designed by renowned Jewish artist Yaacov Agam, according to Butman. During the celebration, one candle is lighted the first night, and an additional candle is lighted each subsequent night for eight nights, earning Hanukkah the name ""The Festival of Lights."" ""The menorah is a symbol of inspiration not only for the Jewish people, but all people, regardless of race, color or creed,"" Butman said. In the nation's capital, a special lighting ceremony near the White House also marked the start of the holiday. ""Tonight, as families and friends come together to light the menorah, it is a story that reminds us to count our blessings, to honor the sacrifices of our ancestors,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""To believe that through faith and determination, we can work together to build a brighter, better world for generations to come.""

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Howard University student Tora Burns works long days in the summer helping children in Washington. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Tora Burns leads her classroom with an infectious smile, patiently teaching her young pupils about the benefits of recycling -- and then a catchy little tune to try out at home with their siblings and parents. ""What I want you guys to know is that we can all make a difference,"" the 19-year-old tells the children as they prepare a coloring lesson that also reminds them of the household materials that belong in the recycling bin -- not the trash can. The Howard University student wants to be a teacher, and she views this summer classroom experience as a step toward her dream. And the latest evolution in a young lifetime often focused on community service. ""I would ask my mom, 'Well, can't you help the old lady out of the building?' "" Burns said this week. ""And she'd be like, 'You are only 6 or 5. Why are you trying to help everyone?' "" Her urge to make inner-city communities better and safer was reinforced, she said, by a jarring memory from her high school days in Detroit, Michigan. ""I saw a man kill another man, and I was just sitting at the red light and you have that moment, you are, like, 'Oh my God, someone just lost their life,' "" Burns said. ""No child should have to live like that. No child should have to see things of that nature."" During her sophomore year at Howard, Burns saw a fund-raising table on campus and walked over to donate a few dollars. But the literature caught her eye, and soon she was a mentor in a program run by America's Promise, the community service organization founded by former Secretary of State Colin Powell. This summer, she also is working with Heads Up, a teaching and mentoring program in Washington that is affiliated with the AmeriCorps national service program. During the session on recycling, when Burns asked why being environmentally conscious was so important, one young student suggested the sun would go black if people didn't recycle more. ""They say the craziest things,"" Burns said. ""But every now and then you have that 'aha' moment. And I feel you learn a lot more from the students than they learn from you. ... When you see -- it is like a sparkle in their eye, and they are happy when they are learning. I think that is where you see the change."" There are 75,000 AmeriCorps participants nationwide, 1,500 of them in Washington. And 6,000 more slots will be filled come September because of additional funding in the recently passed stimulus legislation. The need in Washington's inner-city neighborhoods is obvious. Nearly 20 percent of the city's residents are below the poverty line, and more than 27 percent of children under 5 live in poverty. And while the national graduation rate is just shy of 70 percent, in the District of Columbia it is 48.8 percent. D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee has been in her job two years and generating more than her share of controversy by closing underperforming schools and replacing many of the system's principals. ""We've done more in two years than humanly possible,"" she said in an interview at her office. ""But it is still astonishing to me to come into work every day and sit in meetings and hear about the challenges that we're still having and to think -- we're pretty much at ground zero."" To Rhee, ""one of the most precious resources at your disposal is time,"" and while many school systems nationwide are being forced to cut back on summer programs because of the recession, the District of Columbia is expanding its offerings, in part because of projects run by Heads Up, AmeriCorps and other service organizations. Leaning over one young man in her classroom, Burns offered her advice, and this message: ""We are here to teach so that by the time you are out of here, you will be able to count better than anyone your age."" She said she was pushed by her parents to succeed, and nudged back on track by a few key teachers whenever she began to lose her way at school. Now, she pushes herself through 10- and 12-hour days in the summer weeks when her family and many friends are off on nice vacations. Why? ""Everything boils down to children. It all boils down to children you know,"" Burns said during snack time this past week. ""How dare I be a college student and be selfish and not do something to help my community? And I feel like children are at the center of it all. That's why.""","Aspiring teacher finds reward in volunteering this summer in Washington schools .

"(CNN) -- My 65-year-old father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was shot five times, knife in hand, as he wrestled with a domestic terrorist in the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin. The coward fled, leaving my father to pass away in a murmur of meditation. My father lived the American dream. Starting with only a couple bucks in his pocket, he worked hard and long to make a life for his family and his community, helping to build the Sikh temple where he was attacked. Since that day, many discussions in our community have come and gone, with little attention from the majority of the national media or government. It seems many hard-earned lessons from this tragedy already have been forgotten. But they bear repeating and remembering. Injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere. This attack was predicated on hate. Too many hate groups exist right here in the United States, and terror can take many forms: from school bullies to conservative radio hosts spreading fear and distortions to racists spewing hate. And, of course, to psychotic loners. Violence has become part of American life. The U.S. has the highest murder rate of affluent democracies. America had an extreme homicide rate of 5.4 per 100,000 people in 2008-2009, compared with a 1.43 rate in England and Wales and a 1.3 rate in Italy. The statistics differ somewhat every year, but the rate is always much higher in the United States than in other affluent nations. Japan has less than a 10th of the U.S. murder rate. Since 1982, America has seen at least 60 mass murders (defined as at least four people being killed) committed by guns. But violence doesn't manifest only in the psychotic actions of a few. It seems to be part of the fabric of society, prevalent in entertainment and present in the ""pre-emptive war"" in Iraq, waged on false information and funded by the American public. The coward -- I will never utter his name -- who so violated sacred ground and killed so many people was a product of a broken system. He spent six years in the armed forces, drank heavily and was a member of a white-power rock band. At some point, we must acknowledge and understand why this happens. In seems our system of education, our culture and our governance are failing somehow. President Obama, come to Oak Creek . On August 5, the American dream was attacked. Immigrants, whether naturalized -- like my father -- or not, have been treated as a second class for far too long. Mexican-American and Muslim immigrants shoulder the brunt of this sentiment. Yet all people who are not Caucasian and Christian most likely have felt this disregard, including African-Americans, brought to this country against their own free will. Conservatives who are anti-immigration add to the poison by denigrating foreigners more and more often. It is a sad and backward situation because immigrants are the lifeblood of this country, as John F. Kennedy wrote so eloquently in his book, ""A Nation of Immigrants."" ""This was the secret of America: a nation of people with the fresh memory of old traditions who dared to explore new frontiers...,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Every ethnic minority, in seeking its own freedom, helped strengthen the fabric of liberty in American life. Similarly, every aspect of the American economy has profited from the contributions of immigrants."" This second-class status was further demonstrated when the national government and media seemed to lose interest in or concern about the shootings and the ensuing dialogue. Maybe it was too much to take in after the massacre in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Maybe this was not tragic enough to get prolonged attention. Maybe politically, this is a powder keg. Whatever the excuse, it is not good enough. Michelle Obama is coming to Oak Creek, but she is not an elected official who is responsible for national policies that are at the core of this problem. On a Sunday morning when devout Americans were getting ready for a sermon, they were slaughtered by a maniac who should have never been able to own a gun, given his history. No matter what was happening that week, it should have been top priority on any leader's list to do something to acknowledge and help right this situation. The president should have made phone calls to representatives of the Sikh community. The media should have sent their best and brightest to Wisconsin to dissect the phenomenon of hate murders -- to its credit, CNN did. Civil rights leaders would have done well to evaluate the nuances of the massacre, to shed light on their own causes. In turn, they would have gained an ally in the Sikh community. If any of these things would have happened, maybe our discussion would turn to how to take action. How does ""freedom"" apply to hate speech, gun control, or the history of violence in America? Maybe Democrats and Republicans could unite on the issue of safety in our society. Maybe political leaders would realize that when neighborhoods are safer, the economy benefits as more people and businesses move in. Maybe immigrants would stand side by side to raise a unified voice in the upcoming elections -- seeking legitimate immigration reform. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe these lessons are not lost. Maybe those who laid down their lives did not do so in vain. I hope this is the case. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amardeep Kaleka.","Amardeep Kaleka's father was killed as he tried to stop Sikh temple murderer .

"(CNN) -- The press does not have the right to get access to the government's investigation into the deadly August accident at the Crandall Canyon mine, a federal judge in Utah ruled Tuesday. Rescuers drill into the mine on August 16 to try to reach the miners. Three people died in rescue attempts. U.S. District Judge Dee Benson said there is no constitutional basis for him to make the investigation public. ""Plaintiffs argue that the First Amendment mandates public access to the type of MSHA [Mine Safety and Health Administration] proceeding at issue in this case,"" Benson wrote in his order. ""They point, however, to nothing specific in the Constitution to support their claim."" A coalition of news organizations including CNN, The Associated Press, the Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret Morning News filed suit last week seeking to stop the investigation into the Crandall Canyon incident until a judge could decide whether the proceedings should be open to the public. The suit asked for Benson to grant a temporary restraining order to stop federal investigators ""from conducting any more closed proceedings"" and to release the transcripts from the proceedings that have already taken place. Michael O'Brien, a Salt Lake City attorney representing the media organizations, said they are ""disappointed, but not disheartened."" The news organizations are considering appealing the ruling within the court system. They are also considering a possible appeal to Congress that would require MSHA to hold public hearings ""on these important matters, where the actions of MSHA as well as the mine owner are under question. ""Certainly, MSHA should not be allowed to investigate itself in secret,"" O'Brien said in an e-mail to CNN. ""If the courts don't intervene, hopefully Congress will find a way to allow public scrutiny of MSHA's investigations of itself and its regulated mines."" The U.S. Attorney's Office in Utah is pleased with Benson's decision, but won't comment further ""since this is ongoing litigation,"" said spokeswoman Melodie Rydalch. Attorneys for MSHA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. On August 6, a cave-in of the Crandall Canyon mine trapped six miners. Ten days later, three other people, including an investigator for the U.S. Department of Labor's MSHA, died as they attempted to reach the trapped miners, whose bodies have not been recovered. Benson said there is no established precedent under which he could make the investigation public. Some cases the media organizations referred to have to do with access to criminal trials, he wrote, and ""the court cannot make the leap that plaintiffs suggest by concluding that because the public has a First Amendment right of access to hear witnesses in a criminal trial, they also have a right of access to private government investigatory interviews."" The media organizations claimed in their suit that the same Utah federal court, after a similar accident 20 years ago, ruled that MSHA had to make its proceedings public. Government attorneys said in their response to the suit that the decision was later vacated as moot, and even if it had not been, that case involved formal hearings open to outside groups but closed to the media. Benson agreed with the government in his ruling, saying the facts in the previous case differ from those in the current situation. ""In this case, MSHA is conducting private, government-only interviews. Unlike [the previous case], no company or union representatives, or any other outside individuals, are permitted to attend or participate in the interviews."" The ruling in the previous case allowed MSHA to exclude the media so long as interview attendants were limited to MSHA personnel, a court reporter, the person being questioned, and his or her attorney or adviser, Benson wrote. ""This is almost the exact situation in this case. The only difference is that in this case a state official [who is part of the investigation team] and a notary are also present.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, Pentagon officials said Thursday. A file image of the USS Cole, which the U.S. Navy moved to the Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon. The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency, but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked. ""It's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Navy do, the presence is important,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday. ""It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that,"" he said. ""But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world."" The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors. It returned to service in 2002. The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast, Pentagon officials said. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was ""important,"" and Washington was waiting for it to take place. And a Bush administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringSyria that ""the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon, and we want to see the situation resolved."" ""We are sending a clear message for the need for stability,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak for publication. The ships ""should be there a while,"" the official added. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The country has been without a president since November, when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman, disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock. Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Five former secretaries of state from both parties Monday discussed how they would advise the next president on a wide range of foreign policy, including relations with Russia, Iran and the Middle East. ""I would advise the president to fully engage with Syria,"" former Secretary of State James Baker said at a George Washington University forum co-sponsored by CNN. ""I think it's ridiculous for us to say we're not going to talk to Syria, and yet the Israelis have been negotiating peace with them for the last six or eight months."" Baker served under President George H.W. Bush. (The full comments will air on ""The Next President: A World of Challenges"" this Saturday night at 9 p.m. ET and again Sunday at 2 p.m. ET.) Baker, who has endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain's presidential bid, appeared with former Clinton secretaries of state Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher; Henry Kissinger, who served under Nixon and Ford; and former Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell. Albright has been an active supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama. Powell, who said he has not decided which candidate to back this year, said Monday the election of an African-American president ""would be electrifying, but at the same time [I have to] make a judgment here on which would be best for America."" As the former diplomats urged a cautious approach in the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Powell seemed to take a swipe at McCain's tough criticism of Moscow. ""Some debate in the presidential elections has basically been, 'We are all Georgians now,' "" said CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour. ""What does that mean? It's the same as was said after 9/11."" Responded Powell, ""One candidate said that, and I'll let the candidate explain it for himself."" Pressed to explain his response, the retired general said the crisis called for caution. ""The fact of the matter is that you have to be very careful in a situation like this not just to leap to one side or the other until you take a good analysis of the whole situation.... ""The Russian Federation is not going to become the Soviet Union again. That movie failed at the box office. But they do have interests. And we have to think carefully about their interests."" When the crisis began in early August, the Obama campaign called ""for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict,"" echoing the statements from the White House and the European Union. Kissinger told the panel the United States needs ""Russia for resolution of the Iranian problem. We may need Russia if Pakistan evolves in some of the directions that it might."" ""I would urge the new president, as I'm urging this president, to explore the possibilities of cooperation and be very sure before we go the route of cutting off WTO [World Trade Organization] and the other international measures for which cooperation with Russia may be very important,"" he said. Baker said the U.S. needs to cooperate with Russia ""where we can, where it makes sense, but we ought to also be willing to confront them where our vital interests are involved. We are committed to the independence of these former republics of the former Soviet Union."" The former secretaries of state also focused their attention on talks with Iran. The Bush administration joined the other members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, China and Russia, along with Germany -- in offering Iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones North Korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program. But the United States has refused to sit down with Iran until that suspension takes place. ""When I was in office, we had a standing policy with the Iranians. We were ready to talk to them, provided it would be done at an official level, at the level of the secretary of state, and they did -- they wouldn't -- they didn't have enough domestic political support for that,"" Baker said. Kissinger added:  ""Well, I am in favor of negotiating with Iran. And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East, of a stable Middle East, and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it. And, therefore, I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we -- we know we're dealing with authentic."" Albright told the panel that she doesn't think the United States understands Iranian society and that could be a problem in dealing with the nation. ""It is not monolithic. There are various aspects of the fact that [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad is not particularly popular. There are economic issues. And the more that we go around vilifying them, we create -- put him a stronger position. And so not only should we do these steps that the others have been talking about, but we have to make sure that we're not undercutting what we want to do by creating a bigger problem than we have."" Christopher said checking the authenticity of the negotiations is a key factor. ""I think the first thing you do when you've got a message from the Iranians is to find out whether it's authentic or not,"" he said. ""Then, I think you have to move forward. ... We can't be complacent about the nuclear possibilities in Iran, but nevertheless we cannot afford not to have a comprehensive dialogue to see if it can be stopped because, frankly, the military options here are very, very poor.""","Former secretaries of state discuss foreign relations in CNN forum .

"Washington (CNN) -- A second government report on the Secret Service scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia found no fault with how the agency investigated the matter, according to a copy obtained Friday by CNN. The report by the Homeland Security Department inspector general's office was scheduled to be released next week. In its first report last September, the inspector general concluded that the incident in which Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel last spring caused no security threat before President Barack Obama arrived in the country for a summit. The new report coming out Tuesday said the Secret Service ""responded expeditiously and thoroughly"" to the incident. The agency immediately pulled 11 agents allegedly involved in the prostitution scandal from the security detail, put them on administrative leave and removed their security clearances. Report: DEA agent made prostitute arrangement for Secret Service agent . ""Investigative activities included interviewing 232 subjects and witnesses, sending four inspectors to Colombia, reviewing thousands of e-mail messages, and administering 14 polygraph examinations,"" the report said. It noted that Obama's security was not compromised and that the agency took subsequent steps intended to prevent similar problems on future trips. The report made no recommendations, which signaled the watchdog's satisfaction with how the incident was handled. A third report examining whether the culture of the Secret Service enabled or tolerated such behavior was expected in coming months. Secret Service scandal: Systemic problem or abberation? The incident that embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old agency and raised security concerns involved agents who were part of the advance team preparing for Obama's arrival for the Summit of the Americas last April. They hit the clubs of Cartagena for a night of drinking that ended with bringing women back to their hotel rooms. A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to exposure of what happened and the ensuing investigations. Nine agents eventually left or lost their jobs. U.S. soldiers reprimanded in scandal . At a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in May, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan insisted the incident was an aberration. ""This is not a cultural issue, this is not a systemic issue,"" Sullivan said, arguing that similar misconduct hadn't occurred on thousands of other overseas trips by Secret Service agents. ""On this particular trip, we had individuals who made very bad decisions."" In addition to the Secret Service agents, 12 military personnel also were cited for their role in the scandal in Cartagena. Seven U.S. Army soldiers, two Marines and an Air Force member received letters of reprimand, while two members of the Navy refused non-judicial punishment and are awaiting court-martial.

"(CNN) -- Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan slams President Bush and today's Republicans, while calling Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton ""the smartest presidents"" he worked with, according to an advance copy of his upcoming book. President Bush, left, smiles with Alan Greenspan after the longtime Fed chairman stepped down last year. He further says the GOP deserved the stomping it took in November's congressional elections -- a ballot that saw both houses of Congress wrested from Republican control -- because the party ""swapped principle for power."" His book, ""The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World,"" is scheduled for release Monday. CNN obtained a copy Saturday. In the book, Greenspan wrote that Bush essentially left an unbridled GOP Congress to spend money however it saw fit, and by not vetoing a single bill in six years, the president deprived the nation of checks and balances. ""The Republicans in Congress lost their way,"" Greenspan wrote. ""They swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose."" Greenspan, an 81-year-old Republican who retired last year after five terms as Fed chairman, wrote that he made no secret of his view that Bush should reject some bills. ""It would send a message to Congress that it did not have carte blanche on spending,"" Greenspan recalls telling the administration. ""But the answer I received from a senior White House official was that the president didn't want to challenge House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 'He thinks he can control him better by not antagonizing him,' the official said."" The White House, however, said that vetoes weren't necessary because Congress ""worked with us."" ""The Republican Congress stayed within the president's top-line numbers on non-national security appropriations bills. We had veto threats, which were used to good effect to keep spending within the president's numbers,"" said spokesman Tony Fratto. Greenspan wrote in his book that the decision was costly. ""To my mind,"" he wrote, ""Bush's collaborate-don't-confront approach was a major mistake -- it cost the nation a check-and-balance mechanism essential to fiscal discipline."" He further wrote that former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill ""found himself the odd man out; much to my disappointment, economic policymaking in the Bush administration remained firmly in the hands of the White House staff."" Fratto countered that O'Neill and former Treasury Secretary John Snow ""had the opportunity to present their ideas through the policymaking process. If ideas failed to carry the day, it probably had something to do with the force and logic of the policies being advocated, rather than anything about the 'process.' Ideas were considered, sometimes they achieved consensus, sometimes not -- nothing unusual there. At any rate, where we ended up on economic policy was right, as our records show."" ""We're not going to apologize for increased spending to protect our national security,"" Fratto said. ""That isn't just increased spending. It's an investment in the safety and security of the nation, which is also, by the way, an important economic objective."" Greenspan praised former President Clinton and his attitude toward economic policies, saying, ""either Clinton shared many of my views on the way the economic system was evolving and on what should be done, or he was the cleverest chameleon I'd ever encountered."" ""Clinton was often criticized for inconsistency and for a tendency to take all sides in a debate, but that was never true about his economic policy,"" he wrote. ""A consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth became a hallmark of his presidency."" Greenspan said Clinton and former President Nixon were ""by far the smartest presidents I've worked with."" The former Fed chairman says his view of the Bush administration was not always so grim, and that he was initially excited about Bush's election. ""I looked forward to at least four years of working collegially with many of the government's best and brightest men, with whom I had shared many memorable experiences. And on a personal basis, that is how it worked out,"" Greenspan wrote. ""But on policy matters, I was soon to see my old friends veer off in unexpected directions."" E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- NASA's launch of the Mars Science Laboratory -- hampered by technical difficulties and cost overruns -- has been delayed until the fall of 2011, NASA officials said at a news conference Thursday in Washington. A photo illustration of a laser-equipped vehicle that is set to be part of the Mars Science Laboratory. The mission had been scheduled for launch in the fall of 2009. The Mars Science Lab is a large, nuclear-powered rover designed to traverse long distances with a suite of onboard scientific instruments aboard. It is, according to NASA's Web site, part of a ""long-term effort of robotic exploration"" established to ""study the early environmental history of Mars"" and assess whether Mars has ever been -- or still is -- able to sustain life. The delay of the launch, according to NASA, is due to a number of ""testing and hardware challenges that must (still) be addressed to ensure mission success."" ""The progress in recent weeks has not come fast enough on solving technical challenges and pulling hardware together,"" said Charles Elachi, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Changing to a 2011 launch ""will allow for careful resolution of any remaining technical problems, proper and thorough testing, and avoid a mad dash to launch,"" argued NASA Associate Administrator Ed Weiler. The overall cost of the Mars Science Lab is now projected to be roughly $2.1 billion, according to NASA spokesman Dwayne Browne. The project originally carried a price tag of $1.6 billion. NASA's entire budget for the current fiscal year, according to Browne, is approximately $15 billion. According to NASA, the Mars rover will use new technologies and be engineered to explore greater distances over rougher terrain than previous missions to the planet. This will be done in part by employing a new surface propulsion system. ""Failure is not an option on this mission,"" Weiler said. ""The science is too important and the investment of American taxpayer dollars compels us to be absolutely certain that we have done everything possible to ensure the success of this flagship planetary mission."" Weiler asserted that, based on the agency's preliminary evaluations, additional costs tied to the delay of the Science Lab launch would not result in the cancellation of other NASA programs over the next two years. He did, however, concede that it would result in other unspecified program delays. Critics have charged that the delay and cost overruns associated with the Mars Science Lab are indicative of an agency that is plagued by a lack of accountability and inefficiency in terms of its management of both time and taxpayer dollars. ""The Mars Science Laboratory is only the latest symptom of a NASA culture that has lost control of spending,"" wrote Alan Stern, a former NASA associate administrator, in a November 24 op-ed in the New York Times. ""A cancer is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects."" Stern charged that the agency's cost overruns are being fueled by ""managers who disguise the size of cost increases that missions incur"" and ""members of Congress who accept steep increases to protect local jobs."" Browne replied in a written statement saying that NASA administrators are ""constantly working to improve (the agency's) cost-estimating capabilities. ... We continually review our projects to understand the true risk in terms of performance, cost and schedule."" ""The fact of life at NASA, where we are charged with creating first-of-a-kind missions of scientific discovery, is that estimating the costs of ... science can be almost as difficult as actually doing the science,"" Browne said. NASA's most recent Mars project -- the mission of the Phoenix Mars Lander -- came to an end last month after the solar-powered vehicle's batteries ran down as the result of a dust storm and the onset of Martian winter. It had operated two months beyond its initial three-month mission. NASA officials had landed the vehicle on an arctic plain after satellite observations indicated there were vast quantities of frozen water in that area, most likely in the form of permafrost. They thought such a location would be a promising place to look for organic chemicals that would signal a habitable environment. Scientists were able to verify the presence of water-ice in the Martian subsurface, find small concentrations of salts that could be nutrients for life, and observe snow descending from the clouds, NASA said Thursday.","NASA's launch of the Mars Science Laboratory delayed until 2011 .

"(CNN) -- All charges have been dropped against the first suspect arrested in connection with last week's shooting at a Texas community college that left three wounded, officials said Monday. Carlton Berry, 22, was arrested on the day of the shooting and charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, but the Harris County district attorney dismissed the charges pending ""further investigation,"" Harris County District Clerk Claire Kennedy said. The Harris County sheriff has scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon to talk about why the charges against Berry were dropped. Investigators arrested another man -- 22-year-old Trey Foster -- on Friday, charging him with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Kennedy said. Foster was arrested in Plano, more than 250 miles north of the scene of the shooting at the North Harris campus of Lone Star College, just outside Houston. The shooting garnered wide attention amid early fears that a gunman was on the loose on a campus. Harris County officials have said the January 22 shooting apparently stemmed from an argument between two men. At least one had a student ID. Both were wounded by gunfire and treated at a hospital. A maintenance worker also was shot in the leg. The shooting took place outdoors between the academic building and the library. Foster is being held in jail awaiting arraignment, set for February 28, Kennedy said.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Three Christian churches in Indonesia were destroyed by an angry mob during clashes with police Tuesday that erupted after a local court handed down a verdict against a Christian man accused of blasphemy against Islam, authorities said. The man was given a five-year sentence, said national police spokesman Col. Boy Rafli Amar, but the protesters wanted him to face a stiffer penalty. The destroyed churches were in Temanggung, Central Java, Amar said. ""The scene is now under police control,"" he said. ""It's calm but security is high."" Security personnel are searching for those responsible for the attack on the churches, and authorities are ""asking local religious leaders to stay calm and find diplomatic ways to solve the problem."" The attacks were the second violent incident against minority religious groups in Indonesia in the past three days. On Sunday, a mob of about 1,000 people, wielding knives and stones, attacked about 25 members of the Muslim minority sect, Ahmadiyah, in Cikeusik village in West Java's Banten province. Three people were killed and six others injured. The crowd opposed the presence of the Ahmadiyah in the village and demanded the group stop its activities. Amateur video of the incident obtained by Human Rights Watch showed people pummeling what looked like lifeless bodies with sticks and rocks. The video has been posted on the internet, fueling public outrage. In a televised statement Monday, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the violence against Ahmadiyah and ordered a thorough investigation. Human rights activists, however, are calling for the government to revoke a ministerial decree issued in 2008 that bans the community's religious activities. ""How many Ahmadiyah have to die at the hands of mobs before the police step in?"" said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""The Indonesian government should end this wave of hate crimes and immediately revoke the 2008 anti-Ahmadiyah decree, which encourages these vicious attacks."" The Setara Institute for Peace and Democracy, a local think tank, noted in a recent report a marked increase in the number of attacks against Ahmadiyah and other minority religions in Indonesia in recent years. The most populous Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has previously been touted as an example of tolerance and democracy in the Islamic world. But a 2009 study from the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington suggested it was actually among the most restrictive countries when it comes to religion.

"(CNN) -- From a remote valley in Northern California, Jill Tarter is listening to the universe. Jill Tarter at the Allen Telescope Array in California, which monitors radio signals for signs of alien life. Her ears are 42 large and sophisticated radio telescopes, spread across several acres, that scan the cosmos for signals of extraterrestrial origin. If intelligent life forms do exist on other planets, and they try to contact us, Tarter will be among the first to know. Are we citizens of Earth alone in the universe? It's a question that has long fascinated astronomers, sci-fi authors, kids with backyard telescopes and Hollywood executives who churn out spectacles about alien encounters. Polls have found that most Americans believe that some form of life exists beyond our planet. ""It's a fundamental question,"" said Tarter, the real-life inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 movie ""Contact.""  ""And it's a question that the person on the street can understand. It's not like a ... super-collider or some search for neutrinos buried in the ice. It's, 'Are we alone? How might we find out? What does that tell us about ourselves and our place in the universe?' ""We're trying to figure out how the universe began, how galaxies and large-scale structures formed, and where did the origins of life as we know it take place?"" Tarter said. ""These are all valid questions to ask of the universe. And an equally valid question is whether the same thing that happened here [on Earth] has happened elsewhere.""  Watch a preview of CNN's ""In Search of Aliens"" series » . Thanks to advancements in technology, scientists hope to get an answer sooner rather than later. Rovers have snapped photographs of the surface of Mars that show fossil-like shapes. NASA hopes to launch within a decade a Terrestrial Planet Finder, an orbiting observatory that would detect planets around nearby stars and determine whether they could support life. Such developments are catnip to scientists like Geoffrey Marcy, a professor of astronomy at the University of California-Berkeley who has discovered more extrasolar planets than anyone else. ""It wasn't more than 13 years ago that we hadn't found any planets around the stars, and most people thought that we never would. So here we are not only having found planets, we are looking for habitable planets, signs of biology on those planets,"" Marcy told CNN. ""It's an extraordinary explosion of a field of science that didn't even exist just a few years ago."" Then there's Tarter, whose quest for signs of extraterrestrial life kept her on the fringes of mainstream science for decades. While pursuing her doctorate at UC-Berkeley, Tarter came across an engineering report that floated the idea of using radio telescopes to listen for broadcasts by alien beings. It became her life's work. In 1984 Tarter founded the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) in California. Using telescopes in Australia, West Virginia and Puerto Rico, she conducted a decade-long scouring of about 750 nearby star systems for extraterrestrial radio signals. None was found, although Tarter had some false alarms. In 1998, she intercepted a mysterious signal that lasted for hours. Tarter got so excited she misread her own computer results: The signal was coming from a NASA observatory spacecraft orbiting the sun. Today, Tarter listens to the heavens with the Allen Telescope Array, a collection of 20-foot-wide telescopes some 300 miles north of San Francisco. The dish-like scopes are a joint effort of SETI and UC-Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Lab and have been funded largely by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who donated more than $25 million to the project. Unlike previously existing radio telescopes, which scan the sky for limited periods of time, the Allen Telescope Array probes the universe round the clock. Each of the 42 scopes is aimed at a different area of the sky, collecting reams of data that are continually studied by computers for unusual patterns. Then the listeners must filter out noise from airplanes and satellites. ""We're listening for something that we don't think can be produced by Mother Nature,"" Tarter said.  ""We're using the radio frequency, other people are using optical telescopes ... and in both cases we're looking for an artificial nature to a signal. ""In the case of radio, we're looking for a lot of power being squished into just one channel on the radio dial. In the optical, they're looking for very bright flashes that last a nanosecond ... or less, not slow pulsing kinds of things. To date we've never found a natural source that can do that."" Signals that any extraterrestrials might be transmitting for their own use would be difficult to detect, Tarter said. Astronomers are more likely to discover a radio transmission broadcast intentionally at the Earth, she said. Astronomers at SETI, however, are not sending a signal into space in an attempt to communicate with aliens. University of California professor Marcy is skeptical about the existence of intelligent alien life and believes our galaxy's vast distances would make communication between Earth and beings on other planets almost impossible. ""The nearest neighbor might be halfway across our galaxy, 50,000 light-years away. Communicating with them will take a hundred thousand years for a round-trip signal,"" he said. Still, Tarter remains undaunted. The Allen Telescope Array already does in 10 minutes what once took her scientists 10 days. When the project is completed, it will have 350 telescopes that, combined, can survey tens of thousands of star systems. ""We can look in more places and more frequencies faster than we ever could. And that will just get better with time. We're doing something now we couldn't do when we started, we couldn't do five years ago,"" she said. ""Think of it as a cosmic haystack. There's a needle in there somewhere. If you pull out a few straws, are you going to get disappointed because you haven't found the needle yet? No. We haven't really begun to explore."" CNN correspondent Miles O'Brien contributed to this story.","Scientists use radio telescopes to monitor the heavens for signals of alien life .

"Washington (CNN) -- Time after time Wednesday, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan insisted last month's prostitution scandal in Colombia was an aberration -- just poor choices by a dozen agents under the influence of alcohol. ""This is not a cultural issue, this is not a systemic issue,"" Sullivan told the Senate Homeland Security Committee, arguing that similar misconduct hasn't occurred on thousands of other overseas trips by Secret Service agents. ""On this particular trip, we had individuals who made very bad decisions."" He maintained that view when Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, noted the agents used their own names when signing in prostitutes as overnight guests in their hotel rooms. Doesn't that show the agents lacked any fear of disclosure or discipline, Collins asked. Sullivan responded that ""between the alcohol and I don't know, the environment, these individuals did some dumb things,"" adding that he did not believe they acted because they thought their behavior would be tolerated. In his own Secret Service career spanning decades, Sullivan noted, he never witnessed such behavior. To Collins and other senators on the panel investigating the night of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes in Cartagena, Sullivan's personal dedication and loyalty to the agency he heads might be preventing him from accepting what seems obvious to them. ""I continue to believe that the problem is broader than you believe it to be,"" Collins said to Sullivan at the end of Wednesday's hearing. She later told reporters: ""I think he has a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that he has a broader problem than just this one"" episode. Photos: A decade with the Secret Service . The hearing was the first by a congressional committee on the April incident that embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old agency and raised security concerns. In Colombia as part of the advance details before President Barack Obama arrival to attend the Summit of the Americas, a dozen agents hit the clubs of Cartagena for a night of drinking that ended with them bringing women back to their hotel rooms. A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to a dozen Secret Service members being sent home and the resulting media coverage and investigations. Collins and committee chairman Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with the Democrats, called an announcement at the hearing that the Department of Homeland Security's acting inspector general will launch an independent investigation of the Colombia incident ""a big change"" and ""significant."" Previously, the acting inspector general, Charles Edwards, was going to review the internal investigation by the Secret Service. In addition, at least two other congressional panels are looking into the scandal, and the military is investigating 12 members also allegedly involved. In his opening statement Wednesday, Lieberman said it was hard to believe that on one night, the agents involved ""suddenly and spontaneously did something they and other agents never had done before."" House chairmen praise Secret Service response to prostitution scandal . Lieberman and Collins provided new details of the incident, describing how the Secret Service agents went out on the town in groups of two or three to four different strip clubs and night clubs and returned to their hotel with foreign women who were signed in as overnight guests. Collins said the circumstances suggested that ""different rules apply on the road."" Sullivan, however, repeatedly argued the incident reflected misconduct by a few bad actors in an otherwise professional and exemplary agency. He apologized for what happened and declared himself ""dumbfounded"" when word of what happened first reached him the next day. ""When many of these people were interviewed, I don't think they could explain why they exhibited the behavior they did,"" he said, adding that ""there is no excuse for that type of behavior from a conduct perspective and a national security perspective. That type of behavior was reckless."" Sullivan also revealed that two of the Secret Service agents who initially said they would resign over the scandal now are seeking to challenge their ouster. He said the agency will seek to revoke the security clearances of the two, which would effectively prevent them from continuing to work for the Secret Service. Under respectful but persistent questioning by the panel members, Sullivan said the misconduct never compromised the security plan for the Obama trip. 3 Secret Service agents refuse prostitution scandal polygraph . The incident involved roughly 20 alleged prostitutes and has resulted in the dismissal of nine Secret Service members. Three others were cleared of serious misconduct. The military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 service members, but has yet to announce any results. Collins noted that ""it is basic 'counterintelligence 101' that Secret Service personnel and others holding sensitive positions of trust in the U.S. government should avoid any situation that could provide a foreign intelligence or security service or criminal gangs with the means of exerting coercion or blackmail. Yet two of the primary means of entrapment -- sexual lures and alcohol -- were both present here in abundance."" While preliminary findings are that no weapons or classified material was in the agents' rooms, those involved ""could easily have been drugged or kidnapped, or had their liaisons with these foreign national used to blackmail them,"" she said. ""They willingly made themselves potential targets not only for intelligence or security services, but also for groups like"" drug cartels. White House defends Secret Service amid prostitution investigation . Sullivan said in his opening statement that ""at the time the misconduct occurred, none of the individuals involved in misconduct had received any specific protective information, sensitive security documents, firearms, radios or other security related equipment in their hotel rooms."" In addition, Sullivan noted that allegations of similar misconduct by Secret Service personnel in El Salvador in March 2011 appeared to be untrue. ""After several days in San Salvador and conducting 28 interviews with hotel managers and employees, individuals from the U.S. Department of State, other government agencies and contract employees assigned to assist the Secret Service ... no evidence was found to substantiate the allegations,"" he said. The alleged incident was reported by CNN affiliate KIRO in Seattle. The station cited an unnamed U.S. government contractor who worked extensively with the Secret Service advance team in San Salvador before an Obama visit. The source said he was with about a dozen Secret Service agents and a few U.S. military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before Obama arrived. The men drank heavily at the club, the source said, and most of them paid extra for access to a VIP section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash. Sullivan said Wednesday that the owner of the business was interviewed and provided a sworn written statement saying ""he had no knowledge or any other information that any Secret Service personnel had been to his business or information about misconduct by Secret Service personnel."" He outlined previously reported steps being taken to prevent future instances, including enhanced supervision on such assignments and a reinforced code of conduct. Sullivan also encouraged agents to blow the whistle on any misconduct by peers that they encounter. ""I don't think that our men and women need these guidelines because we have men and women of character, we have men and women of integrity,"" he said. Collins remained unpersuaded, telling reporters after the hearing she was disturbed by Sullivan's repeated insistence that the Colombia scandal was an isolated incident. Meanwhile, three Drug Enforcement Administration agents are under investigation for allegedly soliciting sex in Cartagena. One of them had a long-term relationship with a prostitute, two government sources familiar with the investigation said. Investigations focus on agents' activities, relationships in Colombia . The DEA agents were not involved in security for the president's trip, the government sources said. The DEA agent's relationship with the prostitute came to light after a Secret Service agent voluntarily reported to his superiors that he was at a party at the agents' Cartagena apartment on April 13 where the three agents and several women were present, the government sources said. The Secret Service agent is the 13th employee to be caught up in the Colombia scandal. He is on administrative leave, according to several sources, but is not expected to lose his job because he came forward on his own to report the incident. CNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Ashley Hayes and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Senators differ with the Secret Service director on the scope of the problem .

"(CNN) -- Washington was a sea of smartphones snapping photos on Monday throughout the pomp and circumstance of Inauguration Day. Between the glamorous gowns, the presidential oath, and the parade of marching bands, it was a day meant to be documented. But we made a discovery during it all: Just as interesting as the photos themselves were the people taking them. Back in 2009, the inauguration was a huge deal -- an estimated 1.8 million people packed the National Mall to see America's first African-American president make history. Not surprisingly, CNN iReport saw a record number of contributions that day: nearly 12,000 submissions of ""the moment,"" when President Obama took the oath of office. This time, things were different. There were fewer attendees -- officials estimated between 800,000 to 900,000 people attended Monday's inauguration. But, more importantly, the social media landscape has dramatically changed in the past four years. So this time around, we invited our audience to document the inauguration through Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing site that was launched in October 2010 and now boasts an impressive 90 million monthly active users. The call to action was simple -- we invited attendees to take an Instagram shot of themselves during the inaugural festivities, tag the photo #cnn, and share why they made the trek to Washington -- and the end result was fantastic. Between Sunday and Monday, we received more than 10,300 photos and showcased some of the best submissions in a custom interactive. Others uploaded photos to iReport, CNN's global participatory news community. Together, the photos tell you a story about the people assembled for Obama's second inauguration. The crowd was diverse, made up of people old and young, black and white. There were families and groups of friends. For some, it was their first inauguration. Others were back to see Obama's inaugural speech a second time. It was cold and sunny, as evidenced by the number of winter hats and sunglasses in the crowd. At least one attendee, though, used her shades to block more than just the sunshine. ""I was a total crybaby out there,"" she wrote. American flags were the other accessory du jour. ""Don't even think about going without a flag,"" advised iReporter Lisa Clemans-Cope, mother of two young girls. At least one attendee made a point to stand out among the rest -- in a clever homemade ""Obama Care Bear"" costume. There were notable attendees in the crowd -- ""Glee's"" Darren Criss, Rep. Grace Meng, D-New York, and comedian Hal Sparks all joined the Instagram + iReport project -- alongside average citizens. And most everyone was grinning ear to ear, except for one man who documented his frustration with the glitchy Mall television feed. Finally, there were the stories behind the photos. Renee Chrisman shared a photo of her husband, Gunnery Sgt. Bradley Chrisman, who was chosen to escort inaugural VIPs onto the stage. Renee and their children were glued to the television set at home in North Carolina hoping to see Bradley in action. ""We caught a glimpse of him standing to the right of the president,"" she gushed. Political science student John White took notes during the ceremony. ""I plan on pursuing a career in national politics,"" he said. ""Now that I am beginning to lay out the work for my future career, this inauguration is my first step."" And for Becky Primeaux, attending the inauguration meant she could cross off an item on her ""bucket list."" ""To be part of something that is so patriotic and historic is so exciting,"" she said. ""I think every American should (attend an inauguration) in their life.""","CNN iReport and Instagram teamed up to see who attended the inauguration and why .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The highest-ranking Catholic church cleric charged and convicted in the landmark child sexual abuse trial will remain in jail for the time being, a Philadelphia judge ordered Tuesday. Monsignor William Lynn was found guilty Friday of one count of child endangerment, the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted of such a charge. The trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses but also church leaders for failing to stop them. Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse. He was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and on a charge of conspiring to protect a priest accused of abuse. Lynn's defense team argued during the trial that their client repeatedly told higher-ups about the alleged abuse and, under strict orders from the late Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, had no authority to remove priests from the ministry. On Monday, Lynn's defense attorneys filed a motion requesting that their client be released on house arrest pending his scheduled August 13 sentencing. He could face three-and-a-half to seven years in prison for his conviction on the third-degree felony. ""With every fiber in my body, (fleeing) is a non-issue,"" said Jeffrey Lindy, one of Lynn's lawyers. Following Friday's verdict, Lindy criticized the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing, calling it ""an unspeakable miscarriage of justice (for) a 61-year-old man with no prior record and long-established ties to the community."" Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington vehemently opposed house arrest. ""It's absurd,"" Blessington said. ""It would truly be an injustice to indulge these people after what they've done."" The hearing to discuss the motion for house arrest took place before a packed courtroom Tuesday. Lynn arrived dressed in all black and without his clerical collar. He wore full clerical garb during the 50 days of the trial and 13 days of jury deliberations. In addition to his two lead counselors, several of Lynn's family members filled the rows in the gallery. Also in attendance was Rita DeCarolis, the mother of Lynn's deceased sister's husband, who agreed to allow Lynn to stay in her home if he were granted house arrest, at which point one of Lynn's sisters began to weep. DeCarolis, who lives alone, was briefly called to the witness stand to confirm her understanding of house arrest and to prove her residency to the judge. ""I'm free,"" she told the court, regarding her availability to house the monsignor. At the conclusion of Tuesday's hearing, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Teresa Sarmina delayed her decision on whether Lynn should be placed under house arrest rather than jailed until his sentencing. Sarmina allowed prosecutors a week to consult legal analysts and Rev. Thomas Doyle -- who was sworn in as an expert witness on Catholicism and its canon law during the trial -- to determine what, if any, steps are to be taken in the event Lynn fled to the Vatican, where there is no extradition. She also instructed the defense to consult with their client to ensure he was aware of the consequences, should he flee. ""Get the hell out of here, he's not going to the Vatican,"" another one of Lynn's attorneys, Thomas Bergstrom, told reporters outside of the courthouse, adding that his client is incredibly strong considering the circumstances. ""That's ridiculous."" Although Sarmina did not grant the defense motion for release on house arrest pending sentencing, she did initiate the procedure for receiving an electronic monitoring device. The average wait time for such a device is three to four weeks. If granted and Lynn were to violate the conditions of house arrest, the judge could sentence him immediately as well as impose the maximum sentence of seven years in prison. ""The risk of flight is going up because he now has something to lose,"" Assistant District Attorney Mark Cipolletti told reporters outside the courthouse. ""This case is unprecedented and on a lot of fronts, it's a case of first impressions."" Lynn surrendered his passport and his bail was increased to $100,000 pending the house arrest judgment. All parties are due back in court July 5.","Monsignor William Lynn must remain in jail for now, a judge rules .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Several Japanese Coast Guard ships fired water cannon and shouted warnings at a boat carrying Taiwanese activists who were attempting to land on islands disputed by Taiwan, Japan and China, a spokesman said. Through loud speakers, the Japanese Coast guard urged the activists and four Taiwanese Coast Guard vessels accompanying them, to retreat from waters around the islands, which are known as the Senkakus in Japan, and Diaoyu in China. The deterrent worked and the Taiwanese ships left the area, the Japanese Coast Guard said. According to state news agencies in Taiwan and China, the confrontation occurred about 28 nautical miles from the islands in the East China Sea. Several activists were aboard the main protest boat, Chinese news agency Xinhua said, adding that it was the third time since June 2008 that the ship had been involved in a confrontation with the Japanese Coast Guard. Why Asia is arguing over its islands . Once on the islands, the activists planned conduct ceremonies relating to Matsu, the ""Goddess of the Sea"" on the islands, according to the Li Yiqiang, secretary general of World Association for Protecting the Diaoyutais. The activists included Hsieh Mang-lin, chairman of the Chinese Association for Protecting the Diaoyutais. He told Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) that they planned to erect a statue of Matsu on the island to help protect Taiwanese fisherman operating in the area. According to CNA, the Taiwanese fleet set out at 1.45 a.m. local time Thursday from Shenao in New Taipei and planned to return home the same afternoon. Disagreement over who owns the islands strained relations between Japan and China during the latter half of 2012, and the dispute shows no signs of waning. Protests flared across China in September, soon after Japan announced it had bought the islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands being bought by Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. In December, the dispute escalated when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen overhead. A number of Chinese ships have also entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

"New York (CNN) -- The family of a 7-year-old Bronx boy is suing the city of New York and its police force for $250 million, claiming the child was falsely arrested and handcuffed over a $5 theft. After being accused of stealing the money from a fellow student in November, the parents say, the boy was taken out of his third-grade class in the Bronx and detained by authorities. The family filed the suit last week, but the incident came into the spotlight early Wednesday in New York when the boy's mother released a photo of the boy being handcuffed. The court filing says the child was handcuffed by police, held for 10 hours and charged with two counts of robbery that were later dropped. But the New York Police Department disputes those allegations, saying the claims are exaggerated. ""We're barred from discussing details involving a minor, but that doesn't stop a plaintiff's lawyer from exploiting a child and grossly distorting and fabricating 'facts,'"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne. Police said they have referred the case to Internal Affairs for further review.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Militants attacked an army base in northwest Pakistan in a coordinated assault that resulted in an hours long gun battle that left at least 35 people dead on Saturday, intelligence and security officials said. At least 13 security personnel, 10 civilians and 12 militants were killed in the early morning attack on the base that included housing for Pakistani military personnel and their families near the town of Serai Naurang in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the officials said. About 40 militants targeted the base as well at least one house believed to be a home for some of the personnel and their families. Two of the militants who were killed were wearing suicide jackets, intelligence officials said. Ten civilians, including three women and three children, also died when one of the suicide bombers entered a nearby house and detonated the explosives, they said.

The trailer truck contained 44 valves made of a nickel and chromium alloy that, due to their ""high resistance to corrosion, make them particularly apt for use in the nuclear industry,"" the ministry said.

"(CNN) -- Under fire for its treatment of a rape victim, the Saudi Arabian government on Saturday said that the woman had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that both ""exposed themselves to this heinous crime."" Human rights groups want Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim. In a statement, the kingdom's Ministry of Justice said it was ""forced ... to clarify the role of the woman and the man who was accompanying her in this case and its circumstances"" because of what it claimed were false media reports. The 19-year-old woman was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for meeting with the man -- described by her attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph. The seven attackers, who abducted the pair and raped her, received sentences ranging from 10 months to five years in jail. When the woman appealed her sentence, a Saudi court more than doubled it. The Qatif General Court also increased the sentence for the rapists, to two to nine years in prison. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law.  Watch why official reaction has been muted » . The ministry has previously said the woman's punishment was increased after further evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. She was convicted of violating the kingdom's Islamic law by not having a male guardian with her. The attacks took place in March 2006, when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married. The government statement said that according to the woman's signed confession, she called a man on her cell phone and ""asked to be with him alone, illegally."" The two met at a marketplace, then rode in the man's car to ""a dark area of the beach, and stayed there for some time,"" the ministry said. The group of attackers ""saw her in a compromising situation, her clothes on the ground,"" the statement said. ""The men at this point assaulted her and the man with her."" The woman knew that being alone with a man who wasn't her husband was illegal, ""and therefore she violated the covenant of marriage."" However, the woman was engaged -- not married -- at the time. After the incident, the woman and the man did not come forward about the assaults or press charges until someone contacted the woman's husband ""telling him what happened, and about his wife's affair and adultery,"" the ministry said. ""She then confessed ... the husband therefore came forward to the police and formally complained nearly three months after the incident."" The woman and her companion ""exposed themselves to this heinous crime, causing the crime to take place because of their violations of the pure Sharia ruling"" -- the country's strict Islamic law. The case was handled through regular court procedures, and the woman, her male companion and the attackers all agreed in court to the initial sentences, the government said in a previous statement. The woman's husband told CNN earlier this week that ""from the onset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime. She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes."" Asked about the ministry's statement Saturday, the husband declined to comment publicly. The woman's attorney, Abdulrahman al-Lahim, has said his law license was revoked to punish him for speaking to the Saudi-controlled news media about the case. Attempts by CNN to reach al-Lahim Saturday were unsuccessful. Al-Lahim previously said the woman met the man at a shopping mall in order to retrieve an innocuous photograph from him. He has also said the man was blackmailing his client and forced her to have the meeting to save her engagement and avoid embarrassment. The woman's husband did not find out about the crime until his friends told him the rapists were bragging about it in the Qatif community, The Arab News reported in its Sunday editions, citing a source close to the case. Earlier this week, the woman's husband blamed his wife's treatment on a judge with a personal vendetta. Al-Lahim told CNN that the head judge in the three-judge panel that considered the case was opposed to his client from the beginning. Both said they believe the man forced the woman to meet with him, but said she was not allowed to present that in court. The government has said that al-Lahim was punished by a disciplinary committee for exhibiting ""disrespectful behavior toward the court."" Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. Al-Lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing next month at the ministry, where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment, according to Human Rights Watch.

"(CNN) -- The federal prosecution of former U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona will continue, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Thursday. The three-judge panel said the lawmaker's actions were not protected by the Constitution's ""speech and debate"" clause. ""Despite Renzi's best efforts to convince us otherwise, we agree with the district court that the alleged choices and actions for which he is being prosecuted lie beyond those limits"" of protected activity, the court said in a unanimous 45-page ruling. The privilege protects lawmakers and staffers from legal action over ""legislative"" acts. The pending trial had been on hold while the constitutional issues were being appealed. Republican Renzi, 53, faces federal corruption charges related to an alleged illegal land-swap deal, allegedly designed to help a business associate pay back $700,000 owed the lawmaker. He is also accused of misappropriating money from his family insurance business to fund his campaigns and for personal benefit. The charges include conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering, extortion and insurance fraud. FBI agents raided his family business in 2007, and he was indicted a year later. He decided not to seek re-election in 2008. He has pleaded not guilty. ""The Supreme Court has made equally clear that the Speech or Debate Clause does not make members of Congress supercitizens immune from criminal responsibility,"" said the appeals court. Renzi could now appeal his case to the Supreme Court. Previous lawmakers have sought to shield themselves from prosecution using the ""speech and debate"" protection, including former Rep. William Jefferson, D-Louisiana. He was convicted and sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009 for bribery and public corruption while in office. Renzi represented the large 1st District in his state, centered in Flagstaff. The case is U.S. v. Renzi (10-10088).","Renzi faces corruption charges related to an alleged illegal land-swap deal .

"(CNN) -- A liberal Democratic congressman who came under fire for a lewd photo that briefly appeared on his Twitter account over the weekend told CNN Wednesday that he did not post the image. Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner spoke to CNN's Wolf Blitzer a day after a contentious exchange with reporters in which he refused to directly answer any questions about the picture. On Wednesday he said he had hired a law firm to look into the matter. But he declined to directly answer whether he appeared in the photo. ""Photos can be manipulated. Photos can be of one thing and changed to something else. We're going to try to get to the bottom of what happened,"" he said. The photo showed the lower body of a man wearing underwear. A conservative blogger who broke the story has called for a full investigation of what he said was either the hacking of a congressman's account or something Weiner wants to hide. But Weiner told CNN he did not think such steps are necessary to deal with what he said was internet spam, an issue that many Americans face. ""Just because it happened to Congressman Weiner on his personal account doesn't mean that the taxpayers should pay for an investigation,"" he said. ""I'm going to turn it over to some people who are going to give me advice on what to do next. ""This seems like it was a prank to make fun of my name, the name Weiner. It happens a lot,"" he added. Asked whether he was protecting anyone, Weiner replied, ""Yes, I'm protecting my wife, who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality. You know, we've been married less than a year."" He also declined to say what he had written in direct messages to Twitter followers. ""I'm not going to get into how I communicate with people on social media. There was nothing ... inappropriate,"" he said. An e-mail that Twitter sent to members of Congress Wednesday lists several online security tips, according to a copy of the e-mail CNN obtained. The message does not specifically mention the photo posted on Weiner's page, but notes that questions about account security have surged recently. ""Some of you inquired today about the security of Twitter accounts,"" Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote. ""While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials."" Weiner on Tuesday told reporters he wasn't interested in talking about the issue any more, saying he already made statements over the Memorial Day weekend after the photo turned up on his Twitter account Friday night. In a heated exchange with reporters, he repeatedly dodged direct questions about the photo. ""If I were giving a speech to 45,000 people, and someone in the back threw a pie or yelled out an insult, I would not spend the next two hours of my speech responding to that pie or that insult. I would return to the things that I want to talk about,"" Weiner said in response to a question about whether he sent the lewd photo to a Seattle woman. He also refused to say why he hasn't asked law enforcement to investigate if in fact his account was hacked, as he has said it was. Despite repeated efforts by reporters, Weiner did not directly answer questions about the photo. In earlier comments, when asked if the photo was of him, Weiner deflected the question. ""I'm not going to talk about this anymore,"" he said, adding: ""I'm going to get back to the conversation I care about,"" including economic issues and what he calls a conflict-of-interest situation involving conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on the health care reform law. The New York Democrat is a leading liberal voice in Congress. Asked several questions about the Twitter situation Tuesday, Weiner stuck to his message. ""I understand you're doing your job, but I'm going to go back to work now,"" Weiner said at one point. When asked if he was concerned about being hacked, he responded: ""I'm going to return to working on the things I care about. I participated in the story a couple of days now, given comments on it. This is a distraction and I'm not going to let it distract me."" When a reporter noted the distraction might go away if he answered the questions, Weiner answered: ""I'm not convinced of that. ""I'm not convinced there's any value of me talking about it,"" Weiner said. Asked again if he was the man in the photo, Weiner responded again that he had made previous statements and now it was time for him to get back to work. On Wednesday, Weiner told CNN that he regretted ""the way that I handled it yesterday and I'm trying to do a better job today."" Previously, Weiner blamed the photo on a hacker who got control of his social-networking accounts and played a prank. Weiner's spokesman, Dave Arnold, said Monday the congressman has retained an attorney to look into the situation. No formal criminal investigation has been launched, which rankles Andrew Breitbart, whose conservative website biggovernment.com first reported the photo on Weiner's Twitter account in connection with a tweet to a Seattle woman.

"(CNN) -- A United Kingdom budget airline has apologized to its Jewish customers after loading ham and bacon baguettes on to the flight instead of the standard kosher food. EasyJet said it made the mistake on a flight from Israel to London. Some passengers were forced to go hungry during the 4 1/2-hour trip from Tel Aviv. An airline spokeswoman said incorrect food canisters were loaded onto the aircraft, though pork was not served to passengers. EasyJet's standard practice is to offer kosher and vegetarian sandwiches onboard Israeli flights, the spokeswoman said. She said the airline also offers nonkosher products but its  policy is not to load any pork products. ""We would like to apologize to the passengers, and can confirm we have done everything we can to ensure that this does not happen again,"" the airline said.","EasyJet says it made the mistake on a flight from from Tel Aviv to London .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lawyers within the Obama administration disagreed with the president's decision that U.S. participation in the NATO-led Libyan military mission doesn't come under the War Powers Resolution, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. President Barack Obama is in a stand-off with House Speaker John Boehner over the issue, and Congress might vote on measures to restrict funding for the mission this week to protest what Boehner says is Obama's violation of the war powers law. The president disagrees, based on a legal analysis of the situation backed by his general counsel, the State Department and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Carney said. ""This is not a unanimous legal decision within the administration, and it would be shocking if it were,"" Carney said in reference to what he called constant debate over the war powers measure since it was passed in 1973. ""... But the president makes the decision. Obviously, his White House (and) State Department lawyer also agree with his assessment, and we feel very confident that the legal reasoning is sound."" Carney also noted that Justice Department lawyers took part in the discussion, but he didn't include them among those he listed as supporting Obama. ""As the Justice Department has stated publicly, its views were heard,"" Carney told reporters. House Republican sources told CNN on Monday that several options are under consideration for votes this week -- probably Thursday -- to exert some congressional control over the Libya mission. No decision will be made on how to proceed until GOP legislators return Tuesday from a long weekend in their districts. Cafferty: Should Congress cut off funding? One idea is a vote to prohibit funding for any ground troops in Libya. Obama has pledged no ground forces will be sent to the mission, and the House Republican sources said the proposal would be intended to prevent any possible escalation in the mission and give legislators a chance to express their disapproval. ""Ultimately (the legislation) needs to have enough teeth for it to be to worth it,"" said one senior House GOP aide. The House already was planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill this week, and legislators including liberal Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio intend to propose an amendment to cut off funding for the Libya mission. According to the House GOP sources, separate votes on the Libya mission are likely before the defense bill comes up in order to allow legislators to signal their displeasure through legislation that doesn't go as far as the proposal by Kucinich. In addition, House members were further angered by news of strong disagreement within the Obama administration over the president's analysis of whether the Libya mission came under the War Powers Resolution. GPS: Debate over War Powers Resolution . The New York Times reported Saturday that a lead attorney for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel as well as counsel at the Pentagon argued internally that the president needs congressional authorization for the Libya mission, and the president overruled them. Carney's comments Monday acknowledged the disagreements, but portrayed them as part of the normal discourse on the war powers legislation. ""For me to get up and tell you that by some miracle, every lawyer in this administration was in agreement on that issue, you wouldn't believe me, because it's simply been too contentious for now 38 years,"" Carney said. Even if the House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same. On Sunday, two influential Republican senators said Congress should support the military campaign to send the proper message to allies and foes. ""The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi down,"" conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" later adding that Obama ""needs to step up his game with Libya but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi."" Gates also backed the Libyan mission, saying Obama was right to limit the scope of U.S. involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the War Powers Resolution. ""What was going on in Libya was considered vital interest by some of our closest allies. Those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan,"" Gates told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on, in support of our allies who did consider it a vital interest, is a legitimate way to look at this problem."" One of the GOP sources noted that the Republican leadership is facing the same dilemma it did earlier this month, when Kucinich was pushing a resolution that would have withdrawn all U.S. forces from the Libya mission. To prevent that from passing, Boehner was forced to counter with a watered-down version that gave the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya. Obama responded with a report to Congress last week that argued the limited role of U.S. forces in the NATO-led Libya mission failed to constitute engaging in hostilities as defined by the War Power Resolution. On Friday, Boehner said he specifically asked if the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel agreed with the administration's legal analysis, and that the White House's failure to answer that question made cutting funds for the mission a possibility. ""The House of Representatives will not allow the White House to continue skirting its obligations to the American people, this Congress, and the laws of this nation,"" Boehner said in a statement. ""Over the coming week, our members will review all options available to hold the administration to account."" Passed in 1973, the War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end the hostilities. That 90-day period ended Sunday. In the Senate, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts have drafted a resolution that supports the Libyan mission. If adopted by Congress, the resolution would serve as congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution, they say. Congressional opponents of the Libya mission include liberals such as Kucinich who generally oppose any war effort, as well as some Republicans who complain its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Gadhafi's ouster. The opponents also say the Libya situation could become a stalemate that drains resources at a time of mounting federal deficits that must be addressed. The White House, however, says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic, political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down. Carney has repeatedly emphasized that Obama had kept his word to the American people that the initial U.S. leadership role in the mission would get reduced to a supporting role, and no U.S. ground troops would take part. Even though the Senate in March unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, some Republicans now express total opposition to the U.S. support for that effort. In its report on the mission, titled ""United States Activities in Libya,"" the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Dan Lothian and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","The dispute involves the U.S. role in the NATO-led Libya military mission .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have launched a homicide investigation after identifying a body found in a rural western Tennessee county as that of Karen Swift, a mother of four last seen six weeks ago, authorities said. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge John Mehr said the body was discovered Saturday in Dyer County. ""It's very emotional for Mr. Swift and the family,"" Timothy Naifeh, a lawyer for the woman's husband, David Swift, said in a statement. ""They're asking at least for this period of time to have some privacy -- it's time for grieving and it's time for mourning. It's heartbreaking and it's very, very sad."" Karen Swift had filed for divorce from her husband on October 10. No lingering issues appeared to have been outlined in those court documents, with the couple seeming to agree on a custody arrangement and child support payments for their younger children, among other details. It was 20 days later, at 1:30 a.m. October 30, that Swift was last seen alive outside her home, according to a previous statement from the Dyer County Sheriff's Office. Her friends had told CNN affiliate WMC that Swift, a 44-year-old mother of four, had just returned home from a Halloween party. Her car, a 2004 white Nissan Murano, was recovered soon thereafter on a main road in northern Dyer County with a flat tire, according to police. Her disappearance prompted a massive ground and aerial search, Dyer County Sheriff Jeff Box noted in early November. The missing woman's brother, Jeffrey Johnson, told HLN's Nancy Grace on November 21 that authorities also searched the Obion River after finding some old clothes nearby. Box said in an e-mail Monday that the body, later identified as Swift, was found ""concealed ... by undergrowth and vegetation for some time"" around 1:30 p.m. Saturday off Harness Road. This runs between Route 78 and Millsfield Highway about nine miles north of downtown Dyersburg. The body was sent to the Shelby County Medical Examiner's Office in Memphis, where it was identified on Sunday as Swift using dental records, according to Box. The sheriff wrote Monday that a homicide investigation, rather than a missing person's case, is now being conducted into the woman's death. In addition to two older children, Swift leaves behind 6- and 9-year-old girls. Weeks ago, Johnson said those girls were ""in shock"" with their mother gone. ""We're doing everything we can to be together right now,"" Preston Swift, an older son of Swift, added November 22 to HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""My father and I have been doing everything we can to help (his two youngest siblings) deal with the situation.""

"Washington (CNN) -- During his 2000 presidential run, a New Hampshire voter asked Republican Sen. John McCain who he might choose as secretary of defense. McCain responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague, the very man who would be nominated to that post by a Democrat and frequent McCain target 13 years later. ""There's a lot of people that could do that,"" he told voters at a January town hall in Nashua, New Hampshire. ""One of 'em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel."" Now Hagel has been nominated for that same job, by McCain's 2008 campaign rival, President Barack Obama. But when the Senate Armed Services Committee meets on Thursday to discuss the nomination, McCain will be one of Hagel's biggest skeptics. What Hagel will say Thursday . ""My biggest concern is his overall attitude about the United States, our role in the world -- particularly in the Middle East and whether we should reduce the Pentagon further -- but mainly his general overall world view,"" McCain told CNN's Wolf Blitzer about his former colleague. To understand the depth of the fallout between the two men one needs to understand how close the senators once were. McCain loaned his star power to Hagel's first Senate campaign in 1996, traveling to appear with him in Nebraska. When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam. In 1997 they attended a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Speaking about his comrades in arms, McCain mentioned the ""unique bond that exists between us of which I am eternally proud."" ""When I see them on the floor of the Senate or somewhere in the Capitol, I feel a little lift,"" he said. Hagel spoke of McCain's service, declaring ""no one during this entire time ever gave more, or showed more courage, than John McCain."" Five things Hagel may be asked about . Their friendship led to a close working relationship during the 2000 presidential campaign, when Hagel served as a loyal surrogate and campaign co-chair for McCain. Then, Hagel said his friend felt he owed the country his service. ""His life has been committed to something larger than he is,"" Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush. ""He's a selfless person who's given much to his country."" Later that year, Hagel introduced McCain on the stage of the party's convention with a giant embrace. Back in the Senate, the long-time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the Iraq war. But their views diverged as McCain came to support President Bush's proposed troop surge in 2007, a military decision that drew Hagel's scorn. He famously called the proposal ""the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam if it is carried out."" Why some conservatives are still going after Hagel . A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences. But even McCain acknowledged the change. ""I've noticed over the years that our views on the United States of America and what we should be doing in the world have diverged rather dramatically,"" he said earlier this month. By McCain's 2008 presidential run, Hagel was more in line with McCain's anti-Iraq war opponent Barack Obama. The two traveled together on a Middle East Senate trip Obama used to beef up his foreign policy chops, and Hagel was never seen on McCain's iconic Straight Talk Express campaign bus. Avlon: Reality check for Hagel bashers . Hagel and McCain spoke after the former senator's nomination to the Defense Department. Afterward, McCain said he had concerns about Hagel's positions on Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan. But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing. ""Sen. Hagel and I are, are old friends and we had a very frank and candid conversation and I'll be looking forward to the hearing and asking questions,"" McCain said on January 22. ""I think that he should be given the opportunity of a hearing before any of us make a judgment."" Hagel's other war .","In 2000, candidate McCain says Hagel would make a great Defense Secretary .

"Washington (CNN) -- A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled against a former death row inmate who sought damages from the state after prosecutors hid crucial blood tests that would have earlier proven his innocence. The 5-4 decision Tuesday involved John Thompson, who came within weeks of execution and had spent 18 years behind bars before being set free after the new forensic evidence came to light. At issue was whether a district attorney's office should be held liable, under a ""failure to train"" standard, when one of its prosecutors unconstitutionally withholds exculpatory evidence from a criminal defendant. Then-New Orleans area District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. claimed his office should not be held fully responsible after one of his staff attorneys violated long-standing, accepted procedures on handling evidence in criminal trials. Thompson's lawyers said the DA's office as a whole should be held liable for the poor training of prosecutors working under Connick. ""A district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors' professional training and ethical obligations in the absence of specific reason, such as a pattern of violations, to believe that those tools are insufficient,"" Justice Clarence Thomas said. He was supported by his conservative colleagues Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito. In a tough dissent, Ruth Bader Ginsburg said ""Connick's deliberately indifferent attitude created a tinderbox in which (constitutional) violations were nigh inevitable."" But Thomas noted prosecutors often face ""gray areas,"" discretionary judgment calls concerning what evidence may be important to the defense. ""To prove deliberate indifference, Thompson needed to show that Connick was on notice that, absent additional specified training, it was 'highly predictable' that the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those gray areas and make incorrect ... decisions as a result,"" he said. ""In fact, Thompson had to show that it was so predictable that failing to train the prosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defendants' (constitutional) rights. He did not do so."" Thompson was convicted in 1985 in the murder of a New Orleans man. He was also implicated in a separate attempted armed robbery. Blood tests at the robbery showed the perpetrator had blood type B. Lawyers at the Orleans Parish DA's office offered conflicting stories about whether the prosecuting attorney ever received the blood test report, or whether Thompson himself was ever given a confirming blood test. Thompson was eventually convicted of both crimes and received the death sentence for the murder. Just weeks before his scheduled 1999 lethal injection, private investigators hired by Thompson's lawyers discovered the original crime lab report in police files. The prisoner was then tested and found to have blood type O. A hidden crime scene report also uncovered years after the fact showed eyewitnesses describing the murderer as 6 feet tall with close-cropped hair. Thompson had a large Afro at the time, and was only 5 feet, 8 inches. That report too was not handed over to the defense at trial. Armed with the new evidence, state courts then reversed the murder conviction, concluding the armed robbery conviction unfairly deprived Thompson of his right to testify in own defense at the murder trial. After being retried for murder in 2003, a jury found Thompson not guilty and he was released from custody. A federal civil rights lawsuit was then filed and a jury awarded Thompson $14 million in damages, a judgment upheld by a federal appeals court. A landmark 1963 high court ruling -- Brady v. Maryland -- said prosecutor have a sworn duty to turn over evidence that may show a defendant is innocent. But in a subsequent opinion, the high court said individual prosecutors cannot be sued for any constitutional violations in the courtroom. The Thompson decision further limits when defendants can sue for so-called ""Brady"" violations. In a rare oral dissent, Ginsburg spoke from the bench to strongly criticize the majority's conclusions. ""The record in this case abundantly shows flagrant indifference to Thompson's rights,"" she said. ""The conceded, long-concealed prosecutorial transgressions in Thompson's trials were neither isolated nor atypical. They were just what one would expect given the attitude toward Brady pervasive in the district attorney's office."" Ginsburg was backed by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Connick, now retired from his DA post, is the father of entertainer Harry Connick Jr. The case is Connick v. Thompson (09-571).","5 justices rule New Orleans DA's office not liable for prosecutor's misbehavior .

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- For 1st Lt. Jeremiah Lynch the golden day of coming home from a lengthy deployment in Kuwait was everything he had dreamed it would be. ""The day I came home from deployment was just euphoric,"" recalls Lynch, who is part of the Minnesota Army National Guard. ""It was fantastic. Somebody dropped me off at home, and the kids are all running out and hugs and kisses."" But as Lynch had been warned the honeymoon welcome home period would soon be over and hard work lay ahead. ""Yes, the first day back is just a fairy tale, of course. And then you have to start trying to put yourself back into the life of your family."" ""And of course they've been working with you gone for a year, and they've changed how they do things. I was advised to expect that and also to try not to come back and suddenly be in charge. I didn't listen to that advice."" Lynch, who has been with the Guard for seven years is married and has three young children, Janna, 9, Galiana, 4, and Frederick, 3, who was born while Lynch was deployed. He knew of many of his friends also deployed were going through tougher times. Divorces were not uncommon, nor were separations. His wife Erin offers some advice: ""It's not like if there was anything broken before deployment, it's all of a sudden going to be fixed."" Mrs. Lynch knows what she is talking about. She's in the armed forces and was herself deployed during 9/11 to Kosovo. She admits it's hard to seamlessly re-introduce a spouse who has been gone for so long. ""Welcoming the old husband back, it's a brand new feeling of 'Yeah you're new, and I like you and you smell nice,"" Lynch said. ""And then there is this 'No this is my routine, and my part of the dresser, and don't take this over.' It's kind of mixed up."" Mixed up all right and entirely too common. Abigail Gewirtz knows all about the new normal for family life after deployment. In fact she and her team at the University of Minnesota are conducting a five-year program trying to help just those families affected. ""Deployment is tough,"" Gewirtz said. ""It's tough when one parent is away and the other parent is single parenting. But the most stressful time is when families have to kind of reconstitute and parents have to get back on the same page and that can be really tough."" The program is called ADAPT and stands for After Deploymnet: Adaptive Parenting Tools. It's only offered in Minnesota to deployed parents with school age kids. The 14-week class offers skills and tools to help the transition back into family mode. The premise is that if the parents are stressed, parenting suffers and that trickles down to the kids. ""When you have been in combat, there are sights and sounds and smells and even tastes that remind you of terrible things,"" Gewirtz said, ""and so everyone who comes back from an environment where you had to react not respond because you could be killed if you didn't react instantaneously, they'll have to recalibrate their emotional responding."" ADAPT teaches parents to learn to take a pause before they start, for example, yelling at their kids if they drop their backpacks on the floor. Their approach is to take a breath, maybe even leave the room. Then when their initial fear over hearing loud noises has passed, go back to their kids and instruct them in just what want them to do. In this case, put backpacks where they belong. ""Going to the (ADAPT) classes I realized how many things we were doing wrong,"" said Jeremiah Lynch. The couple completed the program some months ago and gives it credit for making his re-integration back into family life a lot easier. ""Frankly we were turning into the yelling, shouting parents that if a child isn't doing what they are supposed to be doing we just keep saying it over and over again louder to their faces until they comply."" Now Lynch explains he has a new approach. ""You can't yell from another room 'Clean your room!' because they're not going to understand that. You have to get down to their level, maybe put a hand on them and look them in the eye and say, 'Hey you need to clean your room right now, please.' "" According to the Lynches, just a few of these simple tools and techniques have greatly lowered the level of stress felt in the household. Tools, techniques and most importantly communication seems to be at the forefront for making the transition easier on those that have been deployed as well as their families who have stayed behind. Gewirtz sums it up this way, ""When families don't communicate, there is a sense of walking on eggshells especially with someone who has come back with lots of scars. There is a sense that if we talk about it, it will be worse because it's so painful. But our treatment of PTSD indicates that exposure or talking about it is really the key to recovery, and I think that is no less true in a family context."" As for the Lynch family, they are doing just fine. With the help of the ADAPT tools, lots of communication and a good and ever ready sense of humor, they thrive. But on top of that Jeremiah Lynch has some good advice for those soon to be coming home: ""Listen to what you are being told about how hard it is, because it is that hard. And don't expect it to be fantastic when you get back. Lower your expectations."" In fact he suggests: ""Lower them a lot and then you'll be pleasantly surprised.""","For returning troops, getting back into the family dynamic is not easy .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Was it a game of ding-dong ditch, or just a misunderstanding? A U.S. sailor stands accused of ringing doorbells in the middle of the night and breaking into a 72-year-old woman's property while drunk, say police in Yokosuka, Japan. Authorities arrested Manuel Silva, 20, early Monday on the elderly woman's property in the city, located south of Tokyo. The arrested sailor is assigned to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, the Navy said. A Navy spokesman said he wasn't allowed to identify the sailor by name. Being off-base without permission could put Silva in breach of a standing curfew for all U.S. military service members in Japan. U.S. officials imposed the curfew in response to widespread outrage over rape accusations in October against U.S. sailors on the Japanese island of Okinawa. The incident started after police received several late night emergency calls. Somebody in the neighborhood where Silva was found was ringing doorbells and running away before the doors were answered. Police say they later discovered Silva on the elderly woman's property. The Navy said it is ""currently reviewing the incident to determine if there was a violation"" of regulations for U.S. service members serving in Japan. Silva was being held at a Yokosuka police station until his scheduled transfer Tuesday to a local prosecutor's office. ""The U.S. Navy takes this incident seriously,"" said USS George Washington spokesman Derrick Ingle. He said the Navy is ""fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation."" For decades, crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in Japan have contributed to a bumpy relationship between the Japanese people and the U.S. military. In November, a U.S. airman was accused of breaking into a family's home on Okinawa and assaulting a teenage boy before jumping off a third-floor balcony. Relations between the Japanese and the U.S. military also suffered in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island. CNN's Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","NEW: The Navy is investigating the arrest of a sailor assigned to an aircraft carrier .

"(CNN) -- Polygamist leader Warren Jeffs is not only running the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but he has also ousted at least 45 high-ranking members he considered a threat to his leadership, two well-placed sources tell CNN. Those who have been kicked out of the church -- all men -- are not allowed to return to their wives or children, the sources said. Jeffs, scheduled to go to trial this year on sexual assault and bigamy charges, is running the affairs of the church from his jail cell in Texas, the sources said. Jeffs gave up control of the splinter sect that advocates plural marriages, including marriages that involve girls younger than 18, after he was convicted in 2007 of rape as accomplice. That conviction was overturned last year. Sources within the church tell CNN that the man who replaced Jeffs as business head of the church, Wendell Nielsen, has been removed and that Jeffs has signed documents retaking control of FLDS. Also removed are Willie Jessup, Jeffs' one-time bodyguard who served as the spokesman for the church after a raid on its Texas compound; and David Zitting, the mayor of Hildale, Utah, a town in which the population consists almost entirely of members of the church. The FLDS splintered from the Mormon Church more than a century ago when Mormons renounced the practice of polygamy. Jeffs' church is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Critics of the FLDS say underage girls are forced into ""spiritual"" plural marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied sexual abuse. Texas prosecutors filed charges against Jeffs in 2008 after authorites raided the sect's Yearning for Zion Ranch in El Dorado, Texas. They removed 400 children. Authorities feared they had been sexually abused. While some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse, most of the children were later returned to their families. Jeffs was eventually extradited from Utah to Texas. He was arraigned on the Texas charges in December in Tom Green County.","NEW: Ousted members are not allowed to return to their wives or children, sources say .

"London (CNN) -- The Routemaster bus first appeared on London's streets in the 1950s and quickly became one of the city's most recognizable icons. Now, six years after it was phased out, English artist and designer Thomas Heatherwick is taking inspiration from the famous Routemaster to re-define the look of London buses. With an international reputation for inventive and playful work, his approach blends sculpture with engineering. In 2010, the Heatherwick Studio created a dramatic Seed Cathedral -- a mass of acrylic rods with plant seeds on every tip -- for the UK Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo. Turning the most commonplace public transport into a work of art proved to be an equally challenging feat. But in collaboration with vehicle manufacturer the Wright Group, the double-decker bus with a difference is becoming a reality. Improving the passenger experience was a critical consideration in the design process. Take the lighting, for example: Current buses tend to be lit with fluorescent tubes which isn't the most flattering light, says Heatherwick. ""That's what's tends to be used to illuminate a piggery,"" he jokingly says. ""So introducing some of the lighting techniques that are now used within interior environments is a very simple thing, but we feel it will make a very big difference to the experience,"" he adds. The new bus also has three sets of doors and two staircases, which means you can get passengers on and off more quickly, Heatherwick says. ""That means you are more likely to get a bus that is on time because that means you are not waiting for huge queues to get on or off."" Heatherwick says the new bus is greener too, with a hybrid engine which will be 40% more energy efficient than a standard bus. It also doesn't shudder when it's stationary. ""It's going to be much quieter and calmer,"" he says. The prospect of a calmer commute to work is one to relish in a bustling city of around 12 million people. Passengers can look forward to getting on board the new buses early next year, in time for London's Olympic Games.","London's Routemaster bus is getting a 21st-century makeover .

"(EW.com) -- This weekend, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" hunted down the No. 1 spot at the box office with $19 million from 3,372 theaters. Although ""Hansel and Gretel"" can hardly be called a fairy-tale success at this point, it proved far more bewitching than fellow newcomers ""Parker"" and ""Movie 43,"" which were left with only bread crumbs in their sad debut frame. Paramount and MGM spent $50 million to produce ""Hansel and Gretel,"" which was shot in 2011 and originally scheduled to be released in March 2012. Distributor Paramount moved the film's release to this month to capitalize on star Jeremy Renner, whom the studio hoped would blossom into a true box-office draw following ""The Avengers"" and ""The Bourne Legacy."" (It also seems likely that ""Hansel and Gretel"" got placed in January due to its poor quality — January tends to be a dumping ground for studios' stinkers.) Whether or not Renner had anything to do with it, the date change proved at least somewhat effective — ""Hansel and Gretel"" outgrossed the last supernatural fantasy with Hunter in the title, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" which staked a weak $16.3 million in its debut frame. 3-D showings of ""Hansel and Gretel"" accounted for 55 percent of its weekend gross, while IMAX made up 11 percent of the total. Due to its R rating, the Grimm tale played primarily to older audiences — 57 percent of crowds were above the age of 25, and 55 percent were male. Audiences issued the film a lukewarm ""B"" CinemaScore grade, so it seems unlikely that Hansel and Gretel will achieve strong word of mouth. Fortunately for Paramount (the studio suffered a rough winter with Jack Reacher, The Guilt Trip, Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away, and Rise of the Guardians — which passed $100 million this weekend), the film has already earned $35.8 million from international territories representing about 40 percent of the overseas market. Last weekend's box office champ, Mama, dropped 55 percent into second place with $12.9 million. With $48.7 million after 10 days, Universal's $15 million horror entry has officially surpassed Gangster Squad as 2013′s highest grossing release. Of course, that will change faster than you could say ""Iron Man 3,"" but it's an impressive performance nonetheless. 'Downton Abbey': Big season 4 spoiler! Two Oscar contenders finished in third and fourth place with almost identical weekend grosses — not to mention almost identical totals. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" dropped by an incredibly small 7 percent in its 11th weekend to $10 million. Weinstein's $21 million drama continues to benefit from great word of mouth. And with $69.5 million so far and another month until the Oscars still to go, director David O. Russell's Playbook is on track to finish above $100 million. ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" meanwhile, fell by a steeper 38 percent to $9.8 million and $69.9 million total in its sixth weekend. The $40 million Sony drama will need to notch better holds if it wants to join fellow Best Picture nominees Argo, Lincoln, Django Unchained, Les Miserables, and Life of Pi in the $100 million club.

FilmDistrict's shoot-em-up, whose budget was in the $35 million range, didn't get any boost from costar Jennifer Lopez, who proved unable to attract viewers outside her go-to rom-com genre. Parker opened short of Statham's last three leading efforts, Safe ($7.9 million debut), Killer Elite, ($9.3 million), and The Mechanic ($11.4 million), and it will likely finish below $20 million domestically.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's latest attempt to charge a fiery Islamic cleric on terrorism charges was swiftly adjourned moments after it started in a south Jakarta court Thursday. Abu Bakar Ba'asyir could face the death penalty under fresh charges, which include planning and/or inciting a terrorist act and involvement in a paramilitary training camp discovered last February in Aceh province. However, proceedings were postponed to Monday after his lawyer argued that they were not given enough time to respond to the court summons. The 72-year-old waved and smiled to hundreds of his supporters, who chanted ""God is great."" Ba'asyir was first detained in August for suspected links to a militant training camp raided by authorities in Aceh in early 2010. Police said the suspect and his organization, the Jamaat Tawhid Anshoru or JAT, were involved in setting up the camp. The militants were preparing to launch attacks similar to the one in Mumbai 2008, and assassination attempts on Indonesian government officials, authorities have said. But the lawyers have called the case weak and a fabrication. This was going to be his third trial. In the first two, prosecutors tried to link the elderly cleric to the 2002 bombings in Bali and the 2003 hotel bomb attack in Jakarta. The courts found him guilty of minor charges, and sentenced him to 25 months. He was released in June 2006. ""This trial is very significant, because if the Indonesian government failed to provide a strong unshakable court evidence, they will use this as a weapon, an ammunition to gain more recruits,"" said Noor Huda, founder of Jakarta's Institute of International Peace Building, which aims to reform radical inmates. ""Ba'asyir is clearly a symbol, he gains certain level of celebrity among jihadist, he's very strong, he has a strong charisma to build networks."" Ba'asyir is known for his fiery rhetoric. He was accused of being the spiritual leader of Indonesia's homegrown terror network, Jemaah Islamiyah, which inspired many of those involved in the bombings . He has denied all the allegations and often blamed a U.S.-led conspiracy to put him behind bars.","Abu Bakar Ba'asyir faces the death penalty if found guilty .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Ten Cuban prisoners -- including a doctor nominated last month for the Nobel Peace Prize -- will be released from prison, the Roman Catholic Church said . Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet Gonzalez was among scores of people imprisoned during the Cuban government's 2003 crackdown on political dissidents. He founded and ran the Lawton Foundation for Human Rights and also led the ""Friends of Human Rights"" group in Cuba, according to the U.S.-based non-profit group Freedom Now, which ""works to free individual prisoners of conscience."" National legislators in Canada, Great Britain, the European Union and the United States -- as well as the prime minister of Hungary, and the Freedom Now and the Lawton Foundation organizations -- nominated Gonzalez for a Nobel Peace Prize in February for his dedication to ""non-violent social change."" The nine prisoners besides Gonzalez will travel to Spain after their release, according to statement from Havana's Catholic archdiocese. ""This is a victory for all the Cuban people -- those who are in exile or in Cuba, those who are inside jails or those who are supposedly free on the streets of Cuba,"" dissident Guillermo Farinas told CNN en Español Thursday. Farinas, a psychologist and writer, gained international attention last February when he stopped eating for 135 days to protest the Cuban government's imprisonment of political activists. His hunger strike came to an end in July after Cuba began to release dissidents as part of an agreement with the Roman Catholic Church and Spain to empty Cuba's jails of political prisoners. ""This is a victory for all the Cuban people, including those who govern, who have realized that they should respond in a humanitarian manner. Because simply and truly, what these men and women have done is oppose the government peacefully,"" Farinas said in response to Thursday's announcement. Last year, Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to release all 52 prisoners jailed during the 2003 crackdown. The Caribbean nation has released many of them, as well as other prisoners jailed for ""counterrevolutionary"" activities, ranging from hijacking to arson. Thursday's news means that at least 80 political prisoners will have been released in recent months, with most of them going on to live in Spain. CNN's Nelson Quinones contributed to this report.","NEW: Dissident: ""This is a victory for all the Cuban people""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In separate incidents within the span of a day, five Australian troops were killed in Afghanistan: three in an apparent ""green-on-blue"" attack and two in a helicopter crash, officials said Thursday. ""This is our single worst day in Afghanistan,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said. In the first incident, someone wearing an Afghan National Army uniform shot and killed three soldiers inside their base in southern Uruzgan province late Wednesday . Two others were wounded. The soldiers were in a group ""relaxing and talking"" at the end of the day when the incident occurred, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, the acting chief of the Australian Defence Force, told reporters . U.S. facing growing 'green-on-blue' challenge . Other soldiers returned fire, but the shooter escaped by scaling a fence, Binskin said. The deaths bring to 14 the number of NATO troops who have been killed in August alone in such ""green-on-blue"" attacks. The other two Australian soldiers were killed when the International Security Assistance Force helicopter they were riding in crashed while trying to land in Helmand province Thursday morning. ""It appears that the helicopter has landed and rolled over, and that's all I know at the moment,"" Binskin said, adding there was no indication that enemy action was to blame. Until now, Australia had suffered only one military fatality in Afghanistan in 2012. ""I think morale at the moment has taken a hit over this understandably,"" Binskin said. Earlier this year, Australia said it would pull out its more than 1,500 troops from Afghanistan ahead of schedule. There has been a recent surge in ""green-on-blue"" attacks, or insider attacks in the country. The term refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force, in this case ISAF; and green refers to an allied friendly forces, in this case Afghan National Security Forces. Concerned about the uptick, U.S. Gen. John Allen, ISAF's chief commander, ordered all allied forces at NATO headquarters in Kabul and all bases across Afghanistan earlier this month to carry loaded weapons around the clock. General: Quarter of Afghan insider attacks by Taliban . Earlier this month, President Barack Obama said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the growing number of deadly attacks on U.S. forces by Afghan security forces.

"(CNN) -- Spain has finally asked for a bank bailout from its eurozone peers, to weather the financial crisis that hampered its finances during recent months. Although Spain's Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, has stressed that there are no austerity conditions attached to it, the statement from the Eurogroup made clear that supervision over the country's budget will be strengthened. The budget deficit aims may mean the Spanish government will implement further structural reforms, such as a reducing the country's unemployment benefits, or raising the retirement age. As a result, we may see public disaffection shifting from the streets to the political arena. Unlike other countries -- such as Greece, for example -- in Spain public disaffection with the economic crisis has not yet had a significant impact on the country's traditional political forces. Instead, Spanish citizens have mainly channeled their anger and frustration over austerity measures through social mobilization, while the political landscape has remained virtually the same. Although there has been shift in power -- the Popular Party (PP) took over after general elections in November 2011 -- the political arena continues to be dominated by the two largest parties, PP and the Socialist Party, PSOE. The striking aspect of the emergence of the Spanish indignados movement was that it came about in a country which has, traditionally, had low levels of civic engagement and social participation. While the indignados have been discredited by the right-wing mass media as being a marginal force mainly followed by perroflautas (Spanish slang to describe wandering minstrels), the movement -- which had its anniversary on May 15 -- has shown no signs of fading away. Indeed, a majority of Spanish citizens sympathize with its aims and support its goals. Recent studies show the indignados are not just a movement of the young and marginalized. Many participants are middle-aged, highly-educated and employed, and a majority of them consider their current financial situation relatively good. At the same time, many share a concern about their future financial situation. For a short period the indignados managed to get a reform of the electoral system, that would improve the chances of small parties to be represented in parliament, on the policy agenda. But they have not yet achieved any significant policy goal. Now, some proposals to improve democracy and control corruption have been pushed aside as focus turns instead to the deteriorating economic situation. The movement's current demands focus on the unbalanced distribution of economic costs due to the austerity measures. This does not mean that the indignados have failed, as their most important success indicator is the activation of the protest ""muscle"" in Spanish society, particularly among the network of social organizations at the local level. But if the bank rescue results in further reductions of social welfare funds, or if it is a prelude to the bailout of the state, the government risks unleashing social protest in a way existing social movements may not be able to channel. Public discontent may then shift from the streets to the political stage. This could ruin the leverage of the traditional political forces and, in turn, the capacity of the political system to manage the economic crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sandra León.","Sandra León: Spain's political landscape has been relatively calm despite the austerity measures .
But the Spanish indignados movement have gathered support in a country with low civic engagement .

"SHAOSHAN, China (CNN) -- ""Mao is very great and famous, and he saved the whole of China,"" exclaims an 18-year-old woman from Wuhan in Hubei province. ""Both young people and old people love Mao very much!"" Mao was born in his family house in 1893. The rooms are preserved with original furnishings. The woman is accompanying her 75-year-old grandfather to Mao Zedong's birth town of Shaoshan in Hunan province, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the capital Changsha -- and the juxtaposition is as intriguing as it is telling: A woman born after the Tiananmen Square crackdown and a grandfather born during the Long March, joined in a pilgrimage to celebrate the founder of the 60-year-old Chinese republic. ""Great Leader,"" ""Great Teacher,"" ""Great Helmsman"" -- the monikers for Mao may be numerous, but he alone still serves as the Chinese Communist Party's premier brand, and anyone who visits Shaoshan can still see the power of his personality cult. The village consists of numerous Mao landmarks, and it's his house where the huge numbers of tour buses usually converge first. Born here in 1893, Mao first lived in a large thatched-roof abode surrounded by pretty gardens and a small lake. Visitors tightly snake through the impeccably preserved rooms, marveling at the kitchen utensils and original beds that Mao and his family slept in.  Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown » . There are detailed plaques throughout, outlining the family's early years and brief descriptions of his two brothers -- both of whom were killed in warfare. Nearby is the Museum of Comrade Mao, which displays exhibits and old Communist Party photos. While visitors get a sense of the republic's history, there are glaring omissions. While Mao the heroic revolutionary is celebrated at every step, there's nothing on either the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution -- campaigns that cost the lives of tens of millions and caused massive social and political upheaval. (See Fact Boxes, left). ""Yes, Mao made some mistakes,"" one tourist says as he studies a photo of famous revolutionary Liu Shaoqi, himself a victim of the Cultural Revolution. ""But it was for the common good. Without mistakes, how does one learn?""  Watch visitors express their thoughts about Mao » . About 500 meters up from Mao's house, a large bronze statue of the former leader towers over a massive square, where admirers energetically bow and pay their respects. After their backs can take no more, it's back on to the bus for the last major tour stop, Dripping Water Cave.  Watch the statue and other stops along a tour of the town » . Mao lived in this comfortable retreat briefly in 1966, swam in its nearby reservoir and ""revised the political state of the world,"" according to one sign posted outside his bedroom. Visitors can view where the aging revolutionary slept, the sofas he sat on during important meetings, as well as his bathrooms. The path that winds back down to the main road is filled with touts, their stalls full of miniature Mao busts, caps, key rings, copies of his obligatory Little Red Book and other paraphernalia. You can even have your photo taken and enhanced digitally with Mao smoking a cigarette, or shaking his hand. A buzz surrounds the stalls; business is good. Though visits to Shaoshan dropped off in the 1980s following a more subdued government review of Mao's legacy, tourism is again vibrant. ""Mao is the father of modern China, but he did make some mistakes,"" explains a tour guide. ""As the government said after his death, Mao was '70 percent right, 30 percent wrong.' So fewer visitors came during that period ... but numbers are now back to about 3 million a year."" One of those three million enthusiastically examines the knickknacks that fill the stalls. ""My cousins back home will love this,"" beams the 18-year-old woman from Wuhan, as she holds up a T-shirt of Mao staring dotingly over the Chinese masses. ""Everyone loves Mao!""","Mao Zedong's birth town of Shaoshan is about 100 km from Changsha .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is proposing to spend $53 billion over the next six years to help promote the construction of a national high-speed, intercity passenger rail network, Vice President Joe Biden announced Tuesday. The proposal represents a significant expansion of the $10.5 billion already spent on high-speed rail expansion since Obama entered office, including $8 billion in the 2009 economic stimulus package. U.S. bullet trains: Coming soon? White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters potential funding sources for the plan will be outlined in the president's proposed budget, which is scheduled to be released next week. President Barack Obama said in last month's State of the Union address that he was setting a goal of giving 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail within 25 years. Obama: U.S. infrastructure has ""slipped"" The proposed new investment -- including $8 billion in the upcoming fiscal year -- would accompany a streamlined application process for cities, states, and private companies seeking federal grants and loans to develop railway capacity. ""There are key places where we cannot afford to sacrifice as a nation -- one of which is infrastructure,"" Biden said in a written statement. There is a pressing need ""to invest in a modern rail system that will help connect communities, reduce congestion and create quality, skilled manufacturing jobs that cannot be outsourced."" Biden, who commuted regularly by train between Washington and his home state of Delaware during a 36-year Senate tenure, has been a prominent advocate for railway travel and, more specifically, Amtrak. A new high-speed rail investment, however, may face a cool reception in the new, more Republican Congress. GOP leaders have called for more spending cuts in the wake of spiraling federal deficits.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Nicollette Sheridan slapped her lawyer in court Thursday to demonstrate how she claims show creator Marc Cherry hit her during a rehearsal. Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons. Her wrongful termination lawsuit contends Cherry killed off Edie Britt, the sassy, blond woman Sheridan played, in retaliation for her complaints about being hit. Several of Sheridan's former cast mates -- including Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, Felicity Huffman and Neal McDonough -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend Cherry during the two week Los Angeles trial. Cherry's lawyers argue show writers began planning Britt's demise in May 2008, four months before the alleged battery, as a way to shock viewers and raise ratings. The hit was just ""a light tap on the head"" intended to demonstrate ""a piece of physical humor"" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday. Sheridan's dissatisfaction with her lack of lines in a scene preceded the alleged hitting incident, she testified. She wanted to recite line from a Beatles song -- ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"" -- but Cherry said the music royalties would be too expensive. Without it, her exit from the scene ""wasn't funny anymore,"" Sheridan testified. Sheridan testified that while she explained her concerns to Cherry, the producer asked ""What is it that you want?"" Then he hit her his open right hand, she said. ""It was a nice wallop to my head."" ""It was shocking, humiliating, it was demeaning,"" she said. Sheridan demonstrated the hit in slow motion on her lawyer, Patrick Maloney, but then he asked her to ""hit me as hard as you were hit."" ""I don't want to hurt you,"" Sheridan told her lawyer. The actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force, sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning Maloney's head. ""I'm fine,"" he assured her as she apologized. Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her ""I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness,"" Sheridan testified. But she did not accept it. The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry. ""I thought he could at least apologize again and send me flowers,"" she said. But Cherry's reply, delivered by Perkins, was no second apology or flowers. ""He felt the incident had been resolved,"" Sheridan said he told her. Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five years run on ""Desperate Housewives."" Jurors must decide if the death of Sheridan's character and the end of her employment was illegal workplace retaliation or just a creative decision unconnected to the alleged battery incident. Cherry's defense is expected to present notes made by show writers in May 2008 that document the various scenarios they were considering then for killing off Britt. Sheridan lawyers Mark Baute, in his opening statement Wednesday, challenge the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an ""effort to backdate the decision"" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident. Britt is ""a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious,"" Sheridan said. ""She has a heart, but people loved to hate her."" She made it clear to jurors she was not like the character she played. ""I think honesty is about the only thing we shared."" Jurors appeared to enjoy several clips of the show, featuring her character seducing a series of men. They laughed several times during the playing of the clips. They were also shown Britt's death scene, in which she crashed a car into a tree and was electrocuted by a fallen power line. Cherry lawyer defense lawyer Adam Levin told jurors that TV writers must ""shock and surprise"" viewers with pregnancies, affairs, marriages, divorces and deaths to ""keep them on the edge of their seats."" ""The unanticipated death of a prominent character can shock the viewing audience and energize the show,"" which Levin said can ""lead to water cooler talk and media buzz,"" increasing ratings. The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said. Sheridan testified that the hangman's noose scene was Cherry's idea, prompted by ABC's request that the season end with something ""more spectacular."" Cherry assured her that her character would ""be saved"" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said. She said Cherry even told the whole cast when they gathered to start the next season's production that ""We know one character we won't be killing off is Edie Britt,"" because people were ""up in arms"" over the possibility. The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the ""blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives,"" he said. After five seasons, ""writers could only do so much with the character,"" Levin said. ""There were only so many husbands she could sleep with."" ABC Entertainment is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate Sheridan's accusation that Cherry hit her and then agreed with his decision to fire her. Although a line producer reported the incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Inquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, Baute said. What followed was a ""fake"" investigation designed ""to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,'"" he said. ""Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down."" The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said. Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.","NEW: Nicollette Sheridan returns to the witness stand Friday in her case against producer Marc Cherry .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Although Daniel Day-Lewis appears on track to win the best actor Oscar next month, he suggests his win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards Sunday may actually hurt his chances. ""There's a good chance I won't,"" Day-Lewis said backstage at the SAG Awards. His riveting portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" has been honored with the Golden Globe and SAG best actor awards. While those awards are often predictive of the Oscar best actor winner, Day-Lewis is downplaying his chances. ""I think members of the Academy love surprises, so the worst thing that can happen to you is some kind of expectations,"" he said. ""I think they'd probably be delighted if it was anybody else."" Day-Lewis would be the first male actor to win three best actor Oscars. He won previously for ""My Left Foot"" in 1989 and ""There Will Be Blood"" in 2007. 'Argo' glows . Other Oscar races grew murkier with Sunday's SAG awards, including for best picture. While ""Lincoln"" might have been a favorite at the start of Hollywood's awards season, its prospects of taking the top Academy honor were dimmed with Ben Affleck's ""Argo"" winning the SAG best film award, just two weeks after taking the Golden Globe. ""There was absolutely no way that I thought we'd win this award,"" Affleck said backstage Sunday. Affleck directed and starred in ""Argo,"" a movie centered on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. While his film now appears to be a frontrunner for the best picture Oscar, Affleck was not nominated for best director. The best film and best director Oscars usually go hand in hand. ""I didn't get nominated as a director and I thought 'Well, okay, that's that,' you know, and then I remembered I was nominated as a producer which is pretty exciting,"" Affleck said. ""So I've kind of gone at it with that approach. I don't know what's going to happen. Who knows? Nothing may happen, but it's a wonderful opportunity to be on the ride and I'm really excited."" Lawrence's post-Oscar playbook . Jennifer Lawrence was ill when she won a best actress in a comedy film at the Golden Globes two weeks ago, but she told reporters backstage Sunday that she's feeling a lot better thanks to a ""lot of medication"" and a better inhaler. Lawrence glowed after she was handed the best actress SAG award for her role in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" At just 22, Lawrence is the youngest person ever to have been nominated twice for a best actress Oscar, the first being in 2010 for ""Winter's Bone."" Asked backstage what she might say to a 14-year-old Jennifer Lawrence if she could talk to her, she said she would never reveal her future success. ""I would've said, 'You're going fail, so don't be so full of yourself.'"" Lawrence has plans to relax after the Hollywood awards season ends with the Academy Awards next month. ""I'm going to go to an island somewhere and not telling anyone where I'm going. That's my plan."" Cranston's all-in approach . Bryan Cranston carried home two SAG Actor awards Sunday, one for film and another for television work. His role as a CIA agent in ""Argo"" gave him part of that film's ensemble SAG award. He was also handed the best actor in a TV drama for ""Breaking Bad,"" in which he plays a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a meth manufacturer. Backstage, Cranston said he tries to discourage young actors, telling them a career takes ""total dedication"" to succeed. ""I say that if you can be happy doing something else, anything else, go do that, go do that,"" Cranston said. ""Because in order to be an actor you need to totally commit.

"(CNN) -- Malala Yousafzai was glad to hear that her long ordeal of surgeries will soon be over. Just two more to go, doctors in Britain say. Hopefully. She will receive a titanium plate in the coming days, to cover an opening in her skull, and an inner ear implant. Read more: Malala's journey from near death to recovery . A gunman shot the teenage activist in the head and neck in October as she rode home from school in Pakistan's Swat Valley. Islamist extremists from Tehrik-e-Taliban intended to kill her for taking a stand for the right of girls to get an education. The terrorists have said they will target her again. Read more: Malala, others on front lines in fight for women . The 15-year-old's brain swelled dangerously days after the shooting, so doctors in Pakistan extracted a section of her skull about the size of a hand. Otherwise, the pressure in her cranium would have caused severe brain damage, likely killing her. ""There is no doubt that the surgery performed in Pakistan was life-saving,"" Dr. Dave Rosser, medical director of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK, said Wednesday at a news conference. Malala has made impressive strides and faced her medical treatment with bravery, Rosser said. ""She's very lively. She's got a great sense of humor,"" he said. She is aware of her high profile in the world and what that could mean for her safety. ""She remains incredibly cheerful, incredibly determined and incredibly determined to speak for her cause,"" Rosser said. Photos: Malala and the women of Pakistan . With the patch of skull missing, Malala is limited in what she can do. Her brain is vulnerable to injury, if she bumps her head in the wrong way. Only her skin and soft cranial tissues stand between the outside world and her brain, and that's not enough. Doctors could have covered the breach with the original piece of her skull, which she has carried under her skin since October, where a surgeon in Pakistan implanted it for safe keeping. That's a common procedure to preserve bone fragments for later use, Rosser said. Girls + education: Your story . But her own skull section would have no longer fit properly without the addition of some titanium parts, as her head and the bone fragment have changed. Titanium also has a low incidence of infection and can be handcrafted to near perfection, doctors told her. ""It was Malala's final decision,"" Rosser said. She picked the titanium plate. She will also receive a cochlear implant to restore hearing to her left ear, in which she is currently deaf. The gunfire broke the delicate bones that help turn sound into sensory impulses to the brain. The device will not allow her to hear completely naturally but will restore enough function to the damaged ear to allow her to hear in three dimensions, which is important for safety. It will allow her, for example, to hear an approaching car, Rosser said. Watch 'Girl Rising': 9 girls' quest for education . Malala also recently had surgery to reroute a facial nerve that was damaged in the attempt on her life, leaving part the left side of her mouth listless. ""There is a very good chance after this procedure that within a year to 18 months, this will completely recover,"" Rosser said. She will then hopefully regain her old smile. To make the titanium plate, prosthesis maker Stefan Edmondson had the section of Malala's skull with the gap in it reproduced by an object printer. Then he patched the hole with wax and carved it to fit the shape of her head, Edmondson said, and he used the wax section to give the titanium its form. As for the skull fragment she has carried inside her since that emergency surgery in Pakistan: . ""The bone will be removed from under the skin in her stomach and cleaned up and sterilized and given to Malala,"" Rosser said. She wants to keep it as a remembrance.","Malala chose the titanium over her own bone fragment .
Doctors in Pakistan had removed the fragment to save her life, when her brain swelled .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government moved to block the proposed merger of beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev with Mexico's Grupo Modelo on Thursday, with a Justice Department official calling it ""a bad deal for American consumers."" ABI already owns about half of Modelo, which brews the popular Corona brand. The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit accuses ABI of trying to eliminate ""a significant competitive threat"" from Modelo's Corona brands by purchasing the rest of the Mexican company for a proposed $20.1 billion. That deal would boost ABI's share of the U.S. beer market grow from about 39% to 46%, the lawsuit states. Add that to the 29% already controlled by No. 2 brewer MillerCoors, and two companies would split about three-quarters of the $80 billion field, said Bill Baer, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""Beer prices have gone up in recent years because of this high concentration,"" Baer said Thursday morning. ""ABI and MillerCoors have been able to drive prices up year after year."" Competition from Modelo forces the top two players ""to forego the full extent of the price increases that they would otherwise be able to get out of the market,"" he said. Opinion: Don't let big brewers win beer wars . The effect has been particularly strong in states with large Latino populations, like California and Texas, the lawsuit states. And the complaint cites company documents that Justice says show ABI complaining about Modelo hindering their ability to raise prices. So letting the deal go ahead would be ""a bad deal for American consumers,"" Baer said. ABI was created by the 2008 merger of the historic St. Louis-based brewer with Belgium's InBev, producer of European brands like Stella Artois, Bass and Beck's. A company statement called the antitrust suit ""inconsistent with the law, the facts and the reality of the marketplace."" ""We remain confident in our position, and we intend to vigorously contest the DOJ's action in federal court,"" the company said. But the lawsuit will mean the deal won't be completed by the end of March, it said. To avoid antitrust concerns, ABI had proposed selling off Modelo's half-interest in its U.S. importer. But Justice argued that would produce only ""a facade of competition"" while eliminating a ""a particularly aggressive competitor"" from the market. Baer said the Justice Department and ABI had ""frank and candid"" discussions with the company over the merger, ""but at the end of the day, we were just too far apart.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Twelve new stars have been recently added to the CIA's Memorial Wall, which pays tribute to the 102 men and woman who lost their lives in the line of duty for the spy agency. At a ceremony Monday before the wall in the atrium of CIA headquarters, Director Leon Panetta paid tribute to the fallen officers. ""No matter when or where they served, or whether their names are known to the world or only to us, each cherished colleague remains a constant source of inspiration and courage,"" Panetta said. Seven of the new stars represent the men and women who were killed last December at a CIA post in Khost, Afghanistan, when a believed-to-be informant they were scheduled to meet detonated a suicide vest. None of the clandestine officers are identified by name. The other five stars honor officers who died in recent years while on secret missions. Their names and the details of their work remain classified. ""They are our heroes,"" said Panetta. ""They are America's heroes and that's how we will remember them."" Hundreds of current and former employees, family members and friends attended the memorial service.","Stars honor men and women of CIA killed in line of duty .

"Paris (CNN) -- The human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe urged countries that have hosted secret CIA prisons to come clean Monday, as the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches. Thomas Hammarberg said Poland, Romania and Lithuania were among at least seven countries that hosted ""black sites"" for ""enhanced interrogation"" during the ""war on terror."" ""Darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on European territories,"" he said. ""The full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of co-operation will never be repeated."" CIA officials have acknowledged the rendition program, but refused to discuss details and denied violating any laws. Efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in U.S. courts have been turned aside. Hammarberg's statement comes as documents seized from Moammar Gadhafi's compound in Libya shed light on the program of extraordinary rendition, or questioning of terror suspects in third-party countries where U.S. law does not apply. CNN saw a March 6, 2004, CIA letter to Libyan officials about Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a former jihadist with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and now a senior commander in the anti-Gadhafi forces. It concerned the Malaysian government's arrest of Abdullah al-Sadiq, Belhaj's nom de guerre for his rendition. A CIA officer said the man and his pregnant wife were being placed on a commercial flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to London via Bangkok and then onto Libya. ""We are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in Bangkok and place them on our aircraft for a flight to your country,"" the officer wrote. Belhaj fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, but left after their fall in 2001 and was arrested in Malaysia in 2004. After some questioning by the CIA, he was sent back to Libya and jailed. The Council of Europe's Hammarberg said the CIA had held ""high-value detainees,"" including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Poland, between 2002 and 2003. The Polish site closed and a new secret prison opened in Romania in 2003, Hammarberg charged, and existed for over two years. Lithuania also hosted two sites, he said. Polish prosecutors and Lithuanian lawmakers have investigated the phenomenon, but Romania has shown ""little genuine will to uncover the whole truth,"" Hammarberg charged. ""Effective investigations are imperative and long overdue,"" he said. Neither the CIA, Romania nor Lithuania immediately responded. Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would not comment while prosecutors in the country are still investigating. The Council of Europe is a 47-member group that promotes democracy and human rights on the continent.

"(Lonely Planet) -- Romance runs rich through Italy's veins, with icons of amore to melt the hardest heart. But the most famous sight isn't always the most swoon-worthy; find the real romance of Italy with a hot date at one of these alternative picks. Verona . Romance icon: Juliet's balcony. The dainty stone balcony at the 14th-century Casa di Giulietta is a magnet for lovers (and Shakespeare fans). Visiting romantics scrawl heart-rending graffiti in the charming courtyard and smooch on the balcony with their own Romeos. It's all rather lovely, which means tourists generally remain untroubled by the lack of any connection between the fictional lovers and the Veronese noblemen who actually lived here. The alternative: the Roman arena by night. If literature's star-crossed lovers don't inspire, spend a balmy evening at Verona's 1st-century Roman amphitheater. Find a space for two on the steep stone steps, and the evening is yours to sip wine, be dazzled by on-stage theatrics, and gaze at a starry sky. Take snacks, a blanket and most essentially, a pillow (those stone steps have seriously bum-numbing qualities). Thrifty lovers can snap up tickets for summer operas and ballets from as little as 10 euros (www.arena.it). Lonely Planet: Italy for honeymooners . Venice . Romance icon: a gondola ride. Climbing aboard Venice's iconic boats to drift around the city's canals, to the tune of a singing gondolier, is the holy grail of Italy's romantic experiences. That is, until you see the price tag. There's no doubting the beauty of Venice from the water, but the pleasure doesn't come cheap (and yes, they do charge extra for the singing). The alternative: a bicycle made for two. Flee the flocks of visitors in central Venice with a summer ferry excursion to The Lido. With a day's bicycle hire, you and your date can pedal around the shady streets and catch some R&R away from Venice's manic center. Check out www.lidoonbike.it, who can set you up with the most kitsch date there is, a two-seater tandem bike. Rome . Romance icon: Trevi Fountain. Throw in one coin, and you'll return to Rome someday. Throw in two, you'll marry an Italian. Throw in more than that and well, desperate is not a good look. Lovers line up to take each other's photo next to this jaw-dropping edifice, but crowds and coin-hurling visitors don't make for a dream date. The alternative: the dome of St Peter's Basilica. Who would have thought the holiest of holies is the perfect place for a secret kiss? Start early for a climb to the top of Vatican City's gigantic dome (but spare yourself the blisters and take the lift part-way). If you're there for the opening time of 8 a.m., you'll likely have a hazy view of Vatican City all to yourselves, and ample space for a quick smooch. Lonely Planet: Explosive Italy: a volcano-lover's guide . Florence . Romance icon: Galleria degli Uffizi. With the muscular form of Michelangelo's David setting hearts a-flutter outside the Galleria dell'Accademia, and comely Renaissance maidens in every gallery, it's the artistic heart of Florence that plucks at the heart strings. And nowhere elicits lovelorn sighs more than the Uffizi, with emblems of love like Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"" gracing its walls. But museum fatigue from the brain-boggling volume of art, not to mention bumping elbows with hordes of other visitors, can sap that lovin' feeling. The alternative: Giardino di Boboli. These gardens, a short walk from the Uffizi, are a perfect lovers' escape (learn more on the official website). The further you wander into the gardens, the more secluded spaces you'll find. Seek out a manicured corner of Florence's most beautiful green space, breathe in the scent of citrus trees and sigh among statues of bathing nymphs.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney hates apologies. That's why he leaped to the conclusion that, in the wake of the killing of Libya Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other State Department employees, the Obama administration had issued an apology for America's actions. ""It's a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values,"" Romney declared. ""It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks."" What Romney called a disgraceful response by the Obama administration to the Libyan killings was in fact a statement issued before the killings by America's Cairo Embassy condemning an anti-Islam film that portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester. The title of Romney's 2010 campaign autobiography, ""No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,"" makes it clear that his hatred of apologies runs deep. Unfortunately, such hatred ignores history. What Romney, who after disparaging 47% of Americans for being dependents has insisted there was nothing wrong in what he said, fails to understand is that presidential apologies are nothing new. What's more is that they apologize without drawing critical backlash from their fellow conservatives. Bill Clinton's 1998 apology for the failure of America and the international community to respond quickly to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda may be the most memorable public apology by any contemporary president. But two of the most conservative Republicans in recent history, it is worth pointing out, have issued telling public apologies of their own. The most moving of these conservative apologies was the one that Ronald Reagan made in 1988 on signing the legislation that provided $1.25 billion in reparations, along with a formal apology from the government, for the forcible relocation of 120,000 West Coast Japanese-Americans after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In signing the bill, Reagan, who as an actor was living in California at the time of the relocation, made clear that the money offered to the victimized families was less important than the public apology. ""No payment can make up for those lost years,"" Reagan said. ""So what is important in this bill has less to do with property than with honor, for here, we admit a wrong."" Today those words have taken on enduring form. In Washington they are engraved on the National Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II, which is within blocks of the Capitol. In addition to Reagan's words, the memorial features a towering sculpture of two bronze cranes, each with one wing pointing to the sky and the other pinned down by barbed wire. Two decades later, George W. Bush, the Republican closest in ideology to Ronald Reagan, made a similar statement of regret. In a 2008 video conference with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of Iraq, Bush apologized for the actions of an American sniper in Iraq who used a Quran for target practice. ""He apologized for that in the sense that he said that we take it very seriously,"" White House press secretary Dana Perino told reporters after the video conference. ""We wanted them to know that the president knew that this was wrong."" The impacts that Reagan, Clinton and Bush hoped their individual apologies would have turned out to be as different as their politics. That is to be expected. For their apologies were never just based on calculation. At their core was the shared belief that a presidential apology is not a sign of weakness so much as a chance for a new beginning, a way to shed the indefensible and start fresh. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills: Romney's hatred of apologies shows in his book's title: ""No Apology""
Mills: Romney slammed Obama ""apology"" that was never made; but he forgets history .
Mills: Clinton apologized for Rwanda, Reagan apologized for WWII Japanese internments .

"(CNN) -- The approach of Valentine's Day may have you entertaining thoughts of love, perhaps even marriage. You'll remember the place you exchange vows forever, for sure, but where on Earth should you go to make it extra special? For answers, look to the stars -- the rich and famous kind, that is. Here is a sample of some of the hotels, resorts and castles that celebrities found romantic enough to say ""I do."" Parrot Cay Resort, Turks and Caicos . Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner chose secluded luxury when they tied the knot at this resort on a private island in 2005. Known for its soft white sand beach and first-class spa, Parrot Cay has a no-fly zone so that famous guests -- such as Bruce Willis and Donna Karan -- don't have to worry about photographers snapping pictures of them from the air. If relaxing in a private tropical paradise isn't enough, you can go diving, deep-sea fishing, windsurfing or catamaran sailing. The resort also offers yoga retreats and private cruises. Rooms start at $450 a night for stays through April. If you're willing to spend much more, you can stay in a beach house or a spacious villa with direct beach access. For more information, click here. Castello Odescalchi, Italy . Just a short drive from Rome, this 15th century castle in Bracciano, Italy, has hosted princes, popes and kings, but it became Hollywood celebrity central when Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wed here in 2006. Dozens of famous guests -- including Brooke Shields and Jennifer Lopez -- flocked inside the castle's massive stone walls to watch the couple exchange vows during a sunset ceremony. But you don't have to be a star to get married at the Castello Odescalchi. The property is open to the public and includes a museum as well as space for ""unique and unforgettable"" events and receptions. For more information, click here. To inquire about holding your wedding there, e-mail matrimoni@odescalchi.it. The Cloisters, Lutherville, Maryland . Built in the 1930s by Sumner and Dudrea Parker -- a wealthy Baltimore couple who loved to travel -- The Cloisters looks like a medieval European castle magically transported to rural Maryland. It's here that Will Smith and Baltimore native Jada Pinkett Smith married on New Year's Eve in 1997. The castle, which takes its name from the cloistered garden, incorporates antique building materials from Europe, such as gables from France and a stained-glass door from Italy. Inside, guests can marvel at the four-story spiral stair tower and an extensive collection of tapestries, paintings and antiques. Mrs. Parker bequeathed The Cloisters and its contents to the city of Baltimore in 1972. It's now an event venue, hosting 250 weddings, parties and business meetings a year. You can rent the mansion for $2,000 to $5,500, depending on the day of the week and the time of year. For more information, click here. The Plaza, New York . When one of the world's most famous couples decided to say ""I do,"" they chose one of the world's most famous hotels. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas exchanged vows in a $1.5 million ceremony at The Plaza in the fall of 2000, complete with 20,000 roses and a 6-foot, 10-tier, vanilla-and-butter-cream cake. Located on Fifth Avenue, the elegant Big Apple landmark has long been a sought-after site for weddings, so much so that it was a driving plot line in the movie ""Bride Wars."" Couples can choose the Grand Ballroom or the Terrace Room for the ceremony and one of the hotel's 102 suites for the wedding night. Rooms start at about $645 and suites at about $895 for a February stay. For more information, click here. Villa D'Este, Italy . John Krasinski's character in ""The Office"" got married in Niagara Falls, but the TV star chose a more faraway location for his nuptials to actress Emily Blunt in the summer of 2010. Located on the shores of Italy's famed Lake Como, Villa D'Este was built in the 16th century as the summer residence for a cardinal and was converted into a luxury hotel in 1873. The property is known for its lush gardens -- 25 acres where you can gaze upon everything from a 500-year-old tree to azaleas, camellias and roses. Depending on your budget, you can stay in a room, suite or private villa surrounded by decor that includes period furniture, oil paintings and silk-covered sofas. Rates start at about $545 per night for a March stay and rise quickly for rooms with a lake view. For more information, click here. Umaid Bhawan Palace, India . Called one of the largest private residences in the world, the Jodhpur royal family still lives in part of this massive palace, commissioned by the Maharaja of Jodhpur in 1923. Today, the royals mingle with guests, including model Elizabeth Hurley and businessman Arun Nayar who married here in 2007 -- one of several wedding celebrations the couple held in England and India. (Their British nuptials took place in Sudeley Castle near Winchcombe.) Guests at Umaid Bhawan Palace will find opulent accommodations and exotic touches, such as a traditional welcome with a fleet of elephants and camels dressed in royal attire and the company of peacocks in the palace's colorful gardens. The resort also employs a palmist and astrologer for guest use, noting that ancient rulers in the region were fascinated by star alignments and fortunetelling. One-bedroom suites start at about $900 per night. For more information, click here.","Celebrities found these hotels, resorts and castles romantic enough to say ""I do""

"(InStyle.com) -- She may have charmed audiences in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""Junebug,"" but Amy Adams's sweet demeanor belies a criminal history. ""I used to steal my older sister's pink-and-green Maybelline mascara,"" says Adams, 33. ""I see myself as optimistic, and I think that can be confused with being innocent and naïve."" Although the Colorado native, who appears this month in the movie ""Enchanted"" and in the upcoming ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" has ""outgrown petty theft,"" she says, she hasn't outgrown her love of mascara -- or any other beauty products. Spend time with the actress and she'll offer you a dab of her favorite lip balm (Benetint) and a sample of her tooth-whitening system (Go Smile). When it comes to makeup, she's more a giver than a taker these days. ""If I outgrow something, I like to share it. It's good to be my friend when I clean out my makeup bag!"" How skilled are you at doing your own makeup? It's a learning process. I can do a decent job, but I like to leave it to the professionals when it counts. When I first moved to L.A. I got a callback, and a producer said he'd like to see me with more makeup. But he told my agent that she might have to put it on ""because I didn't seem like the kind of girl who would know how."" And he was right! I had to go into the bathroom at my agency and have my agent do my makeup. Have you come a long way since then? I still keep it pretty simple, although I like getting dolled up to hang out with friends. Sometimes, if you need a pick-me-up, there's nothing better than a new lip gloss. At any given moment, I can have upwards of 10 glosses in my purse. And I am addicted to perfumes. I love Jo Malone's scents -- the Nectarine Blossom & Honey, the French Lime Blossom, and the Orange Blossom. I don't have a signature scent; I switch depending on my mood. Is there another product you are more faithful to? If I'm outdoors, I'm constantly reapplying sunscreen. My sister used to call me Fish-Belly Blue because I was so pale.

I had a grown man at a water park once yell at me to get a tan. A water-park heckler? Me in a swimsuit -- that's a lot of pale skin! How do you take care of it? I get regular facials.

I would love to cut my hair and try platinum -- Christina Aguilera blond. Harlow blond. Have you gone blond before? I've had red hair for the past four years. Before that, I never thought of being anything but blond. There was a definite shift in my life when I decided to go red. I tend to laugh a lot, and I can be really silly. I think when you have blond hair, people associate those behaviors with being flighty. With red hair, you're suddenly quirky. What is your quirkiest beauty tool? I love the classic Conair hot rollers. I put my makeup on, take them out, spray, then just shake my head and I'm ready. I think hot rollers are making a comeback! Anything on your wish list? I always wanted to be taller. [Adams is 5 feet, 5 inches.] I was a dancer, so I always admired that willowy effect. I still look at it with a sense of longing, but I fully accept I can't change it.

"Cairo (CNN) -- An Islamist party that once supported Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy met Wednesday with a prominent opposition group to talk about a solution to the political strife that has wracked the country in recent days. The ultraconservative al-Nour party had backed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood, rallying support for the country's new constitution and its emphasis on Sharia law. Secularists have opposed them. But on Wednesday, members of al-Nour met with the opposition National Salvation Front, a group composed primarily of non-Islamist parties opposed to Morsy. The two sides are discussing a proposal by al-Nour to end the crisis. Egypt has been embroiled in violence since last Friday after a series of seemingly unrelated events last week. On Wednesday, protesters faced off against police in downtown Cairo, with police clad in riot gear chasing demonstrators into alleys. The latest anti-government furor stems from a limited state of emergency declared by Morsy that imposes a 30-day curfew on areas of violence, including the provinces of Port Said, Suez and Ismalia along the Suez Canal. But on Tuesday, Morsy appeared to back off from his orders, allowing local governments to decide whether to impose the curfew. Critics have accused Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, of hoarding power. In a speech this week, he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in Egypt, saying ""dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security."" He invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting to try to solve the conflict. But Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the Constitution Party and a member of the National Salvation Front, reiterated two demands before the front would engage in dialogue: the formation of a new government and a committee to amend the constitution. Morsy on Wednesday was in Berlin, where he referred to the strife in his country during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Egyptian president said he was working to establish constitutional institutions but vowed not to go beyond what he is empowered to do. ""I don't want to use any extraordinary measures in the transitional period, and I would not allow myself or anyone else to go against the law,"" he said. His state of emergency declaration and curfew are ""only for one month,"" and the governors in affected areas retain the power to govern as they see fit, Morsy said. ""Egypt will achieve a state of law and order that we all aspire to,"" he said. ""A civil state that is not run by the military, but its civilians with institutions, with democracy and also the transfer of democracy. A modern country in every sense."" On Tuesday, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the unrest was not surprising. ""It's very difficult going from enclosed regime -- essentially one-man rule -- to a democracy that is trying to be born and learn to walk,"" she told CNN. The government must represent all of the people; the rule of law must apply to everyone; and the constitution must not marginalize any one group, she said. ""I think the messages and the actions coming from the leadership have to be changed in order to give people confidence that they are on the right path to the kind of future they seek."" CNN's Ben Wedeman in Cairo and Tom Watkins in Atlanta contributed to this report .","Mohamed Morsy, in Berlin, rejects ""extraordinary measures in the transitional period""

"(CNN) -- If you want to get to know the real Chris Rock, you might want to strike up a conversation about hair. Follicle fascination: Chris Rock asks high students about their hair. The comedian spent nearly two years exploring the world of black hair for his documentary ""Good Hair,"" which made its debut at Sundance this year. The film, which Rock co-wrote and produced, takes a provocative look at the relationship African-Americans have with their hair. Rock, best known for his stand-up comedy and sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris,"" says he'd been mulling a movie about hair for a long time, but having daughters motivated him to finally get the project started. He tells CNN: ""All these guys I know, we have daughters -- and our daughters have these hair issues that blew our minds."" They couldn't figure out why their daughters wanted straight hair, and when Lola, one of his young daughters, asked him why she didn't have good hair, it just ""ignited something in me,"" Rock recalls. Narrated by Rock, the film explores black hair from a multitude of angles, from the booming $9 billion industry it generates to the science behind chemical relaxers that straighten hair. The comedian is known for his no-limits, confrontational style, but he took a more laid-back approach with ""Good Hair."" ""A lot of people were just scared I was going to make fun of them,"" he says. But it's a documentary so ""you've got to let people talk. You let them do their thing."" Rock managed to sit down with a variety of black celebrities, including actress Nia Long, poet Maya Angelou and the Rev. Al Sharpton, and question them about their hair. The movie uses Rock's humor to draw attention to aspects of the black hair world that many members of the black community probably don't even know about, says executive producer Nelson George. But one of the most charming aspects of the movie is its personal nature, says George, who like many members of the production team worked on the critically-acclaimed HBO series ""The Chris Rock Show."" ""You really get an insight into who he is and his relationship with his daughters which I think is really central to the whole film,"" he tells CNN. His daughter's inquiry started a journey that took Rock across the country. In the movie, he visits barbershops in Harlem, salons in Beverly Hills as well as the extravagant Bronner Bros. Hair Show in Atlanta, where stylists wield their shears in intense hair battles. In the documentary Rock even goes as far as India, which is where the hair from many weaves worn by African-American women actually comes from. While the movie focuses on the relationship African-Americans have with their hair, dissatisfaction with appearance is an issue that faces broader society. ""We live in this crazy world. It's not just weaves, it's boob jobs and Botox and nose jobs,"" Rock explains. The movie has a sense of seriousness, but doesn't lose its humor. ""It plays as funny as any movie I've ever done,"" Rock says. ""I mean if you just sat there and listened for laughs, it's big bang laughs.""","Chris Rock examines world of black hair in new documentary .

"Washington (CNN) -- An FBI agent drowned Thursday in Puerto Rico while trying to save a swimmer, the FBI announced Friday. Special Agent Daniel Knapp was off duty and at the beach when friends of a struggling swimmer asked for help. Knapp put on his swim fins and went into the water off Playa Escondida -- Spanish for Hidden Beach -- in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Knapp reached the 18-year-old swimmer and was assisting him, but was overcome by waves, FBI spokesman Harry Rodriguez said. A police boat reached the swimmer and he was pulled to safety. ""Special Agent Knapp exemplified each of the ideals of the FBI, as well as possessing those traits which define a genuine wonderful person,"" said Joseph Campbell, the head of the FBI's Puerto Rico Field Office. ""He died a hero, saving another life."" Knapp, 43, had been with the FBI for six years and was based in San Juan. The FBI says he received the 2011 FBI Director's Award for Outstanding Criminal Investigation and the 2011 Attorney General's Award for Excellence in Law Enforcement.","Special Agent Daniel Knapp drowned helping a struggling swimmer .

"Sichuan province, China (CNN) -- It's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance. We've traveled for more than three hours up a windy, icy road in western China. Our hope is to get to the Tibetan autonomous zone, in the mountainous region of Sichuan province, an area reportedly locked in an ever-growing spiral of violence. We're so close, only an hour or so away. And then the light. Within minutes, we grind to a halt. A policeman is flashing a flashlight in my face. Our Chinese driver is already outside the car. We won't be going any farther tonight. Roadblocks like this are strewn across the back roads of this province. For weeks, ethnic Tibetans and Chinese security forces have been locked in conflict. Buddhist nuns and monks have been carrying out ritual self-immolation. It is a gruesome protest against what they claim is the ongoing oppression by Chinese authorities. Timeline of Tibetan protests in China . As our car turns back, our driver calls a Tibetan contact. Something serious is going down. The Tibetan says his village is crawling with police and the military. Later, local news reports tell of two Tibetans killed in protests. But many of the villages that straddle the mountains are inhabited by Han Chinese, the dominant ethnic group in China. Inside the houses, lights are on, as people eat, watch TV and talk. We ask what they're hearing. They tell us they have little time for the Tibetans. They call them lazy and accuse them of living off government handouts. One woman claims the Han Chinese are being targeted by violent Tibetan gangs. Local media reports say more than a dozen people have already been killed. There is hysteria, bigotry and fear here. It is fueled by government secrecy and a constant stream of military and police vehicles. Much of the province is in lockdown. In the capital city of Chengdu, police vehicles are seen moving into position at dawn. Soon, they are on every corner, armed police patrolling the streets. They are tightening their grip on this heavily Tibetan populated neighborhood. It's hard to get people to talk here. We see a group of young monks on a corner and wave them over. They agree to take us to their living quarters. Here in a tiny one bedroom apartment, four beds crammed against the walls and their food tied in sacks, the monks tell us they are verbally abused and harassed by police, pushed to breaking point. ""I cannot bear it any longer - any more,"" says one. They are far from their home in the mountains; cut off they say, they cannot even make contact by phone. ""We want to go but we cannot, you can see all the security out there. Wherever you go, they see you. We cannot go anywhere,"" he says. We ask if he's afraid, but he just looks at a picture of the Buddha, a smile on his face. ""I can't explain,"" he says, ""but I'm not afraid."" In their pouch, the monks hold a keepsake of their spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, too sacred to even show us. This pouch, they say, carries a dream. ""We wish what all Tibetans wish for the most: for the Dalai Lama to return to the palace in Tibet."" They know about the self-immolation of other Buddhists; they say they support them and vow it will continue until China leaves Tibet. For the Chinese government, though, these are dangerous men -- part of what they call a ""splittist"" element, determined to tear Tibet from China. Throughout our interview, we have been watched. Later, our vehicle is followed. Our driver says his family has received threatening phone calls. On our way to the airport, a car, rather suspiciously, rams into the back of our taxi. As we make our way to the service counters, we are followed by plainclothes security talking constantly on mobile phones. Eventually trying to clear airport security, we're grabbed by police. We are marched to an airport police station and detained and questioned for five hours. Police keep some of our video. They want to know who we spoke to, what we are doing here, where we've been and why we want to cover this story. We have our own questions -- questions authorities are answering only with roadblocks and police. Later, Chinese authorities black out CNNI when our report airs about the situation in the ethnically Tibetan area. There are claims and counter-claims in this dark conflict. All of it is being played out behind a veil of secrecy in the mountains of western China.","NEW: Chinese authorities black out a CNN report on the situation in Tibet .

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators say they have joined Cleveland Police in their search for a serial rapist, thought to be linked to four rapes and a homicide dating back to 1996. ""We're just hoping by reaching out to the media we can reach more people, and someone will recognize this guy,"" FBI Special Agent Vicki D. Anderson said Tuesday. ""Obviously we don't want this guy out there making more victims."" Anderson said forensic evidence has linked the man, who remains unidentified, to the four rape victims, one of whom was killed. Investigators said they discovered the woman's body in February 1997 in a secluded parking lot underneath a truck. The man's first known attack occurred in May 1996 when authorities say he allegedly abducted, raped and shot a woman, who survived the attack, according to an FBI statement. On June 18, 1998, the same man apparently raped another woman at knifepoint as she walked home in Cleveland. He allegedly raped again on December 8, 2010.

"(BudgetTravel.com) -- An epic tour of the Continent is the time-tested way to see Europe -- if you've got a month or three and a pile of cash. Until you win the lotto, we'll help you hit the grandest sites on your wish list. What exactly is a Grand Tour? It started in the 17th century as an extended -- make that a very extended -- European vacation for travelers with time and money to burn. Any trip worthy of the name would last more than a month and include stops in at least England, France and Italy. (When Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt got married in 1905, they spent three months shopping and eating their way from London to Rome.) The floodgates opened to the riffraff (a.k.a. you and me) after World War II, when transatlantic flights became more common and certain guidebook authors shared their tricks on how to vacation on the cheap. The ""If it's Tuesday, this must be Belgium"" incarnation of the Grand Tour -- which whipped travelers through a dizzying number of countries in a week or two -- passed the baton to the popular DIY version undertaken by recent college grads: the rail pass/hostel/Let's Go-type adventure. BudgetTravel.com: 4 most common reasons airlines lose luggage . How can I pull off a trip like that today? Your best bet is to go guided. A good outfitter can eliminate many of the headaches you can get from hopping across the Continent: blindly choosing hotels and restaurants, navigating the maze of trains and planes and orienting yourself in an unknown city. ""Guests come back from our trips overjoyed that they actually got to look up from their guidebooks,"" says Steve Born, the vice president of marketing for Globus family of brands, an international organization that runs more than 3,500 trips to Europe annually. ""They also love that when things are prebooked with a package, there's no waiting on line for admissions."" Globus's most popular cross-Continent tour is the 11-day Essential Europe itinerary, which starts in Rome and loops through Paris on its way to London (from $1,999 per person). Outfitted trips can also provide some authentic experiences that you could never stumble across on your own. Trafalgar Tours' Be My Guest dining option organizes small-group meals at wineries, farms, and private homes in 11 European countries. The stop in Belgium, for instance, takes place in an 18th-century farmstead owned by the same family for five generations. BudgetTravel.com: 12 restaurants with spectacular views . That sounds great, but I could never spend that much time sitting on a bus. The truth is, more and more outfitters have ditched the standard tour-bus and travel-by-number experience of the past. The newest itineraries from California-based Intrepid Travel are a good example: Their 15-day Barcelona to Rome tours (from $2,740 per person) link stays at inns and B&Bs with jaunts on public transportation and include plenty of unscheduled time. Cruises are an increasingly grand option, too. Ships now sail the Mediterranean and Baltic year-round; over the past 10 years the number of passengers touring these seas by ship has grown 163 percent. That's not the only way to sail here, either. Since 2004, the number of North Americans taking river cruises has jumped 60 percent, with the vast majority touring European rivers such as the Seine and Danube. With all these options, it's no wonder that packaged trips to Europe have started to draw a somewhat younger crowd. The average age of Globus's customers has dropped steadily over the years and now stands at 55 (60 percent female, 70 percent married couples, and 20 percent families traveling with children). The outfitter Contiki, which offers 100 itineraries in Europe, actually markets its trips exclusively to the 18-to-35 age bracket. There's no way I can take a monthlong vacation. Any suggestions? You're not alone there. ""Nobody I know can devote the month off that a 'grand trip' to Europe would entail,"" says Max Hartshorne, the editor of travel website gonomad.com. ""Nowadays, you're looking at more like a week or 10 days at the most, so people are no longer trying to do the whole Continent on a single trip."" At the same time, flights to Europe have become even more plentiful, so there's less incentive to save up money (and vacation days) for an epic journey when you can easily manage a weekend jaunt to London or Rome. ""Some travelers still feel the pressure to see and do it all, like they're on a mission,"" Born says. ""But more and more, travelers want to slow down and experience places in depth."" Outfitters have started offering a lot of itineraries with this in mind. In the past two years, for instance, the most popular tour offered by Intrepid Travel has been its 15-day Best of Italy trip (from $2,545 per person), followed closely by the eight-day Russia Highlights (from $1,735 per person) and 15-day Best of Spain (from $2,420). See our sidebar, ""Big Adventures on a Smaller Scale,"" below, for more regionally concentrated trip ideas. How can I do a Grand Tour on my own? For a classic loop—between London, Paris, and Rome, say—devote at least two days in each city. You can cut down on intercity travel time by taking advantage of low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet. Their baggage fees can add up, but their fares are hard to beat: A recent search on Ryanair found one-way flights from Paris to Rome for $12! If you have more time and would prefer to go by train, you don't necessarily need a pricey rail pass. Mark Smith, who maintains a European-train guide at seat61.com, generally advises booking point-to-point tickets with the service provider—such as bahn.com for trips in Germany or tgv-europe.com for France's high-speed line. Just remember one thing: ""grand"" doesn't have to mean ""once in a lifetime."" Don't try to see and do too much. After all, this is a vacation. Have fun—or, as they say, bon voyage!

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Former American student Amanda Knox went back to court Wednesday to appeal her conviction for murdering her British roommate. She is tense and has lost weight, her lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, told reporters. And she is facing a difficult legal battle, he said. Rather than prosecutors having to prove she is guilty, ""we have to prove her innocence, which is more difficult to do,"" Ghirga said. Her stepfather, Chris Mellas, said she had a ""a very strong appeal"" and there were ""ample grounds for Amanda's release."" He said he experienced deja vu walking back in the court where she was convicted nearly a year ago and seeing ""a new jury, new judge -- new judges. Unfortunately the old prosecutor, still, but you can't get everything."" The hearing lasted about 15 minutes before the judge adjourned it until December 11 because one of the lawyers was not present. Knox, 23, was sentenced last December to 26 years in prison for the killing of Meredith Kercher at the villa they shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Kercher, 21, was found in November 2007, semi-naked with her throat slashed. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were both found guilty of the murder. Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. Kercher's family is following the appeal, lawyer Francesco Maresca said. ""Of course, this is a phase in which they want to remember Meredith and think about Meredith and they hope to be able to just dedicate themselves to her memory without having to deal with trials anymore,"" he said. Knox's family said in April that she is innocent and that no forensic evidence puts her at the crime scene. ""Meredith was Amanda's friend,"" the family said. ""They liked each other and spent time together when not in school. Amanda would not hurt Meredith."" The family said the appeal would detail ""a lot of conjecture in these motivations, a number of discrepancies as well as a number of inconsistencies and contradictions; as well as conclusions not supported by evidence."" Jurors said they believed Knox played a role in the killing but that the death was not premeditated, according to a report released in April by the judges in the case.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A top Republican lawmaker is accusing employees at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of blocking investigations into the downing of a missionary plane in Peru that killed two Americans in 2001. Rep. Pete Hoekstra has called for a new hearing on the finding related to the downing of a plane in Peru. Rep. Pete Hoekstra on Thursday criticized ""rogue"" CIA employees involved in a joint CIA-Peruvian anti-narcotics program of withholding information after declassification of a CIA report identifying ""routine disregard"" of safety procedures that led to the plane being shot down. A 7-month-old girl and her mother died. The comments come after a new internal report by the CIA's inspector general -- parts of which were released Thursday -- that said Congress and investigators were not given appropriate access to internal documents regarding the incident. ""This issue goes to the heart of the American people's ability to trust the CIA,"" the Michigan lawmaker said Thursday. ""Americans deserve to know that agencies given the power to operate on their behalf aren't abusing that power or their trust."" Hoekstra, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has called for new hearings into the incident and further declassification of findings. The report identifies ""sustained and significant violations of required intercept procedures"" and found that the ""agency incorrectly reported that the program complied with the laws and policies governing it."" CIA senior managers ""withheld information"" and ""denied Congress, the NSC [National Security Council], and the Department of Justice access to these findings,"" the report says. The Justice Department in February 2005 ended investigations into whether CIA officers lied to lawmakers and to CIA officials about the operation. Immediately after the incident, the Peruvian air force said an unidentified plane that had not filed a flight plan had been detected entering Peruvian air space from Brazil. ""Facing such circumstances and, in agreement with established procedures, the intercept system was activated,"" the air force said in a written statement. After the missionaries' Cessna 185 did not respond to a command to identify itself, the air force fired on the plane, the statement said. Michael Loftus, president of the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism, which sponsored the missionaries, said their plane never left Peruvian air space. It had flown to the Brazilian border town of Benjamin Constant, site of the nearest consulate, to obtain a visa for the infant, he said. Loftus said pilot Kevin Donaldson had been in radio contact with a tower in Iquitos, Peru. ""Central aviation authorities had given him a landing slot. How could he be in contact with the civil authorities and their own military not know about it?"" he said. The pilot's wife said the Cessna aircraft was brought down in a hail of machine-gun fire. ""Within hours, CIA officers began to characterize the shootdown as a one-time mistake in an otherwise well-run program. In fact, this was not the case,"" according to the declassified report. ""In many cases,"" the report says, ""suspect aircraft were shot down within two to three minutes of being sighted by the Peruvian fighter -- without being properly identified."" CIA Director Michael Hayden has reached no decision in regard to the recommendations contained in the report, said CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield. Hayden recognizes the seriousness of the matter and is seeking input from an outside expert before making any decisions, Mansfield said. A senior U.S. intelligence official said Hoekstra's comments are ""puzzling and disappointing"" and could be ""perceived as political pressure.""

"(CNN) -- Sitting at her home in West Seattle, Washington, Amanda Knox's aunt Janet Huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder. ""It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it,"" Huff said of the verdict. She had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word. She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat. When the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison. Following the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed. ""To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,"" Huff said. Soon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd. Watch Janet Huff's interview with CNN's Campbell Brown . Huff said she spoke to Knox's parents shortly after the verdict. ""They are, of course, shattered. They are not doing great,"" Huff said. ""But we have already started the process of appeals. That's all we can do."" For Huff, Knox is still the strong, kindhearted girl she has always known -- not the cold-blooded killer prosecutors portrayed during the trial. Huff said Knox was worried about the trial's impact on the family. ""I think that's what gets her through, knowing that she's got to be strong,"" she said. ""If she falls apart, then we are really going to lose it. Knox's parents: Our daughter is no killer . ""I know she is terribly disappointed, heartbroken and scared to death, but she's more concerned about her family and how we are."" With Knox's conviction, Huff said the family was moving forward with plans for some relatives to move to Italy to be near Knox. The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said. ""We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,"" she said. ""There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone."" Knox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life. Her name and photo have appeared on the front pages of newspapers all over the world, and now, Huff fears, things may get worse. ""Now that there's a guilty verdict, she's always going to be remembered as 'The convicted killer Amanda Knox,' and I'm disgusted by that,"" Huff said. Maria Cantwell, a U.S. senator from Knox's home state of Washington, issued a statement saying she was ""saddened by the verdict."" ""I have serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted this trial,"" Cantwell said. ""I will be conveying my concerns to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."" Huff said she hopes the appeals process will show what her family has believed all along. ""She will be vindicated and she will be found innocent,"" she said. Despite the pain the trial has brought Knox's family, Huff stressed it is nothing compared to what victim Meredith Kercher's family has gone through. ""They still don't have closure, they may think they are vindicated with the guilty verdict but we know it doesn't bring their daughter back,"" she said.","Janet Huff: ""It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it""

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI said Friday it will respond to questions from Congress on the use of FBI aircraft amid allegations that Attorney General Eric Holder is among officials who ""may have used FBI planes for his own travel when aircraft were needed for FBI operations."" Both the Justice Department and the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed FBI Director Robert Mueller himself intends to reply to the allegations.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, was also signed by powerful GOP House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Frank Wolf of Virginia. In May, Grassley asked Mueller, who was testifying on Capitol Hill, if the FBI had to lease a plane because the bureau's jet was reserved for top Justice Department officials. Mueller responded: ""The Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the FBI, understand that these planes are first for investigative work,"" Mueller said. ""They are used for counterterrorism, criminal cases, and that any travel of the principals is secondary to the use of the plane for the investigative work of the FBI."" The answer was not sufficient for Grassley and his colleagues. The lawmakers want to know why the FBI pays for Holder's travel, even when he uses non-FBI planes such as Department of Defense or Federal Aviation Administration aircraft. Among several other demands, the lawmakers want the FBI to list all flights billed to the FBI by the Justice Department, and whether all of those flights were for official or personal travel. The letter, apparently coincidentally, was sent to Mueller on the day The Washington Post highlighted what it called ""Eric Holder's world tour."" The Post noted that Holder is planning a trip to the Middle East. He has already traveled this summer on official business to Denmark, Germany, Guam, Malaysia and Singapore. The article notes the attorney general appears to have itineraries packed full of official meetings, so he has little time for sightseeing. The expenses associated with the travel of attorneys general and other top government officials is an oft-debated topic in Washington. Frequently, the party out of power or its allies complain about the cost to taxpayers for official travel. Holder's predecessor, Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, was also questioned about his travel expenses. One of the major issues is the government's requirement that for security reasons, attorneys general, Homeland Security secretaries, FBI directors, and many defense and civilian intelligence officials must fly in government aircraft. When these officials travel on personal business they must reimburse the government at the rate of a round trip coach fare. The cost of a round trip coach fare between Washington and New York, for example costs about $130, while the actual cost of operating a government plane to and from New York to Washington is more than $4,000. The taxpayers pay the difference.","Holder ""may have used FBI planes for his own travel when aircraft were needed for FBI operations""

"(CNN) -- A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti two years ago, sending an already struggling nation into a tailspin. Relief organizations estimate that more than 300,000 people were injured, nearly 5,000 schools were damaged or destroyed, and 1.5 million people were left homeless. The quake affected one-third of the country's population, according to USAID. A cholera outbreak confirmed in late October 2010 and flooding from Hurricane Tomas in November aggravated dire conditions. ""This water now came by and washed away anything we had left,"" Leogane resident Charlie Simolien said. Recovery efforts have transitioned from relief to rebuilding, but more than half a million people still live in displacement camps, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. From the economy and education to health care and homelessness, relief organizations remain in Haiti, working to meet the ongoing needs of the Haitian people, and there are ways you can help. MFK fights malnutrition, creates jobs . Meds & Food for Kids (MFK) develops, produces and distributes ""Medika Mamba,"" Creole for peanut butter medicine, and other nutritious foods to fight malnutrition. When the earthquake hit in 2010, MFK distributed more than 40,000 pounds of Medika Mamba to malnourished children and patients recovering from amputations and surgery. Today, MFK continues its nutrition programs across the country. A new factory opens this summer and will expand production tenfold. ""What this means is we'll be able to treat all the children that suffer from malnutrition, but we'll also be able to make products that prevent malnutrition and supplements for pregnant and lactating women,"" MFK Executive Director Patricia Wolff said. The expansion also means more jobs. MFK's factory workers and managers are all Haitian and mentored by a small American staff. MFK purchases raw materials in Haiti when possible and provides training for local peanut farmers to improve agricultural practices and output. Visit MFK's website to make a donation. Professionals with engineering, technical, linguistic and managerial skills can contact MFK for more information on mentorship opportunities. Hope for Haiti rebuilds schools . Hope for Haiti has served Haitian children through education, nutrition and health care programs for 22 years. Before the earthquake, the organization supported children and teachers in 37 schools in Haiti's southern peninsula. In response to the disaster, Hope for Haiti distributed more than 1,000 emergency buckets to survivors and established a health clinic that served 10,000 displaced people at the Don Bosco IDP Camp. The organization installed solar panels at a damaged secondary school so classes could continue amid power outages. It built temporary structures at other damaged locations so school would not be interrupted during reconstruction. Hope for Haiti now supports 10 additional primary schools, helping approximately 10,000 students get an education. It provides teacher salary subsidies and basic materials to keep schools operational. Go online to make a donation to the education fund or to support another Hope for Haiti program. Partners in Health / Zanmi Lasante revitalize health care . Partners in Health (PIH) and its local sister organization Zanmi Lasante (ZL) started treating patients in a one-room clinic in Cange more than 25 years ago. The clinic is now a full-service hospital boasting 104 beds, and PIH/ZL has expanded its operations to 11 other hospitals and health centers in central Haiti. In the weeks after the quake, PIH/ZL cared for hundreds of thousands of Haitians who fled Port-au-Prince, organized volunteer medical staff and established health centers at camps for internally displaced people. The organization continues to expand the reach and depth of its health services throughout the country. PIH has hired and trained new medical staff, including 14 new psychologists and seven rehabilitation educators to serve earthquake victims, and will open a new teaching hospital in Mirebalais this year. ""This hospital is the culmination of a dream dating back a quarter-century and underlines our commitment to the country and people of Haiti, which is stronger than ever after the earthquake,"" PIH co-founder Dr. Paul Farmer said. To make a donation to PIH's work in Haiti from various countries, visit PIH.org. Details about volunteer and internship opportunities are also available on the website. CAN-DO reshapes communities . CAN-DO is working to establish model communities and create jobs through its Community Revitalization and Orphanage Revitalization projects. The organization arrived in Haiti less than 48 hours after the earthquake. Over the next six months, CAN-DO distributed 250,000 gallons of water, 8,000 pounds of medical supplies and 11 tons of food to orphanages and others in need. As part of its ongoing revitalization projects, CAN-DO is constructing and repairing schools, orphanages and medical clinics based on needs identified by local communities. CAN-DO also formed a team of Haiti workers called the Nou Kapab Crew made of skilled masons, electricians, plumbers, painters and laborers. Members of the crew are hired to work on CAN-DO and other reconstruction projects, helping Haitians get back to work and help rebuild. ""It's all about getting the community fired up and back on their feet, but they're the ones that are doing it,"" CAN-DO founder Eric Klein said. ""We just bring them the resources. They're going to get the job done."" To support CAN-DO's projects in Haiti, go online or text ""CANDO"" to 85944 to make a $10 donation.

"(CNN) -- It's an extraordinary claim -- one based on a 40-year-old memory -- but one the FBI has been using in an attempt to untangle the unsolved case of skyjacker D.B. Cooper. To Marla Cooper of Oklahoma, her uncle was D.B. Cooper -- except she knew him as Uncle L.D. She believes he died in 1999. ""I saw my uncle plotting a scheme,"" Cooper told CNN's Brooke Baldwin of what she said she remembers witnessing as an eight-year-old girl four decades ago. Cooper said she was with two uncles at her grandmother's house around Thanksgiving time. ""I was with them while they were plotting it. I didn't really know what was going on,"" Cooper said. ""Afterwards on Thanksgiving Day, I saw them return and I heard them discussing what they had done with my father. I have very vivid memories of it."" Her claim might be cause for healthy speculation, especially 40 years after the fact, but two sources close to the investigation have told CNN that Marla Cooper's tip led to the FBI reviving the case and for the past year the agency has been actively working the lead. On November 24, 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper -- the ""D.B."" apparently was a myth created by the press, according to the FBI -- hijacked Northwest Orient Flight 305 and succeeded in getting authorities to give him $200,000 and parachutes in return for letting passengers off the plane. The man then asked to be flown to Mexico City but jumped out of the back of the plane somewhere between Seattle, Washington, and Reno, Nevada. Authorities have never been able to prove whether the man survived or what his actual identity was. FBI working new lead in D.B. Cooper hijacking case . Marla Cooper says he did survive, but maybe, just barely. ""He and my other uncle came back very early on Thanksgiving morning and my Uncle L.D. was wounded,"" she said. ""He had blood on his shirt. He was banged up. He was really in bad shape."" She said the Korean War veteran later received treatment for his injuries at a VA hospital. It was then Cooper's father swore her to secrecy, she said. ""He explained that what my uncles had done could mean death and he said, 'Marla, you can never speak of this,'"" according to Cooper, who said she last saw L.D. Cooper around Christmas 1972. ""He just vanished from the life that he had known before,"" she said, noting that her uncle missed her grandmother's funeral around 1975. The FBI hasn't directly commented on Marla Cooper's claims, but a spokesman for the agency did say this week that the tip the agency is investigating came to them through a retired law enforcement officer, who had a contact who thought he or she knew the skyjacker's identity but added the suspect was dead. Marla Cooper said she gave the FBI a guitar strap her uncle had given her mother. She said they couldn't find any of his fingerprints on it. ""Family members of the deceased have cooperated with us and given us access to items which belonged to the deceased,"" said Fred Gutt with the FBI's Seattle Field Office. The FBI's lab started looking for evidence that might prove the dead person was the man who skyjacked Flight 305. The FBI wanted to retrieve items with fingerprints belonging to the new suspect. Gutt said the FBI knows Cooper had handled certain papers, including his plane ticket, and touched plane seats, but many fingerprints were found on those items. Through the years, the FBI managed to identify some fingerprints but not all of them. Gutt would not discuss the suspect's identity, the evidence retrieved or what the lab results were. But, Gutt said, ""so far there's not a lot that's inconsistent"" with the suspect matching D.B. Cooper. Gutt added the FBI has not been able to prove the person is the mysterious skyjacker and the law enforcement agency still does not know for certain whether Cooper survived his leap out of the plane almost four decades ago during bad weather. Although the FBI has been looking into the new lead for a year, it was first revealed during an interview with The Telegraph of London in advance of the 40th anniversary of the unsolved case this  November. One clue came in 1980, when a young boy found a rotting package full of $20 bills -- $5,800 in all -- that matched the serial numbers of the ransom money. The FBI returned most of the bills to the boy, named Brian Ingram, and Ingram has since auctioned some of them, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. ""We've run down thousands of leads and considered all sorts of scenarios,"" the FBI said in 2007. ""And amateur sleuths have put forward plenty of their own theories. Yet the case remains unsolved. Would we still like to get our man? Absolutely."" The FBI appealed for help from the public, releasing pictures of Cooper's black J.C. Penney tie, which he removed before jumping and which later provided authorities with a DNA sample, along with some of the found money. The agency reminded the public that Cooper was no expert skydiver. ""We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper,"" said Special Agent Larry Carr in 2007. ""We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve chute was only for training and had been sewn shut -- something a skilled skydiver would have checked."" Agents also believe Cooper had no help on the ground. If he had had an accomplice, he would have needed to coordinate closely with the flight crew and jump at just the right moment. ""But Cooper simply said, 'Fly to Mexico,' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped,"" authorities said. ""There was also no visibility of the ground due to cloud cover at 5,000 feet."" Two flight attendants who were in contact with Cooper gave nearly identical descriptions of him, as did those who encountered him on the ground. He was said to be between 5 foot 10 and 6 feet tall, weighing 170 to 180 pounds with brown eyes. Carr said in 2007 he believed it was unlikely Cooper survived the jump. ""Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his chute open,"" he said. By the five-year anniversary of the hijacking, the FBI said it had considered more than 800 suspects and eliminated all but two dozen from consideration. Several high-profile suspects have been ruled out over the years. Duane Weber, who claimed on his deathbed to be Cooper, was eliminated by DNA testing, the FBI said. Another man, Kenneth Christiansen, did not match the physical description and was a skilled paratrooper. A third, Richard McCoy, who died in 1974, also did not match the description and was at home the day after the hijacking having Thanksgiving dinner with his family in Utah -- ""an unlikely scenario unless he had help,"" the agency said. Gutt said while the FBI understands there is great public interest in this long-unsolved case ""it's a fairly low-priority case for the FBI"" as it pursues new investigations involving cases like missing children that have a current impact on public safety. Even so, Gutt said the FBI always follows up on any new tips on the case. On Sunday, another FBI spokeswoman, Ayn Sandalo Dietrich, told CNN the information on the new suspect is not expected to be ""a big break in the investigation."" CNN's Brooke Baldwin, Patrick Oppmann, Carol Cratty and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report .","The woman's claims are being investigated by the FBI, sources tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- The European Council of December 8 produced a curious mixture of cohesion and disagreement. Cohesion was apparent among the eurozone countries (and a number of other countries) which all accepted the essence of the Franco-German proposal to make the limits on economic policy even more legally binding, now called officially a ""fiscal compact."" On the substance the new fiscal compact is a case of ""now we really mean it."" In the old Stability and Growth Pact, member countries had already solemnly declared their commitment to achieve a balanced budget over the cycle. But this was never achieved; and when both France and Germany had deficits exceeding 3 % of GDP in the early 2000s they simply cobbled together a majority to change the interpretation of the Stability Pact to allow them to avoid fines. Under the new fiscal compact this should no longer be possible. Member countries from now have to observe a limit on their cyclically adjusted fiscal deficits of 0.5 % of GDP. This number is almost exactly the same as the new constitutional rule Germany adopted recently. All member countries have undertaken to enshrine this rule in their constitutions and submit control of it to the European Court of Justice. How to get to this lofty goal was left open. On current projections only two member countries will actually satisfy the limit of the euro fiscal compact: Germany and Italy. Given that Italy is now the biggest headache for the eurozone, this may seem surprising --Italy does not have a deficit problem. The problem of Italy is its high debt level, or rather the need to roll over large amounts of debt coming due at acceptable rates. The fiscal compact will do little to alleviate this problem. Most other member countries, especially France, will have to undertake a major fiscal adjustment if they are to adhere to the limits of the new fiscal compact. It remains to be seen how the French parliament will react when this becomes more widely appreciated. The new fiscal compact is certainly not needed to deal with the acute crisis at hand. At present there is no need for fines or interventions by the European Court of Justice to force countries bring their budget in order. The pressure from financial markets is already so strong that Italy has already implemented changes that more than satisfy the new limit given. The country is on course to achieve fiscal balance in two years. The true significance of this agreement in the short run is that it might provide political comfort for the German government. Angela Merkel can now claim to the German public that the financial support Germany has given to the periphery will not be wasted because these countries have accepted a permanent fiscal straight jacket. The French and German leaders felt vindicated by the fact that their proposal had been accepted not only all euro area countries but also a number of other EU member countries. The disagreement with the UK was not about the substance of this fiscal compact, which would anyway have no implications for the British government, nor for the British economy. The opposition of the UK did not allow the euro states to make full use of the EU framework. This is why a new, intergovernmental treaty, will now have to be negotiated. This can actually be done quicker than a full-fledged revision of the EU Treaty, which requires an elaborate and time-consuming procedure. If the new limits on deficits really are adhered to, last week's agreement will signal a fundamental change. Fiscal policy would be mostly on automatic pilot and debt levels should decline continuously. It remains to be seen whether national parliaments will fully swallow this loss of sovereignty. If credible this fiscal compact should lead to a massive improvement in the rating of sovereign debt in the euro area. A first test might come soon, when the ratings agencies have to decide whether to follow through on downgrade warnings issued before the summit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Gros .","Daniel Gros is the Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels .

"(CNN) -- Take some bills out of your wallet. Read the signatures. What do you have? I've got a couple of Henry Paulsons, some Robert Kimmitts and a Stuart Levey. But now, the currency of the greatest nation on Earth will carry a scribble that has been variously described as curly fries, a phone cord, a bendy straw or simply the ""Boing!"" sign from a comic strip. That's the signature of Jacob ""Jack"" Lew, President Obama's nominee for secretary of the Treasury, and it has lit up the blogosphere. So instead of going crazy because the Cabinet is in sore need of a binder full of women, what the ""boing"" is going to do to our money is the big deal. I know a guy who is a great artist, and his signature is mainly a straight line interrupted by a bump in the middle, which could have been caused by someone accidentally hitting the table. But he is an artist and can do what he wants. I also know people who have had their 1040 tax returns rejected by the IRS for a boing-style signature. Is it possible that our Treasury secretary could have his tax returns go awry because of his penmanship? Could the Chinese start rejecting the almighty dollar because they think the boing looks too weird? Or could his signature mean something else in Chinese, like ""We will bury you"" or ""This is Monopoly money""? Jack Lew is a Harvard-Georgetown, really smart type of guy, and God knows we probably owe him a lot.

The information minister, Qamar Zaman Kaira, said the two countries' representatives signed 13 agreements. Kaira predicted that China's private sector would announce more investment during Saturday's business summit in Islamabad. China's delegation includes ministers, diplomats, members of the news media and 250 businessmen, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan. Friday's agreements included Chinese aid to Pakistan's flood victims -- in the form of cash and help rebuilding houses and roads -- as well as the opening of culture centers in both countries, aid in energy projects, student scholarships and trade.

"Brasilia, Brazil (CNN) -- A former prostitute plans to sue the U.S. Embassy in Brazil, alleging that members of its security team in December threw her from a van and ran over her, the woman's attorney said. Romila Aparacida Ferreira showed CNN photos of injuries she claimed she received in the incident. ""These are the tire marks,"" she said about one photo. ""They run down my side and across my abdomen."" Ferreira claimed she suffered a broken collarbone, three broken ribs and a punctured lung. The story broke this week, eliciting a comment from visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The Marines involved were disciplined and are no longer in Brazil, he said. ""They were reduced in rank and they were severely punished for that behavior. I have no tolerance for that kind of conduct, not here or any place in the world,"" Panetta said. The incident is the third to come to light this month involving alleged transgressions by U.S. government employees or military personnel. Sources ID agent at center of Colombia scandal . The Secret Service has been rocked by allegations that agents engaged in heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes this month before President Barack Obama arrived in Cartagena, Colombia, for the Summit of the Americas. Twelve members of the military are under investigation in that alleged incident. New claims include an account from El Salvador described by CNN affiliate Seattle TV station KIRO as being very similar to what allegedly happened in Colombia. It involved members of the Secret Service and other government agencies, according to KIRO. Ferreira, in an interview at her modest apartment in a suburb of the Brazilian capital, said she worked for three years as a call girl and stripper at Apples nightclub. On December 29, she said, she and three co-workers left the club with a group of Americans from the U.S. Embassy security team. ""We had drinks and chatted and then we each set a price,"" said Ferreira. According to a police report, the men, three Marines and one embassy employee, called for an embassy van and driver to pick them up. While soliciting prostitution is legal in Brazil, U.S. military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" It is also considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. The lengthy police report has contradictory accounts of what happened next. Ferreira says she was violently thrown out of the van by one of the Marines after she argued with the Brazilian driver. Other witnesses say she was aggressively forced out, but not violently thrown on the ground. The Marines said Ferreira was asked to leave. When she stepped out of the car, she received injuries as she tried to get back in, they contended. Ferreira said she was holding on to the door handle when the van took off. ""That's when it dragged me and ripped the skin off my leg. I let go and then the back tire drove over me, literally right over me,"" she said. According to the police report, the van stopped and the other women got out. Then, with the embassy staffers inside, the van drove off, leaving Ferreira in the road. The woman's attorney, Antonio Rodrigo Machado, said the lawsuit is not about money. ""It's a question of honor and reputation,"" he said. ""If money will make them suffer and recognize how much pain they've caused, then let it be money."" The U.S. Embassy in Brasilia, when asked for details of the incident, referred to comments made Thursday by a U.S. State Department spokeswoman. ""My understanding is that she (Ferreira) was initially in the car, she was asked to leave the car, she got out of the car, the doors were closed, as the Pentagon guy said, the vehicle was at rest, and then, as they started to drive away, she chased after the car, tried to get back in and that's when she was hurt,"" said spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""I do not have that she was run over by the car."" The embassy cooperated with Brazilian authorities and allowed U.S. employees to be interviewed, Nuland told reporters. Ferreira said she is no longer working as a prostitute. She used her savings to start a pet grooming shop. ""I'm not that girl from the club,"" she said. ""I started to think about what I wanted from life."" Ferreira says she turned down a compensation offer of $2,000 from the U.S. Embassy because it wasn't enough to pay her medical expenses or lost income. Machado says Brazilian prosecutors are considering criminal charges against the Americans, including assault. But since the men are no longer in the country, it is not clear whether they would ever face trial in Brazil.","Former prostitute claims U.S. Embassy van ran over her after she was thrown out of it .

"(CNN) -- It started as a dot -- a bright, white star that raced across the Southwest. Over Texas, the dot became a streak that thickened, then spawned smaller streaks -- ""little sparklies,"" Linda Steed recalled. Then came the sound -- ""a big, rolling boom,"" she said. ""The dog started barking like crazy."" A decade ago, 200,000 feet above Steed's driveway in Nacogdoches, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart on re-entry. All seven astronauts aboard died. Friday, NASA marks the anniversary with tributes to the crew of Columbia and 10 other astronauts lost in the space agency's two previous fatal accidents -- the 1986 explosion that destroyed Columbia's sister ship Challenger, and the launch pad fire that killed Apollo 1's three-man crew in 1967. All three anniversaries fall within a week -- the Apollo fire on January 27, Challenger on January 28 and Columbia on February 1. Controllers lost contact with Columbia at 8:59 a.m. ET, about 15 minutes before it had been expected to land at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shuttle commander Rick Husband's wife Evelyn, who was waiting for him there, feared the worst. Space fan remembers the shuttle 10 years later . ""I remember looking up at the sky and thinking, 'Is that it? Is that the end of Rick's life?' "" she told CNN. In an instant, she was a single mother with two young children. She was angry, frustrated. But she said NASA is ""the best of the best."" ""They're human. They're flawed,"" said Husband-Thompson, who remarried five years ago. ""They did the best they possibly could. Nobody maliciously caused this to happen."" Nevertheless, she said, the grief still lingers. ""The Lord definitely healed our hearts tremendously, but it's a lifelong process,"" she said. ""I don't think that pain ever completely goes away."" Commemorations will also be held in some of the towns where the orbiter's wreckage rained down that bright Saturday morning. One of them is Hemphill, Texas, about 170 miles north of Houston, where a roadside monument and a museum commemorate the disaster and the volunteers who combed the surrounding woods for pieces of the spacecraft. Space shuttle Columbia part found in east Texas . ""Some of them, you knew instantly what they were,"" said Belinda Gay, one of those searchers. ""We would find some of the instrument panel that was in the shuttle cockpit. You could still see the numbers and the switches. You knew that if you found a can of caviar with Velcro on the back of it, you know it's not supposed to be in the woods."" The remains of the shuttle's crew were found near Hemphill, along with the nose, part of the landing gear and much of the cabin. In addition, two members of a helicopter crew engaged in the search were killed in a crash the following month. Gay now leads the Sabine County Columbia Memorial Committee. Unlike Steed, whose space buff sister-in-law called her outside that morning, she was getting ready for a relative's baby shower and didn't see the breakup. ""My house started vibrating, and the pictures on the wall started shaking, and then I heard two sonic booms,"" she said. ""We knew something was up."" Gay's husband was president of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter, and she led the group's Ladies' Auxiliary. Hemphill's VFW hall was quickly turned into a dining hall for the search teams, and it will host lunch for the guests at Friday's ceremony. Overall, NASA recovered about 84,000 pieces of the orbiter, about 40% of the craft, scattered from the Texas panhandle to Fort Polk, Louisiana. Pieces turned up as late as 2011, when the state's brutal drought uncovered an aluminum fuel tank on the bottom of Lake Nacogdoches. An investigation determined Columbia was doomed almost from the instant its 16-day mission began. A piece of insulating foam from its external fuel tank broke away, striking and cracking a panel on the orbiter's left wing. The damaged panel allowed searing hot gases to seep into the wing on re-entry, causing the craft to lose control and disintegrate. The three surviving shuttles returned to space starting in 2005. The last mission was in 2011, thirty years after Columbia -- the first of the class -- made its maiden voyage. NASA and the families of the crew decided to preserve its wreckage, which now sits on the 16th floor of the massive Vehicle Assembly Building at Cape Canaveral. For scientists, it's a ""treasure trove"" that lets them study the material used in the spacecraft, said Mike Ciannilli, the caretaker of the orbiter's remains. And for young NASA workers, it's a place to see firsthand why failure can't be an option. ""When you actually walk amongst Columbia and you talk about the accident and you talk about the lessons learned and how you can do the best job you can do to help prevent this from ever happening again, that's very powerful,"" Ciannilli said.

"(CNN) -- Fabiola Leocal's story ought to be uncommon, but in post-earthquake Haiti, it's not. All she has left of her previous life are a stack of photographs and a few other things scavenged off the rubble of the building she called a home. When the catastrophe struck, as the Haitians say, her house tumbled, along with many others that dotted the hillside in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Canape Vert. Her husband of nine years, Rene, was crushed under concrete. She lived in a camp for a while but returned to where she belonged. Now she has a tin shack and memories -- photographs carefully tucked away in loose, laminated photo album pages of herself and Rene. He, in a suit. She, in a much finer dress than the black sleeveless top and printed skirt she has on now. Some people tell her she should get rid of the pictures. What good are they now? They bring the kind of sadness that seems almost pointless to dwell on. Life has to go on for Leocal. She has to survive, if not for herself, then for her 15-year-old daughter. Sadly, Haitians have grown used to seeing earthquake rubble and the makeshift camps that sprang up after that fateful day in January 2010. The United Nations, Haitian officials and private aid agencies have said that Haiti has made strides in the two years since the quake. But few deny that recovery has been painfully slow. All you have to do is look at Leocal. And she might be considered one of the lucky ones. She has a ""home,"" however modest. The United Nations estimated the 7.0-magnitude earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000. More than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the Western hemisphere and wracked by crisis. Consider that 70% of Haitians did not have stable jobs before the quake and there were only 5.9 doctors per 10,000 residents. Two years later, almost as many Haitians are still unemployed. Debris still clutters the capital and other places. About half the rubble, the equivalent of five football stadiums full, has been removed, according to the United Nations. Impact Your World: How to help . About half a million people are still homeless. Many still live in tents in the shadows of the collapsed presidential palace, perhaps the most visible symbol of Haiti's misery. ""You can't stay on the streets,"" Leocal said. ""If that's what you have, you have to rebuild."" She is not alone in her frustration. Thousands of Haitians marched Wednesday through Port-au-Prince to the Parliament building to demand a reform of land laws so they can be freed to build homes, said Marjorie Bertrand Dumornay, coordinator of the grass-roots campaign funded by ActionAid Haiti. ""The rebuilding process is mostly led by the foreigners,"" she said. ""There is no national plan. The Haitian state does not have the will."" Michel Martelly, the former pop star who was elected president last year partly because he presented a fresh face in Haitian politics, campaigned on a pledge to fix Haiti. But it took him months to even form a government and he recently said that motivating people to move in the nation's ""culture of immobilism"" has been a challenge. CNN Photos: Haiti's children, two years later . Standing recently on a site where he said more than 600 families had been living in tents until just days ago, Martelly said the government was able to relocate them in housing. The project, he said, cost $9 million because damaged homes had to be either repaired or reconstructed. He acknowledged that many thousands are still waiting. ""But it's about sending the signal,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It's not about having the magic stick and making the problem disappear in one day. If you plant a tree today, in order to enjoy the shadow, you have to wait five years. So changing Haiti is going to take time and healing the wounds is going to take time."" Perhaps that signal can be seen at the tent city that sprang up on the slopes around the tony Petionville Golf Club. Ben Krause, director of Sean Penn's aid agency J/P HRO, said the number of people living there has dwindled from a high of 60,000 to 20,000. The focus, he said, has shifted from emergency care for the people in the camp to relocating them. The agency has been helping uncover a buried neighborhood nearby. ""What we've done in the past year is we've transitioned all our services from the camp into the neighborhood,"" he said. ""So for right now all of our medical clinics, they're operating in the neighborhood. They're close enough to camp that the people in the camp can access them, but really they're community clinics at this point."" Trapped in Haiti: A return to site of catastrophe . It's not just about providing services but also how to make the best use of money. Dumornay said Haitians are demanding transparency in a land enveloped by corruption. Again, Martelly acknowledged it will be ""very difficult."" ""I believe the real devil in Haiti can only stop when we change our mentality, our way of doing things,"" he said. After the earthquake, Haiti became a darling of the international community. Nations pledged money and policymakers vowed that out of tragedy would come a new beginning. But two years on, Haitians are asking: Where did all that money go? A key issue has been the disbursal of the foreign aid that was pledged for reconstruction. The United Nations said this week that almost 53% of the $4.5 billion the international community pledged for reconstruction in 2010 and 2011 had been disbursed. However, the Center for Economic and Policy Research said its analysis showed that only 10% of the funds disbursed by the Haiti Reconstruction Fund, which the center said received nearly 20% of all donor pledges, have been spent on the ground. According to the Washington-based research organization, the ""Interim Haiti Recovery Commission has approved over $3 billion in projects, yet most have not even begun. And only 2.4% of U.S. government contracts went directly to Haitian firms, while USAID relied on Washington area contractors for more than 90% of their contracts."" Buried alive together, survivors reunite for first time . Oxfam International, one of many international charities working in Haiti, said progress is at a ""snail's pace."" ""With a new government in place and billions of aid dollars pledged, Haitians are left asking why there has not been more progress in rebuilding the country,"" said Oxfam's country director in Haiti, Cecilia Millan. ""The second anniversary of the devastating earthquake must be a call to action,"" she said. ""Despite the apparent slowness of reconstruction, this remains an opportunity for HaitiÂ´s political and economic elite to address the chronic poverty and inequality that has plagued the country since independence."" Leocal got tired of waiting for aid agencies to help her. It's difficult, she said, to live like this. Without hard walls. Without much of anything. But she thought she might as well return to the slopes of Canape Vert, dotted with crumbled structures and vacant spots. At least it was home. CNN's Anderson Cooper, Charlie Moore, Neil Hallsworth and Edvige Jean-Francois contributed to this report.","Fabiola Leocal lost her home and husband in the 2010 earthquake .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A Russian billionaire and former KGB agent is buying a controlling stake in the venerable Evening Standard, the London newspaper announced Wednesday. The Evening Standard was sold for the token sum of £1. Alexander Lebedev, 49, already owns the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, one of the few pro-democracy newspapers in Russia. Lebedev is buying the Evening Standard for £1, or $1.38, a spokesman for the deal told CNN. While it sounds like a steal, the purchase price is more symbolic than reflective of the paper's worth. With it, Lebedev also assumes the unprofitable paper's debts. The Standard reported it is the first time a Russian business magnate and former member of a foreign intelligence service has owned a British title. Lebedev told The Guardian newspaper this month that he read the Evening Standard when he was a spy working at the Soviet Embassy in London in the late 1980s. ""I had to read every newspaper,"" he told The Guardian. ""I had to read the FT (Financial Times), The Guardian, Standard, and the Daily Mail."" Lebedev said the Standard was ""a very good newspaper"" with some ""brilliant journalists."" The oligarch said he had no intention of interfering in British politics and vowed a hands-off approach, telling The Guardian, ""My influence would be next to zero."" Top management of Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), which is selling its controlling interest to Lebedev, said the move ensures continued investment in the 182-year-old paper. ""We believe that the agreement announced today is in the best interests of the staff and our shareholders,"" said Martin Morgan, chief executive of DMGT. ""The investment planned by Mr. Lebedev secures the future of the paper."" Lebedev owns 49 percent of Novaya Gazeta together with former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev. A journalist from the newspaper was killed Monday in Moscow when she tried to intervene in the fatal shooting of a Russian human rights lawyer, Russian media reported. In addition to owning Novaya Gazeta, Lebedev is also chairman of the board of the National Reserve Corporation, which is the majority shareholder in National Reserve Bank, one of Russia's largest. Lebedev also owns 30 percent of Russian airline Aeroflot and shares in finance and energy companies, including Russian energy giant Gazprom. After serving in the Russian parliament, the Duma, Lebedev formed a new political party last September. The Independent Democratic Party of Russia campaigns for legal and economic reform, a stronger role for parliament, and the expansion of Russia's independent media. Lebedev is purchasing the Evening Standard with his son, Evgeny, 28. ""The Lebedev family is delighted to be investing in the Evening Standard,"" Lebedev said in a statement. ""We are strong supporters of a free and independent press and we greatly admire the Evening Standard as an iconic publication with its pedigree of fine journalism and commentary."" Evgeny Lebedev already has hefty business dealings in London and elsewhere in Europe. He owns stakes in several London restaurants, he runs a men's fashion company that has shows at Paris Men's Fashion Week, and he has interests in hotels in Italy, France, and Switzerland. Forbes Magazine listed Alexander Lebedev as the world's 358th-richest person last year, worth $3.1 billion. Forbes said Lebedev made most of his money through investments in banking and insurance companies and in Aeroflot.","London paper Evening Standard will be owned by billionaire Alexander Lebedev .

"(CNN) -- Author Philip Jose Farmer died in his sleep Wednesday, according to a message on his Web site. Farmer was known for his science-fiction and fantasy novels and short stories. He was 91. His most popular work was his ""Riverworld"" series, written in the 1970s. Joe Lansdale, a critic, writer and friend of Farmer's, credited Farmer with changing the face of science fiction. ""I just can't begin to tell you how important he is to the field as well as other fields,"" Lansdale said. Critics say Farmer, who was born in Indiana but spent the rest of his life in Peoria, Illinois, was the first author to address adult sexual themes in science-fiction novels. Jonathan Strahan, an editor and critic for Locus magazine, said Farmer treated sex seriously, not in a juvenile manner or for cheap thrills. ""It wasn't pornography and it wasn't just about the sex of it,"" Strahan said. ""It was about the sexuality of people in an interesting and intelligent way."" His influence over the science-fiction community is becoming more apparent over time, critics said. One of the most well-known science-fiction novels to be influenced by Farmer was ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" by Robert Heinlein. Strahan said Heinlein was good friends with Farmer. Farmer was one of a handful of writers to win the lifetime achievement award from the World Fantasy Society and the Grand Master Award presented by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Winning both the awards is rare, Strahan said, because not many writers wrote as expansively in both fields as Farmer did. Lansdale said Farmer was fearless when it came to the subject matter for his stories. Farmer's latest books were published by Subterranean Press. His last novel, ""The City Beyond Play,"" was published in 2007. A statement on Subterranean's Web site Wednesday noted the death of Farmer, ""who we have been lucky to publish, but have been even luckier to be readers of for so many years."" ""You can imagine it's been a sad day here -- we're still working through our emotions about it,"" the statement said. ""But we can say that our memories of him are good ones. He was always a joy to work with, and we will dearly miss his intelligence and good nature.""","Farmer's most popular work was his ""Riverworld"" series .

"(CNN) -- One year ago, a series of events began with an earthquake off the cost of Japan that culminated in the largest accidental release of radioactivity into the ocean in history. We have to be careful and say ""accidental"" because in the late 1950s and early 1960s, 50 to 100 times more radioactivity was released worldwide as fallout from the intentional testing of nuclear weapons. The word ""ocean"" is also important, since Chernobyl in 1986 was hundreds of miles inland, so it had a smaller impact on the concentrations of radionuclides in the sea than was measured directly off Japan in 2011. One year later, we have to ask, what do we know about Fukushima's impact on the ocean and levels of radioactive contaminants in water and fish? In many ways we were fortunate that impacts were largely confined to the ocean. Certainly, the Japanese people continue to feel devastating effects of so large a release within their country, and many people may never be able to return to their homes. But in general the winds during the height of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were blowing offshore. As a result, more than three-quarters of the radioactivity fell on the ocean. This is important, as any that lands on soil remains in place, resulting in the potential for greater human exposure and increased chances of contamination to food supplies and property. In the Pacific, however, the strong Kuroshio Current (similar to the Atlantic Gulf Stream) helped move any contamination quickly away from shore and diluted it by mixing it into deeper water. This allowed us to report that by June 2011, even when we sampled within sight of the nuclear power plants, levels of cesium-137 and cesium-134 in the ocean, two primary products of nuclear fission, were elevated, but still below those considered of concern for exposure to humans. They were also well below biological thresholds of concern to the small fish and plankton we sampled, even if these were consumed by humans. Several other groups have now confirmed our findings about levels of radioactivity up to 400 miles offshore. Other measurements show trends that are more worrisome. Levels of radioactivity found in fish are not decreasing and there appear to be hot spots on the seafloor that are not well mapped. There is also little agreement on exactly how much radioactivity was released or even whether the fires and explosions at the power plant resulted in more radioactive fallout to the ocean than did direct releases of radioactivity caused by dumping water on the reactors to keep them cool. Opinion: U.S. reactors still vulnerable, a year after Fukushima . Japan is taking what some think of as a precautionary measure by lowering the limits of radioactive contaminants in drinking water and food supplies, including seafood, on April 1.The new level for fish will be one-tenth of the acceptable level in the United States. Will Japan's new limits build consumer confidence or raise fears and questions about why more fish are considered unsafe for consumption? And why were fish caught last year considered safe, but now are not? Despite the announcement in December that operators of the power plant had achieved cold shut down, we know they are still using tons of water to cool the reactors and that not all the water has been collected or treated. As a result, the ground around the site is like a dirty sponge, saturated with contaminated water that is leaking into the ocean. Marine sediments are also collecting radioactive contaminants, exposing bottom-dwelling fish, shellfish and other organisms on the sea floor to higher levels of contaminants than those in the waters above. Little is known, however, about the level of contamination in the groundwater and on the seafloor and whether these will be a source of contaminants long after levels in the ocean have become diluted to the point that only the most sensitive instruments can detect them. We do know that we can detect cesium at very dilute levels, well below those considered harmful. Using these sensitive techniques we can track the Fukushima contaminants as ocean currents carry the peak releases across the Pacific where they are expected to reach the U.S. West Coast in 2013-2014 at levels that are much lower than we measured off Japan in 2011 and thus not of concern to human health. Two weeks ago, we held the largest international gathering of marine scientists studying radioactive substances in the ocean originating from Fukushima. Although we shared freely what each of us has learned in the last year, what we need today is also what we needed on March 11, 2011 â€” greater international coordination of long-term studies of the fate and consequences of the radiation. We've done the initial assessments. Now we need to begin answering the tougher questions, building public confidence in scientific studies by having multiple, independent groups at work, and ensuring we have the resources to build comprehensive, long-term studies. As a scientist and a marine radiochemist, I am trained to provide answers about radioactivity in the oceanâ€”how much is out there, where it is, and what its fate is likely to be in the future. Today, we haven't gone very far beyond the first question, which was key on March 11, 2011, but hardly seems sufficient one year later. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Buesseler.","Fukushima disaster led to largest accidental release of radioactivity into ocean .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations is urging Pakistan to look deeper into reports that thousands of people inside the country have been illegally detained or disappeared. A U.N. delegation spent 10 days inside Pakistan at the invitation of the government, and interviewed families of the missing. The group issued a detailed report on their findings Thursday. In many cases, the group found, families were often intimidated or threatened against reporting cases to authorities and were given empty promises that if they didn't, their loves ones would be returned to them. The U.N. commission that receives reports of missing has more than 500 cases in its docket for all of Pakistan. But that number, the working group notes, ""may not be reflective of the reality of the situation."" ""According to various official and unofficial sources met during the visit, it is in the post 9/11 period that the question of 'missing persons' began to raise real attention at the national level,"" the report says. ""There is acknowledgment that enforced disappearances have occurred and still occur in the country."" ""Cases continue to be reported to the national authorities. But there are controversies both on the figures and on the nature of the practice of enforced disappearances."" CNN was unable to obtain comment Thursday and Friday from Pakistani government officials about the report. At least two high ranking Pakistani officials told CNN they were devoting attention to protests that have erupted in the country over an online anti-Islam film. Disappearances related to 9/11 . The U.N. group visited Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar and with families of those who are missing. ""We call on the State to guarantee the safety of those who have met with us and protect them against any form of reprisals, threat or intimidation,"" the group wrote. Throughout their time in Pakistan, the group held numerous meetings with NGOs, activists and lawyers as well as government representatives. It talked with people involved in diplomatic circles in Islamabad and heads of various U.N. agencies. A number of cases of disappearances filed with the group allegedly occurred in 1985 and the beginning of the 1990s, in the country's northwest region, the report says. The alleged disappearances appear to be related to conflicts in Afghanistan. And in the 1990s, the cases seem connected to the military operations carried out in Karachi, specifically in the Sindh province. In the 2000s, the working group started receiving information about people allegedly abducted ""in the context of the so-called 'war on terror' and sometimes said to have been transferred to other (Pakistani) territories or detention"" centers, the report says. The working group heard a range of figures for how many may be missing -- between a hundred to thousands. Found dead, tortured . In the western province of Baluchistan, sources told the group that more than 14,000 people are still missing. In Baluchistan, since 2010, people who were missing were discovered dead. Their bodies had signs of torture, and due to decomposition their families didn't recognize them. The local government says only 100 are missing, the U.N. group notes. The federal and local officials the group met with claimed the missing persons were not victims of forced disappearances, the report says. Rather, the officials said those people had actually been under criminal charges and chosen to go into hiding. Others, the Pakistani officials told the U.N. group, fled to another country to join illegal armed organizations. Another scenario presented to the U.N. investigators was that the missing were abducted by groups not affiliated with Pakistan. Some people who have gone missing and turned up again have testified to being held in unofficial places of detention, the report says. Many said they had been threatened not to speak about their detention. Fitting a pattern . The stories of families of the missing appear to fit a patten, according to the report: Abductors appearing to be law enforcement and accompanied by what appear to be plain clothes intelligence agents, remove a person in front of witnesses. Some families told U.N. representatives they had tried to file a report with the police but were turned down or discouraged from doing so. Many filed their cases with the Supreme Court of Pakistan so that the Court would issue an order to the police to initiate an investigation. In a ""large number of cases,"" the families would be threatened or intimidated against reporting. In a few cases, the U.N. group reports, lawyers defending the families were reportedly victims of enforced disappearances. The U.N. group praised efforts by some Pakistani courts in which people were found and returned to their families but ""in the greatest number of cases,"" investigations went nowhere. Even when there's evidence, the report says, perpetrators are often not prosecuted.","A U.N. delegation went to Pakistan to investigate reports of missing people .

"(CNN) -- Writing this article is tough. Sunday we all lost a great friend, Dan Wheldon, in what was the most horrendous crash I have ever seen. This day was supposed to be a celebration, not a tragedy. The event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway marked the end of our IndyCar season and was to have determined the season champion. As a side story, Dan was entered in the Go Daddy $5 million challenge, which -- if he could win the race from starting last -- could have won $2.5 million for him and $2.5 million for a fan. It was a challenge that garnered much media attention, and Dan had spent the past month or so heavily promoting the event and describing how excited he was to take part in this challenge. Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a fast racetrack that is high banked, and IndyCars reach speeds of 225 mph. Danger is part of our sport. We all know it is ever present, and we face it every time we step in the race car. We push it to the back of our minds because as drivers we have a job to do and you cannot let fear get in the way. One would be crazy to think nothing could ever go wrong, but we must not allow such thoughts to distract us from the job at hand. Only a handful of laps into Sunday's 300-mile race, I was following a couple of car lengths back from Dan. Going into turn one, I saw a couple of cars touch wheels up ahead and immediately began attempting to slow the car down from more than 220 mph. The racetrack in front of me began to fill with smoke and debris. I saw cars fly up into the air and drivers pile up into one another. While slowing the car, I got hit from behind and saw fellow driver Will Power barrel roll over the top of my head and fly about 200 feet through the air, straight into the wall. My car came to a rest, and fortunately I jumped out unhurt. The scene around me was something out of a war movie. Debris everywhere, cars burning to the ground and other drivers standing at the side of the racetrack in total shock, like myself, after having jumped out of their cars. As we got into the medical car that takes the drivers to the infield care center, we knew Dan's crash was the most severe and that it looked like he was injured. Honestly, death never crossed my mind. Broken bones and other serious issues, yes. Death, no. Leaving the medical center, my wife said to me, ""It's really bad, really bad."" Suddenly the fear of losing Dan began to overwhelm me and all the others around me. Only a short while later, drivers were called to a meeting and told that our greatest fear was a reality. Dan had passed. The grief was indescribable. Dan was a friend to all, a kind, charismatic man who could instantly light up a room with his beaming smile and charm. He was a great husband and wonderful father to his two young boys. His family meant everything to him. The question surrounds us as to why this happened. Was the racetrack too unsafe? Honestly, I don't have the answer to those questions. Is our job worth the risk? When you think of Dan's wife and children left behind, the answer is simple. No. But coming into this race you could argue that the risks are so remote that it was worth the risk to do what we love. Injury is possible, but we just haven't seen a death in the sport for a long time, and huge safety improvements have been made. Sunday we learned the hard truth: that no matter how much we can improve safety and plan for all eventualities, some things are impossible to prepare for. I think over this off-season we will evaluate what went wrong and how we can prevent this from happening again. And mark my words, we will learn from this. From my point of view as a driver, now is not that time. Now is the time to remember Dan, the great champion he was -- a two-time Indy 500 winner, the great husband, father and friend to so many of us. We will all miss him. No one can be blamed for this accident. It is just that, an accident. We will learn and improve, but we will not blame. This is what we do as drivers. Dan is a legend of our sport, one of the greats. His impact on my career as a fellow British driver has been profound. He touched everyone he met and was truly one of the most special human beings to walk this Earth. Now is the time to mourn the loss of Dan, the loss of a champion, the loss of a friend. We will never forget. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Lloyd.","Driver Alex Lloyd lost friend Dan Wheldon on a day meant for celebration, not tragedy .
He says drivers know racing is risky but try not to be distracted by this thought .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In what activists describe as unprecedented, the Catholic archbishop in Los Angeles has relieved a retired cardinal of his public and administrative duties for his mishandling of ""painful and brutal"" allegations of sexual abuse by priests. Archbishop Jose H. Gomez of the Los Angeles Archdiocese disciplined his predecessor, the now retired Cardinal Roger Mahony, after a California judge forced the archdiocese to release about 12,000 pages of church documents revealing how it handled allegations of abuse. There were 192 priests and bishops named in litigation, the archdiocese said. ""The cases span decades,"" Gomez said in a statement Thursday. Some go back to the 1930s. The documents were released on the archdiocese's website. ""But that does not make them less serious. I find these files to be brutal and painful reading,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office is reviewing the newly released set of documents, spokeswoman Jane Robison said Friday. No member of the Los Angeles church hierarchy has been charged with any wrongdoing, she said. Also on Friday, Mahony posted on his personal blog a response he sent to Gomez. The letter provides ""the history and context of what we have been through since the mid-1980s,"" Mahony said. When Gomez began to take over the archdiocese in May 2010, ""you began to become aware of all that had been done here over the years for the protection of children and youth,"" Mahony wrote to Gomez. The archdiocese became ""second to none"" in such protection, he wrote. ""Not once over these past years did you ever raise any questions about our policies, practices, or procedures in dealing with the problem of clergy sexual misconduct involving minors,"" Mahony wrote. ""I have stated time and time again that I made mistakes, especially in the mid-1980s. I apologized for those mistakes, and committed myself to make certain that the Archdiocese was safe for everyone,"" he wrote. Gomez cited Mahony for serious shortcomings after victims came forward during his tenure. ""Effective immediately, I have informed Cardinal Mahony that he will no longer have any administrative or public duties,"" Gomez said in a statement. David Clohessy, director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP), described Gomez's decision as unprecedented, but it amounts to a mere slap on the wrist long after the fact. ""I can't think of any instance in which a current Catholic prelate -- and that would include bishops and cardinals -- restricted or, in this case, promised to restrict their predecessor,"" said Clohessy, who has spent 24 years monitoring sex abuse allegations against priests. Clohessy said that between the ages of about 11 and 16 he was sexually abused by a priest in Missouri. ""But to say to a retired employee that we're going to give you fewer roles, it's a symbolic gesture and a pretty hollow one at that,"" Clohessy said. ""A meaningless gesture. He should have been demoted or disciplined by the church hierarchy, in Rome and in the U.S.,"" he said. But Mahony was not as much as denounced when he was in power, Clohessy said. Mahony ""expressed his sorrow"" for the alleged abuse, which victims reported during his tenure as archbishop from 1984 to 2011, the archdiocese said Friday. But Clohessy feels that he and other church officials knew too much and did too little, and that there have not been enough consequences to deter future abuse or cover-ups. ""If you successfully conceal your wrongdoing, you can keep your job,"" Clohessy said. Mahony hasn't had administrative duties since his retirement in March 2011, archdiocese spokesman Tod M. Tamberg said. Mahony, who will turn 77 later this month, can continue to celebrate the sacraments with no restrictions and can vote in conclave in a papal election until age 80, Tamberg said. ""He is reducing his public profile, which included numerous invitations in California and around the country to give guest lectures on immigration reform, on the church in the 21st century, etc.,"" Tamberg said in an e-mail to CNN. ""He remains a priest in good standing, and a cardinal of the church."" At the same time, Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Curry, who's the regional bishop of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties in California, has resigned and ""has also publicly apologized for his decisions while serving as Vicar for Clergy"" in relation to the sex abuse cases, Gomez said. ""I have accepted his request to be relieved of his responsibility,"" Gomez said. Clohessy called the resignation ""less noteworthy."" ""Eight to 12 bishops around the world have resigned because of these cases,"" Clohessy said. On Friday, SNAP leaders and supporters who said they were victimized as children by priests called upon federal and local prosecutors to investigate the sexual abuse allegations in the church files. The activists also called upon silent victims to come forward and disclose additional sexual offenses. At a press conference outside the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angeles, the activists called Thursday's release of church files ""incomplete."" Manuel Vega of Oxnard, California, said a priest abused him from age 10 to 15. On Friday, he called for a congressional hearing. He accused the church of withholding documents, especially with the priest who abused him and priests who abused his friends. ""We've had congressional hearings for doping,"" Vega told reporters. ""But where's our congressional hearing? This has not only impacted L.A. but it's impacted the entire United States and throughout the world."" Jim Robertson of Los Angeles said he found no files relating to the priest who abused him. He described the church hierarchy as ""corporate officers of a corporation."" ""So far this is nonsense. These people have spent millions and millions of the faithful's dollars to protect themselves,"" Robertson told reporters. ""These people behaved horrifically, absolutely horrifically."" The released files include letters by underage male victims accusing priests of sexually abusing them. In one letter, a clergyman is described as ""a very charismatic and much loved priest in the Hispanic community and people would never suspect of any wrongdoing,"" a victim wrote. But when the victim was 17 years old in 1983, the priest took the youngster to a mountain retreat near Big Bear Lake in California, and when they took a break by a stream, the priest ""gave me a hug and kissed me as if I were a woman,"" the victim wrote. Later, at the cabin, ""as I stood looking at the pictures on the walls, he reached out and fondled me,"" the victim wrote in a letter to a church official. The priest also ""forced me to have sex"" in a church rectory, a hotel and in a mobile home near Tijuana, Mexico, that someone loaned the priest, the victim wrote. ""While I felt forgiven by God, I still feel dirty,"" the victim wrote. In the file of another priest -- the one whom Vega identified as his abuser -- the contents were largely newspaper clippings about the priest being accused of child molestation. The priest was in charge of the altar boy program at an Oxnard church. At the end of the last page of the priest's file is a handwritten note stating: ""Ventura DA (district attorney) *3/27/03 -- Charged w/ felony 25 counts of child molestation of 8 youths in late 70's-early 80's."" The archdiocese published the names of accused clergy in a 2004 report, but the release of Thursday's documents will allow the public to trace how the church handled the allegations. It may bring to light some cases in which accusations were kept under wraps and the accused were kept out of the sight of the law or accusers. The documents were evidence in 508 civil cases by sex abuse victims that were settled in one stroke in 2007. Victims received $660 million in the landmark judgment. Most of the documents were inner-church correspondences about accused clergy. The archdiocese fought to purge the names of the accused from the papers until Thursday, when Judge Emilie Elias ruled that they be made public by February 22. The church published them shortly after the ruling. There are 124 personnel files in total, 82 of which reveal sex abuse allegations against minors. The release ""concludes a sad and shameful chapter in the history of our Local Church,"" the archdiocese said. It warned that although the names of the abused have been deleted, some may recognize their cases. ""We understand this experience may be a difficult one,"" it said. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","""Not once over these past years did you ever raise any questions,"" retired Mahony tells successor .

"(CNN) -- Bram Stoker's private journal sat unnoticed on his great-grandson's bookshelf in England for at least a year. Full of notes that would inform his legendary novel ""Dracula"" and other stories, the thin, unmarked book had probably been lugged down from the attic at some point, along with other things the Stoker family had passed down for more than a century and placed inconspicuously in Noel Dobbs' Isle of Wight home. Then, one day not long ago, a researcher working on a project about Stoker got in touch with Dobbs to ask if he might know anything about a journal his famous relative kept. Dobbs looked around and finally popped open this tiny book. It was signed ""Abraham Stoker."" ""It's kind of incredible, but Noel was rather blasÃ© about it,"" laughed Dacre Stoker, Dobbs' cousin and a professor in South Carolina who has written a book about Bram Stoker. When news reached Dacre that the journal had been discovered, he cajoled his cousin into sending him photographs of a few pages. ""When I saw it, I was amazed,"" Dacre Stoker said. ""I thought, 'The Holy Grail! We've found it!' There is so little written by Bram about Bram. Family, scholars and hard-core fans -- so many people have wanted to know what made the man who wrote 'Dracula' tick. And here we had a major set of clues."" Those clues will be published next March in ""The Lost Journal,"" Dacre Stoker told CNN.com. The publication will mark 100 years since the author died in April 1912. Dacre Stoker has worked with Bram Stoker scholars to annotate ""The Lost Journal,"" which also offers quirky bits of folklore from Ireland, Stoker's homeland, and insight into the inspiration for his other work. There are 305 entries, some pages-long, others just a few sentences. Bram Stoker was in his early 20s when the journal began in 1871. He had graduated from Ireland's Trinity College and was working at Dublin Castle. It would be more than a decade before the author learned about the primary inspiration for his Count Dracula, ""Vlad the Impaler."" The real-life prince of Wallachia who ruled during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, Vlad earned his nickname by impaling his enemies. His viciousness became notorious in Germany and other parts of Europe where tales spread of a man-monster who lived off blood. Vlad's father was a member of the Order of the Dragon, or Dracul. ""Dracula"" means son of the Dragon. The last entry of Stoker's journal in 1881 hints at a major character he would use in ""Dracula."" In the novel, Renfield is an asylum inmate who has delusions that compel him to eat living beings, including flies, to gain their life force. The vampire Count Dracula seizes on Renfield's weakness and offers him as many creatures as he can eat in exchange for his eternal devotion. It doesn't work out well for Renfield in the end. In his journal, Stoker wrote: ""I once knew a boy who put so many flies into a bottle that they had not room to die."" In another passage, the author seems to be alluding to a vampire's inability to see his own reflection. ""Story of man who reflects everybody's self who meets him,"" he wrote. Stoker's interest in spookiness shows up in other journal entries. ""A man builds up his shadow on a wall bit by bit by adding to substance,"" he wrote. ""Suddenly the shadow becomes alive."" The passage is believed to be a kernel of the ""The Shadow Builder,"" one of Stoker's first attempts at a horror mystery. The journal offers some surprising insight about the author, too. There are funny ""memos"" that Stoker wrote to himself, which Dacre Stoker believes were witticisms that the author may have wanted to use at a party or a pub to seem interesting. The journal also contains romantic poems. ""People don't think of Bram Stoker as being romantic, but there are some very romantic, sweet moments here,"" Dacre Stoker said. The author apparently drew from his journal for material that would make up ""Under the Sunset,"" a lesser-known collection of short stories for children that Stoker published in 1881. One note in the journal alludes to the writer's fascination with children: ""Palace of Fairy Queen. Child goes to sleep & palace grows -- sky changes into blue silk curtains etc."" Dreaming kids would appear in several stories in ""Under the Sunset,"" all darkly told tales that meditate on the blurry line between reality and imagination, science and folklore. ""Bram had a troubled childhood,"" Dacre Stoker said. ""He was very lonely and thought about death a lot during seven years that he was just a boy and struggling through an undiagnosed illness."" The journal's first entry, titled ""Night Fishing,"" is a kind of ode to the sea and the people who encounter it. The writing seems experimental and flowery. ""It's as if Bram were practicing,"" Stoker said. ""He might have thought, 'Well, this is how a writer is supposed to write -- in very long sentences.' "" The author was fascinated with the theater and the act of observing, and he traveled a lot, a rare thing for his time. Journaling and touring are central in ""Dracula."" The novel's narrator, Jonathan Harker, writes in his journal as he travels across Europe, witnessing and questioning the day's superstitions and trying to make sense of his own bad dreams and bizarre, supernatural encounters. The novel centers on Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England, and his battle with professor Abraham van Helsing. ""Bram traveled an unusual amount for the time that he lived,"" Dacre Stoker said. ""He was curious. He loved to ask those questions: What is real and what is myth, and where do they meet? What is stronger, science or myth?"" Though Stoker died before his Count Dracula became internationally famous when Bela Lugosi played him as a suave nobleman in the 1930s film, Dacre Stoker thinks the author would be flattered by how his character has stayed relevant over the years. From Lugosi to Anne Rice's Lestat and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" to ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood,"" Stoker's main question: ""What does it mean to live forever?"" has proved eternal. And in true Bram Stoker style, he left one more mystery. In one of his books, the author alludes to another diary. He writes about an upcoming trip to London where one can get work as a writer. The journal of writing and notes that was recently found in the Isle of Wight home is not that diary. ""There's something else out there -- that missing piece, this mystery diary,"" Stoker said. ""I'm dying to know where it is.""","Bram Stoker's journal has been found in a home on Isle of Wight, England .
The journal contains notes that would inform Stoker's ""Dracula"" and other works .
An annotated book will be published 100 years after Stoker's 1912 death .

"Leon, Mexico (CNN) -- It happened during my taxi ride from the airport to the hotel. After giving me a quick look, the cab driver asked: ""So where can I take you, Father?"" I had just arrived in Silao, Mexico located in the state of Guanajuato, which has the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico. Yes, I was wearing a dark suit -- my blue shirt had no collar though -- but the confusion had to do more with the cab driver's sense of anticipation than the way I looked. More than 3,000 archbishops, bishops, priests and nuns descended on Guanajuato last week with the hope of meeting the head of the Church. Pope Benedict XVI was coming to Mexico for the very first time in his seven-year papacy and the sense of anticipation was great. It was to be the pope's first trip to Spanish-speaking Latin America as well. The country was chosen carefully: Mexico has the second largest population of Catholics in the world, after Brazil. By the time Benedict arrived at El Bajio Airport Friday afternoon, there were tens of thousands of people lining up the streets along the 20-mile stretch that would take him to Colegio de Miraflores, a Catholic school run by nuns in the city of Leon where the pope would stay three nights. Most greeters were high school students who seemed genuinely excited about the pope's arrival. But others were compelled to attend by schools and church authorities. The City of Leon cancelled classes and declared a holiday. Mexico was the first country Pope John Paul II visited in 1979, only months after being elevated to the papacy. Benedict XVI has been pope for seven years and had received two personal invitations from Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who traveled to the Vatican in 2007 and again in May of last year. Before the visit, many Mexican Catholics perceived Benedict as a distant and reserved pope who felt uneasy when interacting with people -- a perception the Catholic and the Mexican Church were trying to lay to rest. That probably explains the reason why Benedict wore a broad-brimmed sombrero on arriving at Guanajuato state's Bicentennial Park to celebrate a mass attended by hundreds of thousands. He again wore a sombrero when addressing worshippers congregated outside Colegio de Miraflores on the last night of his visit. ""I've made a lot of trips, but I've never been welcomed with such enthusiasm. Now I can understand why Pope John Paul II used to say 'I feel like I'm a Mexican pope',"" Benedict told a crowd of thousands of excited followers. And then, there were the references to the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. As an academic with deep knowledge of theology and canon law, the pope is probably not thrilled about the fact that some Mexicans put images of the dark-skinned representation of the Virgin Mary right next to that of Christ. ""To love her [the Virgin Mary] is to get committed to listen to her Son; to venerate the Virgin of Guadalupe is to live according to the words of the blessed fruit of her womb,"" the pope reminded people attending the open-air Mass. At the Mass, the pontiff urged Mexicans to rely on their faith to fight poverty, drug violence and other ills that have afflicted Mexico in recent years. The pope made repeated references to the sorrow of recent violence in Mexico. Mexico is only three months away from holding presidential elections and the opposition questioned the timing of the visit. President Calderon's party, the PAN, is Catholic-oriented and deeply conservative. The president appeared with the pope every single day of this visit. That would have been unthinkable before 1992, when Mexico resumed diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a 130-year freeze. All four presidential candidates attended the pope's main mass at the park. The only controversy about the visit surfaced Saturday. On the same day Pope Benedict addressed and blessed a group of 1,800 children in Guanajuato, three Mexican authors released a book accusing the Vatican of hiding or ignoring cases of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests. The book entitled ""La Voluntad de no Saber"" (Willing not to be Aware), focuses on Father Marcial Maciel, a now-deceased, Mexican-born Roman Catholic priest accused of multiple cases of sexual abuse of minors. Calls for the pope to meet victims of sexual abuse while in Mexico went unanswered. The big question after the visit is whether Pope Benedict XVI was able to connect with young people. The Catholic Church has lost a significant number of members in the last few decades. The percentage of Catholics now stands at 83% in a country that used to be almost universally Catholic. Was Pope Benedict able to erase the perception that he is a distant academic or is he now seen as a warm and affectionate, grandfather-like figure, much like his predecessor? Only time will tell.","Pope Benedict XVI's trip to Mexico first since becoming pope seven years ago .

"(CNN) -- Officials are calling it one of the largest operations against human traffickers in Europe. Police in Europe arrested 103 people in 10 countries this week, all accused of smuggling in people on boats, freight trains and small hidden compartments in the floors of buses and trucks. The massive operation spanned a host of European nations and deployed more than 1,200 police officers. The operation descended on homes and properties across Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Slovak Republic, Turkey and Kosovo region in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Related operations took place in Switzerland and Austria. Mexican cult accused of forced labor . Their search yielded 176,500 euros (about $240,000) in cash, plus a collection of mobile phones, laptops, bank statements and a semiautomatic rifle with a large amount of ammunition. ""All arrested persons are suspected of being involved in the clandestine smuggling of a large number of irregular migrants into and within the European Union mainly via Turkey and the Western Balkan region,"" a Europol statement said. Europol is the European Union's law enforcement agency, . Most of those being smuggled were recruited from Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey by the criminal ring targeted in these raids. Human trafficking is a global multibillion dollar business, only ranking behind illegal drugs and arms trafficking, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. It is believed to generate profits of an estimated $32 billion, according to a 2005 report from the International Labour Organization. Half of those profits come from industrialized nations.

"(CNN) -- After a year of 10-to-14 hour workdays, the use of seven recording studios and just under $1 million in production costs, Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" was released in 1977 -- and it hasn't fallen out of rotation since. The classic disc was the No. 1 album on the charts for 31 weeks, with Rolling Stone naming ""Rumours"" the 25th greatest album of all time. It is the 10th best-selling album ever with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. It won the 1977 best album Grammy and, 35 years later, remains the band's most successful effort. Ken Caillat, author of the new book, ""Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album,"" was the iconic album's engineer/co-producer. (He's also the father of Grammy-winning singer Colbie Caillat and produced her No. 1 album, ""Breakthrough."") ""Rumours,"" Caillat said, is the ""perfect album because it had this really great combination of lyrics and ... well-thought-out musical components,"" he told CNN. ""It's the perfect ride for the perfect time."" But Fleetwood Mac's story began in another decade on another continent. And as fate would have it, the only two members who were with the group from the start are its namesakes: Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Fleetwood Mac was originally a blues-format group formed in England in 1967 by Fleetwood, McVie, Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. In 1970, Green left the group and McVie's wife, keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie, joined. Spencer left that same year, and the late guitarist Bob Welch joined. The group relocated to California in 1974. Welch, who took his own life earlier this month, resigned in December 1974 and was replaced by guitarist/vocalist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks. By the time Buckingham and Nicks joined, Fleetwood Mac had put out 10 albums but had yet to have a big hit in the U.S. In the book, Caillat described ""Rumours,"" Fleetwood Mac's second album with Nicks and Buckingham, as ""a journey that a handful of people ... took during the mid-1970s."" It was ""made out of flaws in the human spirit, sometimes through agonizing determination, love, lust, and a force of will that made failure unthinkable."" Recording began on ""Rumours"" on January 28, 1976, at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California. Twelve days earlier, Caillat had never even heard of the band, but that would soon change because 1975's eponymous ""Fleetwood Mac"" album (""Rhiannon,"" ""Say You Love Me"") was beginning to climb the charts. ""What's ironic is that throughout the 'Rumours' journey, Fleetwood Mac went from one end of the fame spectrum to the other,"" Caillat noted. ""That day in Sausalito, when we walked into the studio to start recording, they were an established band, but you could hardly say they were rock stars. Before we even released 'Rumours,' that had changed dramatically."" Although Nicks arguably became the best-known member of Fleetwood Mac, when they first started recording ""Rumours,"" many involved with the project thought she was the band's weakest link, Caillat said. ""She was somewhat of a sweet hippie chick, and she didn't have a lot of technical knowledge about music and instrumentation,"" he said. ""Ultimately, her ethereal songwriting and vocals added a dimension ... that was every bit as essential as any other band member's contributions."" (Incidentally, Nicks wrote the band's only No. 1 hit, ""Dreams."") Caillat described Buckingham, who often clashed with band mates, as ""extraordinarily talented"" as well as ""unpredictable,"" ""brilliant but difficult."" However, Caillat said, ""with Lindsey's contribution ... everyone in the world who'd ever heard a song on the radio would eventually know who Fleetwood Mac was by the time 'Rumours' had run its course."" In the book, Caillat described the unique way in which Buckingham taught himself guitar. He uses his fingernails instead of a pick, which is quite common, except instead of plucking strings upward individually, he can play more than one string at a time by stroking down --- and up -- with the backs of his nails, which allows him to play several notes at once. Buckingham honed this skill years before joining Fleetwood Mac when he was bedridden with mononucleosis for six months. At the time they were recording the album, all five band mates were going through painful breakups: The McVies were divorcing, Buckingham and Nicks' long-term relationship was coming to a bitter end and Fleetwood's wife was about to leave him for his best friend. It's all personal drama that Caillat chronicles in his book. ""In retrospect, it's a miracle that we were able to finish 'Rumours,' "" he said. ""But later, I came to understand that 'Rumours' probably succeeded because it was brilliant group therapy. ... It's horrible that if it hadn't been for all of the relationship turmoil in the band, you wouldn't know this record any better than some of the previous Fleetwood Mac records."" Sadness was contagious in the studio, which Caillat said was besieged with arguments, drugs and alcohol. During the summer of '76, the band took a break from recording ""Rumours"" to go on tour to promote their ""Fleetwood Mac"" album. It was the first time Buckingham and Nicks had played in front of a very large crowd, and the concert tour propelled the band to superstardom. Even though ""Fleetwood Mac"" was released in July of 1975, it finally hit No. 1 in September of 1976. As soon as the album began to lose momentum, the record label wanted the band to have the first single off ""Rumours"" -- ""Go Your Own Way"" -- ready to go. Caillat recalled that it was John McVie who came up with the album's title. ""John told us about a brainstorm he had recently had,"" he said. ""With all the rumors flying around about this album, why don't we call the album 'Rumours'? But let's spell it the English way."" Another major step involved in creating what would become an iconic album was selecting song sequence, which was ""crucial because it can make or break the album's success."" The idea was to make it compelling and tell a story through music. ""Back then,"" Caillat said, ""running orders were important; and because it was vinyl, you'd put the needle down and listen to side one all the way through to side two, and it was just like going to Six Flags -- you'd get lifted up on a high song and it'd slow down a bit; again, perfect! And I can only take a little bit of credit for that, but I was really proud to be a part of that."" Caillat told CNN that he believes ""Rumours"" still resonates to this day ""because it's great music. It happened to be created out of a lot of pain and suffering and sincerity and it just so happens that every song is great, every lyric is great, and every song has something that seems to appeal to someone -- except me."" That's right -- Caillat can no longer bear to listen to ""Rumours."" ""I see all the little pieces and I can visualize the arguments and I see the assembly of it all,"" he said. ""I can see behind the curtain, so to speak."" However, part of the reason Caillat knew that the story of ""Rumours"" needed to be told was because ""we experienced something extraordinary, something bigger than all of us.""

"(CNN) -- Now would be an appropriate time to cue up that GIF of Dawson bawling his eyes out. The last few years have been a nostalgic whirlwind with Angela Chase on ""Homeland,"" Zack Morris on ""Franklin and Bash,"" and Felicity Porter on the new FX drama ""The Americans."" Even Cory and Topanga are coming back to us. But for fans of ""Dawson's Creek,"" there's now a glaring hole in the TV landscape. ABC has pulled James Van Der Beek's ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23"" from the schedule, leaving eight episodes of the acerbic comedy unaired. (Not to mention that Pacey's, er, Joshua Jackson's ""Fringe"" just came to an end after five seasons on Fox.) This just isn't how it's supposed to work out for The Beek. Having made a name for himself as Dawson Leery on the WB drama, fans came to know -- and love -- Van Der Beek as the sensitive guy next door. Later, a slew of guest appearances in various series, ""Funny or Die"" sketches and the hilarious Van Der Memes Tumblr introduced the world to a different side of the actor. If it's even possible, our feelings for him grew stronger. So in April 2011, when Van Der Beek began starring as a single, self-obsessed version of himself on ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23,"" it felt like the universe finally got it right. Here's why old and new fans, alike, can't bear to part with James Van Der Beek on TV: . - On ""Apartment 23,"" Van Der Beek is in on the joke, poking fun at himself in the most charming way. He's up for anything, be it learning a choreographed routine for his character's turn on ""Dancing with the Stars"" or riding a horse sans pants as People's (pseudo) Sexiest Man Alive. - He even announced the sitcom's cancellation with grace via Twitter, followed by, ""And please, no bashing ABC. While I'm sure no one there would say they think they nailed it when it came to programming #Apt23 this year ... You've got to give ABC props for ever picking us up in the first place. They took a shot at something original & edgy. I respect them for it."" Same old sensitive Dawson. - ""Apartment 23"" takes advantage of Van Der Beek's roots, and reminds fans of how obsessed they were with ""Dawson's Creek,"" which is hilarious in and of itself. The show toyed with the idea of organizing a ""Creek"" reunion in an October episode aptly titled ""A Reunion..."" Busy Philipps, Frankie Muniz and Mark Paul-Gosselaar all guest-starred as fictional versions of themselves. What other show can do that? And it's all because of The Beek. - He'll next reprise his role as Simon, Robin's loser ex-boyfriend, in an episode of CBS' ""How I Met Your Mother."" He doesn't consider himself to be above cameo appearances that require him to sport a bald cap and gut. - Like a fine wine, James Van Der Beek has only improved with age. Amen.","ABC has pulled James Van Der Beek's ""Apartment 23"" from the schedule .

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows that Super Bowl host New Orleans can throw a party better than almost any other city in the world. But If you can't get there anytime soon, know that the cities sending teams to Sunday's game also know how to have a good time.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional Republicans are seeking more details on President Barack Obama's plan to reduce gun violence in schools. In letters to members of Obama's Cabinet, they requested information about the president's time frame and funding plans for the implementation of 23 executive actions on gun control enacted in mid-January in response to the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. Additionally, they want to know how the president's Congressional proposals will relate to mental health programs currently in place for students. The leaders of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce sent letters to Attorney General Eric Holder, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Housing and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""While we agree we cannot stop every senseless act of violence, we share the president's commitment to reviewing the facts and evaluating proposed and existing policies and programs intended to help teachers, principals, and parents protect their children,"" the letter to Holder says. Signed by Committee Chairman John Kline, R-Minnesota, and Subcommittee Chairmen Todd Rokita, R-Indiana, and Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, the letter also asks what ""legislative authority the department is expected to invoke to carry out the executive actions."" In his January speech, Obama said, ""To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act -- and Congress must act soon."" He called on the legislative branch to pass laws requiring universal background checks for anyone trying to buy a gun, to restore a ban on military-style assault weapons and to limit magazine rounds and to help law enforcement be tougher on people who buy guns with the purpose of selling them to criminals.","House Education Committee seeks more information on Obama's school safety plan .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced President Barack Obama's compromise over whether to require religiously affiliated institutions to provide contraception to female employees, saying the proposal raises ""serious moral concerns,"" according to a statement posted on its website late Friday. ""Today's proposal continues to involve needless government intrusion in the internal governance of religious institutions, and to threaten government coercion of religious people and groups to violate their most deeply held convictions,"" the statement said. Under the new plan announced by Obama, religiously affiliated universities and hospitals will not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees. Insurers will be required, however, to offer complete coverage free of charge to any women who work at such institutions. Women who work at churches, though, will have no guarantee of such contraception coverage -- a continuation of current law. News of the compromise came after days of escalating partisan and ideological rhetoric over the divisive issue. The White House originally wanted to require hospitals and schools with religious ties to offer full contraception coverage. Many Catholic leaders and other religious groups strongly oppose any requirement for contraception coverage on theological grounds. The question of whether institutions with religious ties should be required to offer insurance plans covering birth control and the so-called morning after pill, among other things, hits a number of political hot buttons. Liberal groups have pushed for an expansive contraception coverage requirement on grounds of gender equality in health care. Conservatives generally consider it a violation of the First Amendment and an infringement on religious liberty. The statement released by the Catholic Bishops conference said the proposal requires ""careful moral analysis,"" saying it did not appear to offer clear protection for self-insured religious employers or religious and secular for-profit and non-profit employers. It came hours after the president briefed New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, head of the Catholic Bishops conference. Dolan later released a statement declaring ""while there may be openness to respond to some of our concerns, we reserve judgment on the details until we have them."" But 'today's decision ... is a first step in the right direction,"" he said. Under the proposal, there will be a one-year transition period for religious organizations after the policy formally takes effect on August 1. ""No woman's health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes."" Obama said at the White House. But ""the principle of religious liberty"" is also at stake. ""As a citizen and as a Christian, I cherish this right."" The president also discussed the decision with Sister Carol Keehan of the Catholic Health Association and Cecile Richards, head of Planned Parenthood. Some political analysts believe the controversy could cost Obama votes in politically critical states like Pennsylvania and Ohio in November, while others insist it will ultimately hurt Republicans with suburban women. Reaction to Friday's decision fell largely along predictable party lines. Democratic leaders embraced the revised rule, while Republicans called it inadequate. ""The rule announced by President Obama today guarantees that all women will have access to free contraception coverage through their employers, while protecting the religious freedom of faith-based institutions,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""I strongly support the rule announced today because in the year 2012, women should not be denied access to contraception. ... Whether women choose to use contraception should be their decision, not the decision of their employers or politicians in Washington."" Planned Parenthood's Richards also praised the decision, arguing that ""in the face of a misleading and outrageous assault on women's health,"" it ""does not compromise a woman's ability to access these critical birth control benefits."" But conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, insisted the revised rule still violates the Constitution. ""This ObamaCare rule still tramples on Americans' First Amendment right to freedom of religion,"" Jordan said in a written statement. ""It's a fig leaf, not a compromise. Whether they are affiliated with a church or not, employers will still be forced to pay an insurance company for coverage that includes abortion-inducing drugs."" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, said the revised rule ""simply pretends to shift costs away from religious employers, but it doesn't fix the problem and is another call for individuals and institutions to compromise on principle."" Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Friday's decision guarantees congressional action on the matter. ""The Constitution does not compromise; those rights are inalienable and cannot be bartered away for political expediency and convenience,"" he said. ""The administration has simply reaffirmed that congressional action to permanently reverse this mandate is necessary."" Published polls show a slight majority of U.S. Catholics actually favored the administration's original proposed rule. ""I think (Obama's) punting, just kicking the can down the road,"" Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenkis told CNN. ""He's hasn't really addressed our concerns. I think the only thing to do is... to take back the whole thing."" Sister Keehan from the Catholic Health Association said she was ""very pleased"" with the White House. Sources familiar with White House thinking on the matter have said the administration is convinced approval from conservative Catholics is out of reach, and is trying to win over more progressive Catholics. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the administration was deeply divided over how to handle the issue. Vice President Joe Biden -- who is Catholic -- and former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warned Obama about the possibility of negative political repercussions in swing states if the White House moved ahead with the initial rule. Several female members of the administration -- including Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius -- urged the president to move forward with the initial rule, Bloomberg said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied the report, though he declined to offer any details. ""A lot of these accounts are overdramatized,"" a senior administration official insisted Friday. On the presidential campaign trail, GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney pledged earlier to eliminate the original version of the rule on his first day in office. Both the White House and Romney's Republican opponents, however, noted a Massachusetts law in effect while Romney was governor that required hospitals -- including Catholic ones -- to provide emergency contraception to rape victims. It's ironic for Romney to criticize ""the president for pursuing a policy that is virtually identical to the one that was in place when he was governor of Massachusetts,"" Carney said Wednesday. Romney, in turn, said Carney needs to ""check his history."" In 2005 then-Gov. Romney vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals -- including Catholic hospitals -- to provide emergency contraception. The heavily Democratic state legislature overrode his veto. According to news reports at the time, Romney initially said his administration would not enforce the law at Catholic hospitals. But he later reversed course, saying all hospitals would have to supply the morning-after pill. Romney was quoted at the time as saying, ""My personal view in my heart of hearts is that people who are subject to rape should have the option of having emergency contraception or emergency contraception information."" ""I worked very hard to get the legislature to remove all of the mandated coverages, including contraception,"" Romney told reporters Wednesday. This ""was a provision that got there before I did, and it was one that I fought to remove."" CNN's Alan Silverleib, Dan Lothian, Dan Gilgoff, Eric Marrapodi, Deirdre Walsh, Jessica Yellin, Brianna Keilar, Paul Courson, Ted Barrett, and Dana Bash contributed to this report .","NEW: Catholic bishops group says the president's new plan is a ""needless government intrusion""

"(CNN) -- The Pro Football Hall of Fame is about to get a lot bigger. The hall's selection committee on Saturday -- meeting in New Orleans, on the eve of Super Bowl XLVII -- selected six former players and one coach to join the ranks of the NFL's best. They were all bigger than life, literally and figuratively, in their heydays -- from towering, 6-foot-9 inch Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden to the ""Big Tuna,"" the moniker given to legendary and well-traveled coach Bill Parcells. ""Surreal. Speechless,"" Ogden said, on his Twitter page, moments after the announcement. ""Still can't believe it."" The original Raven -- as the team's first draft pick after it relocated from Cleveland to Baltimore -- literally stands above everyone else in the Class of 2013, by virtue of his height and 345-pound frame. On the field, the UCLA grad stood out enough to be named All-Pro six times and earn Pro Bowl honors in 11 of his 12 seasons. Another big name, and big personality, who will be joining him is Warren Sapp. The University of Miami product terrorized linemen and quarterbacks while racking up 96.5 sacks over his 13-year career with the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, although some better know him for his brash trash-talking, wide smile and love for the camera, including on the 2008 season of ""Dancing With the Stars."" ""Warren played the game with incredible ability and passion,"" Buccaneers co-chairman Bryan Glazer said of the 1999 Defensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl XXXVII champ. ""He ... helped to redefine the tackle position."" Two other defensive stars will be joining Sapp in the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. One is another defensive tackle, Curley Culp, who made six Pro Bowls during his 14 seasons between 1968 and 1981 with the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions. Going farther back in NFL history is linebacker Dave Robinson, who amassed 27 interceptions in his career, much of it with Vince Lombardi's great Green Bay Packer teams. After narrowly missing out in recent years, wide receiver Cris Carter finally will make the trip to Canton -- just 120 miles from where he first emerged at Ohio State University. In his 16 NFL campaigns, most of them with the Minnesota Vikings, he was consistently among the league's top wideouts with eight straight seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards and 130 total touchdowns. His selection stirred rejoicing among Vikings' fans, with team owner Zygi Wilf calling the current ESPN analyst ""one of the most beloved players in franchise history."" ""In terms of catching the football, I haven't seen anybody in my time better than Cris Carter,"" former Vikings assistant and Indianapolis Colts head coach Tony Dungy said, according to the Vikings' official website. Just over five years ago, Larry Allen was a dominating presence with the San Francisco 49ers, with whom he played after 12 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. Now the mammoth offensive lineman -- measuring in at 6 feet, 3 inches and 325 pounds -- has another honor to his name as a hall of famer, in addition to having been named to the NFL's All-Decade teams for the 1990s and 2000s. ""Larry is one of the greatest players in Cowboys history, and arguably the very best guard to ever play the game,"" said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, whom Allen has tapped to give his induction speech. Parcells is this year's other honoree, a man who never played in the NFL though he nonetheless became one of the league's most recognizable names in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. A graduate of Wichita State University, he was drafted in the seventh round by the Detroit Lions but opted for a carer in coaching. He took stints at several universities before jumping to the NFL. Parcells led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles, then took the New England Patriots to the title game in January 1997 (where they lost), before finishing up his career with stops with the New York Jets, Cowboys and Miami Dolphins. ""Bill Parcells has been thought of as one of the all-time greats for a long time, so it is with great pride that we can officially refer to him as a Hall of Famer,"" said Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who coached under Parcells with the Giants and Jets before succeeding him in New England. ""He deserves all the recognition he is getting."" The seven inductees were chosen Saturday by the Pro Football Hall of Fame's selection committee from a list of 17 finalists -- with late longtime Cleveland Browns and Ravens owner Art Modell, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis and wide receiver Tim Brown among those narrowly missing the cut. The honorees will be enshrined on August 3, in a ceremony expected to include 130 others who have been so honored over the past 50 years. Already blown away by his name being called, Ogden said he expects the feeling will only get better when he gets to Ohio, according to a story on the Ravens' official website. ""It will be one of the best moments of my life,"" he said.","NEW: Bill Belichick lauds his ex-boss and 2013 inductee Bill Parcells as an ""all-time great""

"(CNN) -- For as long as we've watched television, we've talked about it. And thanks to social media, in the past few years we've moved our living room discussions and chit-chats around office water coolers to the wider digital world. Viewers now take to Facebook to exchange their views with friends, and shows frequently broadcast their suggested Twitter hash-tag over opening credits. Viewers of X Factor can even tweet their vote for contestants, and in the United States characters from Glee have their own Twitter accounts on which they tweet, as the show is broadcast. For producers and broadcasters, who are increasingly aware of the benefits of an online buzz, encouraging this kind of real-time viewer interactionâ€” or ""social television""â€”is increasingly important. And for social media companies, any tie-in with television can only be advantageous. A recent Deloitte survey showed that the British still spend 12 times more time watching BBC1 or ITV1 (the UK's largest television channels) than they do looking at Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. They also consume television in significantly longer sessions. However the two sources are increasingly being consumed simultaneously. Numerous studies have discovered that up to 80% of television viewers of all ages now incorporate a ""second screen"" -- laptop, smartphone or tablet computer- into their viewing habits. Apps, such as Zeebox, have recently hit the market, designed to facilitate this new merging of multiple sources. Zeebox determines what show is currently being viewed and then provides streams from relevant social media, as well as offering targeted links to spin-off products, and background information about the actors, music or writers drawn from online resources. According to the marketing campaign, the app allows its users to ""sit together on a virtual couch... even though you may not be in the same place together."" Simultaneously, the broadcasters can hawk their wares and generate additional e-commerce revenue. Social media company Live Talk Back has a similar app named Tellybug, and has also built a social media platform specifically for X Factor. This includes a ""tap and clap"" facility, through which viewers can virtually boo or clap an act at the touch of a button, without even the need to construct a 140-character response. In the app's first five weeks in operation, there were more than 100 million claps or boos. While X-Factor, remains by far the biggest regular hitter when it comes to TV-related tweets in the UK -- 3.7 million of the 38.7 million made about shows broadcast free-to-air on British television from April 1 to November 1 this year -- it is not just entertainment shows getting in on the act. According to research by Live Talk Back, the list of the top 20 tweeted shows also includes news and current affairs programs, as well as sports coverage including Wimbledon and Formula One. By transforming broadcasts into multi-media events, not only do the programs attract more viewers, but also the necessity grows among the audience to watch the first screening, or else be exposed to spoilers and excluded from the fun. ""If you're not playing along at the time the show is being broadcast, you both don't get to see what your friends are doing, and they don't get to see what you're doing,"" said Matt Millar, founder of Live Talk Back. ""You're much, much more out of the loop."" This community spirit means that broadcasters can guarantee to advertisers that their shows attract a real-time audience and cannot therefore skip the commercials. Media analysts are coy on the specifics of what is lined up next for social television. Robin Grant, of the social media agency We Are Social, hinted that there are innovations afoot surrounding the broadcasts of major sporting events. Meanwhile Millar said that he is talking with producers of more than 20 shows across all the major UK broadcasters preparing to enhance their interactive output. Millar said that he has encountered proposals for social media interaction with drama series, where an audience vote would determine plot twists and denouements, essentially turning television drama into a ""Choose Your Own Adventure""-style experience. This approach has yielded indifferent results in more high-brow pursuits -- recent attempts in collaborative novel-writing have largely failed -- but the advertising world has already embraced similar interactivity. The ""Adam and Jane"" advertising campaign for telecoms company BT, for example, invited viewers to decide the fate of their eponymous fictional couple. More than 1.6 million Facebook voters decided to bestow a child on the lovers and then also had their say on the minutia of the couple's wedding. ""We've moved on from a temporary aberration where, through the invention of the printing press all the way through to the invention of TV, communication became one-way for a few hundred years,"" Grant said. ""That's not the natural human state. Social media has brought us all back around the campfire and allowed us to talk to each other and to take part in the stories people are telling.""","Social media and TV are becoming closer entwined .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Of all the terrifying moments during Hurricane Katrina, one of the worst was when word came that the roof of the Louisiana Superdome was tearing away. During the storm and for days after, the dome was a refuge of last resort for people who had nowhere else to go.   It was an iconic image of the city itself, and it became a symbol of all that went wrong with the evacuation. The Superdome suffered severe damage -- 70 percent of its 10-acre roof was ripped away, revealing the metal framework underneath, and allowing oceans of water to flow inside.   Over 70,000 stadium seats were soaked, and water poured down over 2 million square feet of walls, electronics and furniture. Doug Thornton, senior vice president of SMG, a managing company in charge of the Superdome, watched as the city's crown jewel was shredded. ""There were projectiles that had actually been driven into the aluminum skin of the Superdome,"" he says. ""We were very concerned about debris falling from the roof. We had no water pressure. We had no ability to remove trash and debris, and we were taking on more and more and more people. The Superdome was literally the poster child for misery and suffering."" As the last of the storm's refugees were finally evacuated from the area days later, Thornton flew out in a helicopter and looked back across his own neighborhood to the Superdome, seeing an ocean of water the whole way. ""I didn't think there would be any way to come back ... not to the city, not to the dome, not to my home."" Still, within days, he and his staff returned, called in architects, and began examining the Dome to see if it might be saved. For a month, they crawled through the framework, studied structural components, and finally decided that a restoration could be attempted. Maybe a long shot, but possible. So mounds of debris were cleared. Anything that had been damaged beyond repair was removed, and the expensive process of replacing everything that had been lost began. The cost was staggering. A new sound system was put in for $7 million. Concession stands: $3 million. Video systems: $8 million. Phones: $8 million more. And on and on it went. All of this was happening under enormous time pressure. The NFL wanted the Saints to open their 2006 season in the Superdome, and that game was slated for little more than a year after Katrina. Work would have to proceed seven days a week. So Thornton is grateful for every break that came his way. The crews replacing the roof hoisted a ""No Hurricanes"" flag as a joke to stave off any storms that would delay their efforts. It worked. They finished more than a month ahead of schedule. Inside, all those soaked stadium seats were molding. They could not afford to replace them all, so they cleaned them, covered them in plastic, and for two months blew hot air beneath the plastic to thoroughly dry them and kill off any residual mold. That worked too. Only 20,000 were beyond saving. Thornton stands far up in the stands looking over the vast expanse of seats and shakes his head in wonder. ""If we would have had to replace 72,000 seats we wouldn't have made it."" But they did make it. Much remained to be done, but the Dome was declared ""football ready"" and filled with fans to see New Orleans' beloved Saints beat the Atlanta Falcons in the home opener. Since then, the Saints have, of course, won the championship of the NFL, making the whole comeback seem as if it were fated. Thornton knows better.   The work has continued nonstop for five years, and it goes on still. This is the largest stadium restoration project ever attempted in this country on one of the largest rooms in the world. When it is all done, it will have cost more than $300 million. And yet it is the small moments that Thornton remembers most as he walks the hallways, tending to this landmark of a beleaguered city.   Near one stadium gate, he points out a spot where every day during the crisis he saw an old woman crouching, helping tend to some children.   He says he still wonders, almost every time he passes, what happened to her. But just as he did with the Superdome itself, he hopes for the best, and works on.","Katrina ripped roof of NFL Superdome stadium as people sought shelter inside .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations may expand its role in Iraq, according to a new draft resolution the U.N. Security Council is considering. Damage is evident at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad in September 2003, a month after a deadly bombing. The resolution would expand the U.N. mandate in Iraq to include fostering ""regional dialogue"" on matters such as border security, energy and refugees. The United Nations also would work with the Iraqi government to ""resolve disputed internal boundaries"" and on ""planning, funding and implementing reintegration programs for former combatants."" A copy of the draft, which CNN obtained Thursday, calls for the extension of the mandate for another year after the current one expires next week, on August 10. U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey had no comment on the draft. The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq has had a limited role in the country since 2003, when it greatly scaled down activities after two bombings at its Baghdad headquarters. Currently, the mandate calls for the mission to ""play a leading role"" in helping the government with its electoral machinery and constitutional development. It is also mandated to advise on promoting human rights, working toward national reconciliation, developing civil and social services, coordinating development and aid, and planning on a ""comprehensive census."" The draft calls for these roles to continue, but would expand the mandate to include other activities. It calls on the mission to promote a ""national dialogue and political reconciliation"" process that would be ""inclusive."" The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq also would be charged with promoting ""the development of effective civil and social services"" and implementing programs ""to improve Iraq's capacity to provide essential services for its people."" The resolution also mandates ""active donor coordination of critical reconstruction and assistance programs through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq,"" an agency created by the World Bank and the United Nations. The draft resolution calls for the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq to help the government with the ""safe, orderly and voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons, including coordinating and delivering humanitarian assistance in Iraq and coordinating with agencies providing assistance in states hosting Iraqi refugees."" It calls for a partnership between Iraq and the international community that would help the country foster ""peace, sound governance and economic reconstruction."" The draft says ""security is essential"" for U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq to perform its duties. The top U.N. envoy to Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others were killed in an August 2003 bombing at U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. After a second bombing that year and attacks against humanitarian workers, then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan removed all U.N. international staff from Iraq.

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be the Copa del Rey semifinal showdown between Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and his Barcelona nemesis Lionel Messi. But the two superstars, who have scored 77 goals between them in all competitions this season, were overshadowed by a man making his very first start in a Clasico matchup in Madrid Wednesday. Real defender Raphael Varane might only be 19, but he capped a hugely impressive performance with a dramatic equalizer to ensure his side will travel to the Camp Nou next month level at 1-1 with every chance of making the final. Messi sets up 'El Clasico' clash . The Frenchman, playing at the heart of the Real defense, made a whole host of challenges and tackles to help Jose Mourinho's side claim a draw from an enthralling first leg encounter. That result looked in doubt for some time once Cesc Fabregas had fired the visitor ahead early in the second half with the Catalans going on to create a whole plethora of chances. Xavi Hernandez hit the crossbar in the first half and had another effort brilliantly blocked on the line by Varane as Barcelona threatened to take control of the 223rd clasico. Austerity gives El Clasico new twist . But the league leaders finally made the breakthrough six minutes after the interval when Cesc Fabregas latched onto Leo Messi's pass and slotted the slotted the ball home. Real, which is 15 points behind Barcelona in La Liga, had chances of its own and Ronaldo somehow headed wide from three yards when he looked certain to score. Pedro should have punished Real further when he burst clear with 17 minutes remaining, but he inexplicably prodded his effort wide of the far post with just the goalkeeper to beat. Messi trumps Ronaldo . And Real took full advantage of Barcelona's wasteful nature as Varane headed home Mesut Ozil's cross with nine minutes remaining. There was still time for stand-in goalkeeper Diego Lopez to deny Jordi Alba a late winner but Barca was forced to settle for a draw and a crucial away goal. ""These games are always very tough,"" Fabregas told Spanish television. ""Considering how the march went the result could have been more favourable from our point of view. ""But we will be at home for the return leg in front of our own fans. We are in a good rhythm and having a spectacular season."" The two teams will contest the second leg at Camp Nou on February 26. More woe for Chelsea boss Benitez . In the English Premier League, Chelsea manager Rafael Benitez was forced to watch on in horror as his side threw away a two goal lead to draw 2-2 at relegation threatened Reading. Juan Mata and Frank Lampard had put the visitor in a commanding position with just 24 minutes of normal time remaining. But Reading's super sub Adam Le Fondre scored twice in the last three minutes to snatch a point for his side. Manchester United extended its lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points with a 2-1 win over Southampton. After falling behind early on at Old Trafford to Jay Rodriguez's effort, United hit back thanks to two goals from Wayne Rooney. Real Madrid, Barca or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Arsenal came from two goals down to claim a point in a thrilling 2-2 draw against Liverpool. Luis Suarez and Jordan Henderson had give Liverpool at two goal lead in London but strikes from Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott ensured the spoils were shared. But there was bad news for Arsenal after it was confirmed that defender Kieran Gibbs will be out of action for up to three weeks with a thigh injury. Elsewhere, Tottenham was held to a 1-1 draw at Norwich, Fulham defeated West Ham 2-1 and Everton saw off West Bromwich Albion by the same scoreline. Lazio charged with racist fan behavior . Meanwhile, Italian club Lazio has been fined $190,000 by UEFA after its Europa League games with Tottenham and Maribor were marred by racist chanting. Lazio was hit with a $122,00 punishment after sections of its support sang ""Juden Tottenham"" (""Tottenham Jews"" in German) at the visiting fans, whose club has a historical Jewish connection. They also held up a banner which read ""Free Palestine"" during the game on November 22 last year. Tottenham was also fined $13,500 for crowd disturbances in the same fixture. Lazio had previously been fined $54,500 by UEFA after monkey chants were directed at Tottenham players during the reverse fixture in London in September. Anti-semitic chanting mars Lazio game .

"(CNN) -- Authorities captured a convicted murderer whom Chicago authorities mistakenly released from custody. Steven Robbins, 44, convicted of a 2002 murder in Indianapolis,had been on the run for three days before he was captured in Illinois Friday night. After interviewing Robbins' family and friends, they were able to determine where he was, the Cook County Sheriff's Department said. They captured Robbins in the city of Kankakee, about 60 miles away from Chicago. A solemn-faced Robbins, dressed in blue jeans and spotless new shoes, was photographed by Cook County authorities after his arrest and before he was put into a police car. This saga started on Tuesday when Robbins was taken from an Indianapolis prison to Illinois for a court hearing on unrelated weapons and drug charges, according to the Indiana Department of Correction. Both of those charges were dropped and Robbins was supposed to be returned to the Indiana prison to continue serving his 60-year sentence for the murder. That did not happen. During the manhunt, authorities released one clue that they said may help in the search. On the right side of his neck, there's a tattoo that says ""Nicole."" It was unclear Thursday whether Nicole was instrumental in the apprehension or lived in the area where Robbins was captured. Robbins was convicted in the May 2002 shooting death of a 21-year-old man who tried to stop a street fight between Robbins and his wife Nicole Robbins, according to court documents. In Session's Kisa Santiago contributed to this report.","Steven Robbins was serving a 60-year prison sentence for murder .

"(CNN) -- Football's big game is coming to the small screen. For the first time ever the Super Bowl, along with some postseason NFL games, will be streamed online and through the league's mobile apps, the NFL and partner Verizon Wireless announced Tuesday. The upcoming wild card games, the Pro Bowl and the Super Bowl -- TV's most-watched annual event -- will be streamed for free to computers on NFL.com and NBCSports.com. NBC's live stream will run different ads from those on TV, but Super Bowl viewers will be able to pull up the TV commercials on demand through the website shortly after they air, an NBC Sports spokesman said. On phones and tablets, Verizon is the only cellular carrier that offers NFL games through an exclusive deal. Verizon smartphones with a high-speed 4G LTE data plan can stream the games through the NFL Mobile app for free, a spokeswoman for the carrier said. Mobile devices with 3G service, such as the iPhone, iPad or older smartphones, require a $10-per-month Verizon Video subscription, she said. The NFL does not stream most games for free during the regular season. NBC began streaming Sunday Night Football games through its sports website three years ago. NBC announced last week that it had extended its contract with the NFL through 2022. The playoffs start on January 7. The Super Bowl will be played on February 5 in Indianapolis.","The NFL's wild-card playoff games, Pro Bowl and Super Bowl will be streamed online .

"(CNN) -- A room with a commanding view demands attention. Some of the world's most desirable lodgings are clifftop aeries that transport guests far above the fray, affording unobstructed panoramic views and an unparalleled sense of privacy without the feeling of total isolation. Cliff dwellings have historically offered attributes that lowland abodes can't match. As far back as A.D. 600, the Anasazi people, who once lived in what is now the American Southwest, built precipitously high in the sandstone cliffs -- likely for protection from enemies. In medieval times, as barbarian hordes wreaked havoc across Europe, monastery towns perched high up on the Amalfi Coast afforded excellent vantage points from which to observe the gathering militias. (Today the cliffs are more likely to attract armies of jet-setting moguls.) In peaceful times, a clear view from high atop a cliff was deemed spiritual, bringing pilgrims closer to God. Departures: Stunning hotel dining room views . There is also something utterly romantic about waking up to uninterrupted ocean views, especially when the waters in question are as captivating as the ones surrounding our seven choices. Nothing beats the bird's-eye perspective one gets when admiring the vast Indian Ocean from 1,000 feet above at the Bulgari Resort in Uluwatu, Bali, or the moody Bay of Naples, 1,000 feet below the Caesar Augustus in Capri. Rarefied air, indeed. Hotel Caruso Belvedere, Amalfi Coast . Breathtaking views were not what the founding fathers of Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, had in mind: The town was hacked from the cliff during the fifth century to protect its citizenry from barbarian hordes. Perched on the Monti Lattari mountain range, Hotel Caruso Belvedere takes in picture-postcard Mediterranean views of the city of Salerno and Amalfi Bay, a sheer 1,150 feet below. Walking paths connect the hotel to the seaside town of Amalfi, and (fortunately) a free shuttle is available for the uphill climb. Rooms, from $852 (includes breakfast, lunch or dinner); 2 Piazza San Giovanni del Toro; 39-089/858-801. Departures: 10 stunning hotel penthouses . Aman Resorts Amankila, Bali . A three-tiered pool that echoes the region's rice paddies forms an extraordinary centerpiece at Amankila, the iconic resort that architect Edward Tuttle designed to take in the full splendor of the Lombok Strait. A paved path descends 75 feet from the hotel to the beach club, which features a 134-foot lap pool set amid a grove of coconut palms and shaded by a giant frangipani tree. Even the library maximizes the dramatic setting, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the top tier of the main pool. Suites, from $950; 62-363/41333. Birkenhead House, Hermanus, South Africa . The unassuming exterior of Birkenhead House, just 100 miles southeast of Cape Town, conceals a hotel built around a central pool that cascades down to the clifftop restaurant and plunge pool. Though the cliff itself isn't particularly high, staying here is like having dress-circle seats to the best show in town: the region's most idyllic swimming beaches, VoÃ«lklip and Kamma Bay, are home to calving whales from June till November. At the base of the cliff, a six-mile path from Birkenhead House leads into town, and the hotel offers a shuttle for the return trip. Rooms, from $520 a person (includes all meals); 11th St. and Seventh Ave.; 27-28/314-8000. Bulgari Resort Uluwatu, Bali . The Italian luxury house's second resort, located on the rugged Bukit Peninsula at the southern tip of Bali, in an area that was once royal hunting grounds, makes the most of its drop-dead-gorgeous location. From nearly every point -- the glamorous, ultra-private suites tucked into the terraced hillside; the elegant Sangkar restaurant; the vast horizon pool and spa -- guests are treated to unforgettable vistas of the Indian Ocean. A glass elevator makes the 500-foot journey down the cliff face, stopping off at La Spiaggia restaurant and the Beach Club. The mile-long beach cannot be accessed by land or sea (a reef prevents boats from mooring), which makes for the ultimate secluded cove. The only visitors you're likely to encounter are friendly dolphins. Villas, from $1,000; 62-361/847-1000. Departures: World's most opulent villas . The Caves, Negril, Jamaica . At the westernmost tip of Jamaica rises the honeycombed cliff of natural limestone caves after which this hotel is named. The 12 villas are built into the rock shelf with expansive views over the impossibly blue Caribbean Sea, facing west to absorb Jamaica's flamboyant sunsets. Some villas have steps leading down to swimming platforms, and jumping platforms offer braver guests the chance to take the plunge from 30 feet up. Rooms, from $385; Lighthouse Rd.; 800-688-7678. The Chanler, Newport, Rhode Island . The wealthy industrialists who populated Bellevue Avenue in Newport no doubt appreciated the sea breezes and views, but it was their vast employee base that really took in the panoramic splendor. Staff members weren't allowed on the main street, so the three-and-a-half-mile-long Cliff Walk (which backs the mansions) was developed as a servant path. The only hotel on this storied footpath is The Chanler, a Civil War-era mansion built by former New York congressman John Winthrop Chanler. Gourmet meals at the hotel's Spiced Pear restaurant come with a side dish of attention-grabbing Atlantic Ocean vistas, while breakfast on the terrace offers a sweeping panorama of Easton's Beach and a daily parade of runners soaking in the million-dollar views. Rooms, from $489; 117 Memorial Blvd.; 866-793-5664. Caesar Augustus, Capri . Perched 1,000 feet above the Bay of Naples, the Caesar Augustus is situated on the side of Mount Solaro in Anacapri, a small hamlet located at the end of a 15-minute drive up a vertiginous mountain road, typically negotiated by convertible taxi. Almost every nook and cranny of the hotel offers sweeping water views, with the tiny town of Sorrento and, on a clear day, Mount Vesuvius, visible just 20 miles north. Reserve a poolside table on the Lucullo Terrace for a candlelit dinner with the Bay of Naples at your feet. Rooms, from $589 (with double occupancy); 4 Via G. Orlandi; 39-081/837-3395.

"(EW.com) -- Is ""Teen Mom 2"" headed the way of ""Jersey Shore""? The NY Post reports the reality show's ""days are numbered"" in the wake of erratic behavior by co-star Jenelle Evans. The series follows four women who became pregnant while in high school. The Post reports that Evans, following a stint in rehab, got married, became pregnant again, lost her baby due to a miscarriage and then publicly demanded a divorce in a profanity-laden tweet. Now the paper says the network is planning to shelve the show due to Evans' ""out-of-control antics."" But MTV insisted to EW the show's fate has not yet been decided. ""No decision has been made yet regarding a fifth season of Teen Mom 2,"" said a network spokesperson. ""But the network is planning to air the fourth season this year and will announce the premiere date soon."" With 3.4 million viewers tuning in for the show's third season premiere last September, there's no reason the show couldn't simply recast one of its contestants if the only issue was Evans. The network might also want to upscale its brand now that its investing heavily into scripted programming like ""Awkward"" and ""Teen Wolf."" MTV gave its original ""Teen Mom"" a series finale last year (then again, the network also dove back into the reality depths with Buckwild). Stay tuned... See the original article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- Just about every year, brilliant movies are utterly ignored by the Oscars. ""The Searchers,"" ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Breathless,"" ""King Kong,"" ""Casino Royale,"" ""Touch of Evil,"" ""Caddyshack,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""The Big Lebowski"" — the Academy has a long history of overlooking comedies, action movies, horror flicks, hard-boiled genre pics, artsy foreign films, and documentaries that aren't about World War II. This year, we'll be taking a closer look at films that were too small, too weird, or perhaps simply too awesome for the Academy Awards. These are the Non-Nominees. The Film: Affectionately known as ""Channing Tatum's stripper movie,"" the Steven Soderbergh film is about man at a crossroads: Does ""Magic Mike"" keep grinding his moneymaker to bank those singles he's saving to start his own custom-furniture business, or, does mentoring a fresh face (Alex Pettyfer) for his shady boss (Matthew McConaughey) make him see that he's losing more than he's gained and hang up his G-string for good? Why it Wasn't Nominated: EW's Owen Gleiberman gave the movie an A-, so we could pretend this had an actual chance to follow in The Full Monty's footsteps and garner a nod as one of the year's Top 10 (or nine) best pictures. But even with Soderbergh's name attached, no one wanted to take this film seriously. (Especially the people who paid to see it multiple times even though they thought there wasn't enough stripping and that Cody Horn, as Tatum's love interest, was way too wooden.) The real snub here is that McConaughey, who's picked up supporting actor honors from the New York Film Critics and National Society of Film Critics among others this awards season, didn't score his first Oscar nomination for playing narcissistic club owner Dallas. The critics remember their summer raves for McConaughey's commitment, but the buzz had faded by the time Academy members got to voting: Only one acting nomination this year came from a film with a U.S. release date before September, and that's Beasts of the Southern Wild's lead actress Quvenzhane Wallis. Another uphill battle: All supporting actor nominees this year have not only been nominated before, they've all won before. But perhaps the biggest mountain for McConaughey to climb was the idea that him playing a shirtless beefcake with a chill vibe and his eye on the prize (moving the revue from Tampa to Miami) wasn't a stretch. (We didn't penalize Alan Arkin for playing Argo's acerbic movie producer, did we?) 'Following' ratings grow in week 2 . Why History Will Remember It Better Than ""Amour"": This is the film that secured Channing Tatum the title of People's Sexiest Man Alive (and will forever make of us think of him when we hear Ginuwine's ""Pony""), but it was already legendary before that. There are multiple lessons here: . 1.) How Tatum turned what could have been an embarrassing leak — a video of him stripping in his younger days — into a film that's grossed more than $113 million domestically and sparked talk of a sequel and a stage musical. He didn't try to bury his past (as perhaps some of his reps wanted him to); He knew there was a story in the comically dark, seedy world of male stripping, and he used his experience to inform it. That kind of honesty and sense of humor wins you fans. 2.) Media tours can be fun, which we learned watching Tatum's remarkably game costar Joe Manganiello body-roll his way around town. That's also something we won't soon forget. 3.) Speaking again to McConaughey's snub specifically, just because a role seems a perfect fit doesn't mean you shouldn't get credit for making it your own. As we found out when we went behind the scenes of the stripping numbers, in the original script Dallas didn't even have a stripping scene. McConaughey wanted one, and knew exactly how it should play out: He'd begin by serenading the women from the stage with a slow song. Music supervisor Frankie Pine suggested she and McConaughey pen the tune with Martin Blasick, McConaughey's guitar coach. They wrote ""Ladies of Tampa"" in about three hours at McConaughey's hotel. ""The song is silly as hell, but Matthew swears it's gonna get nominated for an Academy Award. He keeps telling me I have to pick out my dress. And you know what, I am gonna submit it,"" Pine told EW before the film's June 29 release. After the song, McConaughey wanted to blow fire, smash his guitar, and strip to KISS' ""Calling Dr. Love."" Whitney Houston's bro talks sis and drugs . McConaughey worked with costume designer Christopher Peterson on designing his thong. ""Matthew didn't want to wear, nor did I want him to wear, just a spandex thong. There was a rock 'n' roll Western feel to his clothing, and he kept talking about this specific coloring that a certain horse has. It just started occurring to me that maybe we were talking about a horse mane and fringe. He liked that idea,"" Peterson told EW last summer. Fringe placement was another discussion. ""I started placing it at different places on the thong, and Matthew said, 'Right down the center,'"" Peterson recalled. ""Initially, the fringe was a little out of control. It was like a horse's mane. We trimmed it back and trimmed it back. When those pants came off and the silver and black patent fringe started catching the light, the reaction was IN-SANE."" As for the actual moves for the number, McConaughey had ideas for those, too. ""He was so in it to be gross and raunchy,"" choreographer Alison Faulk told EW. He came up with signature moves, like the ""Lick It and Slick It"" (he licks his fingers and slides them down his pants). ""He was the one who had the most names for things, because we would call them out,"" Faulk said. ""I've never laughed as hard as I laughed watching him perform, only because it was so f—ing amazing. The women did not know what to do with themselves. The last thing he does in his routine is lie on the ground, and the girls were insane trying to tip him, shoving money in his G-string, and his G-string ripped off. He held it on with his hand. Nothing will beat that to me."" As Peterson said, when recalling that McConaughey's G-string also had a fringe tail, ""Matthew was out to outdo all the other boys. I don't know that he succeeded necessarily, but he certainly committed something incredibly memorable to film for all time."" See the original article at EW.com.

"(Financial Times) -- Nothing offends a Chinese employee more than cancelling the annual lunar new year party -- a rare chance to eat, drink and win a free iPad or iPhone, courtesy of the boss. But the austerity drive launched by the new Chinese leadership of Xi Jinping, coupled with the economic slowdown, has led government departments and state-owned enterprises across China to cancel or radically scale back new year festivities this year -- the equivalent of office Christmas parties in the West, but often far more lavish. Lunar new year begins this year on February 10, but banqueting season is normally in full swing at least a fortnight before. Some multinational companies say they are struggling to find any government officials willing to be wined and dined, as they scramble to respond to a fresh call for frugality from Beijing, part of the leadership's anti-corruption drive. Even private companies are getting in on the austerity act, with some opting to hold their lunar new year parties at fast food restaurants, prompting a backlash from employees on social networking sites. Everyone from caterers to florists, purveyors of fine Chinese wines to watches, report their revenues have been affected by the wave of asceticism. CIC, China's $500bn sovereign wealth fund, opted not to hold a new year party this year. One employee said: ""We have never been extravagant in our nianhui [new year parties], and actually had a really good year last year. I can understand if they wanted to do a smaller nianhui, but none at all is going too far."" PetroChina, the state-owned oil producer, said some of its celebrations had been cancelled or scaled down. Sinopec, China's largest oil refiner, said annual celebrations at its headquarters and at some of its subsidiaries had been cancelled. Two years ago, Sinopec claimed that its year-end party, which included comedy skits and singing and dancing routines by staff, was held to encourage the ""spiritual life"" of employees. In Shanghai, employees from branches of Agricultural Bank of China and Pudong Development Bank said their year-end festivities did not take place. One florist at Shanghai Chengzhuang Florist Company, which supplies flowers to hotels and restaurants where business is normally boosted by the parties, said that they were ""greatly"" affected by the cancellations and that their business had been cut by half from last year. On Sina Weibo, the microblogging site, one employee posted pictures of her company's year-end party at Pizza Hut, while another complained her company party at a five-star hotel took place from 9am to 11am and offered only the most meagre sustenance: ""No gifts, no lunch, no set plate . . . no tea or coffee offered. Everyone only got a mini bottle of mineral water.""

"(CNN) -- ""Innocence"" lay for 11 hours in the rubble of a building flattened by an aerial bombing Saturday until neighbors dug her out alive. ""What's your name?"" a medic asked the teenager while sitting her up straight on the gurney of an underground rebel hospital. It was a miracle that she suffered only some scrapes, bruises, a bloody nose and a broken arm. She was wide awake and talkative. ""Baraa,"" she answered. In Arabic, her name means ""Innocence."" Baraa and her mother lived near the National Hospital in Daraya, barely south of Damascus. The town, home to government ministries and a key military airport, is the scene of bitter fighting between rebel and government forces. Opposition fighters have dug in deep there with a system of foxholes, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's military has for weeks tried to smoke them out. Syria's 'urban refugees' struggle for survival . Baraa said she and her mother heard that al-Assad's forces were advancing and wanted to flee but changed their minds and hid in the basement of a building in town. ""Some people told us that the structure of the building was not that strong,"" she told the medics in a video posted by opposition activists to YouTube. ""But we stayed there for three days."" Rockets hammered the area every day, and Baraa learned that one of her neighbors had died. Then she heard a warplane soaring overhead. The rebels don't have that kind of military hardware -- captured tanks at best. Bombs thundered down nearby. Then all went black. ""The plane threw a barrel bomb on us,"" she said. ""The last thing I saw was a red flash like fire. After that, it was complete darkness."" She lay in the basement, buried alive in the building's rubble. The gruesome toll of deadly cluster bombs in Syria . ""How were you breathing?"" someone asked. ""I was hardly breathing,"" Baraa answered after a medic thoroughly scrubbed debris and blood from her mouth and nose. ""How many (people) were in the basement with you?"" ""30."" Children? ""About 14,"" Baraa said. ""The oldest was 11."" ""Did you have any siblings among them?"" ""Yes, three siblings: one 11 years old, the second was 9, and the third was 2Â½ years old."" All three died in that basement, she said. Twenty-eight people perished in all, according to Baraa. But Baraa is luckily not alone. Her mother survived, too. By day's end Saturday, 136 people had died in Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network. CNN could not independently verify the group's claim that 47 died in Damascus and its suburbs. Inside Syria: 'Is there a worse way to live than this?'

"(CNN) -- Alex Okosi left Nigeria as a young boy in the late 1980s to seek a better future in the United States. By the early 2000s, the music executive was carving a successful career with broadcasting giant MTV, holding strategic positions within the influential medial company both in the United States and Europe. Yet, Okosi never forgot where he came from. His dream had always been to promote his continent's diverse music scene and vibrant youth culture. In the mid-2000s, at a time when not many were convinced about his continent's economic potential, Okosi helped persuade his bosses to launch a dedicated MTV channel for Africa. Today, as the senior vice president and managing director of MTV Networks Africa, Okosi runs MTV Base, the company's first localized television service targeted exclusively at sub-Saharan Africa. ""We've ... been quite lucky in being able to create a brand that we have taken from our international stable and bring into the continent to be able to create content and experiences that people enjoy, localizing them to make sure that they cater to the attitudes and tastes of African audiences,"" says Okosi, now based in South Africa. Read related: Malian kora legend breaks music barriers . Born in the West African country of Nigeria, Okosi moved to the United States at the age of 12. He excelled throughout school, graduated with high honors in 1994 and won a scholarship to St. Michael's college in Vermont. He credits his mentor Midge Monte for shaping his character and showing him the value of working hard to achieve your goals. ""Midge was such an important an influential part of my life as she served as my guardian the last two years of my high school career and has since remained a huge part of my life,"" says Okosi. ""Midge also instilled in me the importance of hard work and commitment as one strives to be successful."" Okosi's determination and academic excellence helped him land a job with MTV straight after university. His talents soon started to shine -- Okosi worked both in MTV's New York and West Coast offices before moving to London to be part of the company's international strategy team. He first planted the seed of bringing MTV to Africa during a business lunch with the head of the broadcasting giant. Okosi was convinced about the power and value of the African market, but putting together a viable business plan was far from easy -- a lack of data on the size of the advertising market, coupled with infrastructure challenges, hampered Okosi's ambitions. Yet, despite all the challenges, Okosi was determined to succeed. ""I just focused on the fact that there's this great opportunity to do something that I believe would enable us and our youth culture to be projected in the most different way,"" he says. ""The excitement and the passion to do what we've been able to do completely overshadowed everything that was there to consider."" Read more: Guitar hero of the desert . Once Okosi's business plan had convinced his MTV bosses that a foray into Africa could be a success, his vision and dream were put to the test. The brand was well entrenched in the developed world but setting up shop in the continent had its own unique challenges. At first, he says, the quality of the music videos was the biggest setback. ""We had to up the game, we had to create a benchmark for what the quality was,"" he explains. As a result, the company started training producers, artists and directors in its key African markets how to shoot better music videos. It brought experienced international directors to work together with their African peers and also helped create free music videos for a number of artists. ""That also kind of helped create what we have today which is an incredibly exciting African music market where we're now having African music videos being played in London and the U.S. and across the continent, which is quite exciting.""

"(CNN) -- A forlorn and frightened pygmy elephant calf, reaching out its trunk to touch its dead mother. That's the heartbreaking scene local authorities came across recently as they patrolled the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve in northeastern Borneo. The mother was one of 14 elephants, the latest one discovered Thursday, found dead over the past few weeks in the forest reserve. Officials believe they were poisoned, though the cause of death is still being determined. ""Poisoning elephants is a very common practice in these parts of the world,"" said Barney Long, the World Wildlife Fund's Asian species expert. ""The elephants are usually poisoned with bait such as pineapple, palm oil or bananas. The poison is fast-acting and can kill up to a whole herd."" The purpose of poisoning the elephants: to make the land safe for farming. ""This is a very sad day for conservation and Sabah,"" said Malaysia's environment and tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, in a news release. Sabah, one of 13 Malaysian states, is home to Gunung Rara and the remaining pygmy elephants. ""The death of these majestic and severely endangered Borneo elephants is a great loss to the state."" Approximately 1,200 of the endangered pygmy elephants remain in the wild, Long said. The elephants like low-lying, open areas in Sabah where they can feed easily, but they have also been known to roam into plantations and villages where they cause damage and losses to farmers and villagers alike. Masidi said he has directed the Sabah Wildlife Department, which is in charge of the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve, to set up a joint task force with entities such as the Forestry Department, the forestry group Yayasan Sabah, the World Wildlife Fund and police to investigate these deaths. ""If indeed these poor elephants were maliciously poisoned, I will make sure that the culprits are brought to justice and pay for their crime,"" he said in the news release. The World Wildlife Fund, in a separate statement, said it ""is providing support to the Sabah Wildlife Department and is part of the special task force that has been set up by the department to further investigate the matter."" ""Our patrolling teams worked closely with the department in unearthing the incident,"" WWF-Malaysia's executive director, Dionysius S K Sharma, said in the statement. ""The central forest landscape in Sabah needs to be protected totally from conversions"" from forest to farmland, he said. ""All conversion approvals need to be reviewed by the Sabah Forestry Department and assessed not purely from commercial but the endangered species and landscape ecology perspectives. ""Conversions result in fragmentation of the forests, which in turn results in loss of natural habitat for elephant herds, thus forcing them to find alternative food and space, putting humans and wildlife in direct conflict."" Holistic, long-term solutions need to be put in place to address and mitigate the problem, Dionysius said. While the cause of the elephants' deaths is being investigated, the future of the little calf found by his mother's side is uncertain. The calf, now named Joe, is said to be in the care of the Sabah Wildlife Department, but officials hope to have him rejoin a herd as soon as possible.","Fourteen elephants have been found dead in recent weeks in Malaysia .

"(CNN) -- The 2010 television series ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty"" may not have lasted long, but fans might not be convinced that the clan has vanished from reality TV. That's because the family's latest woes are playing out in the public arena -- very much like one might expect from such a series. There is tension, drama, a reported scuffle and plenty of people tuning in (though in this case to Twitter) for the latest action. In the past few days there has been a dispute regarding the whereabouts of the family's 82-year-old matriarch, Katherine Jackson. Her nephew reported her missing and her granddaughter Paris has taken to her Twitter account to lament the lack of contact with her grandmother. Katherine Jackson has been the legal guardian for Paris and her two brothers since the children's father, Michael Jackson, died three years ago. Judge suspends Katherine Jackson as guardian of Michael Jackson's children . Other relatives, including Jermaine Jackson, denied that Katherine Jackson was missing and insisted she was resting on doctor's orders. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives closed the missing persons case opened for the elder Jackson after she was discovered to be with her eldest daughter Rebbie in Arizona. She has reportedly since called home. But the closing of the case has apparently not ended family tensions. On Tuesday, CNN obtained surveillance video which appeared to show Paris' superstar aunt, Janet Jackson, attempting to take the 14-year-old's cell phone from her. Authorities reportedly broke up a scuffle at the Jackson family home following that event. T.J. Jackson, brothers inspired by famous uncle . Now there is much speculation over whether the root of the issue is tied to the massive estate left in the wake of Michael Jackson's death, a 20% share of which belongs to his mother. ""Money always brings out the worst in people,"" said Bradley Jacobs, a senior editor for Us Weekly magazine. ""Michael Jackson was a hot mess in life, and things are still really messy in death."" Jacobs noted the great lengths to which the late pop star went to shield his children from just the type of publicity and notoriety that they are now immersed in. Jackson would often employ disguises for his children when they were younger, and very few details of their lives were shared. Paris, Prince Michael and ""Blanket"" (as the youngest is known) are now much more visible, and Jacobs pointed out that Paris' reported aspirations to be an actress mean she plans to stay that way. ""It's ironic given how Michael protected those children and kept them from the spotlight and now Paris is wanting that spotlight,"" he said. ""Paris is tweeting and people are learning from Paris."" Jackson family feud caught on tape . Rabbi Shmuley Boteach befriended Michael Jackson in the 1990s and is the author of the book ""The Michael Jackson Tapes."" Boteach said the Jackson family has long struggled with fame, and hence Michael Jackson went out of his way to try and help his children avoid such pitfalls. ""There's no question that fame took Michael's life,"" Boteach said. ""What Michael wanted in shielding his children was protecting them from all that had happened to him. He was denied a childhood, and he wanted them to have the most special childhood."" Boteach -- who said he has not been in contact with the Jackson family for years -- said he had high hopes for the children when Katherine Jackson first took custody of them because she is a deeply devout Jehovah's Witness. ""Religion means you focus on things that are larger than yourself and you subordinate your ego to something larger than yourself,"" he said. ""That's one of the remedies to the corruption of celebrity -- that there is something bigger than you."" Cooper Lawrence, the author of ""The Cult of Celebrity: What Our Fascination with the Stars Reveal About Us"" and the co-host of the ""Loose Talk"" podcast, said fans are fascinated by how the Jackson family dynamic is playing out because so many people have grown up with them. Katherine Jackson returns home after losing guardianship . As the next generation of Jacksons, Paris and her brothers are continuing to keep the public enthralled, Lawrence said. Paris, especially, has been very vocal on Twitter about the fact that she believes her grandmother was being kept from them and she refuses to stand for it. ""I follow Paris on Twitter which is so strange because she is only 14,"" Lawrence said. ""But I find her incredibly interesting, lucid and mature. I like that she doesn't just lay down and take it. She recognizes at such a young age that most of the adults around her are children and behave like children, and she's taken that role that she's the adult and she's calling them out on their immaturities."" Regardless of how the drama plays out, Boteach said he believes Michael Jackson's desire to leave a legacy in which children -- including his -- are celebrated and protected is being overlooked. ""If you look at his legacy now it's his music, which is beautiful, it's his concerts and it's this money that people are arguing over,"" Boteach said. ""I believe that some of this dysfunction would be alleviated if there was an agreement on what is Michael's legacy, and that was pursued.""

"Midland City, Alabama (CNN) -- Kelly Miller heard the gunshots, then the screams from the school bus. She could hear her children screaming: ""He's got a gun. He took a kid."" Outside, a gunman had just boarded a school bus, killed the driver and grabbed two children, according to authorities. One of the children escaped. The other, a 5-year-old boy, was not so lucky. The suspect then disappeared with the boy into a nearby well-stocked, underground bunker. Shaken community . By now, everybody in the small southeastern Alabama town of Midland City knows what happened. The story has been recounted at the grocery store and at the gas stations, where people trade the latest details about the hostage standoff that entered its fourth day Friday. It has thrust this town of about 2,300 into the national spotlight, with nightly reports recounting the hostage drama that has shaken this community known for its close vicinity to the ""Peanut Capital of the World."" On Tuesday afternoon, bus driver Charles Poland Jr. was shuttling children from school to their homes when he dropped Miller's two boys off and a man boarded the bus. He demanded that Poland, 66, hand over a child. Poland refused, blocking access to the bus's narrow aisle as at least 21 children escaped out of the back emergency door, according to police. It's unclear whether the suspected gunman was after a specific child on the bus. Police have said there is no connection between the suspect and the abducted boy, whose identity is being withheld. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley told CNN affiliate WMPI that he spoke with the child's mother shortly after the abduction and ""she was very distraught."" Police are tight-lipped about a possible motive, and have refused to divulge what, if any, demands the suspect has made to hostage negotiators. The suspect is holed up in a bunker 4 feet underground and built at least partially out of PVC pipe, authorities have said. An FBI hostage negotiator was communicating with the alleged gunman through a plastic ventilation pipe in an effort to end the standoff. ""They're taking time and trying to wear him out,"" said Police Chief James Arrington of Pinckard, who is familiar with details of the case. Bentley, the governor, said Friday that ""the right people (were) in place to work through this problem."" ""Patience should be a virtue ... we don't want to make any mistakes,"" Bentley told WPMI. On Friday, authorities confirmed what neighbors have been talking about and news outlets around Midland City have reported -- the suspected gunman's identity. He is Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, a Vietnam veteran and retired truck driver who moved to the area about five years ago. Local authorities releasted a photo of Dykes -- a gray-bearded unsmiling image -- along with his home address and a brief physical description -- white male, 6 feet tall, weighing 170 pounds with brown eyes and gray hair -- but provided no new details about any developments in the case. 'Take this' By all accounts, Poland knew the alleged gunman, at least in passing. On Monday, the day before the shooting and abduction, Dykes flagged down Poland while he was driving the bus to talk to him, according to Miller, who lives near the suspected gunman. While Miller did not know the nature of the conversation between the two men, she told CNN affiliate WSFA-TV that Tuesday morning, Poland offered the suspect a gift of eggs and marmalade as a thank you for clearing his driveway so the bus could turn around easier. Hours later, Dykes handed over the eggs and marmalade to Miller's father. ""He said, 'Take this, I don't want it,'"" she said. So when Dykes got on the bus Tuesday afternoon, it didn't seem unusual to her sons, Jesse and Jackson, she said. Neighbors have described Dykes as ""anti-government"" and abusive, with several describing run-ins, including one where they claimed he pulled a gun. Tim Byrd, chief investigator with the Dale County Sheriff's Office, told the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch that Dykes was a ""survivalist type"" with ""anti-America"" views. ""His friends and his neighbors stated that he did not trust the government, that he was a Vietnam vet, and that he had PTSD,"" Byrd told the civil rights group. ""He was standoffish, didn't socialize or have any contact with anybody."" Still, Miller said she can't reconcile the man she knows as her neighbor with the one accused of killing a bus driver and abducting a boy. ""I really in my heart don't believe that he intends to hurt that little boy,"" she said. ""I think that he may have something to say and he wants people to hear him. I'm not sure what that is. But I don't think he intends to hurt that little boy."" 'That's a hero' Even as authorities search for answers behind the killing and kidnapping, there is no question to Midland City residents that the bus driver was a hero. Poland was a gentle Bible-reading man who could not stand to discipline the children on his bus because it hurt his heart, the Dothan Eagle newspaper reported. He had worked as a full-time bus driver for four years, shuttling children between their homes and schools. ""There was a laughter and a love that he had for the kids,"" his brother-in-law Melven Skipper told CNN affiliate WDHM, reflecting on the regular conversations he'd have about ""my youngins'."" ""They were his youngins', when he had them on the bus."" The state's governor echoed that sentiment: ""He did his job -- he protected those children,"" Bentley said. ""He stood in that place, and when that man came to take two children, he said no. And he lost his life because of that ... he did his job, and I'm proud of him as the governor but I'm just proud of him as a human being."" Poland will be memorialized Saturday night at a visitation service, followed by his funeral Sunday afternoon at the Ozark Civic Center. ""You couldn't give nothing greater than your life for a kid or anyone else,"" Skipper said. ""That's a hero."" CNN's George Howell reported from Midland City and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Joe Sutton, Greg Botelho and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Governor urges patience: ""a virtue ... in dealing with this situation""

"(CNN) -- Rescue crews in the Philippines grappled with washed-out roads, downed power lines and poor communications in search of hundreds of people missing after a typhoon that killed more than 300. More than 180,000 people were left homeless after Typhoon Bopha raked the large southern island of Mindanao with heavy rains and sustained winds of up to 175 kph (110 mph). As of Thursday morning, the storm had left 325 dead, 411 injured and 379 missing, the Philippines National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported. Many of the missing were in remote highland towns. The storm wiped out the mountain village of Baculin and killed at least half of the residents of nearby Kinablangan, the official Philippines News Agency reported Wednesday. Bopha also severely damaged almost all of the homes in the villages of Boston, Cateel and Baganga, Davao Oriental Gov. Corazon Malanyaon told PNA. ""I felt like there was an earthquake because the winds and rain were so strong,"" said Herbert Yepis, a staff member of the humanitarian group World Vision working in Mindanao. Watch: iReporter captures Typhoon aftermath in southern Philippines . Bopha, known in the Philippines as Pablo, continued to work its way through the island nation Wednesday, making its fourth landfall in the northwestern province of Palawan, PNA reported. The storm had begun to move offshore by Wednesday afternoon, but continued to wash Palawan with heavy rain. It wasn't expected to fully clear the Philippines until Thursday. It left chaos and death in its wake. At one point, at least 319 people were missing in the Mindanao town of New Bataan alone, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported, citing Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas. ""Entire families may have been washed away,"" ABS-CBN quoted him as saying. At least 180,000 people were living in shelters, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the federal emergency management agency. The Philippine Red Cross put the number at 216,000. Fresh water is scarce -- ocean water has contaminated many wells -- and sanitation and hygiene are looming problems, said Philippine Red Cross head Richard Gordon. Are you there? Share your story . Bopha struck first and hardest on Mindanao, which is rarely in the direct path of tropical cyclones. Bopha's heavy rains set off sudden, violent floods in several parts of the hilly and remote region, washing away houses and dozens of people. The storm damaged 2,970 homes in northern Mindanao, wiping out nearly half of them, according to the country's emergency management agency. Bopha even thwarted some of the authorities' efforts to relocate people in vulnerable areas to safer places. ""In one case in Davao Oriental, the evacuation centers -- public buildings and schools -- were also victims of flash flooding,"" said Camilo Gudmalin, assistant secretary at the Department of Social Welfare and Development. ""And as a result, some people who were in an evacuation center died."" The storm damage and remote location of many of the affected villages made it hard for rescue workers to reach some victims, Gudmalin said. ""We have difficulty communicating with our teams because power lines and communication signals are down,"" Gudmalin said. The storm also damaged at least five bridges and nine major roads, the government said. Fishing boats were delivering relief supplies to some areas. The storm disrupted ferry services, and about 5,000 travelers were left stranded at ports across the country Wednesday. The national disaster agency warned that sea travel remained dangerous in places because of high swells. The storm brought back memories of Severe Tropical Storm Washi, known in the Philippines as Sendong, whose heavy rains swept away entire villages in the same region in December 2011. More than 1,200 people died in that storm, which caught many people off guard. This time, local authorities did a better job of relocating people out of vulnerable areas and preparing evacuation centers for Bopha, the Philippine Red Cross said. CNN's Sarita Harilela, Jethro Mullen and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 325 people have died as a result of Typhoon Bopha, officials say .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he was confident the UK would stay in the European Union, despite Prime Minister David Cameron's promise to hold a referendum on the topic. ""I am confident if there is to be a referendum, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and continue to shape its future,"" Monti said during his special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos Wednesday. Read more: UK warned against 'cherry-picking' EU policy . ""The EU does not need unwilling Europeans -- we desperately need willing Europeans,"" he said, noting a referendum would crystallize the issue. Monti said he was pushing to speed up the completion of the single market, which had lost pace after a successful launch 20 years ago. ""On this I agree with Prime Minister Cameron...that prosperity and growth be priority number one for Europe,"" he said. Monti also used his speech to criticize the country's financial record under predecessor Silvio Berlusconi. ""Italy in the past did not use the opportunities of the past to do reforms,"" Monti said. Should Britain stay in the EU? What would the impact be if it left? Send us your thoughts. The country wasted its surplus and ""lived under the illusion we could offer change without reforms,"" he added. ""This is what one can call promising reforms, and ending up with taxes and debt and a sovereign debt crisis."" The government chose ""the policy of status quo and procrastination,"" he said, and ""the costs of inaction were dumped were dumped on our children and grandchildren until the moment of truth."" Monti's comments come as the union's relationships suffer the strain of nearly three years of crisis with the euro, the common currency to which 17 of the 27 EU nations belong. Monti blamed ""short-termism"" for Italy's financial problems, which pushed the country's cost of borrowing above the crucial 7% level a year ago and put it in the center of the crisis. Medvedev: Russia is open for business . Monti is a technocrat leader appointed by President Giorgio Napolitano after the soaring borrowing costs -- and Berlusconi's colorful private life and tax scandals -- toppled the long-term leader. Berlusconi pulled his support for Monti's government late last year, triggering elections due in February. Monti implemented tough austerity measures and said his actions had pulled the country through the crisis, although more needed to be done. ""Today, the atmosphere around Italy has changed... I can feel Italy has gained back respect and confidence and respect for its ability to bounce back,"" he said. New year, same old problems? ""I think this change is a reward for the action taken by my government with the support of the parliament, most of all it must be a reward for all Italian citizens.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world thought the U.S. fiscal cliff deadline was December 31, but ""the fiscal cliff is (still) coming"", says Howard Lutnick, CEO of global financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. ""You're going to watch the U.S. do crazy, crazy things this year,"" Lutnick told CNN's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""The Republican Party that was elected to control Congress... (is) going to cross their arms and they are not going to raise the debt ceiling ultimately unless they get severe spending cuts, and the Obama administration is not going to give it to them."" If Congress fails to act, the U.S. and the world economy will have a ""dreadful"" 2013, Lutnick said. Following this week's PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of global CEO confidence, Lutnick appears to be one of the more than 25% who think the world economy is more likely to deteriorate in 2013. Despite Lutnick's concerns, on January 23 the Republican-controlled House of Representatives did pass a bill that would allow the U.S. Treasury to borrow new money through mid-May. President Barack Obama has said he would not oppose the proposal if it reaches his desk, although he prefers a long-term debt ceiling increase. Lutnick adds that to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, regulators need to actually address issues that caused it. ""What caused the credit crisis was just dumb lending. When you lend money to people who can't pay you back, you go broke."" Looking ahead to 2013, Lutnick says the biggest risk to global growth is the U.S. hitting the debt ceiling -- whether in the short- or long-term. ""Off the fiscal cliff we go.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan called on India Friday to investigate what it called repeated violations by Indian soldiers along the de facto border between the two nations in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Pakistan's Foreign Office summoned the high commissioner of India, Sharat Sabharwal, to its offices to protest the killing of one of its soldiers on the Pakistani side of the border known as the Line of Control. Opinion: How India mistreats Kashmir . Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani also demanded that the Indian government investigate recent clashes between the two countries in the Kashmir region. Jilani's call came just days after Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai summoned the Pakistani high commissioner to lodge complaints about the killing of two of its soldiers in the Kashmir region Tuesday. India and Pakistan have traded bitter accusations over allegations of repeated violations of a cease-fire in recent days at the Line of Control, increasing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Read more: South Asian rivals take baby steps to warmer relations . It began with a clash Sunday that, according to the Pakistani military, saw Indian troops cross the Line of Control and attack a military post. Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, Pakistan said. The Indian Defense Ministry, however, said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. Indian troops retaliated and forced Pakistani troops to stop firing, the ministry said. It did not immediately report the number of casualties. Read more: India says 2 soldiers killed in clash in Kashmir . That was followed Tuesday with allegations made by India that Pakistani troops took advantage of thick fog in a wooded area to cross over to its side of the border. The Indian military says one of its routine patrols spotted the Pakistani troops in the Mendhar sector of Poonch district, and a firefight lasting about 30 minutes ensued, during which two Indian soldiers were killed. The Indian government on Wednesday accused Pakistani troops of subjecting the two soldiers' bodies to ""barbaric and inhuman mutilation,"" calling the alleged actions ""highly provocative."" Pakistan denied the accusations, saying India was trying to distract attention from a weekend clash in the Himalayan territory that left a Pakistani soldier dead. Pakistani Taliban threaten to target India after execution of Mumbai attacker . The Pakistani Foreign Ministry rejected the allegations that its troops had crossed the Line of Control and killed Indian soldiers. The two South Asian neighbors have had a cease-fire along the de facto border since November 2003. But it has been violated repeatedly, with both sides accusing the other of offenses. Bilateral talks were suspended in 2008 after an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai, India's most populous city, killed more than 160 people. The negotiations have since resumed. The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan. Kashmir was free to accede to either nation. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the kingdom at the time, initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India, thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi. In exchange, India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue. The South Asian rivals have fought two full-scale wars over the territorial issue. Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan. A United Nations resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join, but that vote for self-determination has never been held. Pakistan wants that referendum to take place. India says that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks.","Pakistan's Foreign Office summoned India's high commissioner .

"(CNN) -- As the first female judge to be appointed to Botswana's high court, Unity Dow is a trailblazer in her home country, paving the way for other women fighting for equality and justice. Her 11-year tenure at the high court was marked by the landmark 2006 case where Botswana's Bushmen took the government to court over the right to live and hunt in the central Kalahari game reserve. In what is the southern African country's longest and most expensive trial to date, Dow ruled that the Bushmen should be allowed to return to their ancestral lands. The case attracted widespread international attention and came to define Dow's career at the high court that ended in 2009. Today, 53-year-old Dow is a partner in her own law firm, a successful author and a prominent activist championing women's rights. It's all a far cry from growing up in a dusty rural village on the outskirts of Gaborone, Botswana's capital. ""I was born into a Botswana where there was no tar road, no telephone. I think I saw my first refrigerator when I was a teenager,"" remembers Dow, 53. ""I grew up in a Botswana where you had to hold water on your head and hold firewood as well."" Despite the tough conditions and the initial objections of her family, Dow decided to pursue a career in law following advice from one of her teachers. After high school, she went to Swaziland to continue her studies before spending two years at Edinburgh University, Scotland, where she found herself one of very few women in the law faculty. While making her first professional steps, Dow says she quickly came across an innate gender inequality built into law. ""When you start to practice you realize how just the language of the law is so male, the culture of the law is so male,"" she says. ""You're beginning to think, 'I don't think it should be like this, I have a right to be here, I've earned the right to be here and therefore this whole environment should be about me as well."" Read more: In pictures: Africa's power women . Dow went on to work with great success as a criminal prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney in Botswana. But her reputation shot up in the early 1990s when she was the plaintiff in a groundbreaking case that dealt with citizenship rights through the mothers of newborns. ""I was married to a non-citizen, and therefore my children were born to a Botswana and an American,"" she explains. ""I was shocked to realize that in terms of the law my children were not Botswana citizens because I was not male."" Dow thought the law was unfair and embarked on a mission to make it unconstitutional. The long-running legal battle attracted huge media coverage in Botswana. ""Suddenly I was being unpatriotic by bringing this case, I was being un-cultural, I was influenced by my foreign training, I was not behaving like a normal nice wife,"" she says describing some of the comments directed toward her during the trial. ""There were times where I was really energized, feeling I'm going to win this battle; there were times where I really felt so despondent; there were times when I felt so angry, and I think I cried many more times during that period than any other time in my life."" But after five long years, Dow won the case, managing not only to change the law on citizenship and give men and women equal rights, but also influencing other laws. ""After that the government actually commissioned a study to say what other laws discriminate against women and over a period of time those began to be changed,"" she says. ""I think now in terms of the legislative framework, the legal framework, we have a fairly decent equality provisions across the board."" Dow also co-founded the AIDS Action Trust to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and the Women and Law in Southern Africa Research Project, an initiative aiming to empower women in the region. ""We did studies on child support and how culture influences the law on child support; we looked at access to property by women; we looked at widowhood and widowhood ceremonies, the extent to which they strengthen and you know undermine women,"" she says. ""It was really a chance to actually talk within southern Africa."" But when she's not fighting legal battles or promoting human rights, Dow is busy spending her time penning novels, exploring issues such as gender conflicts, the contradictions between traditional and western values and the AIDS pandemic. And now, after spending last decades studying the law and fighting for a more equal legal system, Dow says her next target is to join the political arena -- a move that will enable her to put forward her own ideas. Chart: Women in Africa's parliaments . ""I'm a lawyer and I've been a judge, but there's one thing that I have not done so far and that is to make laws,"" she says. ""I would love a plan to join politics and to run for a political office as a member of parliament and therefore join the legislature.""

"(CNN) -- Ready to jive, cool cats? Let's slide! ""Jackson 5ive"" ran as part of ABC's Saturday morning cartoon lineup beginning in September 1971. A heavily fictionalized representation of the Jackson 5's rise to fame and subsequent success, it was co-produced by Rankin/Bass (of Christmas special fame) and Motown Records. A relic replete with bell bottoms, tie dyed shirts and reel-to-reel tape players, the series has been released on DVD/Blu-ray by DreamWorks Classics. Every episode featured two musical numbers by the cartoon counterparts of Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael Jackson. The songs -- Jackson 5 staples like ""ABC,"" ""The Love You Save,"" and ""I'll Be There"" -- were woven in to the plotlines of the show, which experienced a renaissance in 1984 with Michael Jackson's rising solo career. Although the show didn't feature the speaking voices of the Jacksons because of scheduling conflicts, it was them singing. ""Jackson 5ive"" animation director Bob Balser had co-directed the Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"" film and developed the reputation as an expert in music videos. Balser said his most important contribution to ""Jackson 5ive"" was his insistence that the series not include violence. He was also adamant that the show -- one of the first cartoon representations of a black family --- be fair and not resort to cheap gags and stereotyping. ""When I came in,"" explained Balser, ""the series had been started. I was not happy with the approach they were doing because ... (this) was going to be the first series directed at young people that was about a black group, and I felt that it was really important that it be shown in a creative way, that they solved their problems with music and with intelligence and not with violence -- which had started out as the approach in the first episode."" Balser, now 85, attended art school at UCLA. After graduation, he traveled to Europe for what was supposed to be a six-month vacation. He wound up living and working there for 40 years, spending a decade in London, where he worked on ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Jackson 5ive,"" among other projects. He then ran a studio out of Barcelona for 30 years. ""There was a lot of influence from the stuff that we did in 'Yellow Submarine' in terms of interpreting songs in a creative, graphic way,"" said Balser. ""It was a Hollywood production done in London, and I brought in as much of a European flavor as I could."" Balser commissioned studios throughout Europe to work on the two songs featured in each episode. ""I got the best artists I could get and gave them complete freedom,"" explained Balser. ""I said, for example, 'This is a circus theme, so the graphics have to reflect that theme.' Other than that, they were completely free to do it however they wanted. We came up with some fun stuff, which was really one of the best parts and that was probably one of the things that made the 'Jackson 5ive' series so popular in terms of the reception that it received."" Most episodes featured the Jacksons driving around in their charmingly dilapidated jalopy -- with pet mice Ray and Charles and pink snake Rosie -- trying to please their manager, a cartoon version of Motown founder Berry Gordy. Gordy was never really the Jackson 5's manager, per se, but in the cartoon universe it worked, with him coming up with ideas for publicity. In one episode, the Jackson brothers take a plane -- with their jalopy tied to the aircraft -- to a concert similar to Woodstock and are pitted against evil lumberjacks planning to tear down the outdoor show's forest venue. In another, Marlon and Michael are accidentally drafted into the military and get their afros shaved off. In yet another episode, Michael is adopted by a female gorilla. Another strange theme was that a disproportionate number of episodes featured young Michael Jackson falling unconscious: . • On a flight to Hawaii, the five brothers crash onto an desert island. Michael gets hit in the head with a coconut and encounters a band of pirates. • In the episode titled ""Michael White,"" the future King of Pop hits his head in a bicycling accident and dreams that he is a hiding in a cottage where his brothers have become dwarf-sized, like in the story of Snow White. Michael bites a poison apple and immediately collapses. • In ""Michael in Wonderland,"" Michael becomes unconscious on a roller coaster ride and dreams he is in the Wonderland theme park. • In ""Jackson and the Beanstalk,"" Michael falls asleep and dreams that he has sold the jalopy in exchange for magic beans that grow a beanstalk outside his family's home (a la the story of Jack and the Beanstalk). The hectic turnaround schedule was a concern for Balser. ""Chuck Jones was the vice president in charge of children's programming at ABC at that time, and he was a friend of mine, and I got a message to him because I was really concerned, and I said 'What happens if I don't deliver?' Balser said. ""A few weeks later, one of his assistants came over -- we were working on some other things as well -- and we went out to lunch, and he said to me, 'By the way, I've got a message for you from Chuck: You do not not deliver.' "" Balser, who is now retired and living in California, says there have been vast changes in the animation field since the days of hand-drawn cartoons. ""It is losing something, because there's something about hand-drawn animation,"" he said. ""I don't know whether this is because I'm nostalgic for it or what, but as somebody said, 'The difference between hand-drawn animation and computer animation is, computer animation doesn't have a soul.' "" Of course, he doesn't think all is lost. ""There's one thing that hasn't changed, and that is communication, story, idea. When you're making a film, the basics still come down to: Did you have a good script? Is it well-presented? Once it's prepared, the technique of animation doesn't really make a difference anymore.""","""Jackson 5ive"" cartoon fictionally chronicled the brothers' success .

"New York (CNN) -- New York police on Sunday touted the impact of their much-criticized ""stop, question and frisk"" policy, claiming it has contributed to a spike in the number of firearms confiscated and coincided with what is shaping up to be a historically low murder rate. Comparing numbers from the first three months of 2012 to the same period last year, the number of such stops increased 10% while the number of illicit guns taken away went up 31%, according to a New York Police Department statement from Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Meanwhile, New York's murder rate has plunged 21% year-to-date as of last Friday -- meaning, if the current trend continues, the yearly number of murders in the city would be the lowest since such statistics first were recorded, as such, in 1963. ""New York City continues to be the safest big city in America, and one of the safest of any size, with significantly less crime per capita ... than even small cities,"" the department said. Police cited Operation Impact and the ""stop and frisk"" policy as key reasons for the improving crime statistics. But the policy has been criticized sharply by some as grounds for racial profiling. Donna Lieberman -- executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which has described the practice as ""unlawful and racially biased"" -- blasted the latest release of data, accusing the police department of trying to ""massage the numbers to make this look like an effective and worthwhile program."" ""What (this policy) does is terrorize moms of color about the well-being of their sons, who have to navigate how to survive unwarranted intrusion into their activities by a police department for doing absolutely nothing wrong,"" she said Sunday in a statement. Added Darius Charney, senior staff attorney for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, ""It is mind-boggling that, after years of public outcry and in the face of strong evidence that stop-and-frisk violates people's rights and does not make them safer, the NYPD has doubled down on this discriminatory and ineffective practice."" Another critic, City Council member Jumaane Williams, earlier this year questioned how the policy affects the police department's relations with minorities in the city. ""Communities are losing trust with the police, which is one of the biggest crime-fighting tools that we have,"" Williams said. Minorities are far more likely than whites to be questioned under New York's program, according to police department statistics. Of those stopped and frisked -- 93% of whom were males -- 54% were African-American, 33% were Hispanic, 9% were white and 3% were Asian. Yet the police department, including Commissioner Ray Kelly, has argued that the policy ends up disproportionately protecting those in minority communities. African-Americans and Hispanics made up 96% of all New York shooting victims and 90% of murder victims last year, police said. Therefore, a drop in such shootings citywide would logically equate to fewer minorities' being killed. New York police pointed out there were 124 murders this year in the city through April 29, compared with 158 in Chicago -- which, with about 2.7 million people, has less than one-third of New York's population. Those figures couldn't be clearly matched on the city of Chicago's website. Official crime data from Chicago did note 120 homicides in that city through April 20, while the Chicago Tribune's RedEye website recorded 169 homicides as of May 9. ""The continuing murder decline in New York is vindication of the NYPD's policy of engagement, which includes Operation Impact, police stop and questioning and use of the Real Time Crime Center to get timely information into detectives' hands as quickly as possible,"" New York police said in their statement Sunday. Civil liberties advocate Lieberman acknowledged progress regarding crime, but disputed the idea that this can be credited to ""stop, question and frisk"" -- or that such trends aren't evident elsewhere without such policies. ""Crime has gone down and stop-and-frisk has gone up, but that doesn't meant that stop-and-frisk is (the) reason for reduction in crime. It's gone down in almost every city in the last decade,"" she said. ""It's time for (Mayor Mike Bloomberg) and Police Commissioner Kelly to treat people of color as if they were their own families."" While 31% more firearms were recovered in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same stretch one year prior, only 13% more weapons total were confiscated, according to police statistics. That is because most such seized weapons are knives, at about seven times the rate for guns. The vast majority of those stopped, questioned and frisked walk free without punishment. According to data from 2012's first three months, 5% of those ended up being arrested and another 5% were served summons. Both rates are slightly below those from the previous year. CNN's Nina Ibarra contributed to this report.","NEW: Police ""massage the numbers"" to support ""stop, question and frisk,"" a critic says .

"(CNN) -- A friend of mine told me (when) I was 17 years old (that) I should sing opera because I had an interesting voice. I said: ""Oh my gosh, No! These fat ladies singing on stage!"" She gave me two Maria Callas CDs, I listened to them and I started to sing the high notes. I started to hear the orchestra and the emotion -- and the power to express so many different feelings through voice, through instruments, through feelings. That was the beginning. This talent I have got, I had to develop it, because it was a burning flame in my heart. When it started, I knew. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe different people feel that with love -- you just know it! I felt that with music and opera. Virginia Zeani, Ileana Cotrubas, there are so many great Romanian singers, but from my little town in the north, I think I was the first one. I come from Transylvania in the north of Romania. The city I am from is called Bistrita. My parents are very proud of me and so are other people in our little town. So I worked through the summers so I could get professional singing lessons and then I got into the music academy in Cluj where I studied for six years. When I finished at the music academy, Ioan Holender from the Vienna State Opera heard about me from a critic. He sent me an email (saying) that he wanted to hear my voice and from that moment on everything changed. I don't know the details about what the critic wrote -- it must have been something that made him curious. More from Human to Hero: Boxing's first female Olympic gold medalist Nicola Adams . The difference between one singer and another is of, course, the talent he or she got from nature. The color of the voice, yes you could say that, but the most unique thing, the thing that makes a difference, is sincerity. It's not that easy to open yourself to the audience -- to be sincere, to open your soul, to say, ""This is me with my talent, my insecurities, with everything I am. This is me."" Of course, technique is important too, but there are lots of singers with good technique who don't take enough time, maybe, to develop the other part -- the sensitivity. My technique is not perfect all the time -- if I am not sleeping enough or having problems and too many thoughts. You can't force your voice to sound the same all the time because lots of exterior things influence your resonance and your energy, and all that feeds into your voice. The voice is a very sensitive instrument. It's not that easy, it's not just going out there and singing and your voice comes out. It would be so easy if it was like that. Can you imagine how hard it is without a microphone to have the force and the power to sound through an orchestra of 80 people playing loud music? That's not normal, right? You have to be patient and focused and to love what you do and to understand there are lots of moments where you feel very down. As an opera singer you have to understand that going through those rough moments is part of the lesson, of development, of enrichment. Going through those moments, you can learn to inspire yourself. I inspire myself when I have to interpret a role where the character is very sad or very depressed. I think what I am doing to project that sound is connecting with something beyond this world. I just take a breath, and try to focus on one point. I can't push the sound out; it feels more like I'm just connecting myself with the universe. There are lots of times where I feel depressed or lonely or misunderstood and different. I don't have a normal life with family or a partner who can help me from time to time.

The most interesting thing (is) that we always work with new people -- new conductors, new musicians, new partners -- on a new repertoire or a new role. This is the most beautiful thing that keeps me awake and makes me discover more of myself, to want more. You can compare being an opera singer with being an athlete: Both have to practice a lot to focus on the distance. I also have to somehow know when I can hold myself back to maintain energy. Some days I practice three, four, five hours, it depends. Some days I'm just reading, going through the score. We are in the most beautiful and the most known theater in the world, La Scala in Milan.

"(CNN) -- Monday night's inaugural CNN/Tea Party Debate revealed more about the current Republican presidential field than we've seen in any previous debate. In the same way that the tea party has dramatically changed the course of national politics, this debate could change the course of the presidential race. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is strongly embraced by the tea party, revealed Monday night what one might call a moderate or liberal side on a number of issues, opening the door to potential conservative criticism or perhaps an embrace from moderates. Picking up where the last debate left off, the battle lines were drawn early over Social Security. CNN's Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in teeing up a Perry versus Mitt Romney showdown over Social Security reform. Perry stood by his original Social Security remarks, calling the program ""a broken system."" He promised seniors that Social Security would remain intact under his watch, but said it needed real reform. In response, Romney revealed a new aggressive and combative side that we've rarely seen before. Romney sharply attacked Perry's use of the term ""Ponzi scheme,"" saying it is over the top, unnecessary, and frightens people. In response, Perry calmly replied that rather than scaring seniors, it's time to have a legitimate conversation in this country about how to fix Social Security. Round one went to Perry, but it quickly changed after that. Michele Bachmann, founder of the Tea Party Caucus, was a crowd favorite all night. She moved to the right of Romney and Perry all night and made it a key point to emphasize personal responsibility over government oversight, winning loud applause from the crowd. While she refused to attack Perry's comments about the Federal Reserve, she pulled no punches when it came to his decision requiring girls to get vaccinated for the HPV virus -- saying it was ""just flat out wrong"" and ""a violation of a liberty interest"" -- and accused Perry of catering to big pharmaceutical interests. Sen. Rick Santorum piggybacked off Bachmann's comments and dealt some of the toughest shots against Perry all night. Santorum, a longtime champion of individual liberty, said Perry's decision was ""big government run amok,"" receiving loud applause. It was one of Perry's weaker moments, especially with the tea party crowd. Another tea party favorite, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, did well with the crowd. Gingrich continued his narrative against the mainstream liberal media and shunned any attempt to criticize his fellow Republicans, while playing smartly to the tea party's vision of shrinking government to match revenue, not raising taxes to catch up with government spending, as he said. The most revealing moments of the debate occurred as the dialogue shifted from economic issues to immigration and foreign policy. Perry found himself in the hot seat after staunchly supporting a Texas law that grants in-state tuition to the children of undocumented immigrants, saying that immigration is a states' rights issue. He also criticized a border fence as unrealistic, saying, ""The idea that you're going to build a wall from Brownsville to El Paso and go left for another 800 miles to Tijuana is just not reality."" Jon Huntsman railed against Perry, saying, ""For Rick to say that you can't secure the border I think is pretty much a treasonous comment."" Bachmann joined in and compared Perry's position on in-state tuition to the DREAM Act, supported by President Obama. And for the final blow, Romney said that Perry's immigration plan would only promote and encourage an influx of illegal aliens. The topic of foreign policy was left for second-to-last and given only a few minutes of consideration, but the responses were noteworthy, and somewhat discouraging. Perry found himself awkwardly agreeing with Huntsman's call to bring home the troops in Afghanistan, while failing to put forward his own substantive plan on the Afghan war. Many on the right will be disappointed in what they heard Monday night, a day after the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. In the end, tea party favorites like Bachmann, Gingrich, Santorum and Herman Cain were the winners, though polls may not move much. Perry was on the defensive all night and, despite his reputation nationally, he came across as ""liberal"" on some issues, criticized from the right on the vaccination issue, immigration, and Afghanistan. But some in the center might have warmed to Perry and some of his non-tea party stances. It remains to be seen whether his standing with conservatives will weaken -- at this point I doubt that it will. And once again, Romney was able to escape unharmed from a not-so-friendly crowd by shifting his attacks toward Perry and tacking away from some of his more center-right positions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: CNN/Tea Party Debate may change course of presidential race .

"(CNN) -- Since 17 June, Sudanese civilians have been demonstrating against the totalitarian regime that has ruled them for 23 years. Their protests against rising food and fuel prices have reportedly broadened into criticism of the corrupt National Islamic Front junta, rebranded as the National Congress Party. Predictably, the security forces are responding with swift and brutal force. Equally predictably, Sudan's leaders blame foreigners for fomenting the unrest. Read more: Hundreds tear gassed amid clampdown on Sudan protests . This is not the first sign of the Arab Spring in Sudan. Demonstrations last year were swiftly crushed, leaving citizens in no doubt they risked their lives if they challenged the decrepit status quo. Local journalists have been arrested and intimidated, and foreign reporters are harassed in an effort to stifle media coverage. Activists warn the internet may be unplugged by the regime at any moment. And yet, the demonstrations continue to spread. In a country rated as among the ten most repressive and corrupt nations by Freedom House and Transparency International, there is no freedom of speech or assembly. The stuttering economy is in the hands of the ruling elite in Khartoum and their cronies, and the regions have felt marginalized for decades. Losing a third of its territory, and most of its oil to the new South Sudan was the culmination of a disastrous policy of Arabisation ethnic cleansing. And the recent removal of price controls on essential consumer goods has tested the endurance of a stoic nation. More: Sudanese police crackdown on growing protests . Sudan's president, the indicted war criminal Omar al-Bashir, calls protestors ""aliens and bubbles,"" led by a few ""incited"" individuals. The mayor of Khartoum explains that Sudanese authorities have detected ""foreign elements"" organizing the marches. This is standard practice in Sudan: the Israelis and Americans are held responsible for stirring up the rebellious ethnic groups in the south, then Darfur and the east, and now along the contested border with South Sudan. In other words, the regime is never to be held to account for its calamitous foreign and domestic policies. More: Sudan, South Sudan prepare for peace talks . Over the years Bashir's speeches have routinely heaped abuse on the imperialist West with its dastardly, alien plots. In a region where few people know how to access impartial sources of news, and where many people are illiterate, it makes sense to play on their paranoia. It also helps rally a fractious nation around a faltering regime, united against an imaginary enemy. This approach is familiar to Bashir's close friends and ideological buddies, the Iranians, for the same reasons. A recent report on Sudan in a Tehran paper explains that all separatist groups, from the Basques to Tibet to Darfur, are part of a conspiracy organized by evil, colonialist powers. However, blaming foreigners also says a great deal about how Bashir and his supporters view their population, revealing their contempt for their citizens' intelligence. Their message is, in effect, ""You are simple people who are easily manipulated by outsiders, incapable of forming your own opinions."" Their iron control of all public debate is part of what psychiatrists call the ""infantilization"" process. Blaming evil foreigners also shifts attention away from the incompetence and corruption that has marked the Bashir regime. Instead of using years of oil revenue to develop the country and diversify the economy, it chose to wage successive wars against its own people in the name of creating a supposedly pure ethnic Arab and Muslim nation. Until recently Arab autocrats resorted to similar tactics to pacify the restive ""Arab street."" When people asked why their economies were so feeble, why their young men could find no work, their rulers responded by telling them about the iniquities suffered by their brothers in Palestine. Bashar al Assad has used the same strategy recently, blaming foreign infiltrators for the Syrian revolution; Gaddafi did the same, and in May 2012 Egyptian authorities banned several foreign NGOs including the uber-respectable and impartial Carter Center, accusing them of stirring up trouble. This shared narrative is based on embracing the victimhood of the Arab people, as if they are powerless to challenge fate. Yet, this is hardly an exclusively Arab syndrome: Putin uses the same approach in Russia, making the work of foreign human rights NGOs almost impossible. Read more: Malawi drops AU summit over Sudanese leader . One of the most joyful aspects of the Arab Spring has been watching citizens reject the notion that they are powerless victims, at the mercy of fiendish foreign imperialists. They have ceased to accept that there was no alternative but to submit to the inept and corrupt dictators who have ruled them. It has been a bumpy and bloody journey, but it often is when people take control of their destiny. Saturday, Sudan's ruling National Islamic Front celebrates 23 years in power. As demonstrations spread from the capital Khartoum to cities across the country, from students and intellectuals to the disgruntled unemployed, the system created by Bashir and his cronies is wobbling. But it is a system's survival at stake, not just a few individuals. The resilient Sudanese will soon see how much change is possible.","Since 17 June Sudanese civilians have been demonstrating against the totalitarian regime that has ruled them for 23 years .

"(CNN) -- When world leaders gather in Rio Wednesday they will be hammering out a new set of goals to measure sustainable development. This time it's the SDGs (sustainable development goals) -- goals which will influence a new development framework. But before we rush to embrace another acronym, we need to tackle a basic injustice left over from the last development goals -- access to reproductive health. Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned. Clearly this is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth - through something women want and need, the ability to decide when to become pregnant. More: Africa's birth rate: 'Why women must be free to choose' Rapid population growth puts pressure on economies as governments struggle to provide education and health services, yet in many countries around the world women still have little choice when it comes to childbearing. More than 215 million women in the developing world who wish to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy are still not using an effective method of contraception. This unmet need highlights just how far reproductive health and rights have slipped off the agenda: just at the time when it should be key to the challenge of sustainable development. Reproductive rights and health services not only provide immediate health benefits and reductions in maternal and child mortality, but helps end poverty passed on from one generation to another and lightens the burden on countries with few natural resources. Experience has shown us that educating girls, legal reform and access to family planning have made all the difference in many countries. While it's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families, the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories. In the words of Nafis Sadik, former head of the United Nations Population Fund, ""it is the freedom from which other freedoms flow"". The evidence continues to bear this out - family planning saves lives, contributes to the fight against HIV and AIDS and helps governments and communities achieve sustainable social and economic development. World Bank studies have found reproductive healthcare extremely cost-effective: an investment of US $4.10 per person could avert eight per cent of the global burden of disease. See also: Why family health makes moral and economic sense . Fully meeting the unmet need for family planning services would result in global unintended pregnancies dropping from 75 million to 22 million. This would result in 25 million fewer abortions, 22 million fewer unplanned births, and 680,000 fewer deaths among women and newborns. As a result, couples and individuals and communities will become more resilient - they will be better able to prepare for unpredictable events, including climate change disasters, and to adapt towards economic, social and environmental sustainability. See also: Mother's Day is not so rosy in Africa . That's why IPPF, the world's largest reproductive health and rights organization, will be vocal and visible at the Rio Summit. We will be lobbying for a clear road map for the SDGs and one that prioritizes women's representation, binding agreements on universal access to reproductive health and pledges to deliver those services. Ahead of the Rio summit, IPPF is making three positive commitments of its own to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of people in the world's poorest countries to increase their resilience to climate change. More: Road to Rio special coverage . Firstly we will meet the needs of some 120 million women by increasing our provision of services for the poorest and most vulnerable people by 50%. Secondly, we will work towards making comprehensive sexuality education available to the world's largest ever generation of young people have by 2020. See also : 7 billion reasons to empower women . Finally we will lobby governments for legislative changes to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive services by 2020. As climate change begins to influence our lives, it is the poorest women and children who again will pay the highest price. It is also women who can lead the changes required for increased resilience in the face of climate change and to enable them to do this we must meet their unmet need for health and education. We must now make up for lost time, investment and the opportunity. We need to hold governments and international agencies accountable for the commitments they have made -- financial, political and legal. This level of unmet need will expand as the world's largest generation ever of young people enter their reproductive lives - increasing demand for contraception by 40 per cent by 2050. This represents a crisis for health, human rights, and development. How can we hope for global sustainability and resilience unless we invest now in sexual and reproductive health and rights?

"(Financial TImes) -- The Netherlands has nationalised SNS Reaal, the fourth-largest systemically important bank in the Netherlands, at a cost to Dutch taxpayers of €3.7bn. The bank had spent the past several weeks in a desperate search for private capital to compensate for heavy losses in its real estate holdings, particularly in Spanish assets. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Netherlands' finance minister, said in a statement he had ""looked at every alternative involving private parties"", but found none that could guarantee the stability of the Dutch banking system. With ABN Amro still in government hands after it was nationalised in 2009, the nationalisation of SNS Reaal means two of the Netherlands' four systemically important banks are state-owned. The nationalisation, carried out under the Netherlands' 2012 law on bank intervention, will mean shareholders of the bank and subordinated debt holders will see their stakes wiped out. The state will inject €2.2bn in new capital, while forgiving €800m the bank still owed from its earlier bailout during the financial crisis. It will also write off €700m in the value of the bank's real estate assets. ""I can sympathise easily with the resistance many will feel because we again will need to use a large amount of public money,"" Mr Dijsselbloem said. ""This is why I want the private sector to pay as large a share as possible of the rescue of SNS Reaal."" In addition, the government will levy a one-time tariff of €1bn on Dutch banks in 2014 as a contribution to restoring the health of the financial sector. ""Politically speaking, that's very important,"" said Harald Benink, a professor of finance at Tilburg University. Ronald Latenstein, SNS Reaal's chief executive, as well as the bank's chief financial officer and chairman of the board of directors, tendered their resignations. SNS Reaal announced they ""could not take responsibility for the nationalisation scenario"". The finance ministry said the bank's management would receive no bonuses, and that salary cuts were to be expected. The nationalisation comes after the European Commission blocked an earlier plan that would have seen the country's other large banks, Rabobank, ING and ABN Amro, contribute capital to a so-called ""bad bank"" to house SNS Reaal's distressed property assets. In a blogpost on FT.com on Thursday, economist Heleen Mees noted that rating agency Fitch has warned it may downgrade the debt of other Dutch and European banks if a government rescue of SNS Reaal wipes out ordinary bondholders.","Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said he had ""looked at every alternative .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan's Toyota Motors has revved ahead of U.S.-based General Motors in 2012 to reclaim the title of world's biggest auto manufacturer. This week, Toyota announced global sales of 9.75 million vehicles, even beating its own forecast of 9.7 million. GM earlier this month had announced global sales of 9.29 million vehicles for 2012 -- about 460,000 fewer vehicles. The gap is ""fairly sizeable...about 5% or so,"" says Chris Richter, CLSA Senior Analyst, Japanese Autos in Tokyo. However he sees Japan's return to the top in 2012 as simply ""going back to the natural order of things"" after Asia's second largest economy was devastated by the 2011 quake and tsunami. ""It's not that General Motors did anything right. They got a free pass in 2011 because the other team (Toyota) wasn't on the field. What we saw in 2012 was a more normal situation in terms of pecking order of global sales."" ""In 2011, Japan had too many negative events which led to a shortage of (vehicle) supply,"" agrees J.P. Morgan's Kohei Takahashi, a Tokyo-based auto analyst. ""If there were no such kind of events, Toyota should (have been) number one (that year)."" With Toyota's return to the top, the question remains ""how does it manage to succeed"" just as its tech cousins in Japan have become infamous for hemorrhaging billions of dollars in losses. Panasonic in 2012 reported a record loss of $9.68 billion, while Sony reported a record $5.7 billion loss in last year's fiscal year through March. Meanwhile, Sharp Corp owes $31 billion to the banks. While a perceived lack of creativity and innovation plagues Japan's tech industry -- as well as a yen hitting post-WWII highs last year -- ""it has a lot to do with a difference in the nature of the auto and tech industries"" and a traditionally stronger emphasis on reliability and quality in the former, says CLSA's Richter. With tech products ""consumers are very price motivated. They expect a television to work for several years but when they want to change it they'll chuck it in the bin. But if you buy a new car, you expect it'll work every day you own it and when you resell it you want it to hold its value,"" he adds. For Japanese automakers, ""perfection and quality of the product matter a lot."" Toyota and GM . In the United States, the world's second largest auto market after China, General Motors is the country's top-selling brand, while Toyota is number three, after Ford Motor. But domestically in Japan, Toyota is number one as U.S. automakers have little penetration in the country. That likely will not change, says CLSA's Richter. ""American automakers wouldn't invest in Japan because it's already very crowded and very competitive."" With profit margins in the ""low single digits,"" Richter adds that Japanese automakers don't make much money in Japan as it is. ""Ford wouldn't go in"" and any idea that Japan makes it difficult for American automakers to enter the Japanese market is just a ""political smokescreen to attract government help from Washington."" Richter says the U.S. auto market provides for profit margins in the ""high-single"" or ""low-double digit"" range. Toyota and Volkswagen . While Toyota and GM claimed the top two spots in 2012 global market sales, Volkswagen Group sold 9.09 million vehicles to pull in at number three. Last year was the first time Western Europe's most dominant automaker broke the nine-million vehicle barrier. Volkswagen passed that milestone not because of stellar sales in Europe but because of BRIC countries, including Brazil and China, where it enjoys growing market share, says Richter. Europe is a place where ""global automakers go to lose money"" because ""current economic conditions are bad,"" he says. Just earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its forecast for the eurozone, predicting the region's economic activity would contract for a second consecutive year. ""To the advantage of Japan's automakers, they don't have a large presence in Europe. For European automakers, it (the economy) is a big millstone around their neck in deep water,"" he adds. Toyota only has a 5% market share in Europe, says Kohei of J.P. Morgan. Toyota and Hyundai . While the shadow of successful South Korean tech firms -- like Samsung which posted a record $6.6 billion profit last week -- continue to loom large over their loss-making competitors in Japan ""over the next two to three years, Japan will outperform South Korean automakers in terms of sales volumes,"" predicts Kohei. South Korea's Hyundai, the country's largest automaker, has recently seen strong demand with supply barely keeping up. And between 2007 and 2012, auto website Edmunds.com revealed the average price for a Hyundai vehicle rose more than 10%, beating the 7.5% industry average rise. ""A couple of years ago, Hyundai went through a very powerful product cycle,"" says Richter. The Sonata became Hyundai's answer to the Toyota Camry; Hyundai's Elantra to Toyota's Corolla. But that has now changed. ""Japan is at the peak of their product cycle (and) is recovering from the 2011 disaster. We had a new Camry about this time last year. We had a less expensive version of the Prius -- the Prius C as it's marketed in the U.S. We've had new Lexus launches, relaunches of the Avalon and RAV 4."" ""In terms of durability, Japan is still better than Korea,"" adds Kohei. They (Japan) spend lots of money on R&D. In some design and marketing, Korea is better than Japan -- Honda has even started to benchmark Korea as an index of design. (But) Korea's improvements are not a sustainable trend."" Toyota's sales volumes will be the highest in Asia over the next few years, concluded Kohei. And depending on growth in China, it may continue to be tops in the world.","Toyota reclaims title of world's biggest automaker from GM in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Chuck Colson was a man in full. The former White House special counsel and Watergate accomplice turned born-again Christian and prison evangelist, reminded us all, through his muscular Christianity and ever-present Marine training, that every life is worth saving, that no man should be left behind. He fought tirelessly on behalf of the forgotten and condemned. He defended the defenseless. In his passing on April 21 at the age of 80, we remember one of America's premier cultural ambassadors. Through his Prison Fellowship ministry, Angel Tree program, weekly radio broadcasts, books, and sermons, Colson touched countless lives, from the most innocent to those on death row. He pleaded guilty in 1974 to obstruction of justice in the Nixon White House Watergate scandal and served seven months in prison. But before he went to prison, he underwent a dramatic conversion and became a born-again Christian. Colson emerged from prison a man forever transformed. Last year, on one of his final public speaking tours, Colson summarized his ongoing mission for the past 40 years -- addressing the root causes of the cultural problems threatening our society. ""I discovered early on that the reasons the prisons were being filled wasn't all the sociological theories about crime that we hear generally, it was the... lack of moral training during the morally formative years,"" Colson explained. ""We are raising a generation that lacks male role models. The family has broken down. These kids aren't learning character."" Colson understood that the family is the knot that holds the fabric of civilization together. If the family unravels, then so does society -- economically, socially, and morally. And now, it appears we may be headed that way. Today, more than half of births to American women under 30 happen outside marriage. The out-of-wedlock birth rate in the United States has passed 40% and more than 70% of all births to black women are outside marriage. Children today are the product of fewer successful marriages than perhaps ever before. With high unemployment rates, children are increasingly less likely to see a father or mother getting up and going to work in the morning. Less than half of the American population attends church on a weekly basis. The founding virtues that made this country so successful -- hard work, fidelity and faith -- are in diminishing supply. These virtues can't be taught in ethics classes or pop culture movies, but rather, they must be learned through example, particularly that of mentors and role models. Our children, boys in particular, are drawn to the strongest and loudest forces around them. If positive influences, like parents, teachers, and coaches, are missing, children will gravitate to something inferior, like drugs or gangs. Colson would often illustrate this with stories of convicts leaving prison only to be handed $100 by the guards and told, ""See you again in a couple weeks."" For the overwhelming majority, it was true. They returned home to the same gang they left, the same crimes they committed before, and they ended up back in prison again several weeks later. Colson understood the solution to these problems wasn't political or economical, but cultural. On March 30, Colson gave a speech at the Wilberforce Weekend Conference in northern Virginia. It was the last public speech he would ever give. In it he remarked, ""Politics is nothing but an expression of culture ... so if things are bad, don't think it's going to be solved by an election. It's going to be solved by us."" All great change starts from the bottom up -- from the dinner table to the football field to the prisons. If you want less poverty, less crime and less social breakdown, you need stronger families, stronger churches, and stronger communities. Chuck Colson dedicated himself to this cause with unparalleled fervor and compassion. He will be sorely missed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","Watergate figure Chuck Colson became a born-again Christian, founded prison ministry .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has rejected suggestions that BP's new alliance with Rosneft, the Kremlin-controlled oil company, will provide scope for Russian interference in his country. ""Of course we are not concerned,"" Aliyev told CNN's Richard Quest during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. BP operates Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz gas project, a giant offshore gas field that reduces Europe's reliance on Russian gas. But the energy giant also recently became a major shareholder in the Russian state oil company. British newspapers have reported that the BP-Rosneft deal has raised concerns in Azerbaijan that the partnership would allow Russia to exert indirect influence over its southern neighbor. But Aliyev dismissed the notion, describing BP's relationship with his country as a ""partnership."" ""BP is a company which is present in Azerbaijan almost since the very beginning of our independence,"" he said. ""It's a history of relationship for almost 20 years, and (a) very friendly relationship ... and also a relationship which will continue for at least 20 years more, because the projects we are now implementing jointly with BP are aimed at the future. ""Therefore I'm not concerned about any other issues with BP."" Aliyev told CNN his country had weathered the global economic crisis well, and was now seeking to diversify its economy. ""Our economy is very stable and we managed to develop even in the years of economic crisis. We managed to triple our GDP in less than 10 years,"" he said. ""My main objective now is to attract investments into the non-energy sector of Azerbaijan, particularly in high-tech, IT and services.""","Azerbaijan's president Aliyev says he is not concerned by the BP-Rosneft alliance .

"Davos (CNN) -- Veterans of Davos often refer to nature's awe-inspiring work as the Magic Mountain. The name comes from an early 20th century novel by Thomas Mann -- reflecting on life in an alpine health retreat, and the mystery of time in this breath-taking setting. Read more from John Defterios: Why Egypt's transition is so painful . Since the late 20th century, this ski resort has been synonymous with the World Economic Forum, which represents networking on its grandest scale. This year nearly 40 world leaders -- a record for this annual meeting -- 2000 plus executives and it seems an equal number of people in the media, like yours truly, are in pursuit of them all. The setting is certainly more chaotic then a decade ago. The agendas of the Fortune 500 chief executives are to filled with bi-lateral meetings and back door briefings to allow for the spontaneity that made this venue unique. I first came to Davos as a relatively junior correspondent in 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was arguably then, after nearly two decades in the conference business, when the forum became a fixture on the global calendar. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013 . I can remember, quite vividly, working out of a bunker (like we do today) in the Davos Congress Centre. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sat side-by-side with his East German counterpart Hans Modrow. That meeting before the global community helped set the stage for monetary union, a huge unification fund for what became Eastern Germany and shortly thereafter German elections. The early 90s at Davos were dominated by European reconstruction after the fall of communism. Former party bosses came to the forum to convince business leaders that a transition to market economics could be delivered. Boris Yeltsin made his Davos appearance during that chaotic transition from the USSR to today's Russia. Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? In 1992, Chinese Premier Li Peng used the setting here in the Alps to articulate plans for the country's economic opening up to the world. Not by chance, the architect of Washington's engagement with Beijing, the former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also took a high profile that year. Again only two years later in 1994, Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres walked hand in hand on stage, holding a public dialogue leading up to the creation and recognition of the Palestinian Authority. The World Economic Forum, as the saying goes, was positioned to be in the right place at the right time. While the author of the Magic Mountain talked about the complexity of time around World War I, in the 1990s time was compressed here. The fall of communism, the lowering of global trade barriers, the opening up of China, the removal of apartheid in South Africa and the proliferation of the internet all unfolded in that decade. Interactive: How's your economic mood? As those events came together, so too did the major players as they made the journey to Davos. Michael Bloomberg, evolving as a global name in financial data and now the Mayor of New York City, sat alongside Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. U.S. President Bill Clinton outlined his party's historic move to the political center before a packed audience of global business executives. To spice things up, rock stars and actors, as they became activists, chose the Davos platform: Bono, Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, Brad and Angelina would have the wealthiest and most powerful corporate titans freeze in their tracks. Earlier this week, I walked into the main plenary hall as workers put the final touches on the stage and lighting. It is a venue which has welcomed countless political leaders and business executives, during internet booms and banking busts, in the midst of a Middle East crisis and even during the lead up to two Gulf Wars. But that inter-play between geo-politics and business -- during the best and worst of times -- is what keeps the forum relevant. It allows this setting at the base of the Magic Mountain to endure and recreate something unique during what Mann rightly described as the ongoing complexity of our times.","Since the late 20th Century, the ski resort of Davos has been synonymous with the World Economic Forum .

"London (CNN) -- British media have named entertainer Freddie Starr as the second celebrity to be arrested in connection with an investigation into sex abuse claims involving late BBC TV host Jimmy Savile. Starr, a well-known comedian in the United Kingdom, was arrested on suspicion of sexual offenses Thursday, British media reports say. In media interviews last week, Starr denied the allegations against him, which were made in a TV report. Read more: British police make first arrest in Savile investigation . Police did not release the suspect's name, identifying him only as ""Yewtree 2,"" but said he falls under the ""Savile and others"" strand of their investigation, dubbed Operation Yewtree. He is from Warwickshire and in his 60s, London's Metropolitan Police said. He was released on bail early Friday. A London man, who British media reported to be 1970s pop star Gary Glitter, was arrested Sunday, also on suspicion of sexual offenses. Read more: How celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the BBC . A TV documentary a month ago detailed allegations of sexual abuse against Savile, who died last year. Police investigating the scandal are dealing with about 300 apparent victims, Cmdr. Peter Spindler told reporters. Savile's targets were apparently mostly girls in their mid-teens in what Spindler said was ""alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale."" The British TV icon died in October 2011 at age 84. But authorities have said they are preparing an arrest strategy for others, still living, against whom allegations have been made in connection with the Savile case. Jimmy Savile: National treasure in life, reviled 'sex abuser' in death . Countless Britons who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It"" have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month. The reputation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, his former employer, has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions about how his abuse went undetected, and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations against him last year. ""Now the BBC risks squandering public trust because one of its stars over three decades was apparently a sexual criminal; because he used his programme and popularity as a cover for his wickedness; because he used BBC premises for some of his attacks,"" BBC Chairman Lord Patten wrote in an editorial published Sunday in the Daily Mail. Read more: Former BBC chief explains dropped Savile investigation . The BBC has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries. NatWest Bank confirmed this week that the distribution of Savile's estate, most of which he is reported to have left to a charitable trust, ""has been put on hold."" It has been suggested the money could be used to pay compensation to some of his alleged victims if they file legal claims. Last Saturday, Savile's family made its first public statement since the claims of sexual abuse of underage girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero. Savile's nephew, Roger Foster, had defended his late uncle -- who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young Britons -- in a newspaper interview before the allegations first emerged in the TV documentary a month ago. Read more: Relatives of disgraced Savile voice their anguish . But as those few claims snowballed into hundreds, the family had to face up to the horrific truth: that the man they were so proud of as a media star and tireless charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past. ""I watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle. This wasn't the man we knew and loved,"" Foster said. ""We began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle. How could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing? ""Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts? How could anyone live their life doing the 'most good and most evil' at the same time?"" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","British media name the second suspect arrested as comedian Freddie Starr .

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull,"" ""AC360°"" and ""State of the Union With John King"" as well as special event coverage. Critics of Sonia Sotomayor point to her 2001 remarks that a Latina woman might judge better than a white male. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Even before President Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, he let it be known that he was looking for a justice with, among other things, something called ""empathy."" By that, he said, he meant someone who understands ""ordinary Americans so that everybody is heard."" And that quality, we can infer, comes largely from life experience and background. Ipso facto, Sotomayor's up-by-the-bootstraps life story could well make her a more empathetic justice. It's a notion that clearly horrifies conservatives. ""It opens a grand debate of the president's own making,"" Manuel Miranda, chairman of the Third Branch Conference, told me. For conservative purists, empathy is all about feelings, which have no place in the law. It's also about experiences -- even ethnicity -- which should also have no place in the law. As a defiant Justice Antonin Scalia said in 2007, ""Just as there is no 'Catholic' way to cook a hamburger, I am hard-pressed to tell you of a single opinion of mine that would have come out differently if I were not Catholic."" And I'm sure he's telling the truth. But there's more to it than that. ""If empathy means you understand what other people are thinking,"" says one senior White House adviser, ""... you would think you would want a judge with empathy."" That's also true. So here are the questions: Can a justice have empathy and still rule dispassionately on the law? Or does empathy so control -- and even corrode -- our nature that it affects every intellectual argument? Or, conversely, would judicial decisions actually benefit from a dose of empathy? The wrap against Sotomayor on the empathy front is that she's over-the-top. The alleged proof is a statement she made at a symposium in 2001 arguing that a ""wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has lived that life."" It was silly, to be sure, and more than a tad self-serving. And when she was asked about it by the White House team, according to a senior adviser, she explained her answer by saying that ""her life experiences"" affect ""how she sees facts that come before her as a judge."" Not to mention the fact that she also pointed out that the landmark civil rights decision Brown v. Board of Education was made by an all-white, all-male court. No one can pretend that using the word ""better"" to describe the Latina woman's legal conclusions was a good idea; it wasn't. But how can anyone argue with the notion that who we are affects -- in one way or another -- how we view things? And on a collegial, multi-member court, isn't that diversity of experience a good thing? Just ask conservative Justice Samuel Alito. When testifying at his own confirmation hearings, he was all about empathy. ""When a case comes before me involving, let's say, someone who is an immigrant ... I can't help but think of my own ancestors, because it wasn't that long ago when they were in that position."" Conservatives found no objection when Alito described his own brand of empathy. And ask the more liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who recently told USA Today of her concerns about the male-ness of the court during a recent case involving a 13-year-old girl who had been strip-searched in an Arizona school when officials were looking for drugs. ""They have never been a 13-year-old girl,"" she said. ""It's a very sensitive age for a girl. I don't think that my colleagues, some of them, quite understood."" And then there's this: Can anyone point to a pattern in Sotomayor's opinions that are based more on ""empathy"" than the law? Of course not. And that's precisely the point: Unless Sotomayor's opponents can succeed in using her judicial record to portray her as a passionate, wild-eyed judge who depends more on emotion more than legal precedent, they're in for a tough time. If they think empathy is a dirty word, they'll have to convince the American public. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger asks how critics can argue with notion that who we are affects our view .
Sotomayor said she'd hope ""wise Latina woman"" would judge better than white male .
Borger says it was bad idea to use ""better"" to describe Latina woman's conclusions .
Critics will have a hard time convincing the public that empathy is bad, Borger says ."
"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tony Louzado is facing foreclosure. He's not alone -- in central Florida, where Louzado lives and works, one in every 56 homes is in foreclosure. That simple number, from foreclosure data firm RealtyTrac, doesn't tell the whole story, especially in Louzado's case. Two different law firms are pushing the foreclosure -- on the same mortgage. ""I see now that there's two people that are coming after me, that maybe [the bank] hired in this way,"" he said. ""I don't know all the specifics, but there's two people that are coming after me on the same loan number."" Across the country, millions of Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure since the recession began in December 2007, according to RealtyTrac. Increasingly, however, more of those stories are becoming horror tales about a system in chaos with banks pushing people toward foreclosure, sometimes, allegedly, based on error-filled or even fraudulent and illegal documents. Several of the nation's financial giants, including Bank of America, Allied Financial, JPMorgan Chase and GMAC, have halted foreclosures, although Bank of America and GMAC announced they are resuming the process. While the Obama administration opposes a moratorium on foreclosures so the process can be examined, the federal Fraud Enforcement Task Force has launched a criminal investigation to determine if the banks and their lawyers have done anything illegal. Louzado's case may or may not have been handled properly, but his story is typical. ""I bought the house 6 years ago. It was something I was happy with. It was $1,500 a month,"" said the physical therapist and part-time fireman-paramedic. ""I'm a prideful man. I take pride in paying all my bills."" But then, there were a series of tragic turns. His young son needed three open heart surgeries as well as other surgeries to drain fluid. Louzado's health insurance is good, he said, but not good enough to cover $1,800 per month in prescriptions, co-payments and deductibles. He took a loan from his retirement account. The low interest rate on his mortgage -- supposedly fixed for the first five years and variable after that -- nevertheless rose every year, including a $600 jump in Year 4. The bank had no real answers, he said, and wasn't very helpful. Meanwhile, the bills piled up, and he started to fall behind. Louzado took a 5 percent pay cut at the fire department, necessitated by the struggling economy. But still, he thought he could work his way out until he began calling his bank and realizing, he said, no one wanted to listen. ""They said, 'You are a hard-working American, thank you for paying us. When you stop paying, now we can start working with you,'"" Louzado said. ""Basically, do something wrong, then we're going to work with you. Go through your savings, go through everything, now you have nothing. ""With my situation it's a little more difficult because of my son's surgeries and the medical bills which I now have to take care of, which I want to take care of,"" His son's medical bills take priority, Louzado says. But that's not easy with a big bank seeking to repossess his modest, three-bedroom townhome in Miami -- and two law firms to deal with. ""In my opinion, these are hired guns. Banks want these non-performing loans off their bottom line. And what do they do? They go out and hire a foreclosure mill who's trying to push it through as fast as possible,"" said Louzado's attorney, Jose Funica. Working fast and furiously creates opportunities for mistakes, Funica said, and Florida foreclosure defense attorneys are filing complaints. Funica's Palm Beach law firm, Ice Legal, has taken numerous depositions where banking officials have admitted under oath they signed thousands of foreclosure-related documents every month without personally verifying them. One employee was signing 10,000 documents a month in some cases, the depositions revealed. ""That's virtually impossible,"" said Funica. ""You have to have an army of people to review the documents necessary to prove the validity of these documents in court."" One of the firms foreclosing on Louzado is the law office of David Stern in Plantation, Florida. Florida's attorney general says Stern's foreclosure business is the largest in the state and accuses the firm of submitting false documents, even making some up, just to speed up the foreclosure process. The state has opened a civil investigation against several firms, including Stern's. Repeated calls to Stern's office have not been returned. However, he told the New York Times, "" ... there has not been submission of fraudulent documents."" Stern said the investigation is politically motivated, adding, ""We have done nothing wrong."" ""I can tell you now that no misconduct is occurring at David Stern's law firm, and the firm works very diligently to make sure that all the processing is done correctly,"" Stern's attorney, Jeffrey Tew, said in a phone interview. But in depositions for a lawsuit against the firm, Stern's employees admitted, under oath, they were signing foreclosure documents so fast that they barely had time to even see who the homeowner was. It's a practice known as ""robo-signing."" In an excerpt from a deposition of Cheryl Samons, an employee who once worked for Stern, she says she did not read foreclosure documents before signing them. ""How much time do you spend examining each document before you sign them?"" asked Ice Legal. ""Very little,"" the employee answered. ""Do you read the document?"" Ice Legal asked. ""No,"" the employee answered. ""Their mill is the printer, printing off document after document after document and just having people sign them,"" said Ice Legal attorney Chris Immel. ""They're being paid to serve, to take the foreclosure through the process as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""The servicers actually rate them based on how quickly they move through the process."" And in a ""foreclosure mill,"" time is money. "" ... $1,200 to $1,450 is usually what shows up on uncontested cases for attorney's fees and costs because they're dealing with a pro-se person who's not challenging the different paperwork that they file in the case,"" said Immel. ""I mean, some of these people are making a very good living doing this."" David Stern has made millions. He owns tens of millions of dollars in homes, sports-cars and a recently purchased a 130-foot Mangusta yacht. The yacht alone is estimated to be worth around $20 million. Judges in numerous states have thrown out thousands of foreclosures. In at least six states, attorneys general are investigating, including the state of Ohio which has also sued Allied Financial. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has announced the Department of Justice is looking into the problem, and Congressional leaders are calling for GAO investigations and more. The investigations and lawsuits will eventually peel back the layers and determine if the foreclosures have been handled properly. Congress may set more rules so that the system operates more transparently. But that will all come too late for Tony Louzado, who has given up the fight to keep his home and reluctantly is letting it go. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"London (CNN) -- After five years in crisis the eurozone's new leader has emerged. With influence reaching from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea, the European Central Bank now rules the common currency with unparalleled power. But as the bloc's new protagonist, the ECB is facing criticisms it has overstepped its remit, and potentially broken the law. It began back in 2007, following the U.S. sub-prime housing collapse and subsequent banking crisis. As the reverberations spread across the globe, Europe's central bank took action. Read more: Is the eurozone crisis almost over? For five days -- beginning August 9 -- the ECB pumped 335 billion euros ($431 billion) through the arteries of the European banking system in an effort to revive liquidity in the private sector. It was the first sign of the central bank's willingness to take exceptional measures in order to protect the single currency. Several expensive national bailouts later, the European Central Bank is still grappling with financial crises. But now, it's focused on saving the eurozone. Does the latest strategy break the law? Today, the ECB is relied upon to implement a swathe of controversial and highly unorthodox policies that its President Mario Draghi terms ""non-standard measures."" Such actions include lending to banks at cheap rates, buying-up national debt, negotiating bailouts for financially beleaguered countries and even brokering political support. Read more: Greece: When anger goes beyond despair . Its strategies -- and comments from Draghi -- have been critical to driving down the borrowing costs of eurozone countries, and helping offset the crisis. The ECB's latest crisis-busting solution to buy government debt -- dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions [OMTs] -- is drawing criticism from economists who claim it is tantamount to financing governments struggling to control their debt burdens. Roland Vaubel, a professor of economics at Mannheim University, told CNN the eurozone's central bank is ""violating"" its statute and intervening in the sovereign bond market is ""illegal."" But Christopher Pissarides, Nobel economics laureate, supports the most recent action taken by the euro-area's central bank and believes it is adhering to its mandate by support ailing nations. He told CNN: ""The first point in their mandate is that they should provide the right environment for the euro to establish itself and become the common currency, and I do think that these measures that they are taking are necessary to ensure that."" Read More: Euro crisis opens old wounds for Greece, Germany . The potentially unlimited OMT program has created a rift between the ECB and Germany's central bank president Jens Weidmann, who says the measures pose a risk to euro-area stability. Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank -- Germany's second largest bank -- agrees that the central bank risks losing credibility. He told CNN: ""As an economist, I would say that bond purchases are against the spirit of the ECB statute."" Kraemer added: ""The ECB should not do the job of de facto financing government expenditures."" This is not the first time the ECB has supported governments in the bond market by buying up debt. On May 10, 2010 -- eight days after Greece agreed a 110 billion euro [$141 billion] bailout with European partners and the International Monetary Fund -- the bank announced the Securities Markets Program, a predecessor to the now-operational OMTs. Hero or villain? The OMT program was launched on September 6 at the bank's monthly press conference in Frankfurt, following political pleas for action from Italy and Spain. Prime Ministers Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy had both urged the European Central Bank to buy bonds of eurozone countries to help governments manage unsustainable levels of interest on debt. Draghi has always maintained the ECB's latest solution is not a tactic to fund the debt-stricken nations of southern Europe. To dispel these fears, he introduced strict conditions. According to the rules any country, including Spain and Italy, that appeals for the OMT program must first request a bailout from the euro-area's rescue fund -- the European Stability Mechanism. While this was the path taken by previous aid recipients and eurozone minnows Greece, Ireland and Portugal, it is considered politically destructive for economic giants Spain and Italy. Spain: Perils of being 'filthy stinking poor' But Vaubel says even imposing conditions on eurozone members is a violation of the ECB's statute. He says that the central bank must retain independence and not accept orders from lawmakers. Vaubel argues that by using the government-funded ESM as a condition of central bank support, the ECB ""accepts orders from finance ministers"" which is ""prohibited."" Joerg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology, told CNN the central bank is taking its mandate to the extreme, even with conditions imposed on countries seeking aid. Rocholl added that the ECB has become a guarantor for the private and public sectors in the eurozone: ""The ECB is more than a lender of last resort, not only to the banks, but also to nation-states,"" he said. ECB goes on charm offensive . In October, Draghi traveled to Berlin to justify his policy action to German lawmakers. In a two hour grilling by ministers, he sought to convince euroskeptics that an ECB bond-buying program does not pose an inflation risk. Before entering the Bundestag, he also made clear that the OMTs were not ""disguised financing of governments."" When the former Goldman Sachs banker emerged from parliament -- looking calm and collected -- he stated to a handful of journalists that sovereign bond purchases were in compliance with the ECB mandate. The message was backed by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. But not everyone who attended the question and answer session with the central bank chief was swayed. Frank Schaeffler, a member of the Free Democrat Party in coalition with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, told CNN he was ""definitely not"" convinced by Draghi's justifications for bond purchases. He said: ""Many Germans have become skeptical towards the antics of the ECB."" However, he added ""there is not much credibility left to be damaged."" European Central Bank executive board member Benoit Coeure has publicly defended the bank's strategy. In October, he told the Financial Times the ECB will suspend any OMT operations if the countries do not comply with the conditions. He said: ""It's a condition of the efficiency and credibility of the program."" The threat of this monetary support being removed is potentially dangerous to both the country in question but also to other nations seeking respite, according to Joerg Rocholl. He said: ""It is very hard to imagine how the ECB could withdraw OMT support if a country didn't pursue the reform targets."" Legal challenges ahead for the ECB . Despite Draghi's best efforts to impress policymakers in the Bundestag, Vaubel expects the issue of bond purchases to appear on the agenda of the German constitutional court. In September, the highest court in Europe's largest economy approved and gave legitimacy to the eurozone's permanent rescue fund the ESM. According to Vaubel, the OMT program is likely to come before the German constitutional court in December, and he expects the central bank's latest policy initiative to meet a very different fate. He added ""I foresee that the constitutional court will deem that these OMTs cannot be justified by the ECB.""","ECB President Mario Draghi has said the latest crisis solution is not a tactic to fund the debt-stricken .
The ECB implements controversial and highly unorthodox policies termed ""non-standard measures""
The potentially unlimited OMT program has created a rift between the ECB and Germany's central bank president ."
"(CNN) -- In a new report, the U.S. National Intelligence Council predicts the winding down of ""Pax Americana"" and China's ascent as the world's top economy by 2030. That is, unless several ""Black Swan"" events skew their predictions. On Monday, the report ""Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds"" forecast that U.S. economic and international influence will decline in the next two decades as a shift of global power moves from the West to the East, and from the North to the South. The relative importance of the U.S. as a global actor will decrease, as its economy and that of its western allies will decline. Meanwhile, rising states such as China, India and other Asian nations will contribute an increasingly large share of global financial growth. ""With the rapid rise of other countries, the 'unipolar moment' is over, and 'Pax Americana' -- the era of American ascendancy in international politics that began in 1945 -- is fast winding down,"" the report states. However, despite a weaker economy, the U.S. will probably remain ""first among equals,"" the report says, adding that it is very unlikely that any other nation could replace the U.S. as the leading world power. The report is largely optimistic about technological and economic advances in the next two decades. The numbers of people living in poverty is likely to drop sharply in East and South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, with sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind. ""Under most scenarios -- except the most dire -- significant strides in reducing extreme poverty will be achieved by 2030,"" the report notes. What are those dire scenarios? The report gives a list of eight ""Black Swan"" scenarios -- a reference to Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book ""Black Swan,"" which posits that history is built on unforeseeable, surprise events. Global Trends 2030's potential Black Swans . 1. Severe Pandemic . ""No one can predict which pathogen will be the next to start spreading to humans, or when or where such a development will occur,"" the report says. ""Such an outbreak could result in millions of people suffering and dying in every corner of the world in less than six months."" 2. Much More Rapid Climate Change . ""Dramatic and unforeseen changes already are occurring at a faster rate than expected. Most scientists are not confident of being able to predict such events. Rapid changes in precipitation patterns—such as monsoons in India and the rest of Asia -- could sharply disrupt that region's ability to feed its population."" 3. Euro/EU collapse . If Greece were to leave the euro zone in an unruly way, it could result in eight times the collateral damage as the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, which could lead to a broader crisis in the EU in the future, the report says. 4. A Democratic or Collapsed China . ""China is slated to pass the threshold of US$15,000 per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) in the next five years or so—a level that is often a trigger for democratization,"" the report notes. ""Chinese `soft' power could be dramatically boosted, setting off a wave of democratic movements. Alternatively, many experts believe a democratic China could also become more nationalistic. An economically collapsed China would trigger political unrest and shock the global economy."" 5. A Reformed Iran . ""A more liberal regime could come under growing public pressure to end the international sanctions and negotiate an end to Iran's isolation. An Iran that dropped its nuclear weapons aspirations and became focused on economic modernization would bolster the chances for a more stable Middle East."" 6. Nuclear War or WMD/ Cyber Attack . ""Nuclear powers such as Russia and Pakistan and potential aspirants such as Iran and North Korea see nuclear weapons as compensation for other political and security weaknesses, heightening the risk of their use. The chance of nonstate actors conducting a cyber attack—or using WMD (weapon of mass destruction) —also is increasing."" 7. Solar Geomagnetic Storms . ""Solar geomagnetic storms could knock out satellites, the electric grid, and many sensitive electronic devices. The recurrence intervals of crippling solar geomagnetic storms, which are less than a century, now pose a substantial threat because of the world's dependence on electricity,"" the report says. 8. U.S. Disengagement . ""A collapse or sudden retreat of US power probably would result in an extended period of global anarchy; no leading power would be likely to replace the United States as guarantor of the international order."" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report .","A report predicts that China will surpass the U.S. economy by 2030 .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The board of ailing Italian airline Alitalia has accepted an offer from Air France-KLM to buy 25 percent of the company and become its international partner, Alitalia announced Monday evening. Alitalia began flying in 1947 and was a proud symbol of Italy's economic prowess after WWII. Air France-KLM, which will pay €323 million ($431 million), will be the biggest shareholder in Alitalia and will have three seats the 19-member board of directors, Alitalia said in a news conference in Rome. Alitalia will keep its name, logo and uniforms. The airline will fly 22 fewer jets, but its 148-unit fleet will consist of younger planes, mostly from Airbus. Passengers will be able to fly to 70 Alitalia destinations: 23 in Italy, 34 elsewhere in Europe and 13 on other continents. It remains to be seen how free the new Alitalia will be from union strikes. Demonstrations are scheduled for Tuesday, but no immediate strikes are planned. The next scheduled strike is expected to take place January 19 for four hours. The union behind that strike represents mainly ground workers and some flight attendants. Alitalia declared bankruptcy in August and the government placed Augusto Fantozzi as administrator. The airline began flying in 1947 and became a proud symbol of Italy's economic prowess in the post-war period. Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi campaigned last year on a promise to keep Alitalia under Italian ownership. CAI, a consortium of 18 Italian entrepreneurs, won control of Alitalia in the fall, after numerous talks with Fantozzi and Italian government officials and despite protests and strikes that canceled hundreds of flights and increased losses for the company. Alitalia, for which annual net profits have been rare, is expected to record a 2008 operating loss of €1 billion ($1.3 billion) on revenue of €3.7 billion ($4.9 billion), Fantozzi has said. The other contenders for Alitalia's partnership were Lufthansa and British Airways. Rocco Sabelli, CAI's managing director, said Air France was chosen because it showed more determination, conviction and willingness. Sabelli said Alitalia fares will not increase.","Under new deal, Alitalia will keep its name, fly 22 fewer jets, have younger planes .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich resumed their quest for a 23rd league title on Saturday with a 2-0 win over Greuther Furth at the Allianz Arena as the Bundesliga returned to action after it's annual winter break. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic scored twice -- one in each half -- to earn Bayern all three points to keep Jupp Heynckes' side nine points clear at the top and Greuther Furth anchored at the foot of the table. Heynckes, who gives way to Pep Guardiola at the end of the season, was satisfied with his team's performance. ""We're pleased we won and also kept a clean sheet,"" Heynckes said. ""Our game was tenacious and not so fluid as we are used to, but perhaps that is a positive, as we know what we have to work on,"" he added.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have announced they are reducing their fuel surcharges as the price of oil has plummeted. Passengers on long-haul flights will enjoy the biggest reduction in fares. Both airlines said the cuts, effective Thursday, reflected the lower price of oil, and BA also credited its fuel hedging policy. It means BA passengers will pay £30-35 ($46-54) less on flights longer than nine hours, and £15-20 ($23-31) less on shorter flights, the airline said. European services will cost £4-5 ($6-7) less, BA said. Virgin Atlantic passengers will see similar reductions in the ticket price, the airline said. The fuel surcharge helped airlines pass the high cost of oil on to their passengers. As prices have dropped from a record high in the summer, airlines have been under pressure to cut the fee.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's unbeaten record in La Liga was dramatically ended on Saturday as they slumped to a shock 3-2 defeat at Real Sociedad. Tito Vilanova's side were two goals up inside the first half hour thanks to strikes from Lionel Messi (7th minute) and Pedro (25th minute) and looked to be on course for another routine three points. But five minutes before the break, Uruguayan winger Gonzalo Castro halved the deficit and when Barca's Gerard Pique was shown his second yellow card in the 56th minute the home side took full toll of the numerical advantage. Six minutes later, Castro found the target again to level the scores and to set up a tense finale which concluded in dramatic fashion when striker Imanol Agirretxe stabbed home from close range in injury time. The defeat brings the curtain down on a sensational run of results for the Catalans who, until Saturday, had amassed 55 points from a possible 57 -- Real Madrid the only team to take points off them this season with a 2-2 draw at the Nou Camp in October. Second-placed Atletico Madrid can close the gap on Barcelona to eight points if they beat Levante on Sunday. Elsewhere in La Liga, Getafe and Sevilla drew 1-1 while struggling Granada beat sixth-placed Rayo Vallecano 2-0. Meanwhile in Serie A, league leaders Juventus recorded an emphatic 4-0 win against Udinese. Paul Pogba scored two memorable goals as the reigning champions moved five points clear at the top of the table. The 19-year-old French forward unleashed an unstoppable 35-yard strike in the 41st minute before netting again in the 66th minute with another long-range effort.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From today, travelers visiting the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) risk being detained at airports and sent home if they don't comply with new U.S. immigration rules. Thousands of travelers risk being detained and sent home from U.S. airports and ports. The introduction of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) means visitors from 27 VWP countries -- including most of Western Europe, New Zealand, Japan and Australia -- must now register their details online at least three days before departure. ESTA -- which came into effect today -- replaces the written green I-94 form and allows travelers under the VWP to enter the U.S. without a visa and stay for up to 90 days. The measure is designed to tighten security and make it harder for terrorists who are citizens of the participating countries to easily obtain entry to the U.S. Critics fear the new rule will be an inconvenience for business travelers and the British Foreign Office is concerned that travelers who have not heard about the new rules may be caught out. A British Foreign Office report on travel trends for 2009 predicted that 13 percent of British travelers are more likely to visit the States now Barack Obama has been elected. ""The consequences of not registering through ESTA could therefore be far reaching,"" says the Foreign Office. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assured travelers that the system can handle last-minute and emergency requests. Watch CNN's Richard Quest explain the new rules. » . ESTA has been operating on a voluntary basis since 1 August 2008 and is compulsory from 12 January 2009. Applications can be made at any time, even if travelers have no specific travel plans. If itineraries change, information can be easily updated on the ESTA Web site. Once travelers are authorized, they can travel for up to two years or until their passport expires, whichever comes first. Passengers must submit the same information that is currently required in the I-94 immigration form. This includes biographical data, travel information as well as questions regarding communicable diseases, arrests and convictions. Registration is possible through the U.S. government ESTA Web site. In most cases, eligibility for travel will be approved immediately. Applicants who receive an ""Authorization Pending"" response will need to check the Web site for updates. Applicants whose ESTA applications are denied will be referred to Travel.State.Gov for information on how to apply for a visa. ESTA does not change the rules for citizens from countries that require visas. That no longer includes travelers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Republic of Korea, and the Slovak Republic; they joined the VWP in November, 2008. Malta became a member the following month. Travelers are advised that ESTA does not guarantee entry into the United States. The final decision rests with the immigration official at the port of entry.","Travelers risk being turned away at U.S. airports, as entry rules come into effect .

"(CNN) -- A six-page rant to Virgin Atlantic's Sir Richard Branson about a woeful in-flight meal attracted so much attention on the Internet that it was rumored to be a clever marketing stunt. Image one: ""Look at this Richard. Just look at it."" The author was reported to be Oliver Beale, a 29 year old art director who works at a London advertising agency. Both he and Virgin have insisted the letter, described as possibly ""the world's best passenger complaint,"" is authentic. Here's what Beale had to say after a flight he described as a ""culinary journey of hell."" The letter . Dear Mr Branson . REF: Mumbai to Heathrow 7th December 2008 . I love the Virgin brand, I really do which is why I continue to use it despite a series of unfortunate incidents over the last few years. This latest incident takes the biscuit. Ironically, by the end of the flight I would have gladly paid over a thousand rupees for a single biscuit following the culinary journey of hell I was subjected to at the hands of your corporation. Look at this Richard. Just look at it: [see image one, above]. I imagine the same questions are racing through your brilliant mind as were racing through mine on that fateful day. What is this? Why have I been given it? What have I done to deserve this? And, which one is the starter, which one is the dessert? You don't get to a position like yours Richard with anything less than a generous sprinkling of observational power so I KNOW you will have spotted the tomato next to the two yellow shafts of sponge on the left. Yes, it's next to the sponge shaft without the green paste. That's got to be the clue hasn't it. No sane person would serve a dessert with a tomato would they. Well answer me this Richard, what sort of animal would serve a dessert with peas in: [see image two, above]. I know it looks like a baaji but it's in custard Richard, custard. It must be the pudding. Well you'll be fascinated to hear that it wasn't custard. It was a sour gel with a clear oil on top. It's only redeeming feature was that it managed to be so alien to my palette that it took away the taste of the curry emanating from our miscellaneous central cuboid of beige matter. Perhaps the meal on the left might be the dessert after all. Anyway, this is all irrelevant at the moment. I was raised strictly but neatly by my parents and if they knew I had started dessert before the main course, a sponge shaft would be the least of my worries. So let's peel back the tin-foil on the main dish and see what's on offer. I'll try and explain how this felt. Imagine being a twelve year old boy Richard. Now imagine it's Christmas morning and you're sat their with your final present to open. It's a big one, and you know what it is. It's that Goodmans stereo you picked out the catalogue and wrote to Santa about. Only you open the present and it's not in there. It's your hamster Richard. It's your hamster in the box and it's not breathing. That's how I felt when I peeled back the foil and saw this: [see image three, above]. Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking it's more of that Baaji custard. I admit I thought the same too, but no. It's mustard Richard. MUSTARD. More mustard than any man could consume in a month. On the left we have a piece of broccoli and some peppers in a brown glue-like oil and on the right the chef had prepared some mashed potato. The potato masher had obviously broken and so it was decided the next best thing would be to pass the potatoes through the digestive tract of a bird. Once it was regurgitated it was clearly then blended and mixed with a bit of mustard. Everybody likes a bit of mustard Richard. By now I was actually starting to feel a little hypoglycaemic. I needed a sugar hit. Luckily there was a small cookie provided. It had caught my eye earlier due to its baffling presentation: [see image four, above]. It appears to be in an evidence bag from the scene of a crime. A CRIME AGAINST BLOODY COOKING. Either that or some sort of back-street underground cookie, purchased off a gun-toting maniac high on his own supply of yeast. You certainly wouldn't want to be caught carrying one of these through customs. Imagine biting into a piece of brass Richard. That would be softer on the teeth than the specimen above. I was exhausted. All I wanted to do was relax but obviously I had to sit with that mess in front of me for half an hour. I swear the sponge shafts moved at one point. Once cleared, I decided to relax with a bit of your world-famous onboard entertainment. I switched it on: [see image five, above]. I apologise for the quality of the photo, it's just it was incredibly hard to capture Boris Johnson's face through the flickering white lines running up and down the screen. Perhaps it would be better on another channel: [see image six, above]. Is that Ray Liotta? A question I found myself asking over and over again throughout the gruelling half-hour I attempted to watch the film like this. After that I switched off. I'd had enough. I was the hungriest I'd been in my adult life and I had a splitting headache from squinting at a crackling screen. My only option was to simply stare at the seat in front and wait for either food, or sleep. Neither came for an incredibly long time. But when it did it surpassed my wildest expectations: [see image seven, above]. Yes! It's another crime-scene cookie. Only this time you dunk it in the white stuff. Richard.... What is that white stuff? It looked like it was going to be yoghurt. It finally dawned on me what it was after staring at it. It was a mixture between the Baaji custard and the Mustard sauce. It reminded me of my first week at university. I had overheard that you could make a drink by mixing vodka and refreshers. I lied to my new friends and told them I'd done it loads of times. When I attempted to make the drink in a big bowl it formed a cheese Richard, a cheese. That cheese looked a lot like your baaji-mustard. So that was that Richard. I didn't eat a bloody thing. My only question is: How can you live like this? I can't imagine what dinner round your house is like, it must be like something out of a nature documentary. As I said at the start I love your brand, I really do. It's just a shame such a simple thing could bring it crashing to it's knees and begging for sustenance. Yours Sincerely .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast, the perennial underachiever of the Africa Cup of Nations, began the 2013 tournament with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Togo on Tuesday. After suffering a shock defeat in last year's final by Zambia, ""Les Elephants"" are hoping to finally end a 21-year wait for the title in this month's competition in South Africa. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure put Ivory Coast ahead in front of a small crowd in Rustenberg to ensure he has now scored in four successive Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. Africa Cup of Nations 2013: The teams . Jonathan Ayite leveled for Togo just before the break, but Arsenal forward Gervinho fired home a dramatic late winner to seal the points. Although happy with the result, Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi was left disappointed with his team's showing and has urged his players to learn from the contest. ""I was expecting something better from us -- it wasn't our best performance,"" Lamouchi told reporters. ""I thought the first match was going to be difficult, but it was much harder than I was envisaging. ""I'm happy with the win, but we made too many mistakes, and will have to use this game as a lesson."" Togo coach Didier Six was still fuming at the decision of the referee to disallow his side's effort with the scores level at 1-1 and made a hasty exit from the press conference. ""I think my team deserved something else than that. It wasn't right, the rules weren't respected,"" He told reporters: . Mourinho mentors Cape Verde's 'Special One' Togo, ranked 63 places below Ivory Coast, should have taken an early lead when Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor raced clear on goal only to miss his kick and let Boubacar Barry save. It was a mistake which was to be punished as Toure lashed home via a deflection to give Ivory Coast an eighth-minute lead. The African player of the year went close to doubling his side's advantage when his rasping effort hit the woodwork, but Togo drew level with just seconds of the first half remaining. Serge Akakpo's corner caused mayhem inside the penalty area and Ayite fired the ball home past a helpless Barry. Togo's ""Sparrowhawks"" then thought they had taken the lead when Dare Nibombe headed home a quickly taken corner, but the referee disallowed the effort after deeming the set-piece had been taken before the whistle had been blown. That frustration was further increased when Gervinho met Toure's free-kick at the far post to sweep home an 88th-minute winner. Fuad Ibrahim eyes Africa Cup of Nations chance . Tunisia triumph . In Tuesday's other match in Group D, Tunisia scored a 90th-minute winner to see off Algeria 1-0 at Rustenberg's Royal Bafokeng stadium. Algeria dominated for much of the contest, but could not find a way through a stubborn Tunisia defense in the first meeting between the North African rivals in the tournament's 56-year history. And with time running out, Youssef Msakni produced a breathtaking curling effort which flew into the net and spark wild celebrations. Ethiopia fined . Meanwhile, tournament organizers confirmed that Ethiopia has been fined $10,000 after its fans threw missiles onto the field of play during Monday's 1-1 draw with defending champion Zambia. The incident took place after Ethiopia goalkeeper Jemal Tassew was shown a straight red card during the first half. A statement on the tournament website read: ""After the expulsion of the goalkeeper, the Ethiopian spectators threw all sort of missiles at the field of play (plastic bottles, vuvuzelas....etc). ""The Board decided to impose a financial sanction on Ethiopia amounting to $10,000, nevertheless, the board decided to suspend 5,000 USD on condition that Ethiopia is not found guilty of a similar offense until the end of the tournament (Article 83.3 of CAF Disciplinary Code).""","Ivory Coast begins campaign with 2-1 win over Togo in Rustenburg .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City moved to within four points of neighbors and English Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday with a comfortable 2-0 win over Fulham at the Etihad Stadium. City made light work of Martin Jol's side with David Silva scoring in each half. The Spanish midfielder opened City's account after only 95 seconds pouncing on a loose ball after Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer could only parry Edin Dzeko's long-range effort. Silva's second came midway through the second half, this time meeting a pass from Gael Clichy before lifting the ball over Schwarzer. Alex Ferguson's side can restore their seven-point lead if they beat Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Liverpool hit five past Norwich City at Anfield to climb to seventh in the table. Luiz Suarez scored his 15th league goal of the season to put Liverpool 2-0 up at halftime following Jordan Henderson's 26th-minute opener. Daniel Sturridge scored his third goal in as many games in Liverpool colors in the 59th minute with Steven Gerrard adding a fourth seven minutes later. Norwich's miserable day on Merseyside was completed by a Ryan Bennett own-goal 15 minutes before the end. Liverpool are now level with Arsenal on 34 points, but the Gunners have two games in hand -- one of which is against Chelsea on Sunday. Swansea City extended their unbeaten league run to six games with a 3-1 against Stoke City. Two goals from Jonathan de Guzman and one from Ben Davies sealed victory for Michael Laudrup's side before Michael Owen scored a consolation header in injury time. Newcastle United's dismal league form continued with a 2-1 defeat to Reading at St James Park. Alan Pardew's side have collected just seven points from their last ten games and now sit two places above the relegation zone on 21 points. Reading's second consecutive win lifts them to 18th with 19 points. Aston Villa let slip a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at West Bromwich Albion. The point lifts Paul Lambert's men to 17th in the table. Fellow strugglers Wigan are now second-from-bottom after a 3-2 defeat at home to Sunderland, while Queen's Park Rangers remain rooted to the foot of the table after a 1-1 draw at West Ham United.","David Silva nets twice to move Manchester City to within four points of league leaders United .

"(CNN) -- Former Barcelona star Seydou Keita grabbed the only goal of the game as Mali beat Niger to become the first winners at the Africa Cup of Nations. Captain Keita's 84th minute goal sealed victory for Mali in their opening game and broke a run of three draws at the tournament to determine the continent's best team. With the match seemingly heading for a stalemate, just like the opening two matches of the competition on Saturday, Keita capitalized on a mistake by Niger goalkeeper Daouda Kassaly to find the net. In a game Mali dominated Keita, who now plays his club football in China, hit the crossbar seven minutes before his goal as the team who finished third in last year's competition ground out a valuable victory. Earlier on Sunday DR Congo dragged themselves back from 2-0 against Ghana to secure a 2-2 draw. Ghana, who reached the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup, also held in South Africa, eased into a two-goal lead despite being on the back foot for most of the opening exchanges. Emmanuel Agyemang Badu grabbed the first on 39 minutes, converting from a Mubarak Wakaso attempt on goal. And four minutes after halftime defender Jerry Akaminko nodded home to double the Black Stars' lead. But Congo took just four minutes to respond, Tresor Mputu finishing superbly from Dieudonne Mbokani's cross. A quarter of an hour later Mbokani slotted home from the penalty spot after he was fouled in the area by Jerry Akaminko to secure a deserved draw for Congo. Congo's head coach Claude Le Roy told the tournament's official website: ""I'm proud of my players. I told them before the game that they have huge quality. It is a fantastic experience and they deserve the result."" His opposite number, Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah, said Congo were good value for their point: ""I knew it was not going to be an easy game. ""Usually, it is expected that you win your first game, but it was not the case here. They were a very good side. ""We have learnt a lot from this game in which we game up a two-goal lead.

"(CNN) -- London may have been gripped by a snowstorm that swept across the capital on Sunday but Clint Dempsey's injury time equalizer for Tottenham Hotspur against Manchester United breathed new fire into the English Premier League title race. Alex Ferguson's side looked to have been heading for a crucial 1-0 victory after Robin van Persie's first-half header edged them in front but after surviving a second half onslaught right up until the 92nd minute USA international Dempsey struck to ensure a 1-1 draw. Dempsey's last-gasp effort saw United's lead at the top cut to five points after rivals, neighbors and defending champions Manchester City beat Fulham 2-0 on Saturday but Ferguson was annoyed Wayne Rooney hadn't been awarded a penalty after defender Steven Caulker seemed to trip him. He told Sky Sports: ""I thought we should have had a throw in down our side of the pitch but that linesman never gave us a thing all day. For me it was a poor performance by him. Why he never saw the penalty kick for Wayne Rooney. ""We remember him well from his time in the Chelsea game when (Didier) Drogba was three yards offside and he gave onside. I thought he had a shocking game today. I'm disappointed in his performance, I really am. ""You are 1-0 up with a minute to go, we were really comfortable at that stage. Tottenham worked their socks off, you've got to give them credit for that and I suppose you can't deny them a point. They kept pumping the ball in the box and they got their reward for that."" The game had been in doubt after persistent snowfall cloaked the White Hart Lane pitch in white but once it started Manchester United seized the initiative with the first real chance of the afternoon. Tom Cleverley's cross to the far post found Dutch striker Van Persie lurking and he nodded powerfully in at the near post to register his 17th league goal of the season following his big-money move from Arsenal. Tottenham almost drew level before halftime but winger Gareth Bale's powerful shot was well saved by David De Gea, after it had taken a slight deflection off defender Rio Ferdinand. With the snow still teeming down in the second half Tottenham cranked up the pressure, though they were fortunate not to concede a penalty when Steven Caulker looked to have tripped substitute Wayne Rooney inside the area. At the other end De Dea saved superbly from point blank range as Dempsey charged through the middle of United's defence while Bale again went close with another shot that took a nick off Ferdinand. But just as it looked like United would hold on to record their 19th victory of the season and restore their eight point lead at the top, Dempsey finished from close range after Aaron Lennon's cutback to ensure a share of the spoils. Earlier on Sunday, Chelsea secured only their second home Premier League win under interim manager Rafa Benitez after beating European Champions League rivals Arsenal 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. After losing to bottom side QPR and drawing with newly-promoted Southampton in their last two home games the pressure was on Benitez to deliver and his side consolidated third place thanks to goals from Spain international Juan Mata and Frank Lampard. Chelsea went in front after just six minutes as Mata controlled and finished precisely past Wojciech Szczesny from Cesar Azpilicueta's pass, with Arsenal claiming a foul from Brazilian midfielder Ramires on Francis Coquelin in the build-up. Ten minutes later Arsenal's goalkeeper was shown a yellow card for upending Ramires inside the area before Lampard stepped up to score his eighth league goal of the season, prompting Chelsea's fans to implore owner Roman Abramovich to extend the 34-year-old's contract beyond the end of the season. Fernando Torres, preferred to new signing Demba Ba, continued his stuttering form by blasting over from inside the area as Chelsea dominated right up until half time. But it was a different story after the interval as Arsenal hit back immediately with Theo Walcott and Per Mertesacker both going close. But England international Walcott eventually found the net, running onto Santi Cazorla pass before firing past Petr Cech just before the hour mark. Then Torres again squandered an opportunity to seal the match, overrunning the ball when clean through on goal. He was replaced by Ba and the former Newcastle striker was only denied a fourth goal in Chelsea colours due to a brilliant goalline clearance from Arsenal's Belgian skipper Thomas Vermaelen. Despite late chances for Walcott and Vermaelen, Chelsea held on to move four points clear of Tottenham in third, while Arsenal remain sixth, seven points off a Champions League spot. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger vented his frustration with referee Martin Atkinson after the game. He told Sky Sports: ""The referee gave a lot of free-kicks today, and some much less than the Coquelin one. It's frustrating. It doesn't mean we should have conceded the goal but, in the big games, these decisions have big implications. ""We had a similar start to Man City last week, didn't defend too well and gave them too much incentive. We didn't play well in the first half, but we were much more dangerous in the second half, with a different attitude. ""Unfortunately we didn't make enough of our corners, free-kicks and the chances we created. That's why we lost the game. It's very damaging for our position in the league and difficult to swallow.""","Clint Dempsey's injury time goal denies Manchester United victory at Tottenham .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Real Madrid trail arch rivals Barcelona by a massive 18 points in the Spanish League, so for the rest of the season their mission is to hunt down success in the cup competitions. Such a gap to their Catalan cousins has heaped the pressure on Real coach Jose Mourinho, who must now focus on Spain's premier cup competition, the Copa del Rey, and the European Champions League for salvation. All might be forgiven if he was to secure Europe's most prestigious club prize for a third time as coach, after previous triumphs with Portuguese side Porto and Italian giants Inter Milan. At the very least Real's fans will expect him to win the Spain's second biggest domestic trophy, and a 2-0 win in the first leg of their Copa del Rey tie was enough to quieten the protests against him. A strike from Karim Benzema and an AndrÃ©s Guardado own goal sealed victory on a chilly night in Madrid but Real rode their luck on several occasions in front of their vociferous home support. Cristiano Ronaldo, as ever, was at the center of most of Real's attacking thrusts in the early stages, the Portuguese striker firing a free kick narrowly wide of the post in the opening stages. Luka Modric, signed last year from English club Tottenham Hotspur, then spurned a glorious chance to put Real ahead before Valencia's Brazilian striker Jonas twice went close in a matter of minutes. His misses were to prove costly as Benzema then slotted home from Germany international Sami Khedira's pass inside the area on 37 minutes. Real's fans began to get restless around the hour mark as Valencia began to dominate before Jonas shot wide of an open goal from 12 yards after Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas had parried Roberto Soldado's effort into his path. Again, within minutes of a Jonas miss Real scored, this time Valencia defender Guardado putting through his own net from a Fabio Coentrao cross. Ronaldo was then denied his 29th goal of the season by two brilliant saves from Valencia goalkeeper Vicente, who first repelled the striker's point blank shot from ten yards out before flicking a powerful strike round the post less than a minute later. A 2-0 win gives Real a comfortable cushion going into the return leg in Valencia next Wednesday. In the Italian Cup, Inter Milan had to rely on a goal seconds from the end of extra time to beat Bologna 3-2 and progress to the semifinals. Goals from Fredy Guarin and Rodrigo Palacio put Inter in a commanding position but two goals in four minutes from Alessandro Diamanti and Manolo Gabbiadini pushed the match into extra time. But with a penalty shootout looming Andrea Ranocchia's header crushed Bologna and sent Inter through to the next round. In England's premier cup competition, the FA Cup, there were replay wins for Premier League sides Wigan, Queens Park Rangers, Stoke and Fulham, though Sunderland succumbed to second tier Bolton.","Real Madrid beat Valencia 2-0 in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal tie .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was not ready to make his eagerly awaited debut but his new Paris Saint Germain teammates marked his arrival at the club with a 4-0 win at Toulouse Friday. The comfortable victory leaves the Parisian giants three points clear of Lyon at the top ahead of the other weekend fixtures in France. Beckham signed for the Qatari-owned club Thursday to much fanfare, but having not played a competitive match since the end of the Major League Soccer season two months ago needs time to acquire full fitness. While 100 euro replica shirts bearing the name of the 37-year-old football icon were selling briskly in the French capital, his teammates traveled nearly 600 kilometers south for a key match as they bid to back up their big spending with the domestic crown. Carlo Ancelotti's men were ahead after just four minutes as Javier Pastore scored. The Argentina star had been on target in PSG's 3-1 French Cup win over the same opponents last week and the result never looked being any different despite Toulouse's home advantage. Sweden international Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the advantage before halftime with his league leading 20th of the season. The home side's Cheikh M'Bengue was sent off for a second yellow card just before the break and further strikes from Mamadou Sakhou and Gregory van der Weil put the three points beyond doubt for the table toppers. Blog: Top five signings of the transfer window? PSG's next league fixture sees them home to Bastia in a week's time when Beckham could conceivably make his first appearance in their colors. If PSG eventually win the French title with the former England captain's help it would mean he had won championships in four separate countries. He has achieved the feat with Manchester United in England, Real Madrid in Spain and LA Galaxy, where he spent five years, in the United States. His free agent move grabbed the headlines on the final day of the January transfer window, signing an initial five-month contract with PSG. Beckham, who has promised to donate his salary to local children's charities, revealed he had offers from several other clubs, including some in the English Premier League. His arrival has been generally well received in France, but leading sports newspaper L'Equipe was wary of the real motives. ""With the signature of the 'Spice Boy' David Beckham yesterday, PSG pulled off a sensational publicity stunt. The sporting interest of the move is less clear,"" it said. But Le Monde trumpeted: ""The former captain of the England team has an extraordinary understanding of space and distribution in the game, a brilliant technique and excels in the art of the long cross.""

"(CNN) -- Liverpool, the 18 time league winner and five-time champion of Europe, was humiliated by third-tier Oldham 3-2 in the FA Cup, the most famous domestic cup competition in world football. The Premier League club, which is owned by American businessman John Henry, was embarrassed by a team currently struggling towards the bottom of its own division. On a freezing cold Sunday in the north of England, around 14 kilometers from Manchester, Oldham produced one of the greatest results in its recent history to defeat the seven time FA Cup winners. Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United: Which is the biggest club? Facing the likes of $35 million man Luis Suarez and a whole host of international players, Oldham turned to a man who up until 18 months ago had given up on playing professional football to try his luck at university. Matt Smith, 23, attended the University of Manchester where he gained a degree in International Management with American Studies while playing part-time amateur football. But after completing his studies, he rejoined Oldham and etched his name into FA Cup folklore by scoring twice before dislocating his shoulder in an enthralling contest. Leading 1-0 through Smith's third minute strike, Suarez equalized for Liverpool before Oldham scored two quick goals either side of the break. First, Smith took advantage of some awful goalkeeping by Brad Jones to fire home his second with Reece Wabara heading Oldham into a 3-1 lead just minutes after the interval. Sturridge joins Liverpool . Joe Allen, a $23.6 million signing, volleyed Liverpool back into the contest courtesy of a huge deflection, but Oldham held out for a famous victory. It was a return to the glory days for the club, which reached the 1994 FA Cup semifinals where it was eventually beaten by Manchester United in a replay. It was that year which also saw Oldham relegated from the Premier League -- a division which the club has not been able to return to since. Oldham, which is managed by former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Paul Dickov, will now face Liverpool's Merseyside rival, Everton. ""I am left speechless by the result. We went out there wanting to battle together,"" hero Smith told reporters. ""We rallied and thoroughly deserved the win. We proved what we can do today and we will be looking to do the same against Everton."" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose side is currently seventh in the Premier League, said he had no excuses following the defeat. ""The FA Cup was a competition we wanted to have a go at and there is no excuse,"" he told reporters. ""We put out a strong team capable of winning the game, but we didn't."" Hazard charged with violent conduct . Oldham's triumph capped a remarkable day of cup action in England where European champion Chelsea was fortunate to escape with a 2-2 draw at third-tier Brentford. Brentford, which is less than 10 kilometers from its illustrious west London rival, had taken the lead twice, only for Chelsea to snatch an 83rd minute equalizer through $80 million striker Fernando Torres. It was an impressive showing from minnow Brentford against defending champion Chelsea, which is unbeaten in its past 25 FA Cup matches. Eden a Hazard to Chelsea's public image? Brentford, which is managed by German Uwe Rosler, will now go to Stamford Bridge for a replay in a game which is estimated to earn it around $1.6 million. The winner of that fixture will go on to play at Middlesbrough in the fifth round. James Gibson: The man who saved Manchester United -- twice . There was also drama at Leeds where the first-tier side defeated eight time winners Tottenham Hotspur 2-1. Leeds, which was relegated from the top-flight in 2004, now faces an away game at Premier League champion Manchester City. Meanwhile, Luton Town, which became the first non-league side to ever beat a Premier League team following the 1-0 win at Norwich on Saturday, will play first-tier Millwall in the next round. Manchester United will host Reading, while Arsenal will welcome Blackburn.","Premier League Liverpool crash out of FA Cup after shock defeat by third-tier Oldham Athletic .

"(CNN) -- Athletic Bilbao striker Fernando Llorente has opened talks with Juventus over a move to Italy in June, the Basque club confirmed on Thursday. A 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 winner with Spain, Llorente is out of contract in six months time and is now free to discuss terms with clubs outside of his homeland. ""Juventus informed Athletic Club on January 3 that, knowing Fernando Llorente will end his time at our club on June 30 2013, they will begin negotiations with the player to incorporate him into their squad,"" read an Athletic statement. Llorente impressed as Marcelo Bielsa's team reached the final of last season's Europa League before losing to Spanish rivals Atletico Madrid. The Pamplona-born star has been in and out of the team since announcing he would not be renewing his contract with the eight-time Spanish champions and the usually prolific forward has just two goals in 16 appearances this term. Before Juventus made their move Llorente had been linked with a move to the English Premier League, with Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City all rumored to have been among his suitors. The 27-year-old striker has been a consistent goal threat since breaking into the Bilbao first team in 2005, scoring 115 times in 317 appearances. After making his debut for Spain in 2008, Llorente has netted seven goals from 21 caps for La Roja. Juventus will hope Llorente can bolster a squad which won the Italian title last year and once again sits top of the table this term. Antonio Conte's team drew plaudits for the stylish attacking football they played to reach the knockout stages of the European Champions League. The highlight of the Turin club's campaign was a resounding 3-0 defeat of 2012 champions Chelsea.","Juventus open talks with Athletic Bilbao's Fernando Llorente .

"(CNN) -- European Ryder Cup teammates Lee Westwood and Justin Rose will play off for the World Golf Finals title after both Britons won their last-four ties on Thursday. World No. 5 Rose edged 14-time major winner Tiger Woods to reach Friday's final of the unsanctioned knockout tournament in Istanbul, Turkey. Earlier on Thursday Woods had inflicted a crushing six-stroke victory over out-of-sorts world No. 1 Rory McIlroy at the Antalya Golf Club in their group stage match. Northern Irishman McIlroy struggled all week at the eight-man event, losing all three of his matches. ""I'm not that disappointed because I've got the afternoon off around the pool,"" quipped McIlroy as reported by British newspaper The Guardian. ""I just came here because I have never played in Turkey and there is a lot of good players here. ""I thought it would be a fun week and it has been. So I've enjoyed myself. I feel fine and the energy levels are OK and I've got another week off next week before I get myself up for the Race to Dubai."" With McIlroy and Woods out of the picture, Westwood and Rose will contest the $5.2 million competition. Westwood reached the final courtesy of a dazzling 10-under-par round of 61 to defeat South African 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel. Former world No. 1 Westwood could have carded an even more impressive score had he not double-bogeyed the fourth, but he was still able to wrap up a comfortable six-stroke success.

"(CNN) -- Smoke rises from the marbled beef sizzling over the table grill. One man turns the meat, joining in with the animated conversation already underway, each barely allowing his friend to finish his sentence before offering his own opinion. It's a scene replicated across Seoul every lunch time, but these five men have something particular in common. They all risked their lives to escape the hardships of their home country North Korea and have all now settled in the South. Read more: Power consolidation in North Korea . The topic that has ignited such passion today is China and its ongoing leadership change. All five agree China has been too forgiving of North Korean behavior and human rights abuses in the past, but they are split as to whether that will change with fresh blood at the helm in Beijing. Xi Jinping is widely tipped to lead China for the next ten years. Seo Jae Pyoung, Secretary-General of the Committee for the Democratization of North Korea says his initial dealings with Kim Jong Un, the young North Korean leader, will be watched closely. Opinion: Why China won't turn the other cheek over foreign policy . ""The relationship between Xi and Kim Jong Un will definitely be different compared to the previous relationship between former leaders and the Kim Il Sung or Kim Jong Il regime. The Chinese government may support North Korea financially, but I believe it will require a policy of reform and opening up from North Korea."" Kim Seung Chul disagrees. The President of North Korea Reform Radio says, ""I think the new Chinese leadership will be even more aggressive in supporting North Korea and using it as a strong card against South Korea and Japan. If we ignore this, tensions in Northeast Asia will not get any better."" China's young talent: To stay or to go . China sees North Korean defectors not as refugees but as illegal economic migrants. If they are caught by Chinese border guards, they are arrested and often sent back to North Korea. This practice is internationally condemned as human rights groups say the defectors face harsh treatment and even death when they return. All five of these defectors risked their lives traveling through China to try and make it ultimately to South Korea. But could this policy change? ""China is a member of the United Nations refugee convention but does not allow the UN to help refugees,"" says Kang Chol Hwan who works as a journalist. Kang survived ten years as a child in a brutal North Korean labor camp and wrote a book, The Aquariums of Pyongyang, about his experiences. He does not believe China will soften its policy towards defectors. ""The UN is giving into pressure from China, and the US is not interested. Both need to put pressure on China, only then will something change."" CNN's K.J. Kwon and journalist Jungeun Kim contributed to this report.","Defectors disagree on what China's new leaders mean for North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's worrying mini-slump came to an end on Saturday, but it was not new signing Demba Ba or $80 million man Fernando Torres who fired the London club back up to third in the English Premier League. It was another forward who did the damage -- not only to his reputation, but also to Stoke's longstanding unbeaten home record. Jonathan Walters became just the fourth player to score two own-goals in a Premier League match, and possibly the first to also miss a penalty, as Chelsea cruised to a 4-0 victory at the Britannia Stadium. It lifted the pressure on manager Rafael Benitez after successive home defeats to the EPL's bottom team Queens Park Rangers and then in the first leg of the English League Cup semifinals against Swansea on Wednesday. ""It was a difficult game, especially in the first half. We knew it would be,"" Benitez told reporters after his team closed to within 11 points of leaders Manchester United, who face Liverpool on Sunday. ""We knew it would be physical and intense, but we were ready for that. The goal changed the game because they had to go forward and left space, which meant little by little we could control the game."" The scores were level until first-half injury time, when Walters headed a cross from Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta past his own keeper. It got worse for the Republic of Ireland international in the 62nd minute, as he again headed past Asmir Begovic from Juan Mata's corner. Mata was brought down soon after, allowing veteran midfielder Frank Lampard to continue his scoring run with a penalty, and Eden Hazard sealed it with a superb long-range effort. There was still time for Walters to gain some redemption in his 100th EPL appearance but, given the chance to net his sixth league goal for Stoke this season after being fouled by the returning John Terry, the 29-year-old blasted his injury-time penalty against the crossbar. ""Jon's fine. We look after people at the football club. It wasn't our day today, it was Chelsea's day,"" said Stoke manager Tony Pulis, whose 10th-placed team lost at home for the first time since February, a run of 17 games. Terry came on as a second-half substitute, having been out for two months with a knee injury. ""I was trying to give him some minutes to see how he was,"" Benitez said. ""I watched him in the reserve team but this is totally different, so we played five at the back and tried to protect him a bit. ""We will see how he trains and if he has no problems, it is a question of fitness now."" Fellow central defender Gary Cahill missed the match to be at the birth of his son. ""The baby is fine and they are happy,"" Benitez said. Tottenham failed to stay in third place after being held 0-0 at QPR, now managed by former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp. It was Emmanuel Adebayor's final appearance for Tottenham before leaving for the African Cup of Nations, having patched up his differences with Togo officials. Despite two strong results against top-four teams, Redknapp's side are now two points adrift at the bottom of the table following Reading's 3-2 win at home to seventh-placed West Brom. The promoted side scored three goals in the last 10 minutes, with the winner from Russia striker Pavel Pogrebnyak, after on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku netted twice in the first half. Everton stayed fifth, three points behind Tottenham, after being held 0-0 by ninth-placed Swansea. Southampton moved out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Aston Villa that dropped the home side into the relegation zone, putting more pressure on manager Paul Lambert. Striker Rickie Lambert scored the only goal from the penalty spot for his ninth league goal this season. Sunderland moved up to 14th with a 3-0 win over West Ham that left the London side in 11th, above Norwich on goal difference. Norwich drew 0-0 at home to struggling Newcastle, while Wigan moved above Aston Villa on goal difference after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at 13th-placed Fulham.","Jon Walters scores two own-goals and misses a penalty as Chelsea bounce back in EPL .

He has now targeted No.1 Rory McIlroy in the battle for the overall honors in Europe. ""It's definitely in my sights,"" he said. Grace, who is yet another graduate of the Ernie Els Foundation, led from the first round at Kingsbarns where he shot a stunning 12-under 60. But when Olesen carded two straight birdies around the turn and Grace three-putted the short 11th for a bogey, they were level. But Grace pulled away with a stunning hat-trick of birdies only interrupted by a bogey on the Road Hole 17th. He still had a two-shot lead playing the last which they both birdied. Alexander Noren of Sweden finished third, four shots back, with Joel Sjoholm of Sweden in fourth. Scot Stephen Gallacher, a former Dunhill winner, was making superb last day progress until he accidentally played the ball of an amateur partner Steve Halsall on the 16th fairway. It cost him a two-shot penalty and he ended up running up a quadruple bogey to slip back into a tie for fifth. European Ryder Cup heroes Martin Kaymer and Peter Hanson finished in a tie for 34th.","Branden Grace wins Dunhill Links Championship .

"(CNN) -- The European Tour has long sought to grow golf outside the continent, taking top players around the world to Asia, the Middle East and Africa, while its second-tier circuit even visited South America this year. Its latest bid to break new ground -- the largely untapped golfing market of Eastern Europe -- has been driven by the desires of one of its major sponsors. One of the tour's premier events, the World Match Play Championship, will next year move home from economically-stricken Spain to Bulgaria -- which doesn't have a player ranked in the world's top 1,500 professionals, but has attracted car manufacturer Volvo. ""Volvo was the first company to bring a European Tour event to China and we are the first to take a full European Tour event to Bulgaria, as Eastern Europe is an important business area for us,"" the Swedish corporation's president of event management said on Monday. ""We are very proud to still be delivering ground-breaking innovations as we mark our 130th professional golf tournament. Everyone at Volvo looks forward to welcoming Bulgaria to the 'family' of exclusive host destination partners."" The tournament was staged at England's Wentworth from 1964 to 2009, and this year was the last at its second home at Finca Cortesin. Next year's venue, Thracian Cliffs, has been hailed as Bulgaria's version of the famous American coastal course Pebble Beach. ""You will not find a golf course like this anywhere else on the planet,"" said its designer, South Africa golf legend Gary Player, who won the World Match Play title five times between 1965-1973. Volvo, which also sponsors the European Tour's China Open and Golf Champions event in South Africa, said the World Match Play will be rotated in areas of interest to its business. ""We will announce future venues in due course,"" Ericsson said. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said it was a ""real coup"" to land the tournament. ""The vast media coverage will deliver a reputable boost for Bulgaria and our tourism industry. The recent growth of golf in our country will have the opportunity to be showcased around the world,"" he said. ""Volvo is setting a wonderful example to other international companies, as this shows they view Eastern Europe and Bulgaria as an area of interest for their future business development."" Nicolas Colsaerts, who helped Europe to win the Ryder Cup against the U.S. in a thrilling finale last month, will defend his World Match Play title at Thracian Hills from May 16-19. ""I've never been to Bulgaria but I've heard great things about the country and Thracian Cliffs,"" the Belgian said. ""Having won both the 2011 Volvo China Open and the 2012 Volvo World Match Play Championship, I think Volvo might be my lucky charm so so I hope that continues to be the case in 2013."" Colsaerts will be one of 11 Ryder Cup winners playing at the European Tour's BMW Masters in China this week, including world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and his predecessor Luke Donald. McIlroy won the inaugural tournament at Lake Malaren, near Shanghai, last year when it was a smaller event with no sanctioning but offering a $2 million first prize -- the biggest on offer in golf. This time the winner will take home â‚¬888,560 ($1.16 million) ""To go to back and win for the second time would really put the icing on the cake of what has already been a great year for me,"" said the 23-year-old Northern Irishman, who claimed his second major title at August's PGA Championship. Next Monday he will take on world No. 2 Tiger Woods in an exhibition match at Jinsha Lake Golf Club in Zhengzhou.","Bulgaria will host a full European Tour event for the first time in May 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Paul Lawrie returned the Ryder Cup to its next host venue of Gleneagles Wednesday then revealed how the hostile reception he and his Europe teammates received from the Medinah galleries had given them even greater resolve. Scot Lawrie proved a last day hero after his 5&3 victory over Brandt Snedeker helped his team retain the trophy, but he did not enjoy being the butt of the American supporters. ""I didn't get abused, but you get 'top it, shank it, you're a loser', stuff like that, every shot you play,"" he said. It came as no surprise to the 43-year-old veteran, who played in the infamous ""Battle of Brookline"" in 1999 where raucous home support helped the Americans overturn a four-point deficit on the last day. This time the boot was on the other foot, as inspired by team captain Jose Maria Olazabal, the Europeans silenced the crowd and pulled off the same feat in the concluding singles. ""It makes it all the more satisfying on Sunday night when you're standing there with the Ryder Cup in front of you and they are not. I think it helps us, to be fair. ""I think they (the United States team) said it's the same when they come here. Apparently that's how it is, but I can't see that."" Lawrie has returned to a heroes welcome on home soil where he will be playing in the Alfred Dunhill Links tournament this week. ""Since I arrived here I can hardly get a ball hit for people coming up kind of slapping you on the back. It's been lovely,"" he added. Germany's Martin Kaymer, who holed the testing final putt to make sure Europe retained the Ryder Cup as he beat Steve Stricker, is also in the field. Kaymer had rolled his initial birdie putt on the 18th at Medinah about six foot past the hole to leave the Europe supporters with their hearts in their mouth. ""Even though it was more difficult in the end, it was an even better feeling. Of course it was a lot of pressure, but I see it more like a gift what happened,"" he told the official European Tour website. ""There will never, ever, be a more important putt in my life. Even if I have a chance in two years' time again (At Gleneagles) I've done it before already,"" added the 27-year-old. Kaymer will be looking for his second win in three stagings of the tournament when play gets underway Thursday.","Paul Lawrie returns Ryder Cup to next host venue of Gleneagles .

"(CNN) -- Branden Grace continued his charge towards a fourth European Tour title of the season with a five-under-par 67 at St Andrews to take a five-shot halfway lead in the Dunhill Links Championship. The South African carded a stunning 12-under 60 at Kingsbarns in his opening round to lead by two, but extended his advantage with more fine play. A bogey at the fourth was followed by five birdies in the next six holes at the Home of Golf and another at the 18th. Grace, who also won on South Africa's winter circuit last weekend, will face a tougher test at Carnoustie Saturday before heading back to St Andrews for the final round. ""I think the way I'm playing and hitting the ball I'm looking forward to playing Carnoustie. The putter is going and I'm looking forward to it,"" he told the official European Tour website. Sweden's Joel Sjoholm also shot a 67 at St Andrews for a 12-under total to share second place with Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, who carded a fine 69 at Carnoustie. But they will do well to catch Grace, who was one shot shy of the record lowest 36 hole total on the European Tour, set by compatriot Ernie Els at the 2004 Heineken Classic in Australia. But Europe's Ryder Cup heroes from last week at Medinah were struggling to keep pace. German Martin Kaymer, who sank the clinching putt in Chicago, was faring best but down in 56th place on three under -- 14 strokes behind. Swede Peter Hanson trailed Kaymer by a shot but home hero Paul Lawrie will do well to make the cut, which is made after the third round, having reached the halfway stage on one over and tied for 129th. British Open Els also trailed on one under with twice winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland on level par.","Branden Grace leads Dunhill Links by five shots at halfway .

"(CNN) -- Tottenham Hotspur manager Andre Villas-Boas has told CNN that Bayern Munich is the perfect club for all conquering coach Pep Guardiola to promote his football message. Guardiola signed a three-year deal with the German giants last week after masterminding an incredible 14 trophies in four seasons with Barcelona. After deciding to take a year away from the game citing exhaustion, the 42-year-old will return to football in July aiming to add to his two European Champions League triumphs. And while Villas-Boas, who led Portuguese side Porto to four trophies in his first season as coach aged just 33, was surprised at Guardiola's decision to go to Germany, he thinks it is the perfect vehicle for his counterpart to extol his pure footballing principles. ""I think in Bayern he will find the right setup to continue, not only to promote his message of football, which is immense, but the way he believes in this game and the way he has changed the nature of the game,"" he told CNN. Villas-Boas knows all about the pressure at the highest level of management. After swapping Porto for English club Chelsea in 2011 he was sacked by Russian owner Roman Abramovich after just nine months in charge. Having swapped west London for north, joining Tottenham in July 2012, the 35-year-old is trying to rebuild his reputation, leading his new club to fourth place in the English Premier League. Speculation was rife that Guardiola would head for England to coach either Villas-Boas's former club Chelsea, Arsenal or Manchester United. And Villas-Boas says he was shocked when Bayern announced Guardiola would take over from current coach, Jupp Heynckes, at the end of this season. ""I was so surprised that I asked my media adviser from Tottenham if it was true,"" he added. ""Obviously it's a big, big club, one of the biggest clubs in the world, in a league where we didn't maybe expect Guardiola to go to. ""There's a great respect from all managers towards Jupp Heynckes and what he has achieved in his career."" Guardiola won La Liga, the Spanish Cup and the European Champions League in his first season as Barca manager in 2008-09. He went on to retain the Spanish League title twice more and add another Champions League triumph in 2009-10. In his final season Barca only managed to win the Spanish Cup before Guardiola stunned world football by saying he needed time away from the game. His assistant, Tito Vilanova assumed the reins. Villas-Boas is convinced Guardiola can add to his reputation as one of the finest coaches the game has seen with more trophy-laden years at Bayern, . ""Guardiola is obviously going to become one of the greatest managers in football,"" he said. ""He's won, I think, 14 trophies in 16 (competitions) and he's had such an amazing career.""","Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas says Bayern Munich is right club for Pep Guardiola .

The pair had dominated the latter stages of European Tour event with Van Pelt keeping his nerve to record a final round 68 for 16-under 272. Dufner, playing his first event since being on the losing United States team at the Ryder Cup, had started the last round at Lake Karrinyup one shot adrift of his compatriot, but closed with a 69 for 274. Van Pelt showed signs of nerves by missing short putts on the 14th and 17th but had sufficient buffer to protect his advantage. ""Jason and I had a great battle and played well,"" Van Pelt told the official European Tour website. ""It definitely got tight there at the end but luckily for me I came out on top. ""I have a lot of respect for Jason and his game -- he's a world class player and I knew it was going to be tough today,"" he added. World No.10 Dufner was pleased with his efforts in Australia.

"(CNN) -- Europe's players will pay tribute to Seve Ballesteros by having a special image of the golf legend emblazoned on their golf bags during this week's Ryder Cup matches against the United States in Chicago. The image depicts Ballesteros' famous celebration as he clinched the British Open at St Andrews in 1984. It was a particular favorite of the Spanish star, who had it tattooed on his left arm and described holing the winning putt on the 18th green as ""the happiest moment of my sporting life."" The design was revealed as the European team practiced for the first time Tuesday at Medinah Country Club ahead of Friday's opening action. Non-playing captain Jose Maria Olazabal, who formed an almost unbeatable partnership with Ballesteros in the Ryder Cup, is hoping his players will gain inspiration from memories of his great friend, who died of brain cancer last year. ""We felt that this was one way that Seve could be with us every step of the way. This is the first match since he sadly passed away and a fitting tribute to a true champion,"" he told the official European Tour website. Olazabal will be hoping to lead Europe to a fifth win in six stagings of the biennial team event, but U.S. captain Davis Love III has warned the visitors to expect an atmosphere ""like nothing you've ever seen before"" when the action gets underway in the three-day tournament. Love, a two-time winner of the cup as a player, has told Europe's top golfers to expect partisan support from the American fans. Ryder Cup revolutionaries: Seve & Ollie . ""It's going to be incredible, big golf and a big stage,"" Love, a 20-time winner on the PGA Tour, told a press conference. ""I think the first tee could be the loudest any of these guys have ever seen to start off a golf tournament. So I expect a lot of passion. If we are winning holes, it's going to get pretty loud out there, and that's the home field advantage is all about."" Despite the raucous reception which awaits world No. 1 Rory McIlroy and his European teammates, Olazabal, a three-time winner of the Ryder Cup, is looking forward to sampling the event's unique flavor. ""We respect each other a lot,"" double Masters champion Olazabal said of the rivalry between the two teams. ""Obviously we are going to try to beat each other, no questions about that, but we respect each member of our opponent team. ""Davis and I, we have competed against each other quite a few times, not just in the Ryder Cup but in other events, and here we are sitting together and each one of us has a huge respect towards the other."" Love, the 2007 PGA Championship winner, echoed his counterpart's sentiments, saying, ""We are fortunate to play a game and represent a game that is the model for all other sports. ""It always has been ... We are fortunate that Seve Ballesteros and the players that came before us demanded that ... respect of the game and to carry on traditions of the game. ""I think this match and the friendship that it begins with and the friendship that it ends with is different than any other sport."" Tuesday's practice saw the players go out in groups of four, with the some clues to likely partnerships for the fourball and foursomes matches on Friday and Saturday. Tiger Woods was with Steve Stricker, a successful recent pairing in Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups for the Americans. World No.1 Rory McIlroy went out with Northern Ireland compatriot Graeme McDowell, having played three matches together at Celtic Manor as Europe won the cup back from the United States two years ago.

"(CNN) -- Nicolas Anelka's ill-fated move to China appears to be over after Italian club Juventus claimed on Saturday that the former France striker is poised to join on a short-term deal. Anelka moved to Shanghai Shenhua from English side Chelsea on a two-year contract in January 2012 after agreeing a deal reportedly worth more than $300,000 a week, but could now sign for Juve in a cut-price five-month package worth $800,000. Shenhua struggled to ninth place in the Chinese Super League last year despite also signing Anelka's former Chelsea teammate Didier Drogba on an even higher pay packet. Anelka took over as team coach for a brief period after Jean Tigana was sacked, with former Argentina World Cup winner Sergio Batista subsequently being appointed. The 33-year-old will reportedly join Serie A champions Juventus before the end of the January transfer window, as the club's bosses seek to boost their attacking options ahead of the expected July signing of Spain striker Fernando Llorente. On Saturday Anelka posted an internet picture of himself at an airport, which fellow Twitter users purported to be en route to that of Juve's home city Turin. He has been training with his first senior team, Paris Saint-Germain. He has been involved in transfers worth a total $140 million, playing for top clubs such as Real Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Fenerbahce. ""This summer we made a significant investment to try and strengthen the group but clearly at this stage we are in an emergency situation,"" Juventus sporting director Beppe Marotta told the Sky Italia TV channel. ""As a result, it is logical to make this signing. It should be made official in the next few days. We have an agreement with Anelka for five months with the possibility to sign a further deal if agreeable to both parties."" Juve dropped points in Saturday's frustrating 1-1 draw at home to third-bottom Genoa, but still moved six clear at the top. Striker Fabio Quagliarella scored his seventh league goal in 15 matches in the 54th minute, but Marco Borriello -- who spent the second half of last season on loan at Juve -- leveled with a diving header quarter of an hour later. Third-placed Lazio could have cut Juve's then five-point lead to two in Saturday's earlier game, but lost 1-0 to midtable Chievo to stay below Napoli on goal difference. Napoli can now reduce the deficit in Sunday's trip to Parma, while fourth-placed Inter Milan host Torino. English Premier League leaders Manchester United reached the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 4-1 victory at home to Fulham, as striker Javier Hernandez netted twice after goals from Wayne Rooney and veteran Ryan Giggs, with a penalty. Arsenal snatched a 3-2 win at second division Brighton as France striker Olivier Giroud scored twice and fellow forward Theo Walcott came off the bench to strike a decisive late goal. Norwich became the first top-flight team since 1989 to lose to a non-league side in the world's oldest knockout tournament, crashing 1-0 at home to Luton. The Premier League's bottom team Queens Park Rangers lost 4-2 at third division MK Dons, following Friday's exit by fellow strugglers Aston Villa at the hands of second tier Millwall. Manchester City, Everton, Reading and Wigan went through. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen returned to second place despite being held 0-0 by Freiburg on Saturday. Leverkusen moved a point above two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund, who won 3-0 at home to Nuremberg on Friday. Bayern Munich go into Sunday's trip to Stuttgart with an eight-point lead. In Spain, Valencia moved up to fifth place after snatching 3-2 win at bottom club Deportivo La Coruna, as Ricardo Costa headed home in time added on before Paulo Assuncao became the second home player to be sent off. Deportivo had led 2-1 at halftime through a Riki double, but on-loan Portuguese defender Silvio was sent off seven minutes after the break for a second bookable offense. Levante earlier won 2-1 at home to midtable Valladolid thanks to a 90th-minute own goal from Serbian defender Antonio Rukavina, which put ""Los Granotes"" behind their Valencian rivals on goal difference.","Reports claim Nicolas Anelka is due to join Juventus from Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua .

"(CNN) -- Brandt Snedeker stepped up his bid to win the FedEx Cup playoffs with a superb six-under 64 at East Lakes Saturday to share the third round lead with England's Justin Rose at the Tour Championship. Ryder Cup wildcard pick Snedeker was one of five players, standings leader Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Nick Watney the others, who came to Atlanta knowing that the $10 million bonus payout was theirs with victory come Sunday. World No.1 McIlroy carded a battling 68 to share fourth place on five-under with halfway leader Jim Furyk and Masters champion Bubba Watson. The Northern Irishman made a crucial par saving putt on the 18th to stay in touch with the leaders going into the last day. ""I wanted to make it because I didn't want to give a shot away right at the end,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It's one of those courses where I don't think anyone is really going that low. I might need one and hopefully I have saved it for the last day."" Ryan Moore was alone in third on six-under, while Woods kept his chances of overall glory alive with a 67 to trail by four shots. Last year's U.S. money list winner Luke Donald of England was a further shot behind after holing his second shot to the 14th for a spectacular eagle two. Furyk, who won the FedEx Cup two years ago, looked set to share the lead with Snedeker and the consistent Rose, but ran up a triple bogey on the 18th after finding the water. Snedeker, who has fought back after a poor opening round, was delighted with his efforts. He told the official PGA Tour website: ""My first goal for this week is achieved, and that is to have a chance going into Sunday."" Rose, who has virtually no hope of claiming the top prize, is concentrating on capping his season with the Tour Championship title. ""It's not an easy golf course. Things can happen out there.

"(CNN) -- It is the one event in the golfing calendar where Hollywood stars add some gliltz and glamor to golf's premier European Tour pro-am event. But this year, the great and good from America might be forgiven for keeping their distance from Europe's Ryder Cup royalty in Scotland. Several of the pivotal members of the victorious European team are back to the day job after one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time in Chicago. Both actor Bill Murray and 18-time Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Michael Phelps were at Medinah Country Club, as the United States sunk to defeat from a seemingly unassailable position. But though Martin Kaymer, who holed the crucial putt that meant the U.S could not win back the Ryder Cup, Paul Lawrie and Peter Hanson were playing, Phelps was still delighted to be involved. ""With all the history that is around you here, on these great courses, it is just an honour for me to play in this tournament,"" Phelps told the European Tour's official website. ""I was a bit nervous on the first tee, but it wasn't too bad. To be honest, it was more nerve-wracking watching the Ryder Cup last week! ""My partner Paul Casey was awesome to play with, and there were some good comments going back and forth between us during the round. He gave me some great tips and, by the end, was just telling me to hit it hard!"" As well as the trio of European players all four of Jose Maria Olazabal's vice captains were playing, including 2011 British Open Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley, who was playing with Paralympic 400m champion Oscar Pistorius. The South African, known as 'Blade Runner', birdied the second hole at the notoriously difficult Carnoustie course and has two more rounds to come, at Kingsbarns and St Andrews' famous old course. ""It was very stressful for me this morning,"" said Pistorius. ""It was a nervous time on that first tee, and I was just glad to get the ball past the ladies' tee! But then I got that net birdie and overall the day was an unbelievable experience for me. ""To play with Paul and to be in a four-ball with (2010 European Ryder Cup captain) Colin Montgomerie and (five-time Olympic gold medalist) Steve Redgrave was brilliant, especially as Steve and I have known each other a long time and we are good friends. ""But we didn't have a bet -- we kept it clean! There was a bit of a competitive spirit between us, so perhaps we'll have a little match later in the tournament."" Of all the Ryder Cup contingent it was Kaymer who fared the best, the German shooting a two-under-par round at Carnoustie. The 27-year-old has had a hectic week after his famous putt in Chicago, but said he was glad to be back out on the course. ""There have been plenty of congratulations,"" he said. ""It's a very nice feeling to come to St Andrews and to come here to Carnoustie, and a lot of people were rooting for us on Sunday obviously and they were watching. It's very nice to hear. ""If you put everything in consideration: we won last week The Ryder Cup, this week I get to play with my manager and friend, Johann (Elliot), my brother is caddying for him, we're playing some of the best golf courses in the world, it's nice weather; so it's tough to beat."" Kaymer's solid round was nothing compared to tournament leader Branden Grace, who made an eagle and 10 birdies to break Lee Westwood's Kingsbarns course record with a round of 60. The South African is on 12-under, two shots clear of Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, who broke the course record at St Andrews with a round of 62 -- topping Rory McIlroy's feat from the 2010 British Open.","Hollywood stars mingle with Ryder Cup royalty at Alfred Dunhill Championship .

"(CNN) -- Veteran Jim Furyk produced the round of the day at the Tour Championship in Atlanta after carding a score of 64 at East Lake. The American birdied six of the first nine holes to record an outward 29 as he raced through the field. Furyk won the FedEX Cup $10 million prize two years ago and looked to have an incredible opportunity to record a 59 after hitting seven birdies in the first ten holes. He also claimed birdies at the 15th and 17th but bogeys at the 13th, 16th and 18th left him just two shots clear at the top of the leader board. England's Justin Rose shot a 68 to move into second place on six-under-par. The joint overnight leader hit five birdies to remain in contention following his opening round of 66. But World No.1 Rory McIlroy remained in pole position to claim that $10 prize for overall winner of the playoffs after producing his 10th consecutive sub-70 score. McIlroy sank a 25-foot eagle putt on the 16th to ensure he finished with a round of 68 and leave him four shots off the lead at halfway. The Northern Irishman was joined on three-under-par by Americans Robert Garrigus and Zach Johnson after both players hit rounds of 69. Woods and Rose share first round lead . But Tiger Woods, who shot an opening round 66 to share the lead with Rose, struggled to produce a repeat performance. Woods, whose last win came at July's AT & T National, could only manage a 73 to leave him on one-under-par, a setback to his challenge to McIlroy for the playoffs title. Masters champion Bubba Watson moved into contention on five-under-par alongside Bo Van Pelt, with Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson a shot further back. Last year's money list winner Luke Donald of England shot a 69 to finish level par at the halfway stage, while his compatriot Lee Westwood was 28th out of 30 on five-over-par following a disappointing round of 73. .","Jim Furyk leads the way after stunning start to second round .

"(CNN) -- Nick Faldo knows what it takes to win the Ryder Cup -- so when he says he would rather go into battle with Rory McIlroy in his side than Tiger Woods, it is probably worth listening. Six-time major winner Faldo remains Europe's most successful player in the competition having taken 25 points from his duels against the U.S. While his captaincy during the 2008 defeat at Valhalla was firmly criticized following a disappointing defeat, he remains one of the most iconic figures of the competition. Azinger slams Ryder Cup rival Faldo . With the U.S. and Europe set to go head-to-head at Medinah Country Club in Chicago on Friday, world No.1 McIlroy is expected to lead the charge for Jose Maria Olazabal's team. The 23-year-old has enjoyed a sensational run of form, winning the 2011 U.S. Open and the 2012 PGA Championship and more recently the Deutsche Bank Championship, before pocketing a cool $3 million at the FedEx Cup last weekend. Those achievements have convinced Faldo to back a man playing in just his second Ryder Cup tournament ahead of 14-time major champion and current World No.2 Woods . ""I'd pick Rory,"" said Faldo. ""They're both really marked men now. ""Rory is at the top of the game and everybody in America wants to beat him now and at 23 he has a pretty daunting job on his shoulders. McIlroy dismisses claim that Tiger is 'intimidated' ""You send out your teams you think are going to give you a point but he's a marked man so it gives him a moral victory if somebody beats him as well and that's what I'm trying to say.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has played down comments made by Australian golfing legend Greg Norman that his emergence as the world's most dominant golfer is intimidating Tiger Woods. Norman's comments have led to Woods jokingly referring to the Northern Irishman as ""The Intimidator,"" says McIlroy. But it's a nickname he neither deserves, nor takes seriously, he says. ""No. How can I intimidate Tiger Woods? I mean, the guy's got 75 or whatever PGA Tour wins, 14 majors. He's been the biggest thing ever in our sport,"" he added. ""How could some little 23-year-old from Northern Ireland with a few wins come up and intimidate him. It's just not possible. I don't know where he got that from, but it's not true,"" he added. But Norman, a two-time major winner, believes a changing of the golfing guard is underway. ""When have you ever seen him intimidated by another player? Never. I think [Tiger] knows his time's up and that's normal; these things tend to go in 15-year cycles,"" Norman told Foxsports.com. Woods and McIlroy have been paired together in the opening round of the Tour Championship -- the final playoff in this year's FedExCup -- which starts at East Lake Golf Club, Atlanta on Thursday. McIlroy will guarantee himself $10 million if he wins the tournament and has a good chance of taking the prize with a top-five finish, according to PGATour.com. PGATour.com FedExCup winning scenarios . Victory in the Tour Championship would also see McIlroy complete four wins from his five most recent tournaments on the PGA Tour -- a sequence which began at the U.S.PGA Championship. ""It would just cap off a great year,"" McIlroy said. ""It's hard to compare [the playoffs] to a major championship because it's a year--long thing and it's about being consistent. ""You have to play well at the right time like I have the last couple of weeks. It would be nice to have something to recognise that you have played the best golf the whole way throughout the year."" ""If I win [the Tour Championship], I win [the FedExCup],"" he said. ""That's the mindset I'm coming in with. I feel like I'm playing well enough to win. I know if I do that, everything else takes care of itself."" Meanwhile, McIlroy has revealed he will reconsider his decision to compete for Team GB at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. McIlory, who was born in Northern Ireland, received funding from the Golfing Union of Ireland before turning professional in 2007. His comments that he would rather represent Team GB were criticized in some quarters, but McIlroy says he will make a decision nearer the time. ""After everything that happened last week it definitely makes me reconsider my position and reconsider a lot of things,"" he added. ""I think it just really hit home with me how important it is for a lot of people and how important my success has been to them."" ""Obviously, I've had a lot of support from all sides - from people that call themselves Irish, from Northern Irish, to the whole of the UK, to people over here in the States. ""It just hit home with me at how my success is welcomed by everyone. It would be terrible for me to nearly segregate myself from one of those group that supports me so much. ""It's four years away - I still have a bit of time to decide. But, I'm very, very appreciative and very grateful of the support that I get from everyone.""","World No.1 Rory McIlroy plays down suggestion that Tiger Woods is intimidated by him .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams shrugged off injury concerns to win her first match of the new WTA season in convincing fashion in Brisbane Sunday. The 15-time grand slam champion pulled out of an exhibition tournament in Thailand last week but showed she had fully recovered from a recent foot surgery with a 6-2 6-1 win over fellow American Varvara Lepchenko 6-2 6-1. ""My foot didn't hurt today,"" a Williams told the official Brisbane International website. ""I was a little nervous, but I was completely fine."" Williams finished 2012 in ominous form, winning Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the season-ending WTA Championship, as well as taking double Olympic gold in London. It was a return to her very best after an 18-month layoff through injury and illness, but she is only third in the world rankings due to previous inactivity and results. The two women above, top seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Russia's Maria Sharapova, have both received first round byes for the tournament on the Gold Coast, which also hosts an ATP Tour event. In other action Sunday, former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova made an impressive start with a 6-3 6-4 win over Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro. Poland's Urszula Radwanska beat Tamira Paszek of Austria 2-6 6-0 6-2, while home hope Jarmila Gajdosova shocked world number 16 Roberta Vinci of Italy 4-6 6-1 6-3 to set up a clash with second seed Sharapova. Meanwhile, the elder sister of Serena Williams, seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams, played a key role in a 2-1 win for the United States over South Africa in Perth. Williams, who has battled injuries and illness, came from a set down to beat Chanelle Scheepers 4-6 6-2 6-3 in the opening rubber. Kevin Anderson beat John Isner in straight sets to draw the South Africans level before the concluding mixed doubles. Williams and Isner combined to Anderson and Scheepers 6-3 6-2 to secure victory in the mixed team event. In the other match on the second day of competition, Spain beat France 2-1. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga put France ahead as he beat Fernando Verdasco 7-5 6-3, but Anabel Medina Garrigues leveled it for Spain with a 6-3 6-2 win over Mathilde Johansson.

"(CNN) -- Less than a week after Brandt Snedeker picked up an eye watering $11.5 million check as he claimed the FedEx Cup, the best golfers from the United States and Europe will go head to head with not a dime on the line and with nothing to play for but pride itself. The 39th Ryder Cup matches at Medinah Country Club in Chicago will be watched by packed and partisan galleries and a huge global television audience, but for the 12 players on each team overall victory in the biennial team event is all that matters. They are playing for expenses only and whenever the issue of financial rewards is raised, it is quickly ruled out. ""No prize money is involved, just a lot of pride,"" three-time European captain Bernard Gallacher told CNN. ""And the matches are very, very competitive."" The American team will have the Stars and Stripes running through their veins and it's a chance for the Europeans to combine under a united flag. ""It's the only competition we have with the United States outside the occasional football match and it's the same for them given that their main sports are baseball, gridiron and ice-hockey,"" said Bill Elliott, Chair of the Association of Golf Writers. ""Let's face it, it's not hard for Americans to show nationalistic pride! "" the Briton added with tongue in cheek. Timely intervention . This is a contest which grips golf and sports fans for three days but was in danger of extinction in the 1970s and had it not been for the intervention of 18-time major winner Jack Nicklaus, it may well have withered and died. Nicklaus proposed to Earl Derby, the then president of the Professional Golfers Association, that players from continental Europe should augment the Great Britain and Ireland line-up to make for a better contest. The United States had only lost once in the post-war era -- in 1957 at Lindrick -- and interest, particularly in America, was dwindling. Nicklaus' suggestion was taken up, so in 1979 two Spaniards, Seve Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido, took their place for the match at Greenbrier in West Virginia. This did not prevent the visiting team from suffering a heavy defeat, but as Elliott, who was reporting his first of 17 Ryder Cups and counting, recalls, the change was ""absolutely essential"". Scot Gallacher made one of his eight appearances as a player in that watershed encounter and admitted ""Seve and Antonio had disappointing matches."" (They both had 1-4-0 records.) ""However, their participation in the long-term saved the Ryder Cup,"" he added. Two years later, Ballesteros sat out proceedings at Walton Heath in 1981 after a dispute over his European Tour membership, but even he would have been able to do little to prevent what is rated the strongest U.S. team in history thrashing the home side. United Europe . That was to be last time that the U.S. enjoyed such a level of domination and by the time of the next match at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida in 1983, the Europeans were united under the captaincy of Tony Jacklin, with Ballesteros in his pomp. A narrow defeat was followed by a resounding victory at The Belfry in 1985. Ballesteros famously drove the 311-yard 10th at the Midlands club to set the scene. Sam Torrance sunk the winning putt and the champagne flowed as the players celebrated on the clubhouse roof as Concorde flew past. ""There wasn't a dry eye in the house,"" said Elliott. When rookie Jose Maria Olazabal and Ballesteros led from the front to help Europe to their first win on U.S. soil in the 1987 match at Muirfield Village, the transformation of the event into a clash like no other was finally complete. Read: Seve and Olazabal: Ryder Cup revolutionaries . Olazabal, who will captain Europe in Chicago this week, says he was addicted to the Ryder Cup drug from the moment he first sampled the atmosphere. ""That 1987 Ryder Cup was very special to me -- it made me realize how special the event was and I fell in love with it straight away,"" he told CNN. Top partnership . His partnership in four balls and foursomes (where the players take a alternative shots) with Ballesteros was to bring 11 wins and two tied rubbers in 15 matches over the course of four Ryder Cup contests. Despite their domination, it was the United States who made a mini comeback of their own. They tied the match at The Belfry in 1989, then wrested the trophy back in the ""War on the Shore"" at Kiawah Island in 1991, where Bernhard Langer agonizingly missed a tricky putt to force another tie. The U.S. also won at The Belfry in 1993, but a European team under Gallacher's captaincy took the trophy back at Oak Hill in 1995 to spark a run of six victories in the last eight contests. It was Ballesteros' last match as a player and he was sadly past his best, losing his last day singles. But his tearful embrace with arch rival Nick Faldo, who had beaten Curtis Strange in the key match, is symptomatic of the spirit of the Ryder Cup, where individual performances are secondary to the team effort. Gallacher had tasted narrow defeat as a non-playing skipper in 1991 and 1993 so victory in such fashion was sweet. ""I felt I made a few mistakes in the first two matches, but feel I learned from those mistakes for the 1995 match,"" he said. The two victories for the United States since 1995 have both been on home soil: the infamous ""Battle of Brookline"" in 1999 and at Valhalla in 2008. Raucous galleries . Olazabal will doubtless still have the images of 1999 deep in his memory as the U.S. team poured on to the green after Justin Leonard's putt gave him victory over the Spaniard. But Olazabal still had his own putt to halve the 17th, meaning that golf etiquette had been breached. He missed the 25-footer and the cup was heading back across the Atlantic. The U.S. win in 2008 in Kentucky was also greeted by raucous galleries but not on the level of 1991 and 1999, and both captains -- Olazabal and David Love III -- have spoken of the need for the traditions of the match to be preserved at Medinah. Based on the world rankings, it is likely to be a close run affair. Europe has four of the top five in the rankings, led by world No.1 Rory McIlroy, but the home team boasts 10 inside the top 20 and have -- in wild card pick Snedeker -- the man of the moment after his triumph in Atlanta. The lowest ranked player in the match is Belgian rookie Nicolas Colsaerts at No.35, which demonstrates the quality of the offering over three days of competition. The first two days are taken up with fourball and foursomes team play, with 12 head to head singles matches rounding off the action Sunday. McIlroy's likely face off with No.2 Tiger Woods is set to be a final day highlight but nearly every expert is predicting a nip and tuck affair. Close match . ""My hope is that it will be a close match and that the result will come down to the final pairing and the final green,"" said Elliott. ""Then I hope the USA win because if we keep on winning, then the interest on the Stars and Stripes side of the Atlantic will start to wane."" ""It really is too close to call,"" added Gallacher. It will all be a far cry from the first Ryder Cup in Massachusetts in 1927 where the Great Britain and Ireland team traveled by ocean liner to contest a trophy which was the brainchild of English businessman Sam Ryder. They lost rather easily but it was not until 1937 that a U.S. team captained by Walter Hagen achieved the first 'away' win. It was the signal for U.S. domination, with only the 1957 win and the 1969 halved match at Royal Birkdale, where Jacklin and Nicklaus played a memorable last day singles, offering GB and Ireland any consolation. Nicklaus, forever in touch with the history of his beloved sport, then made his crucial intervention, meaning the contest came alive and since 1979 we have seen eight European wins, seven for the United States and one tied match. Ballesteros, who played such a key role in the European resurgence, both as a player and captain of the winning team on Spanish soil in 1997, will be in everyone's thoughts this week. It is the first match since he sadly passed away in May 2011 and Olazabal's men have a special image of him emblazoned on their golf bags as a constant reminder of his special place in the event's history.

"(CNN) -- Golf fans grew accustomed to the sight of Seve Ballesteros lifting trophies aloft during his glittering career, and his son Javier is continuing the family tradition. Javier Ballesteros, son of five-time major winner Seve, finished on six-under par to clinch the three-round amateur Madrid Open. Seve, who won a record 50 European Tour events during his 33-year playing career, passed away aged 55 in May last year after a prolonged battle with a cancerous brain tumor. ""My father always told me that you have to play with what you got, and that's what I did,"" 22-year-old Javier, a law student in the Spanish capital, was reported to have said by AP. ""I thought about him a lot during the 18 holes and I dedicate this victory to him and my mother."" Javier's win arrived 12 days before his father's close friend Jose Maria Olazabal captains Europe in the Ryder Cup against the United States. The Spanish pair played together in four Ryder Cup matches between 1987 and 1993, winning three and drawing the other, and are widely regarded as one of the finest duos in the competition's history. Ballesteros also captained a European team which included Olazabal to victory on Spanish soil at Valderrama in 1997.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer will surrender his world No. 1 ranking to Novak Djokovic after the 17-time major winner confirmed he is pulling out of the Paris Masters through injury. Federer endured a painful defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro at the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel on Sunday, a match that lasted a grueling two hours and 45 minutes. And after his marathon match, he confirmed he would skip the Paris Masters in order to focus on the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London that start in early November. That decision means he will lose the rankings points he accrued from three tournaments last year, and will be unable to overhaul Djokovic even if he wins his third straight World Tour Finals crown. ""It's just too much,"" Federer was quoted as saying on the official Paris Masters website after defeat in his home town. ""I was trying to make up my mind and I had some niggles I didn't want to take a chance on. I don't want to take a chance for London. ""I feel very disappointed as I had one of the best weeks of my life there last year, but this is just a last-minute decision."" Djokovic enjoyed a 53-week stay at the top of the rankings after his record-breaking 2011 until Federer regained top spot after taking his seventh Wimbledon title back in July. But Djokovic will now end the year as world No. 1 for a second successive year, the first time that has happened since Federer held it between 2004 and 2007. With Rafael Nadal out for the rest of the year with a knee injury, Andy Murray is the major threat to the dominance of Federer and Djokovic and the Briton says he is raring to go after missing the Basel tournament. ""I had a full week of rest after Shanghai which I needed,"" Murray told the tournament's official website. ""I've had a pretty decent preparation for the tournament, which is good."" Murray is one of the strong favorites for the Paris title, and he is gearing up for a big end to his breakthrough year in which he took his first ever grand slam victory and an Olympic gold medal to boot. ""It doesn't make sense to come and save energy,"" added the U.S. Open champion. ""Having a full week of rest at this stage of the season (is something that) in the past I hadn't really had, so I feel so much fresher coming into Paris than I had done the last few years. ""I'll try to play my best this week and then see what happens in London. I feel better at this stage of the year compared with last year.""

"(CNN) -- It is 1987, and a young Spanish man is absolutely murdering a flamenco dance on the green at Ohio's Muirfield Village. Around him, star names such as Seve Ballesteros, Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer are also partying like it's 1999. And why not? The U.S. team has just tasted defeat on home soil for the first time in arguably golf's most important event, the Ryder Cup -- a competition where a sport usually defined by its individualism becomes greater than the sum of its parts. ""That '87 Ryder Cup really was very special for me and it made me realize how special the event was, and I fell in love with it straight away,"" recalls said flamenco dancer Jose Maria Olazabal, who 25 years later captained a European team to another stunning Ryder Cup on American soil -- this time at Medinah Country Club in Illinois. ""The atmosphere is unique. You don't have that sort of cheering in any other event in the whole world. You have two teams, the crowd are split in two, they will root for one of the teams. They are really loud,"" he told CNN before the ""miracle of Medinah"". ""If you look at Celtic Manor at the Ryder Cup we played (in 2010), standing at the first tee people were singing -- you don't see that in any other event. And then you have the team members. The camaraderie in that week is unique."" The Ryder Cup is all about partnerships. For the first two days, each captain divides his teams into pairs which compete in a variety of 18-hole match play competitions known as fourballs and foursomes. Only on the final day of singles matches does it become one versus one, and even then the players will be in the unusual situation of cheering on their teammates. In his second season as a European Tour professional, having already become the first Spaniard to win its top rookie award, Olazabal had the privilege of being paired with one of golf's greatest icons for his Ryder Cup debut: Ballesteros. ""I'd heard about the Ryder Cup, but I never saw one, so I was just amazed at the atmosphere. I'd never seen anything like that before in my life,"" said Olazabal, who came from the small Basque town of Hondarribia, where his family lived and worked on the local golf course. Until 1977, the Ryder Cup had always been Great Britain and Ireland against the U.S. Ballesteros helped change that, an exciting Spanish talent who challenged golf's long-established world order. He was a member of the first European team in 1979 and was a key figure in its breakthrough victory at The Belfry in England in 1985, which was the first year the Americans did not win the title since 1957. In 1987 Ballesteros began what became the most successful partnership in Ryder Cup history -- out of 15 matches together, he and Olazabal won 11, halved two and lost two. ""That week he took care of everything,"" Olazabal said. ""(Captain) Tony Jacklin didn't know what to do with me because I was a rookie. ""What was he going to do with me -- I didn't have any experience of the Ryder Cup -- and all of a sudden Seve somehow took care of that. I think he approached Tony and said, 'Don't you worry, I'll play with him.' ""I remember walking from the putting green to the first tee on the first day of the match. I was really very, very nervous. He walked next to me and said, 'Jose you just play your game, and I'll take care of the rest.' It was a great relief when I heard that."" Ballesteros had spotted Olazabal as a future star several years earlier, even before he had won the British Amateur title in 1984. ""I was at home, and I got a phone call asking me if I wanted to play in a charity match against Seve on his home course. First of all, I thought someone was pulling my leg or playing a joke, and I said, 'Come on, it cannot be true.' ""It was true. I went there and I didn't know what to expect -- I knew Seve had won the (British) Open (in 1979). For a 15-year-old to be paired with Seve -- in terrible conditions, I must say, it was pouring with rain -- I had the best time of my life. ""That day was very special, and I think it contributed also to what happened in the future, me pairing with Seve. We understood each other very well, and I think everything was born and happened that day."" Read how the European team will honor Ballesteros . Olazabal grew up on Real Golf Club de San Sebastian, which was developed from farmland. On the day it opened as a nine-hole course, his mother put in the flags for each green. The next day he was born. ""When the landlord sold the land, he sold it under one condition -- that all the people who worked on the land would have a job on the golf course in some way shape or form, either as a greenkeeper or someone working on the clubhouse. That's how my family got the job -- my father became a greenkeeper, and my mum and my grandmother were working in the clubhouse."" In the center of the course there is an old farmhouse where Olazabal grew up -- it is now converted into a caddy hut. ""In those days, only wealthy people played, and they used to come at the weekends or holidays,"" he recalled. ""From Mondays to Fridays there was no one there, so I had the whole golf course for me. As soon as I could walk I was hitting balls."" Olazabal cemented his friendship with Ballesteros, a man nine years his senior, when they played together in U.S. events. ""He had tough beginnings, the same scenario -- he had to play golf on the beach with a three iron,"" Olazabal said. ""I remember him telling me that when he was a caddy -- and he was quite a good player at that stage -- he had to sneak onto the golf course in the middle of the night with the full moon to play a few holes."" Both began their professional careers in an English-speaking sporting world, without being able to speak much English. ""When I went to the States to play a few events, it was virtually him and I,"" Olazabal said. ""We were on our own, the only Spanish players there, and we spent hours and hours on the golf course together, on the chipping area, having dinner -- he became a mentor for me. He prepared me for what was to come. He knew how difficult it was as a professional. ""It was always a lot of fun with him. He always had stories to tell. He started playing professional golf at the age of 17, he didn't speak a word of English and he started traveling all around the world very quickly."" Like Ballesteros, Olazabal went to the States and conquered the pinnacle of American golf -- the Masters. Like Ballesteros, Olazabal donned the famous Green Jacket at Augusta not once, but twice. ""I owe a lot to the Masters and a lot to the Americans. Without my two Masters I wouldn't be considered the player I am today,"" he said. If his first triumph in 1994 was sweet, the second in 1999 represented an incredible victory over adversity after being stricken by rheumatoid polyarthritis in both feet. ""I couldn't walk for two years, I had to watch golf on the tv, I had to watch my peers making birdies. It was one of the toughest moments of my life,"" Olazabal said. ""Before, I took golf for granted, and all of a sudden you see all those things vanishing. Fortunately enough, I came out of it and was healthy again, and that made me appreciate much more what I have -- everyday life, waking up without pain, being able to do things, enjoying the family and the moment that you're in."" While he enjoyed success in the Masters, later in 1999 Olazabal suffered Ryder Cup heartache when he halved a controversial decisive match with Justin Leonard as the U.S. won the infamous ""Battle of Brookline."" He would not play for Europe again until 2006, the year after the last of his 31 professional victories, but his final appearance as a Ryder Cup player was a winning one, as he forged another strong partnership with another Spaniard, Sergio Garcia -- one of the veterans of the current team. Having been inducted into golf's Hall of Fame in 2009, Olazabal was called up as a vice-captain by Colin Montgomerie during Europe's 2010 victory in Wales, and was a popular choice to take the helm for this year's event. Ballesteros Jr. wins amateur Madrid Open . ""Nothing compares to standing on that first tee, playing the course. Being the captain is the best I can do at the moment. There is always a start and finish to everything,"" Olazabal said. This Ryder Cup was the first to be played since the death of Ballesteros, who passed away at the age of 54 in May 2011 following a long battle with brain cancer. ""The good thing about most of the players in the team is they knew Seve,"" Olazabal said. ""They got a call at Celtic Manor from the man himself. It meant a lot to them, so hopefully those memories will be there with the players. ""He was the one who started to change things -- he made us believe that we could win, and hopefully he will be present there.""","With Jose Marian Olazabal as captain Europe pulled of a stunning turnaround to win the Ryder Cup 14.5-13.5 .

And if the 23-year-old needed any extra motivation, victory should see Azarenka cement her world No. 1 status for the end of the 2012 season. ""I have been practicing hard and expected to play better,"" Azarenka said in a court side interview. ""Hopefully as time goes on, I will get better. If not, I hope to play better next year. ""When I did the right things I was in control much of the time, but I didn't have the consistency today. I had too many opportunities I didn't use. I will be a little bit sad, but I need to bounce back straight away. ""I will give everything to win (on Friday). I will give two hundred percent. I have another opportunity to stay in the tournament and to keep the dream alive."" Defeat snapped a 13-match winning streak for Azarenka after the U.S. Open but Williams is now unbeaten in 16 clashes against the world's top five players. The American had already sealed her place in the last four with wins over Li Na and Germany's Angelique Kerber. Li, the tournament's lowest ranked player, defeated Kerber, the No. 5 seed, 6-4 6-3 in Thursday's opening match to keep alive her hopes of making the semis. Li responded to her defeat to Serena Williams by brushing aside Kerber, who was knocked out of the tournament after her epic encounter with Azarenka on Wednesday evening. Kerber has now lost all three of her matches, winning just one set in the process, while Li can upset the odds and make the semis by beating Azarenka on Friday. In the late match on Thursday, Italy's Sara Errani responded after her opening defeat to Agnieszka Radwanska by toppling Australian Sam Stosur 6-3 2-6 6-0. Meanwhile, less than two weeks from the start of the men's season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London, Rafael Nadal has announced his withdrawal with injury. The 11-time grand slam winner from Spain hasn't featured on the men's Tour since his surprise defeat to Czech Lukas Rosol in the second round at Wimbledon back in late June. Nadal, still holding on to his position as world No. 4, will also miss the Paris Masters event prior to London and is targeting a return at the Australian Open in early 2013. He said: ""It's disappointing for me to miss the last two tournaments of the season in Paris and London, but it doesn't come as a surprise. ""I will hopefully resume my tennis practice soon since I am making good progress with my recovery from injury. I am not ready to compete in time for these events so I will continue my recovery in Mallorca and work hard to be back as soon as possible."" Nadal's spot in London will be taken by Juan Martin Del Potro, who assured his place with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of American Brian Baker at the Swiss Indoors event in Basel. And though the Argentinean was delighted to make the cut, he expressed his sympathy to Nadal on the ATP Tour's official website. He said: ""I'm sad for Rafa, he's really trying in his comeback. But it's not easy after such a long time away. I had the same feeling with my wrist. ""We miss Rafa a lot on the Tour. He is one of the best players in history, he will come back strong. I'm sure it will be very soon. He will be ready to win a big event again.""","Serena Williams wins her third straight match at the WTA Championships in Turkey .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Petra Kvitova expressed sadness after illness forced her withdrawal from this year's WTA Championships in the Turkish city Istanbul on Wednesday, while Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova reached the semifinals of the season-ending event. Kvitova, who lost in straight sets to Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in her opening round-robin match on Tuesday, is suffering from a viral illness. ""I'm really sad to withdraw from the tournament. It's a great tournament and it was an honor to be here,"" the 22-year-old Czech told the WTA's official website. ""I hope I can come back next year. I've never withdrawn from a tournament, this is the first time for me. I don't like to give up, so I'm really disappointed. ""When I played I thought I was nervous, but normally nerves are gone after the first set, and it was actually happening during all the match. I was shaking all match and wasn't feeling very well. My stomach felt funny. After one rally with Agnieszka I couldn't breathe."" Kvitova will be replaced by world no. 9 Samantha Stosur in the elite eight-woman lineup. The Australian can still reach the semifinals if she beats second seed Maria Sharapova and Italy's Sara Errani, the French Open runner-up, in her remaining matches in the White Group. Second-ranked Sharapova went through to the last four after coming from behind to overcome Radwanska 5-7 7-5 7-5 in a match lasting three hours and 12 minutes that finally finished after 2 a.m. local time. The Russian, who won the tournament as a 17-year-old in 2004, faced defeat at 4-2 down in the second set to follow up her opening win over Errani. ""I was a little bit frustrated early on. I wasn't doing the right things and she was doing all the right things, and making me make mistakes,"" said Sharapova, who hit 66 winners to Radwanska's 18 but also led in unforced errors 64 to 19. ""I was injured last year and didn't play very well, so to be in the semifinals this year makes me very proud, and especially given the way I fought tonight."" In the Red Group, world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka stayed on course to finish the year as the top-ranked player -- but only just as she took over three hours to see off the challenge of Angelique Kerber. The Belorussian saved two match points against the German to win 6-7 7-6 (13-11) 6-4 and now needs just one more win to finish on top, and so deny Sharapova the chance to end the year as No. 1. ""On the match points I just thought I had to go for it -- she wasn't going to miss, and I didn't want to wait for her to make a mistake,"" Azarenka said. ""I was so determined to make it happen. I wanted to take destiny into my hands -- if I missed those shots, it was going to be up to me, not up to my opponent."" In the earlier Red Group match on Wednesday, Williams earned her second straight-sets victory in as many days with a 7-6 6-3 win over China's Li Na in a match that lasted one hour and 50 minutes. The American's hard-fought victory was not without incident as the winner of Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Olympics smashed her racket, and so earned a code violation, after serving two successive double faults to lose a service game. ""I started out really strong in the first game but then started making errors, and Li started playing her game and playing it well - that's all,"" Williams said. ""I was a little tight and my serve wasn't working at all, maybe towards the end - but that's not how I usually play. The good thing is I can only play better."" The 31-year-old, playing her first tournament since winning the U.S. Open, will become the event's oldest champion should she win her third title, with previous successes coming in 2001 and 2009.","Defending champion Petra Kvitova withdraws from WTA Championships with illness .

"(CNN) -- Czech tennis fans are enjoying an uplift in fortunes not seen since before the Velvet Revolution more than 30 years ago. The Czech Republic's women's team lifted the Fed Cup title for the second year in a row on Sunday -- echoing the achievements of the all-conquering Czechoslovakia team led by Martina Navratilova in the 1980s. Lucie Safarova clinched the winning point against Serbia to spark joyous scenes in Prague, beating former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic 6-1 6-1 to establish an unassailable 3-1 lead in the final. ""Here at home in this type of crowd, it's indescribable, it's an amazing feeling,"" said Safarova, ranked 17th in the world. ""There are so many emotions and happiness -- and that is the feeling we are practicing for every day, even if you're not in the mood to work."" Fed Cup fever hits Prague . The Czechs had led 2-0 after Saturday's opening rubbers, but the Serbs stayed in the match when Ana Ivanovic -- another former No. 1 -- defeated last year's Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 6-3 7-5. ""I didn't have a lot of energy and it was obvious on the court,"" said Kvitova, who won her opening match against Jankovic despite an illness which ended her title defense at last month's WTA Championships in Istanbul. ""I tried to play only for a few shots, I couldn't play for longer, and that's why I started to have mistakes."" The Czechs became the third successive nation to defend the title following Italy (2009-10) and Russia (2007-08). Counting the five won by the old Czechoslovakia up until 1988, it matched the seven held by Australia -- second overall, but 10 shy of the United States. Last year's victory was the first since the split with Slovakia in 1993. Meanwhile, David Ferrer lifted his first ATP Masters title after ending the giant-killing run of Jerzy Janowicz in Sunday's Paris final. The fifth-ranked Spaniard won 6-4 6-3 to become the first player outside the world's top four to win a Masters 1000 tournament since Robin Soderling in the same event two years ago. Poland's 69th-ranked Janowicz had earlier upset world No. 3 Andy Murray and No. 9 Janko Tipsarevic on his way to his first Masters final. It was Ferrer's seventh title this season -- the most by any men's player -- and sets him up for the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals starting in London on Monday. He will be in action in Tuesday's evening session against Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, after defending champion Roger Federer plays Tipsarevic in the opening Group B tie. Olympic and U.S. Open champion Murray will launch the tournament on Monday against sixth-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych. Novak Djokovic, whose return to world No. 1 will be confirmed on Monday, will then face France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in another Group A clash.","Czech Republic women's team wins Fed Cup final for second successive year .
