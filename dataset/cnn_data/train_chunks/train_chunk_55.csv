"(The Frisky) -- I took a day off to head upstate with some friends for a relaxing weekend in the country. Plaid shirts were worn, showers were abstained from, and copious amounts of pork, wine, and other stuff were ingested. A great time was had by all, especially when my girlfriends took the time to put their heads together to come up with a ""back-up plan"" for yours truly. First, let's just talk about what, exactly, a back-up plan is. Should life not go as ideally intended -- in career, love, etc. -- many people have a PLAN B. My career as an editor for a mega popular lady site goes belly up? My back-up plan is to freelance full-time from Costa Rica. Romantic back-up plans have become fodder for many movies, including one which just hit theaters this weekend, aptly titled ""The Back-up Plan,"" starring Jennifer Lopez. In the film, which I am assured is terrible, Lopez conceives twins via artificial insemination (her ""back-up plan"") ""only to meet the man of her dreams the very same day."" Oh no! The Frisky: Is Minnie Driver secretly married? According to Hollywood, back-up plans rarely go as planned. In ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" Julia Roberts' character's back-up plan is to marry her lifelong male best friend if they're both single at 30. And, of course, just before the clock strikes midnight on the day of her 30th birthday, aforementioned guy best friend announces he is engaged and Roberts' character, of course, realizes she loved him all along. The Frisky: Why women on dating sites don't respond to men . I had a half-hearted back-up plan like this in college. I told myself that if ""things didn't go as planned"" in my love life by, uh, 30-something (which seemed dreadfully old at the time), I would just get together with this guy friend of mine named Miguel. Nothing romantic or sexual had ever happened between us, save this one drunken almost-kiss, and I don't think I included him in the back-up plan-making decision process. He was just rad and cute and we liked the same things. Last week I reconnected with him -- perhaps my subconscious mind was trying to find out whether this ""back-up plan"" needed its own back-up plan -- and as it turns out he's got some girlfriend he hopes to marry, so good for him. The Frisky: Sneak peek at the new ""Bachelorette"" So, back to my new back-up plan, or rather the back-up plan people-who-shall-remain-nameless have concocted for me. I woke up from a nap (one of many, as napping is what we do for fun in the country) to hear a couple of my girlfriends whispering. ""Why haven't they ever dated?"" F. asked. ""I don't know, I don't think either of them has ever thought about it,"" T. concluded in a hushed tone. Noticing me sitting there staring at them, T. said in a more normal tone of voice, ""We were just talking about how you and D. could be really good together. I think if you're both single in five years, you should get together!"" OK, then. They gave me a long list of reasons why this would be awesome and were very proud of themselves. I nodded and smiled and rolled my eyes and then went back to sleep. The Frisky: Here's what it costs to date a celebrity . In fairness, it is not an appalling idea. D. is a perfectly awesome dude. We have been friends for a long time. I'm sure he will make a wonderful boyfriend/husband/baby daddy to someone someday, just as I will make a wonderful girlfriend/wife/baby momma to someone someday. And all joking aside, I know my friends mean well, even if selfishly they love us both and thus would be over the moon if we loved each other like that, because then everyone would be happy and wearing plaid and eating pork together. In truth, there are certain things I really want in life -- a gratifying career (check!), someone to love romantically who loves me back equally and just as fiercely (foot-tapping), and, eventually, kids. I've already explained which qualities I really desire in a man (though a few are hardly necessities), but what if that man doesn't come along? We don't always get everything we want in life. Which is why I have a back-up plan of my own. I'm just not sharing what it is. TM & © 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved .","Jennifer Lopez's new movie is about a Plan B that sort of backfires .

"(CNN) -- Oil spill cleanup is under way at many beaches along the Gulf Coast, and beach-bound travelers are keeping a close eye on coastal conditions. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil spill: . Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website. The site includes a roundup of oil sightings along the coast, including this report Monday from Grand Isle: ""Oil sheen filled with 10 foot wide tar balls extending from 50 yards off of the southwest tip of Grand Isle south into the gulf."" iReporter Natasha Combs visited Grand Isle on Sunday to observe cleanup efforts. ""The beach was empty with the exception of the workers and the military. All of the cleanup crew were wearing HAZMAT suits. Bags of oil were gathered in piles along the beach, and workers were rinsing oil off of themselves in small plastic kid pools,"" Combs said. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. The park service reports that crews found ""very light occurrences of oil"" on Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi. Petit Bois island was cleaned up and has been free of oil as of Sunday, the site said. The Mississippi State Department of Health urges people to avoid swimming or boating in ""any waters visibly affected by oil."" The spill also has affected parts of the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida. Cleanup crews have been working on medium and heavier oil coverage at Perdido Key, Fort Pickens and Santa Rosa. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan. The beaches remain open. The pier at Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores is closed to fishing but open for sightseeing, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. State Gulf waters and some inshore waters have been closed to fishing by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Pensacola and Perdido Key, Florida . The waters in Pensacola and Perdido Key are open Tuesday for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Officials have not issued closures or health advisories for the area, the bureau's website said. iReporter Mike McHugh shot video over the weekend at Johnson's Beach on Perdido Key. ""I came back to Johnson's Beach to see how the cleanup was progressing and to see what high tide brought in. At 4:30 p.m., the cleanup crews were gone. There were less tar balls, but still [they] are easy to find,"" he  wrote. iReporter James Amerson has been tracking the oil in Pensacola, Florida. Tar balls were found late last week on Pensacola Beach, ranging in size from 2 to 3 inches up to 18 inches, Amerson said. ""Strange to think this stuff, millions of years old, came from several thousand feet underground and floated over a 100 miles until it came to rest our sugar white sands,"" Amerson wrote on iReport.com. The visitors bureau urges beachgoers to take precautions. ""According to [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], tarballs do not pose a health risk to the average person, but visitors are advised not to pick them up,"" the website said.","Gulf Islands National Seashores sites open; some oil detected on beaches .

"(CNN) -- The MV Rachel Corrie, a cargo ship loaded with humanitarian aid and bound for Gaza in defiance of an Israeli blockade, is on track to arrive there Saturday, according to the Free Gaza Movement. The 19 people aboard the vessel -- which is owned by the Free Gaza Movement -- include activists and crew members who are determined to reach Gaza, passengers told CNN. ""We're not prepared to turn around,"" said Irish Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, who is aboard the ship. ""We are prepared to go straight to Gaza."" ""We will stay within the international waters,"" said Maguire. ""If Israel refuses that we get into Gaza and insists on boarding our boat, then we will sit down as non-violent activists. We will be very peaceful. We will not resist the Israeli navy coming aboard, arresting us and taking us by force to [the Israeli port city of ] Ashdod, but we will not turn around. We will keep going."" Organizers say the ship is carrying 550 tons of cement to help rebuild schools, homes and other buildings destroyed in Gaza. Maguire said the ship is also carrying ""tons"" of writing materials donated by Norway, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment -- including wheelchairs donated by Scotland -- and toys. Former Assistant U.N. Secretary-General Denis Halliday, also aboard the Rachel Corrie, said the passengers had no plans to confront the Israelis. ""We will stand back and show we are harmless and unarmed -- we will put up no resistance,"" he said. ""We're not going to make any silly mistakes."" Israel has offered to unload the vessel's cargo in Ashdod, screen the material and deliver it to Gaza, but passengers aboard the ship rejected the offer, according to a statement from Micheal Martin, Ireland's minister for foreign affairs. Israel said its naval blockade is in place to stop weaponry from reaching militants in Gaza intent on attacking Israel. ""If, as is their stated intention, the Israeli government intercepts the Rachel Corrie, the government demands that it demonstrate every restraint,"" said Martin. He called on Israel to lift its blockade. In Washington, National Security Council Spokesman Mike Hammer urged the passengers to accept Israel's offer. ""In the interest of the safety of all involved, and the safe transmission of assistance to the people of Gaza, we strongly encourage those on board the Rachel Corrie and other vessels to sail to Ashdod to deliver their materials to Gaza,"" Hammer said. He called on all parties ""to avoid any unnecessary confrontations and to ensure the safety of all involved."" In an incident Monday, violence erupted on one of six ships in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, leading to the deaths of nine people, all Turkish citizens -- including one of dual Turkish-American nationality. A number of other people were wounded. Israel said the passengers initiated the attack; the passengers said it was the troops who initiated it. On Friday, two Turkish ambulance planes left for Israel to carry five wounded Turkish citizens back to Turkey, the country's state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Other Turkish activists on the ship have returned from Israel to a hero's welcome. Turkish President Abdullah Gul said Thursday that the incident ""left an irreparable and deep scar"" in once-close Turkish-Israeli ties. On Friday, thousands of people attended a funeral for the victims in Istanbul. Many of the attendees chanted anti-Israeli slogans. Tensions among Palestinians are also simmering. ""Ongoing provocations and systematic discrimination against Palestinians signify Israel's continuous disrespect of international law and human rights and destabilize the region,"" chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said Friday. The tensions have sparked security concerns within Israel. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN a heightened police presence would keep the peace. Men under age 40 are not allowed to pray at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, he said. The violence sparked official and grassroots rage in governments and streets outside the Middle East on Thursday. South Africa recalled its ambassador to Israel. At the United Nations, the Security Council called for an inquiry into the flotilla raid and the Human Rights Council voted for a probe, but Israel said it alone -- and not an international entity -- should be investigating. It is Israel's ""standard practice"" to carry out ""a prompt, professional, transparent and objective investigation in accordance with the highest international standards"" after military operations, said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister. The Israel Defense Forces military advocate general -- charged with ensuring the military upholds the rule of law -- said Israel's interception of the flotilla was legal. It said international law allows a country to stop a vessel in international waters if it attempts to breach a naval blockade -- even before such a blockade is breached. Free Gaza activist Derek Graham has said the plan was for the Rachel Corrie to be unloaded in Gaza and then return to Ireland. ""We're just hopeful the Israelis will let us make a small gesture for the people of Palestine,"" Halliday said. ""Because we believe Monday was a gross error."" He added that Monday's confrontation resulted from ""faults on both sides,"" saying the effort on the Rachel Corrie is a ""different ball game."" The ship was named for a 23-year-old American woman who was killed in Gaza in 2003 while attempting to keep IDF forces from bulldozing the home of a Palestinian. CNN's Ivan Watson, Paula Hancocks and Laura P. Maestro contributed to this report.","NEW: White House encourages activists to go to Ashdod .

"Want to avoid a heart attack or stroke? In addition to well-known risk factors like diet and exercise, you may want to keep an eye on your vitamin D levels too. Small amounts of vitamin D is available in food, such as fish, cod liver oil, and fortified milk and juice. Low levels of the ""sunshine vitamin"" -- so nicknamed because we get most of our vitamin D from sunlight -- may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, according to a report published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. About 30 to 50 pecent of American children and adults don't get enough vitamin D, says coauthor James O'Keefe, M.D., cardiologist and director of preventative cardiology at the Mid America Heart Institute, in Kansas City, Missouri. ""Society has been slow to respond to the pleas of vitamin D experts for years,"" O'Keefe says. ""People say, 'Well, I go outside,' but the truth is we just aren't outside enough -- or when we are, we're using sunscreen or wearing protective clothing."" Small amounts of vitamin D can be consumed through food, such as fish, cod liver oil, and fortified milk and juice. But to achieve the daily 1,000 to 2,000 international units (IUs) that most people need, a dietary supplement is almost always necessary, according to the report. Oral doses of up to 2,000 IUs a day are considered safe and are available over the counter.  Watch more on vitamin D recommendations for children » . People with vitamin D levels below 15 nanograms per milliliter (deficiency is defined as less than 20 ng/ml) are twice as likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular event within the next five years as those with higher levels, according to the Framingham Heart Study, a large, ongoing study of heart risk factors. Because the Framingham Heart Study is not a randomized controlled trial, it's still not clear if vitamin D is the real reason for the link (the vitamin's levels could drop in unhealthy people for other reasons), or if taking a supplement would lower the risk. However, experts agree that a connection is likely. Vitamin D appears to regulate insulin production in the pancreas, and a deficiency could raise diabetes risk. Low levels of vitamin D can also raise blood pressure and increase inflammation in the arteries, ""a recipe for disaster,"" says O'Keefe. ""These are the fundamental disturbances that predispose us to blood clots, strokes, and cardiac deaths,"" he says. Susan Harris, D.Sc., an epidemiologist in the Bone Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts, agrees that there's little harm in assuming that vitamin D may help the heart. ""It looks like vitamin D is important in very basic physiological functions like appropriate immune responses and inflammation, which play a role in cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses,"" she says.  Health.com: How the financial crisis could break your heart, literally . While placebo-controlled studies are still needed to define vitamin D's real relationship with heart disease, ""it is such a safe and possibly preventive treatment, there's not really any reason to wait until that research is conducted,"" she adds. O'Keefe and his colleagues at the University of Alabama, the Mayo Clinic, and the vitamin D laboratory at Boston University recommend that people with cardiovascular disease or related risk factors -- such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, or a family history -- have their vitamin D levels checked by a doctor. Health.com: 7 Causes of High Cholesterol . To restore normal vitamin D levels, deficient at-risk patients should be supplemented with 50,000 IUs of prescription vitamin D2 or D3 (vitamin D comes in two forms) once a week for 8 to 12 weeks, according to the report's authors. They should then maintain these levels with either 50,000 units every two weeks, 1,000 to 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 every day, or approximately 10 minutes of sunlight a day between the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Health.com: Vitamin Guidelines: Easy Ways to Double Your D . Harris agrees with most of these recommendations, although she warns that sun exposure in the northern United States during the months of November through April tends to be an inadequate source of vitamin D. The bottom line, says O'Keefe, is that adequate vitamin D levels are a necessity for overall health -- and they probably improve heart functioning as well. ""Deficiency really wreaks havoc on long-term health,"" he says. ""And so even though [the cardiovascular benefit] is still theoretical, we have a mandate to normalize levels in heart patients -- and really in all patients -- just for the good it will do the rest of their system.""

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Gary Coleman's ex-wife sold ""death photos"" of the former child actor in ""ongoing desperate attempts"" to profit from his death, according to the person Coleman named as executor of his estate. The photographs, taken inside the hospital where Coleman died last month, will be published this week in Globe magazine, according to a publicist for the magazine. ""We bought the photos,"" said Samantha Trenk, a spokeswoman for Globe parent company American Media. The magazine would not disclose how much it paid or who sold the images. Coleman divorced Shannon Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage in a Provo, Utah, hospital. ""Knowing Gary, as well as anyone could have, I assure his closest family, friends and fans that his disdain for this behavior would be unquestionable and paramount to any foregoing profession of 'love' for Shannon that might have ever poured from his lips,"" Dion Mial said in an e-mail to CNN. Price, 24, did not deny Mial's accusation, but she did say in a statement from her publicist that she needed money because she had helped Mial pay for a lawyer. ""Dion, who claims to be a good friend of Gary, would know that Gary's only wishes were to make sure that Shannon would be OK after he was gone,"" Price's statement said. ""So if Dion was a good friend he would be assisting Shannon, not taking all her money, to pay for his attorney and then use it to take everything from her."" Mial, a longtime friend and former manager of Coleman's, was named in the actor's will to be executor of his estate, according to a lawyer for Coleman's parents. Price's statement said Coleman made a comment just a day before his fatal fall, distancing himself from the man whom he had named executor. ""He said that he had not been friends with Dion for years,"" her statement said. ""When asked why, Gary said, 'All good things come to an end.' Gary was stating that he had a falling out with Dion and did not wish to be close friends with him anymore. I can see why now by the way that Dion is also turning on Shannon as well."" Mial did not immediately respond to Price's Monday statement, but in an earlier statement he told CNN that Coleman's ex-wife ""has absolutely no rights or authority with regard to the disposition of Gary's remains, services, estate management."" ""In light of Shannon Price's ongoing desperate attempts to profit from the mysterious death of her 'beloved husband,' by way of the sale and/or distribution of pre- or post-mortem 'death photos,' moment-to-moment television interviews for pay, video tours of her former home, Gary Coleman's personal effects, photographs or any items that have been removed from the home, without the written consent of a special administrator for or the executor of the Coleman estate, I emphatically request that all solicitations from Shannon, or from any individual holding themselves out as her representative, be categorically denied and refused,"" Mial said. Celebrity news website TMZ said Monday that its representatives were shown one of the death photos but declined to look at others. ""In the pic, Gary is in the hospital, his eyes are closed, and he is hooked up to a ventilation machine. It is not a pleasant sight,"" TMZ said. Funeral plans for Coleman are ""pending"" more than a week after his death, Mial said. Coleman's parents dropped their bid to have the actor's body returned to Chicago, Illinois, for burial after their lawyer was shown the will naming Mial as executor, the lawyer said. Coleman's relationship with his parents was strained after he sued them 20 years ago for $1 million, claiming that they squandered his earnings as a child actor. Mial became Coleman's manager when he fired his parents. Mial was a close companion of Coleman's when he was a child actor on the TV show ""Diff'rent Strokes."" The body of the 42-year-old actor was at Lake Hills Mortuary in Sandy, Utah, as of Friday, the mortuary's legal department said. Despite their divorce, Price had the legal authority to authorize his doctor to disconnect his life support, the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo said. ""Mr. Coleman had completed an Advanced Health Care Directive that granted Shannon Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf if he was unable to do so,"" said the hospital statement, which Price authorized. The document was in effect when the decision to remove Coleman from life support was made May 28, the hospital said. ""An Advanced Health Care Directive remains in effect regardless of a patient's marital status, unless modified by the patient,"" the hospital statement said. Coleman was best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. ""There was a touch of magic and a different stroke in Gary Coleman,"" said TV legend Norman Lear, who produced the show. ""He was the inspiration behind his show's title.""

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Just after Apple CEO Steve Jobs debuted the next version of his company's iPhone to the world, the tech luminary had a bit of technical trouble. ""Well jeez,"" Jobs said, struggling to get the spanking new iPhone 4 to do much of anything without a connection to a Wi-Fi network. The technical faux pas came during Jobs' keynote address at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California. At one point, Jobs turned toward the audience and seemed to ask a question of one of his technical directors: ""Got any suggestions?"" he asked. ""Verizon!"" shouted an audience member, in reference to the fact that AT&T, the sole cellular network that carriers the Apple iPhone, gets notoriously bad reception in San Francisco. Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless. That didn't happen on Monday. The new iPhone will remain an AT&T-only device. It goes on sale on June 24 to AT&T customers for $199 or $299, depending on the amount of storage. Any AT&T customer eligible for a phone upgrade this year can get the iPhone 4 on its debut date at those subsidized prices, Jobs said. After the event, tech industry analysts warned against reading too much into the network glitches during Jobs' presentation. But, if nothing else, they do symbolize the growing frustration some phone consumers have over the lack of choice among wireless carriers. In a recent interview, for instance, Kevin Tofel, a blogger in the GigaOm network, said it is smartest for consumers to pick a wireless carrier first, rather than get the coolest phone. Otherwise, they're buying an ""expensive brick,"" he said. Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network. ""It's Wi-Fi,"" said Carolina Milanesi, research director for mobile devices at Gartner. ""You had so many people in there using Wi-Fi. I didn't read too much into it."" Of AT&T, she laughed and said, ""It's not always their fault."" Van Baker, research vice-president for Gartner, said the ""Verizon!"" comment from the audience was ""totally unfair ... because it's not going over the 3G network."" Jobs eventually resolved the issue himself. In a joking yet stern tone, he asked reporters and conference attendees to stop using Wi-Fi networks so that he could finish the presentation. Some 570 Wi-Fi stations were clogging up the connection he needed to complete the presentation, he said. If the attendees didn't comply, he said, he would simply not be able to show off the rest of the iPhone 4's new features, including its higher-resolution screen, improved camera and video chat functionality -- which, by the way, is only available over Wi-Fi.","Apple CEO Steve Jobs has internet trouble during a presentation .

"(CNN) -- American missiles were used in an attack that killed 55 people, including 41 civilians, in southern Yemen, Amnesty International said Monday. The human rights organization released what it said were photographs of a U.S.-manufactured cruise missile used in the December attack in the community of al-Ma'jalah, and said authorities must be held accountable. ""Based on the evidence provided by these photographs, the U.S. government must disclose what role it played in the al Ma'jalah attack, and all governments involved must show what steps they took to prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries,"" said Philip Luther, deputy director of the organization's Middle East and North Africa program. Asked about the report, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said, ""I would refer you to the Yemeni government for any information on operations against al Qaeda in their country. That said, the Yemen government should be commended for dealing with the al Qaeda threat in their nation. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatens the stability of the region and poses an increasing threat to Yemenis and Americans. We strongly support actions against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and cooperate closely with Yemen and other countries on counterterrorism initiatives."" The government of Yemen has not yet been reached for comment. Yemeni government officials had said the December 17, 2009, attack in southern Yemen targeted an al Qaeda training camp, according to Amnesty International. The attack killed 55 people, including 14 alleged members of the terrorist group, the organization said. Civilians killed included 14 women and 21 children, Amnesty International said. Amnesty International said the photos were provided to the organization by a confidential source. It said the organization had spent months checking their contents with specialists, but teams from Amnesty International had not yet been able to visit the site to verify the images. In December, senior U.S. officials told CNN U.S. special operations forces and intelligence agencies, and their Yemeni counterparts, were working to identify potential al Qaeda targets in Yemen. This was part of a new classified agreement with the Yemeni government that the two countries will work together and that the United States will remain publicly silent on its role in providing intelligence and weapons to conduct strikes, the officials said. Officially the United States has not said it conducted previous airstrikes in Yemen, but officials have privately said the Yemeni military could not have carried out the strikes on its own. Washington began eyeing the impoverished desert nation as a possible new haven for al Qaeda as early as 2001, after the invasion of Afghanistan triggered by the group's attacks on New York and Washington. It's the ancestral homeland of al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, whose followers bombed the destroyer USS Cole in a Yemeni port a year before the 9/11 attacks. In December the country became the target of more scrutiny after U.S. officials said the suspect in the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight over Detroit had trained at a camp in Yemen.","Amnesty International says U.S.-made cruise missiles used in attack .

"(CNN) -- A killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando died Sunday while giving birth, the theme park said. The calf was stillborn. The father of the calf was Tilikum -- the killer whale involved in death of a trainer in February. SeaWorld canceled two shows on Sunday, but all shows were expected to resume Monday. ""We are very saddened by this loss,"" said Chris Dold, vice president of veterinary services for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.  ""Although we understand that complications with pregnancy can occur here, just as they do in the wild, the loss of any animal affects all of us at SeaWorld."" Taima, a 20-year-old killer whale, died from complications associated with the birthing process, SeaWorld said. Taima had successfully given birth to three calves previously. ""Preliminary indications suggest that her death was caused by a condition in which the placenta is delivered before the fetus, as well as an unusual position of the fetus in the birthing canal,"" SeaWorld said.  ""She was not able to deliver the stillborn fetus naturally; SeaWorld's veterinarians attempted to assist, but her complications were too severe."" SeaWorld has had 26 successful births of killer whale calves in captivity, according to Dold, who said the birthing success rate is about 50 percent in the wild and 85 percent in a ""zoological situation."" A necropsy has been scheduled to determine the cause of death.","Killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando dies giving birth .

"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- As if the pictures of birds, fish and animals killed by floating oil in the Gulf of Mexico are not disturbing enough, scientists now say they have found evidence of another danger lurking underwater. The University of South Florida recently discovered a second oil plume in the northeastern Gulf. The first plume was found by Mississippi universities in early May. USF has concluded microscopic oil droplets are forming deep water oil plumes. After a weeklong analysis of water samples, USF scientists found more oil in deeper water. ""These hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking degraded oil but associated with the source of the Deep Horizon well head,"" said USF Chemical Oceanographer David Hollander. Through isotopic or microscopic fingerprinting, Hollander and his USF crew were able to show the oil in the plume came from BP's blown-out oil well. The surface oil's so-called fingerprint matched the tiny underwater droplet's fingerprint. ""We've taken molecular isotopic approaches which is like a fingerprint on a smoking gun,"" Hollander said. Full coverage of oil spill . BP has not commented on the latest development but in the past denied underwater oil plumes exist. ""The oil is on the surface,"" said BP's Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward. ""There aren't any plumes."" Yet BP's Managing Director Bob Dudley said recently, ""We're all absolutely taking these ideas seriously and looking at them."" Scientists on board the university's research vessel Weatherbird II were not able to find the dissolved hydrocarbon or oil by sight. Instead the crew received sensor signatures from the equipment deployed into the water since the plumes appear to be clear. Are you there? Send us your photos . USF is unsure on the exact size of the plumes. ""There are indications this is fairly wide spread,"" said the USF oceanographer. ""There is probably more than one leg of this plume."" Scientist are concerned what effect the oil, not to mention the dissolvents used to break up the oil, will have on marine life. Laboratory tests show bacteria have begun eating some elements of the dissolved hydrocarbons. But the effect on fish ""is what needs to be understood,"" said Hollander. ""We are in uncharted territory."" Impact your world: How to help . Water samples collected by USF were sent to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration labs. NOAA has yet to comment on their conclusions. NOAA and USF will hold a joint press conference Tuesday morning at the university's St. Petersburg campus to release their final findings.","Scientists discover second oil plume .

"(CNN) -- Seven people were electrocuted during heavy storms that hit the port city of Karachi after Cyclone Phet battered parts of southern Pakistan on Sunday, a provincial health chief told CNN. Phet lashed Pakistan's southwestern coast early Sunday as it approached landfall. The Pakistani navy dispatched helicopters throughout the weekend to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan of the cyclone. About 1,000 people were rescued from Gwadar by Pakistani authorities and taken to a navy shelter on Saturday. Dr. Sagheer Ahmed, health minister of Sindh province, had no other details on the electrocutions.

"(CNN) -- Israel acknowledged Sunday that it edited recordings of what it said were anti-Semitic and anti-American radio calls by pro-Palestinian activists who tried to run the Gaza blockade and that it could not identify the origin of the broadcasts. The Israeli military released a 26-second recording Friday night in which a warning call to a ship in the flotilla was met with the reply of ""Shut up -- go back to Auschwitz."" After another voice reports that the convoy has the permission of Palestinian officials to dock in Gaza, a third voice responds, ""We are helping Arabs going against the U.S. Don't forget 9/11, guys."" But after the organizers of the aid convoy accused Israeli officials of manipulating the tapes, the Israel Defense Forces reported it had mistakenly identified one of the six ships in the activists' ""Freedom Flotilla"" as the source of the broadcasts. And it released a nearly six-minute recording of radio traffic that included those calls and several others, along with bursts of static and calls in other languages on the same channel. ""So to clarify: The audio was edited down to cut out periods of silence over the radio as well as incomprehensible comments so as to make it easier for people to listen to the exchange,"" the Israeli military said in a statement posted on its Web site. And it added, ""Due to an open channel, the specific ship or ships in the 'Freedom Flotilla' responding to the Israeli Navy could not be identified."" Israeli commandos intercepted the convoy at sea on May 31 and stormed the largest vessel, the Turkish-flagged Mavi Marmara, killing nine people aboard. The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been blockaded by Israel since its takeover by the Islamic movement Hamas in 2007, and the deadly raid sparked international condemnation. Convoy organizers from Free Gaza said Israel ""doctored"" the recordings ""in order to paint the flotilla passengers as anti-Semites."" The group denied its vessels were the source of the broadcasts and said the Israeli accusations made ""no more sense with the explanation."" ""All radio transmissions on the sea are heard by all captains,"" the group said. ""Once again, Israel is caught in a lie trying to defend itself for the murder and mayhem it committed the morning of May 31, 2010."" On the full recording, an Israeli warship hails one of the vessels in the flotilla to warn it was approaching a blockade zone and warned that ""all necessary measures"" would be taken to prevent it from docking in Gaza. After three warnings, Free Gaza activist Huwaida Arraf replied that the blockade was a violation of international law and that the convoy was carrying only humanitarian aid. ""We do not carry anything that constitutes a threat to your armed forces,"" she says on the recording.","Edits made for easier listening, Israel says .

"(CNN)  -- Rapper Lil Wayne was detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Texas on Friday after authorities found marijuana on two of his tour buses. The marijuana on the buses was detected by a drug dog, said Agent Joe Trevino. The rapper, whose real name is DeWayne Michael Carter, Jr., was among a dozen being detained from his group. They were later released. Trevino said the buses were en route to Laredo, Texas, from a concert stop in Hidalgo. The case has been referred to the Brooks County Sheriff's Office. Calls to Carter's representatives were not immediately returned Friday. The Louisiana native was the 2008 best-selling artist, with 2.8 million records sold, and is signed to Cash Money Records. The rapper is scheduled to begin a prison sentence in February stemming from gun charges in New York.","Rapper Lil Wayne was detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Texas on Friday .

"London, England (CNN) -- Two nine-month-old twin girls were in a serious condition in hospital on Monday after being mauled by a fox as they slept in their London home, according to police. The two girls were attacked in their upstairs bedroom at a house in Hackney, east London, after the fox apparently entered the house through a door left open because of the heat while the twins' parents watched television downstairs, police said. ""Officers and the London Ambulance Service attended and found two nine-month-old girls with injuries,"" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN. ""Both babies were taken to an east London hospital where their condition is described as serious but stable."" A fox caught in a trap placed at the rear of the property by local environmental officers was destroyed early on Monday, the spokesman said. ""On Sunday night a neighbor informed environmental health officers that an animal could be heard in one of the traps,"" he said. ""A vet was called to establish if it was safe to move the animal. It was determined it was not and the fox was humanely killed by the pest controller... The traps will remain in situ for the time being."" The twins, Lola and Isabella Koupparis, are being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital. The twins' four-year-old brother, who was also asleep upstairs, was not hurt, the UK's Press Association said. The girls' mother, Pauline Koupparis, told the BBC she had gone to check on the twins after hearing ""a funny cry, not a normal cry"" from the bedroom. ""It was quite muffled but very pained. I went into the room and I saw some blood in Isabella's cot, I thought she had a nosebleed. ""I put on the light, I saw the fox, it just looked at me and it wasn't even scared of me. I started screaming as I realised Lola was also covered in blood."" Foxes are a common sight throughout London, especially in Hackney which backs onto the green spaces of Hackney Marshes, the Lea Valley Regional Park and the new Olympic site. A neighbor of the family told PA: ""We've all got foxes at the bottom of our gardens. Some people have got two or three living in their garden. They're all as bold as brass. You walk out into the garden and you have to shoo them away."" Of the twin girls, she said: ""They're beautiful little babies, really beautiful."" Michael Parra, another neighbor, said police had warned residents not to leave doors open in the summer weather. ""We see a lot of foxes around here. They're always in our garden. Something should be done about them. I would love to get them out of here. They're really a nuisance and a danger. They've terrorized our garden."" A Hackney Council spokesman said the council didn't have dedicated environmental officers to deal with foxes but had called in a private contractor over the incident. He said the council usually received ""one or two phone calls a month"" from people concerned about foxes going through their trash. ""We have never had reports in the past of foxes attacking residents,"" the spokesman told CNN. ""All the expert advice we have had suggests that shocking incidents like this are incredibly rare, and our thoughts are with the children and their family.""","Twin girls were asleep in upstairs bedroom when attack occured .

"New York (CNN) -- New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced Monday lawsuits to permanently shut down three Brooklyn-based companies that targeted Haitian communities with fraudulent immigration services. The companies and their owners, who are not lawyers, are accused of illegally providing legal advice and services to Haitian immigrants, charging them thousands of dollars to process immigration applications that could be filed for a nominal fee or free through a waiver. Further, as non-lawyers, the owners are prohibited from providing legal advice or representing anyone before immigration authorities, according a press release from Cuomo's office. The lawsuits also seek to compensate the victims. ""In light of the recent devastating earthquake in Port-au-Prince, New York's Haitian residents have sadly been a target for immigration scams, bringing further pain to a community that has already suffered so much,"" Cuomo said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security allowed all Haitians residing in the United States as of January 12, when the powerful earthquake struck the island nation, to stay in the country for 18 months to seek Temporary Protected Status. After that announcement, the attorney general's office received complaints that Haitian immigrants were targeted by companies offering fraudulent and illegal immigration services at high prices. ""These cases are a part of the Attorney General's ongoing crackdown on immigration scams throughout New York,"" Cuomo wrote in the statement. ""I urge anyone who has been affected by this type of fraud to contact my office."" The lawsuits were filed against Chay Pa Lou Community Center Inc., Delegue Tax Consultant Inc. and their owner and operator, Jean Michel; and Rincher's Multi-Service, also known as Rincher Bookstore, Rincher Associates and Haitian American Entrepreneur's Group LLC, and its owners and operators, Deslande Seixas-Rincher and Sharlene Seixas-Rincher. According to Cuomo's statement, Michel's companies face liability for more than 100 known violations; the companies owned and operated by the Seixas-Rinchers face liability for more than 30 known violations. In addition, Cuomo's office has obtained a court order against Chay Pa Lou Community Center Inc., freezing its assets and precluding it from destroying documents and transferring assets. Calls to the three Brooklyn-based companies for comment were not returned. New York state law requires anyone providing immigration services to comply with advertising, signage and surety requirements, and to give consumers written contracts in both the consumer's native language and English that detail their services and cancellation policy. Furthermore, it is illegal to mislead or defraud any person in immigration-related services. The Office of the Attorney General said it will coordinate with several New York legal associations to help handle the companies' existing cases and to protect victims.","Companies accused of targeting Haitian community with fraudulent immigration services .

"(CNN) -- The crew of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon may have been overworked and short of key personnel before the explosion that unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history, a leading Democratic congressman suggested Tuesday. Payroll records show that 20 crewmen -- including seven of the 11 who died on the rig -- had worked a 24-hour shift six days before the explosion, Rep. Nick Rahall wrote in a letter to Steven Newman, CEO of rig owner Transocean Ltd. Rig workers typically work 12-hour days. And records showed only 18 people at work on the second shift on April 20, the night of the explosion, ""with zero engineers, electricians, mechanics or subsea supervisors listed in the report,"" he added. ""Although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it, when combined with the ongoing BP internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster, I have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of April 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed, or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role,"" wrote Rahall, D-West Virginia, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Rahall called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request Transocean said it would meet. But Transocean said no worker put in a 24-hour day, and the documents Rahall cited didn't tell the whole picture. Daily drilling reports track operations and ""certain personnel,"" it said, ""but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember."" ""At the time of the accident, the Deepwater Horizon and its crew had compiled seven consecutive years of operations without a single lost-time safety incident,"" the company said in a written statement. ""The vessel was properly and professionally manned; there was no shortage of technical expertise, nor did any crewmember work a 24-hour shift."" CNN was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up Transocean's claim that no employees worked 24-hour shifts on April 14 -- six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig. And other documents reviewed by CNN seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that don't show up on time sheets, possibly refuting the committee's claim the rig was shortstaffed on April 20. Transocean, well owner BP and oilfield services contractor Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster that followed the explosion. The undersea well the rig was drilling has been gushing up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico since late April. Rahall's committee is one of several in both houses of Congress to hold hearings into the spill, which now dwarfs 1989's Exxon Valdez disaster. In addition, a presidential commission and a Coast Guard-Interior Department board in Louisiana are investigating. BP reported problems controlling the well and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in March, according to documents released in late May. Stephen Stone, a laborer on the doomed rig, told the House Judiciary Committee that drilling had to stop four times in three weeks because of the loss of drilling fluid, ""either because the underground formation was unstable or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack."" The well was five weeks behind schedule, and some of the survivors have told CNN that BP cut corners and pushed ahead with the well despite safety concerns. In addition, Doug Brown, the rig's chief mechanic, told the Judiciary Committee that BP and Transocean managers argued over drill plans the day of the explosion and that cuts to Deepwater Horizon's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform.","New:  Transocean documents appear to refute lawmaker's claims .

"(CNN) -- In a secretly recorded audiotape, the alleged ringleader of an anti-government Michigan militia expresses anger over the ""new world order"" and the ""brotherhood,"" of law enforcement officers. ""In this nation, we think we are free, but you need a certificate to be born, a license to drive, a permit to build, a number to get a job and even a paper after you die,"" says David Bryan Stone Sr., 45, the alleged head of the Hutaree militia, accused of conspiring to overthrow the government and plotting to kill police officers. ""These are permission slips from the terrorists organization called the new world order,"" Stone says in the tape, which was recorded clandestinely by an FBI agent who infiltrated the militia and obtained exclusively by CNN. Government prosecutors played the recording during an April 2 bond hearing for alleged Hutaree members, arguing that the defendants would be a danger to the community and a flight risk if they were freed on bail before trial. A federal magistrate in Detroit, Michigan, agreed and ordered eight militia suspects to be held in jail pending their trial. Stone, his sons, Joshua, 21, and David Brian Stone Jr., 19; as well as the eldest Stone's wife, Tina Stone, 44, have been charged with seditious conspiracy, attempted use of weapons of mass destruction, teaching the use of explosive materials and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence. Joshua John Clough, 28; Kristopher Sickles, 27; Michael David Meeks, 40; Jacob Ward, 33; and Thomas Piatek, 46, face the same charges. Piatek, of Whiting, Indiana, is being held in Indiana. The eight ordered held in Michigan have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors said the tape was recorded last winter when Hutaree members were driving to Kentucky for a meeting with other militias but were forced to turn back due to bad weather. Stone allegedly gave a speech inside the van. ""People in this nation as well as some around this world are waiting for those individuals like you see sitting in this room to actually make the decision to go to war against this evil, greedy new world order,"" Stone says on the tape. ""They need leaders who are not afraid to stand up and actually mean, 'No more.' We are free and we should not be afraid or ashamed to admit that we are the American militia. We outnumber them. As long as we let them terrorize any American through fear and intimidation, then they are winning this battle and we should step up to the fight that they have started and finish it."" Defense attorneys dismissed the tape as just talk -- words protected under freedom of speech. But prosecutors have portrayed the Hutaree militia as a dark-hearted group with evil intent. They said Stone's plan was to create his own country carved out of four Michigan counties, then defend that country against attack by the ""One World Order"" army. The group allegedly planned to incite that attack by making a false 911 complaint, shooting any police who responded, and then attacking attendees at the funerals of those officers with improvised explosive devices. ""Every day, we watch ever so close for those evil blue helmets to appear on our streets -- but as long as through Interpol, law enforcement mercenaries called the brotherhood working for the new world order are doing such a great job, then we don't need to watch for these foreign armies to come to our shores. They are already here,"" Stone says. Conviction on the charge of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, while seditious conspiracy and teaching the use of explosive materials each would carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; the firearm charge would carry a mandatory minimum penalty of at least five years in prison, according to authorities.","Tape recorded last winter when Hutaree members were driving to Kentucky .

In fact, most won't be voting for quite a few years. But that doesn't mean that they have no interest in the race for the White House between Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. As evidenced in videos posted at iReport.com, they care a great deal. Several of these videos were put together by school classes, like Matt MacFarlane's 7th and 8th graders at Templeton Middle School in Templeton, California, who made a short video on the importance of voting. The students called for a ""person with integrity who knows right from wrong"", ""a person of vision who not only knows what is but also what can be,"" ""a person with a moral compass to help [set] a course for our nation,"" and ""a person who has the ability to unite and inspire us as we face challenging times.""

We're counting on you."" iReport.com: Watch the full video from Mr. MacFarlane's class . Some children took to portraying the candidates, complete with clothes and wigs, like the students of Cabot Middle School in Cabot, Arkansas. All of the presidential and vice presidential ""candidates"" gave speeches, with Secret Service, prospective first ladies and family members in tow. Most members of Gov. Sarah Palin's family were present, including a baby doll portraying Trig. This video was just a part of their learning experience about presidential elections. Library media specialist Jill Weir, who submitted the video to iReport.com, said that the students also participated in mock-campaigning, voter registrations, precincts and exit polling. iReport.com: The 'candidates' speak . A church youth group in Winter Haven, Florida, took a more humorous approach, putting together campaign ads from ""John McHinkle"" and ""Barack Yo Mama,"" featuring cameos from ""Sarah Mailin'"" and ""Joe Hidin'"". It was still a learning experience, though, said Pastor James Blewett, who posted two videos to iReport.com  in which the pretend candidates teach lessons about dating and parental conflicts. iReport.com: Watch the campaign ad spoofs . Some iReporters decided to ask children directly what they thought about the election. ""I have a 6-year-old and he watches the debates with me,"" Vijay Sureshkumar of Seattle, Washington, said. ""He's interested in what's going on and that's what triggered me. Why don't I go around the neighborhood and ask the kids?"" The responses he got were both funny and thought-provoking. Some children saw the war as a major issue, one wanted more funding for education, and another said he was in favor of drilling for oil in Alaska. Some children seemed to be in favor of Obama, some for McCain, at least one liked both, and two of them started yelling at each other over which candidate was better. When asked about the candidates' families, one boy could easily name Obama's wife and daughters' names. When asked about McCain, he was a little fuzzier. ""He's been around for a long time. Like he's been around, [since] like 1966.""  iReport.com: Kids sound off on the election . Tony Stampalia of Utica, New York, had a similar idea, asking students in an elementary school class whom they would vote for, based purely on the pictures of the candidates. Stampalia said that it was a tie between McCain and Obama, with one child for Ralph Nader. Obama ""voters"" in the class voted for their candidate because ""he has a cool suit,"" ""because he has the hair,"" ""because he has a nice smile."" One Obama voter mistook him for President Bush, while another wore an Obama button but said she was supporting Sen. Hillary Clinton. McCain ""voters"" in the class liked his blue shirt and tie, and thought he was ""cute."" One liked his ""white hair."" Another one found that McCain ""made people do good stuff,"" but admitted that Obama did the same. All the children seemed to agree that ""your vote counts."" iReport.com: Children pick their favorite candidate . Of course, this is not quite the first election in which children were asked about their choice for president. The Scholastic Election Poll has been doing that for at least 68 years. Poll takers said their poll has reflected the outcome of the actual election all but twice since 1940.  A quarter of a million students participated in the poll.  This year, Obama won with 57 percent to McCain's 39 percent. In many videos on iReport.com, children and teenagers speak out for their candidate of choice. In one case, a 4th grader named Liam Coakley of Long Beach, California went the extra mile by setting up a lemonade stand for Obama. iReport.com: Lemonade stand for Obama . Trisha Prabhu, 8, of Naperville, Illinois, was so excited about Obama's candidacy that she told her mother Bhanu to make a video of her giving reasons to vote for him. iReport.com: Watch Prabhu's video . Trevor Dougherty of Ithaca, New York, said in a video: ""I'm 16 years old and in this presidential election, I cannot vote. That's why I'm begging you this November, if you can, to get out this November and vote."" Trevor has been following the election very closely, and first submitted an iReport while en route to the Democratic National Convention. As part of the ""Voter Vlog Tag"" movement, Dougherty went out and registered voters in his hometown, then submitted the video evidence to iReport.com.

"(CNN) -- A GOP-inspired effort to tinker with the Electoral College machinery in California is raising alarm bells among Democrats who fear it could doom the party's chances of winning the White House in 2008. A GOP-led group submitted a proposal to state Attorney General Jerry Brown that could sway the '08 presidential race. Democrats have come to rely on California's block of 55 electoral votes -- the largest haul available in any state -- as part of their arithmetic to win the presidency with a majority in the Electoral College. A group called Californians for Equal Representation has submitted a ballot initiative to state Attorney General Jerry Brown that would change the current statewide winner-take-all system to a formula based on congressional districts. Republicans say the idea is aimed at attracting presidential candidates to campaign in California, which they rarely do because the statewide vote traditionally leans Democratic. Opponents call the proposal an attempt to grab Democratic votes. Under the proposal, the winning candidate in each of the state's 53 congressional districts would get one electoral vote, with two votes going to the statewide winner. Supporters want to put the proposal on the ballot for next June's state primary, which would put the change into effect for the 2008 election. Do to so, supporters will have to collect about 434,000 petition signatures from registered voters by November 13, according to the secretary of state's office. In the 2006 election, Californians elected 34 Democrats and 19 Republicans to the House. Had the proposed system been in effect in 2004, President Bush would have captured 22 of California's electoral votes. The extra electoral votes would have eliminated Bush's need to carry the pivotal state of Ohio to win re-election. ""This would all but guarantee that the Republican nominee would get 20 extra Electoral College votes, which could certainly impact the outcome of the election,"" said Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican strategist. And that is exactly what has Democrats crying foul. ""The Republicans are doing this in California because they want a chunk of our vote,"" said Darry Sragow, a Democratic strategist. The ballot initiative was submitted by Thomas Hiltachk, a Sacramento election lawyer who is also general counsel for Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. The purpose of the change is to make California more relevant in presidential elections by forcing candidates to campaign in the state, according to the initiative. ""Because this is a reliable Democratic state, none of the presidential candidates -- Republican or Democrat -- ever shows up in California,"" Hoffenblum said. On the other side of the divide, Democrats argue that California shouldn't make such a change when the vast majority of other states still operate under a winner-take-all system. ""This is very fair if it's universal around the country,"" Sragow said. ""It is patently absurd it if only takes place in certain states."" Under the Constitution, each state gets a number of electoral votes equal to its representation in Congress, including both representatives and senators. Currently, 48 states award all of their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the largest number of votes. Two states -- Nebraska and Maine -- have adopted the system that is being proposed for California, assigning their electoral votes based on who wins individual congressional districts, with the statewide winner getting the two votes derived from senators. But this has not generated controversy because both states have just a handful of votes, and the results have never resulted in splitting them between candidates. Ironically, while Democrats are up in arms in California over the idea of changing the Electoral College rules, their compatriots in Republican-leaning North Carolina have floated the idea of adopting the Nebraska-Maine system for their state. However, national Democratic leaders have tried to discourage that effort, because of concerns it would be difficult to support such a change in North Carolina, where it would help the party, while opposing it in California. The change also would help Democrats much less in North Carolina than it would hurt in California. In 2004, the Democratic presidential nominee, Sen. John Kerry, would have garnered three more votes in North Carolina, while losing 22 in California. The disputed 2000 election, in which Bush won the electoral vote while losing the popular vote, has generated a flurry of proposals to abolish or alter the Electoral College, both at the federal and state level. In 2006, Colorado voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have divided up the electoral vote pie in proportion to each candidates' share of the popular vote. A group called National Popular Vote also is lobbying state legislatures to adopt a system where all of a state's electoral votes would be pledged to the winner of the national popular vote -- an idea which, if adopted by states holding a majority of electoral votes, would ensure that the popular vote winner always became president. While National Popular Vote says its plan has been introduced in 47 states, Maryland is the only one so far to pass it. And the change won't go into effect in Maryland until it gains approval in enough states to ensure that the popular vote winner would take the White House. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- Veteran Los Angeles Lakers guard Derek Fisher has been praised by his teammates after helping the defending champions to a 91-84 victory over the Boston Celtics in the third game of the best-of-seven series NBA finals. As Lakers star Kobe Bryant's points tally began to dry up, the 35-year-old scored 11 points in the last quarter to seal victory for his team and a 2-1 series advantage. With less than a minute to go he produced a crucial layup that gave the West Coast side a seven-point lead which the Celtics could not recover from. Bryant, who finished with a team-high 29 points from 29 shots, was full of praise for Fisher -- who scored 16 in total and was mobbed by his teammates at the final whistle. ""Fisher is our vocal leader, the heart and soul of this team,"" Bryant told the official Lakers Web site. ""He's been criticized quite a bit for his age. It's a huge thrill for him and for all of us to see him come through in these moments."" Game two: Celtics level series . ""I love what I do. I love helping my team win,"" Fisher added on his team's official Web site. ""To come through tonight, again, for this team, 14 years in after so many great moments, it's always quite surreal."" Celtics coach Doc Rivers, whose team last won the NBA title back in 2008, also admitted that Fisher's performance played a pivotal role in the Lakers win. ""He was the difference in the game,""  Rivers told the official NBA Web site. ""He's just a gutty, gritty player. He basically took the game over."" Game one: Lakers win opener . Rivers' East Coast team lost the first game of the series in Los Angeles on June 3 but took home-court advantage away from the Californians, beating them in the second game on June 6. Play now remains in Boston for game four on Thursday, and the New England side will be hoping they can once again get the better of the Lakers, this time on their home court. ""You can't really write the story until the next game. As a team we're just going to come out and play with a lot of energy,"" the Celtics' Rajon Rondo, who scored just 11 points in what was a disappointing night for his team, told the official NBA Web site. ""I think we lost our composure tonight in a couple possessions and that hurt us."" After two poor games, Kevin Garnett was Boston's top scorer with 25 points. But off-days from Paul Pierce and Ray Allen -- who scored an impressive 32 in game two -- allowed the Lakers to open up a lead of 12 points at halftime. The Celtics did attempt a comeback in the second half, reducing their opponents' advantage to just one, but they were not strong enough to overtake the Lakers. The Lakers are defending the title they won against Orlando last year, while the Celtics are looking to reclaim the crown they have won a record 17 times -- their last victory coming over the L.A. side in 2008.","L.A.

Coleman's parents are working with lawyers to gain custody of his body, their spokesman told CNN. Coleman divorced Shannon Price in 2008, but he signed a document giving her power to make the decision, according to a statement from the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center in Provo. ""Mr. Coleman had completed an Advanced Health Care Directive that granted Shannon Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf if he was unable to do so,"" said the statement, which Price authorized. Coleman's attorney confirmed for CNN that the couple divorced nearly two years ago, but he did not know if they had remarried since then. Coleman, 42, and Price, 24, were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fatal fall last week. ""An Advanced Health Care Directive remains in effect regardless of a patient's marital status, unless modified by the patient,"" the hospital statement said. The document was in effect when the decision to remove Coleman from life support was made last Friday, the hospital said. Coleman suffered from a brain hemorrhage from a fall at his home on May 26. He died two days later after he was removed from life support, a hospital spokeswoman said. While he appeared ""lucid and conscious"" Thursday morning, his condition worsened by the afternoon, leaving him unconscious and on life support, she said. He died Friday after he was removed from life support, she said. His parents, who live in Chicago, are hoping to learn more about how their son died, their spokesman, Victor Perillo, said. SInce Coleman was not married when he died, they believe they have a right to his remains, Perillo said.  They are working with a lawyer to get the paperwork done so Coleman can be transported to Chicago, he said. Coleman is best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on TV's ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. ""There was a touch of magic and a different stroke in Gary Coleman,"" said TV legend Norman Lear, who produced the show. ""He was the inspiration behind his show's title."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.","Lawyer: Gary Coleman and Shannon Price divorced in 2008 .

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League won a landslide victory in Bangladesh's first national elections in seven years, claiming nearly 230 of the 300 seats in parliament, the country's electoral commission reported. Supporters of Bangladesh's Awami League Party celebrate in Dhaka on Monday. With 295 contests decided, the Awami League had won 228 seats, giving it far more than the two-thirds majority needed to change the country's constitution, the commission reported. The league's closest rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, won 27 seats, with one seat to be contested later. The results are an overwhelming win for Hasina over her longtime archrival, the BNP's Khaleda Zia, in the first vote since an army-backed caretaker government took power in 2006. The rivalry between the two former prime ministers runs so deep that they are known in the country as the ""Battling Begums,"" for an honorific given to women of rank in the country. Monday's balloting went off peacefully, except for a few isolated incidents of skirmishes and people complaining of not finding their names on voter rolls. Asif Saleh, executive director of the human rights group Drishtipat, told CNN that the turnout was close to 70 percent. ""On one hand, it was sending a clear message that the people of Bangladesh believe in democracy,"" Saleh said. ""But on the other hand it's also that they are looking for a sweeping change in the country."" He said anti-incumbent sentiment appeared to damage the BNP, which was in power for the five years before a 2006 state of emergency that was lifted only weeks ago. ""What was surprising was the kind of scale of the change,"" he said. Political analysts say the true test of whether democracy can flourish in this Muslim-majority nation of 150 million people begins now. After its last stint in power ended in 2006, the BNP handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections, as mandated by the country's constitution. But the Awami League refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government, and Hasina accused Zia of stocking it with BNP backers. Supporters of both sides took to the streets in months of deadly clashes. To stem the tide of violence, a military-backed government took control in January 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency, banning political events and postponing elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics. Zia served a term as prime minister in 1991, Hasina in 1996 and Zia once again in 2001. As one took office, the other led strikes and street protests that kept the Muslim-majority country of 150 million people politically unstable and financially radioactive to international investors. Both face allegations of corruption, which each have dismissed as politically motivated. And Hasina was forced to curtail her campaign activities, relying on videoconferencing to address crowds as police investigated a report by CNN-IBN that a fundamentalist Muslim group had dispatched a six-member suicide squad to assassinate her. The group, Harkat ul Jihad al Islami is banned in Bangladesh. Hasina survived a prior attempt on her life in 2004 when extremists threw grenades at a rally, killing 20 and wounding hundreds. Past elections in Bangladesh have been marred by widespread instances of ballot box-stuffing and voter intimidation. To prevent a similar outcome this go-around, the election commission took unprecedented steps -- deploying 600,000 troops to maintain security and thousands of local and international observers to monitor the polls and issuing voter identification cards to 81 million eligible voters. The caretaker government that took power in 2006 adopted emergency powers that allowed authorities to arrest a person without a court warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was related to a crime, said the New York-based group, Human Rights Watch. A wave of detentions followed, and residents rejoiced at the drop in crime. By some estimates, more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged. The state of emergency was lifted on December 17, leaving politicians less than two weeks to campaign. Among those arrested in the interim were more than 150 top politicians, including Hasina -- charged with taking bribes -- and Zia -- facing charges of graft of improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract.

"(CNN) -- A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever: the body of Bigfoot. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, a pair of Bigfoot-hunting hobbyists from north Georgia, say they found the creature's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive. The carcass of the furry half-man, half-ape is 7 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds, they say. However, the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures. Tom Nelson, chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, said he's ""pretty skeptical"" the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday. ""That would certainly rock mammalogy,"" joked Nelson, who specializes in the study of mammals. ""I see a research grant in my future."" Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto, California, in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc. A photograph on that group's Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large, hairy creature with an ape-like face, stuffed into a large freezer. According to a written release, the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show, ""Squatch Detective,"" several weeks ago. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? ""The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was 'the Real Bigfoot Hunter,' Tom Biscardi,"" Dyer said, referring to Searching for Bigfoot's CEO, who has been looking for the elusive, legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971. Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit. Dyer is a former prison guard. DNA tests on the body have begun, said the statement, and ""extensive scientific studies"" will be done on the body by scientists, including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist and a paleontologist. Nelson, the university professor, acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that, in science, ""we always acknowledge the possibility of something new."" But he said that even in north Georgia, home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail, it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7-foot-tall creatures could have eluded hunters, hikers and creeping development until now. ""To the average person, these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you'll find lions and tigers and bears,"" he said. ""The reality is that you're never more than a mile from a road."" The group says the animal is male, has reddish hair and ""blackish-gray"" eyes and human-like feet, hands and teeth.

"Buras, Louisiana (CNN) -- The sign out front points the way: birds, please enter to the right; humans, enter on the left. Huddled in a pen and covered in brown streaks of oil, a dozen pelicans await treatment after exposure to the pools of crude on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. Increasing numbers of birds are arriving at the Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in this coastal Louisiana town as the environmental disaster in the Gulf stretches on. At least 50 birds were treated on Tuesday alone. Wildlife workers say the birds get oiled when diving for fish. Their efforts at preening sometimes worsen the coating of crude on their feathers. The lucky ones are found by state workers and volunteers in time to save their lives. ""The animals that are coming in are covered in oil,"" the center's Rebecca Dunne says. ""But they are pretty healthy animals. So that makes us feel like like we have a chance to save them. We have been pretty successful so far."" While around 200 birds have been dead on arrival at the center, so far none of the 400 birds brought in alive have died. But not all of them express their gratitude. ""If you let 'em loose, they'll bite ya,"" says one volunteer holding shut the bill of a brown bird tucked under his arm. New arrivals get a physical, and a day to ""de-stress."" Next, it's time for a scrubbing. They're washed with Dawn soap, rinsed and dried. Finally, it's out to the aviary pens out back -- labeled ""pelican island"" -- where they are kept for observation and recovery. On Tuesday, top football stars from the Super Bowl-winning New Orleans Saints came out to thank the center's volunteers. ""It's all about doing whatever we can down here in south Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, to help these people come back,"" quarterback Drew Brees told CNN's John King. After rehab, the birds are scheduled for release in Florida, where they are less likely to repeat their run-in with the spilled oil. But not all birds are so lucky. ""For every bird they rescue, there are other birds that are oiled, but that they couldn't rescue,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal says. ""That is what is so heartbreaking to the people of Louisiana."" The latest Consolidated Fish and Wildlife Collection report says 380 oiled birds and 50 sea turtles have been rescued; 594 birds and 250 sea turtles have been found dead. For better or for worse, more birds are being found and brought in each day. Workers are planning to build eight more receiving pens in the coming days to handle the increasing influx of winged guests.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- A man accused of threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wept Thursday as he talked to his attorney before a federal court hearing. Gregory L. Giusti, 48, was charged with making obscene, threatening or harassing phone calls. He was not asked to submit a plea and remained in custody pending a further hearing. A Justice Department news release said the maximum penalty for the charge was two years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000. Giusti was arrested Wednesday in San Francisco, where Pelosi's home district is located, according to FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler. Pelosi is the top Democrat in the U.S. House and was a leading figure in efforts to win congressional approval of sweeping health care legislation. A statement from Pelosi's office said the arrest occurred ""after an investigation into threats against"" the speaker. It thanked law enforcement officials and said Pelosi would have no further comment at this time. Threats against U.S. senators and representatives increased as Congress completed work last month on the health care bill, which was unanimously opposed by Republicans. In addition, conservative activists around the country protested the bill. Most of the reported threats were against Democrats, though there were some against Republicans. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of a 64-year-old Washington state resident for allegedly issuing death threats against Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, who supported the health care bill. A department statement said the suspect, identified as Charles Alan Wilson of Selah, Washington, made the threats in phone messages to Murray's office between March 22 and April 4. Wilson allegedly stated that Murray ""had a target on her back"" and that he wanted to kill her, according to the statement, which said the threats were in response to congressional passage of the health care bill.

"(CNN) -- A woman in California delivered what may be the nation's second live-born set of octuplets on Monday morning, surprising doctors who expected seven babies. The first three to seven days will be critical for the infants, Dr. Mandhir Gupta said. The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound 8 ounces to 3 pounds 4 ounces -- were generally doing well in incubators following their Caesarean-section delivery at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower, California, doctors said. Three of the babies need breathing assistance, but otherwise the eight don't appear to have serious problems, doctors said at a news conference Monday evening. ""It was a truly amazing delivery,"" said Dr. Karen Maples, chief of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses. The woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest.  Watch doctors explain what happened » . Over a seven-week period, a team of 46 physicians, nurses and other staff prepared for the births. When they started the delivery Monday -- more than nine weeks before the babies would be full term -- they were in for a surprise. ""After we got to Baby G, we were surprised by the discovery of a Baby H,"" Maples said. Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies, said Dr. Harold Henry, the hospital's chief of fetal medicine. ""It is quite easy to miss a baby when you're expecting seven,"" Henry said. The hospital said the woman didn't want her personal information released to the news media, and it would not answer questions about whether she'd had  fertility treatments. Preliminary research indicates this is the second set of live-born octuplets in the United States, according to the hospital. Eight babies believed to be the United States' first set of live octuplets were born in Houston, Texas, in 1998. One of the infants died days after birth. The seven other siblings recently celebrated their 10th birthday, the Houston Chronicle reported last month. The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies, said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, one of the doctors at the news conference. The infants could be in incubators for six to eight weeks and in the hospital for 10 weeks, Gupta said. The mother is doing ""very well"" after the deliveries, which took about five minutes, Gupta said. ""She is very excited that she [has] all these babies and that the babies are looking good so far,"" Gupta said.","Babies may be U.S.'s second set of live-born octuplets, California hospital says .

"(CNN)  -- When you think of iconic tennis venues, top of the list are New York's sprawling Flushing Meadows, the green grass of traditional Wimbledon in London and the rusty red clay of chic Roland Garros in Paris. But next month some of the sport's top players will grace a new stage: the glittering $1.2 billion Cowboys Stadium in Dallas, which hosts Super Bowl XLV next year. U.S. star Serena Williams plays glamorous Russian ace Maria Sharapova in a battle of world number ones present and past, while Texas-based Andy Roddick takes on fellow big-serving American John Isner in the men's match-up. Roddick, who lives in Austin 300 kilometers away, is excited by the prospect of being able to take the freeway to a tournament, as well as his sport breaking new ground in the hot-bed of gridiron. He will be action on July 10, just six days after the men's final at Wimbledon in England, where last year he lost an epic title match to Roger Federer. ""I can drive there. With my friends from home, we might just make a weekend of it and have some fun,"" Roddick said when the Texas event was announced. ""I think it will be cool. I don't know if we're going to fill it, but tennis getting into kind of mainstream venues like that more often is a good thing. Selfishly, I like it."" Roddick's fears over filling the 80,000-seater stadium -- which will expand to around 100,000 for the Super Bowl -- are probably misplaced as the matches will be played across one of the end zones. The configuration will mean a seating capacity of 20,000, but still one of the biggest audiences for a tennis event. The biggest capacity at a regular tournament is 23,200 for the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows during the U.S. Open. The center court at Wimbledon can take 15,000 spectators, and all four players in the Dallas exhibition will be hoping to be involved in the finals of  the grass-court grand slam the weekend before. Williams took the women's singles title last year and Sharapova won in 2004, while Roddick suffered a heartbreaking five-set loss to Federer last year. For the Dallas Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones, it is another string to the bow of their new state-of-the-art stadium. It has already hosted soccer, this year's NBA All-Star game and world title boxing as Filipino sensation Manny Pacquiao beat Ghana's Joshua Clottey earlier this year. ""We have seen the flexibility our new stadium has for holding spectacular events of all kinds, and this event should be like no other,"" Jones said. ""Being able to attract some of the best tennis players in the world under one roof for a night like this will be something special."" Filling big stadiums for tennis one-offs looks set to become a regular feature on the calendar for the world's elite players. Just two days before the Dallas exhibition, Belgian rivals Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin will be looking to break a world record in a battle between two former top-ranked stars in the 40,000-capacity King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels. It is an attempt to break the record crowd of 30,492 that assembled for the legendary ""Battle of the Sexes"" match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs at the Houston Astrodome in Texas in 1973. ""The Best of Belgium"" match is expected to easily surpass that attendance, but maybe Cowboys Stadium will wrest the honor back for the Lone Star state in the future.","Tennis breaks new ground with glittering exhibition in Dallas Cowboys' NFL stadium .

"SLEEPY EYE, Minnesota (CNN) -- The father of a cancer-stricken 13-year-old boy whose mother has fled with him to keep him from undergoing chemotherapy appealed Thursday for her to bring him home. Doctors say Daniel Hauser's lymphoma responded well to a first round of chemotherapy in February. ""Please bring Danny home so that we can decide as a family what Danny's treatment should be,"" Anthony Hauser said, directing his halting comments to his wife, Colleen, as he stood in front of television cameras outside the family's house. ""I know you're scared and I feel that you left out of fear, maybe without thinking it all the way through,"" he continued. ""Danny is my son and the rest of the family is worried sick about Danny, how he is and how he's going to come out. ""Please call me and let's talk about how you can come back here and we can get this worked out, what's best for Danny."" The boy was diagnosed with Stage 2B Hodgkin's lymphoma in January. The next month, he received a single course of treatment, which succeeded in shrinking a tumor in his chest but caused side effects that upset the family, doctors have said.  Watch father urge the pair to come back » . Dr. Bruce Bostrom, the cancer specialist who oversaw that course of chemotherapy, told KARE-TV in Minneapolis that, without further treatment, Daniel's odds of survival would plummet from 80 to 90 percent to about 5 percent. Daniel's second round of treatment was to have begun March 5, said the pediatric oncologist and associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School. In April, after the boy had not returned for the second course, Bostrom called the family and left a message threatening to report them for child neglect, he said. Colleen Hauser returned his call, telling him she was seeking a second opinion. But the doctor who ultimately cared for the boy has said he was only treating his symptoms, not the cancer itself, Bostrom said. So Bostrom reported the family to authorities, the first time he has taken such a step in 25 years of practice, he said. ""I think it's our and my duty to do this,"" he said. Meanwhile, the opportunity to intervene is narrowing. ""He's now almost three months late, that's why it has regrown,"" Bostrom said, referring to another doctor's interpretation of a chest X-ray that showed Monday the tumor had worsened. ""It means his cancer is back and he is in danger,"" Bostrom said. ""It could block his airway; he could develop life-threatening breathing problems and possibly even die from it. It could be within a few weeks or a month at the most, I would say."" Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system. Stage 2B refers to the two areas of the body where Daniel has it -- the chest and the neck -- and the symptoms he has experienced: tumor, fatigue, weight loss and night sweats. Authorities said Wednesday that Colleen and Daniel Hauser were near Los Angeles, California, perhaps en route to Mexico for more holistic treatment of his lymphoma. Brown County, Minnesota, Sheriff Rich Offmann cited ""reliable information"" in making the announcement to reporters. The sheriff's office issued a felony arrest warrant for Colleen Hauser on Thursday in an effort to ""ensure extradition to Minnesota."" Family spokesman Dan Zwakman said on Thursday that Anthony Hauser was not aware that his wife was taking the child. ""From all appearances,"" Zwakman said, ""it was a case of her decision by herself.""  Watch what legal issues are at stake » . The boy and his mother were last reported seen Monday in Minnesota. When mother and son failed to show up at a court hearing Tuesday, Brown County District Judge John R. Rodenberg issued an arrest warrant for Colleen Hauser. Court documents show that the doctors estimated the boy's chance of five-year remission with more chemotherapy and possibly radiation at 80 percent to 95 percent. But the family rejected standard treatment, opting instead for a holistic medical treatment based on Native American healing practices called Nemenhah. In a written statement issued last week, an attorney for the parents said they ""believe that the injection of chemotherapy into Danny Hauser amounts to an assault upon his body, and torture when it occurs over a long period of time."" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, said he had no doubts about what to do. ""My advice would be to treat him, without question,"" he said. ""He has a very, very good chance of surviving, being cured and never having to deal with this again. As a doctor, as a fellow citizen, I would say he should be treated.""  Watch Gupta discuss Daniel's chances » . But Zwakman told CNN's ""American Morning"" program Thursday that he knows five people who have been cured with natural healing. ""Yes, it's happened many times,"" he said.  Watch Zwakman speak to CNN » . Mankato, Minnesota, lawyer Calvin P. Johnson, who identified himself as the Hauser family's attorney, said Thursday that forcing treatment would constitute ""assault and torture."" Johnson said officials were forcing treatment neither the boy nor his parents want. ""Anthony and Colleen Hauser share Danny's viewpoint: They do not approve of chemotherapy. Under the circumstances of this case, chemotherapy constitutes assault and torture, when given to a young man who believes that it will kill him,"" Johnson said in a written statement. CNN's Chris Welch contributed to this report.","Dad: ""I feel that you left out of fear, maybe without thinking it all the way through""

"(CNN Student News) -- June 2, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Gaza • Denver, Colorado . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's Wednesday, I'm Carl Azuz, this is CNN Student News, bringing you 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines from around the globe. In fact, our first story is about a global response. First Up: Flotilla Response . AZUZ: This international reaction is aimed at Israel, and it is not positive. Protesters around the world speaking out against Israel. The United Nations Security Council criticizing the violence. Turkey calling it a massacre. Even the U.S., one of Israel's closest allies, says it's open to an investigation. All of this is in response to Monday, when Israeli troops stormed a group of ships bringing aid to Gaza. Israel set up a blockade to control what goods are allowed into Gaza. This group of ships tried to break that blockade. Some of the activists who were taken into custody during the incident have been released, and Israel says the aid that was on board the ships has been delivered into Gaza. The anger is over what happened on those ships, and the two sides tell very different stories. DANNY AYALON, ISRAELI DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER: They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror. On board the ship, we found weapons prepared in advance and used against our forces. The organizers' intent was violent, their method was violent, and the results were unfortunately violent. AUDREY BOMSE, FREE GAZA MOVEMENT LEGAL ADVISER: There could not have been guns on board, and besides, there is no evidence of it. There is a live streaming from the Turkish boat. You see Israeli soldiers jumping out of helicopters onto the boat shooting. There is no crossfire. Had there been crossfire at close range, some Israeli soldier would have been shot. Security Headlines . AZUZ: We're checking out a couple security headlines now, starting with what could be a serious blow to the al Qaeda terrorist group. It reportedly announced the death of Mustafa Abu Yazid yesterday. He was the number three man in al Qaeda and the commander of its operations in Afghanistan. Yazid was also responsible for maintaining al Qaeda's relationships with other terrorist groups, like the Taliban. One group of experts says his death is one of the most significant blows against al Qaeda recently. But it also pointed out that the terrorist organization plans for these kinds of losses. In the United States, Major Nidal Hasan, whom you see here, made his first court appearance in connection with last November's attack at Fort Hood, Texas. Hasan, who is a U.S. Army psychiatrist, is accused of killing 13 people in a shooting spree.Yesterday's hearing was the military version of a grand jury. Hasan answered questions that were asked by the judge, and his lawyers asked for an extension so they can gather evidence for the case. The judge agreed to that request. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The U.S. sees more tornadoes per year than any other country. True! The U.S. has an average of about 1,000 tornadoes a year. Canada is second with around 100. Colorado Tornado . AZUZ: Around 25 percent of those tornadoes form in an area that's called Tornado Alley. Colorado is part of that, and it's where this tornado showed up on Monday. These pictures are amazing; look at this. Twisters like this one can sometimes do a lot of damage. But early reports indicated no injuries or major problems with this one, just a lot of power lines knocked down. Tornado Alley sees a lot of twisters pop up in the spring. But forecasters point out that these storms can happen anywhere, at any time. Dealing with the Spill . AZUZ: Attorney General Eric Holder says he's launching a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. And down in the Gulf, there's more bad news for the fishing industry. Officials have closed off more waters to fishing. Nearly a third of the Gulf now is off limits. Meanwhile, BP is starting the ""cut and cap"" plan. We told you about this yesterday. They're going to cut part of the leaking oil well and then put a cap on it. Hence, cut and cap. Making the cut, though, could increase the flow of oil spilling into the Gulf by up to 20 percent. Now, you've heard a lot from Rob Marciano since this oil leak started. He's one of our reporters covering the story from down on the Gulf Coast. Today, he explains how hurricane season could impact the oily situation. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Almost five years later, signs of Hurricane Katrina are still evident in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. And this year's NOAA hurricane forecast calls for up to 23 named storms. Oil from the BP spill is already in the barrier wetlands here. BILL NUNGESSER, PRESIDENT, PLAQUEMINES PARISH: I'm scared to death. You saw Pass a Loutre. You saw the pelicans. Imagine a storm rolling that oil up and bringing it in here and laying it down. MARCIANO: That's just the kind of unimaginable devastation that Dauphin Island, Alabama is trying to avoid. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What you see here is the tide is down right now. So, the water is below the basket. MARCIANO: The Alabama National Guard is erecting a four-and-a-half mile barrier to keep the oil from impacting protected wildlife here. The baskets are filled with a polymer powder which can turn the wet oil into a solid, making it easier to collect by hand. But what happens to these oil barriers if a major hurricane hits? DAN KOONTZ, CI AGENT SOLUTIONS: They'll be gone just like everything else around here too. That category five will take out the houses and take out every building and structure on this island, probably. MARCIANO: We're out on part of the thick oil here in the Gulf of Mexico. What does the oil do for hurricanes? Well, it would have a hard time developing right over the oil, because the oil actually suppresses evaporation. But that's actually one of the ways that the water actually cools. So, between the lack of evaporation and the darkness of that oil, actually heats up the Gulf. This is going to actually feed it, if anything, and bring it onshore and everything with it, including this big mess. (END VIDEO) Shoutout .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Suspected Taliban militants have executed a 7-year-old boy, accusing him of spying for the government, officials in southern Afghanistan said Thursday. The execution took place Tuesday in the Sangin district of Helmand province, said Dawoud Ahmadi -- the provincial governor's spokesman. In the past, militants have carried out similar killings of those accused of spying, Ahmadi said. Three years ago, a 70-year-old woman and a child in the Musa Qala district of the province were executed following the same allegations, he said. During a news conference Thursday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said officials were looking into reports of the execution and said he condemned the act if it is confirmed to be true. ""I don't think there's a crime bigger than that that even the most inhuman forces on earth can commit,"" Karzai said. ""A 7-year-old boy cannot be a spy. A 7-year-old boy cannot be anything but a 7-year-old boy, and therefore hanging or shooting to kill a 7-year-old boy ... is a crime against humanity."" ""If this is true, it is an absolutely hiorrific crime,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said during the news conference on an unannounced stop in Kabul. ""If true, I think it says more about the Taliban than any book, than any article, than any speech could ever say.""","NEW: Afghan president calls execution a 'crime against humanity,' if true .

"(CNN) -- Agents on Wednesday will release dozens of interviews conducted during the investigation of sexual assault allegations against star professional quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the investigation but was slapped with a six-game suspension from the National Football League for what the league called ""detrimental conduct."" The investigative file contains more than 50 DVDs of audio and videotaped interviews and photographs, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. The file is sure to provide intimate details of the case that hurled the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback from the sports page to the front page earlier this year. Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to Super Bowl titles in 2006 and 2009, faced the threat of criminal charges after a 20-year-old woman accused him of raping her in a Milledgeville, Georgia, bar in March. The quarterback's lawyer said no sexual assault took place, and prosecutors decided in April that they could not prove that a crime had been committed. Although prosecutors determined that no charges would be filed, the investigation showed that Roethlisberger had provided underage college students with alcohol, National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell has said. Along with the suspension, Goodell ordered that Roethlisberger undergo a ""comprehensive behavioral evaluation by medical professionals."" The Steelers quarterback is not the only NFL player dealing with allegations of sexual assault. Seven players from the Green Bay Packers were questioned as part of an investigation into the alleged sexual assaults of two women on June 6, police said. Six of the men were later released and are not considered suspects. A seventh man, who was not identified, was also questioned and released, and remains under investigation, according to Lake Delton, Wisconsin, Police Chief Thomas Dorner.","Agents will release dozens of interviews conducted during probe .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 1,000 American troops have now been killed in Afghanistan, according to CNN calculations. The United States passed that grim milestone Tuesday, when an improvised explosive device killed two of its troops in southern Afghanistan, bringing the total to 1,001. The death toll does not include those killed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in other countries. But the large number of casualties is in sharp contrast to the rates from another recent war. The deaths of these service members come 104 months since the start of the war in Afghanistan, compared with the war in Iraq, where more than 1,000 U.S. troops were killed in the first 18 months of fighting. But Afghanistan is getting deadlier by the day. From 2001 through 2006, the American casualty rate never reached 100 in any single year. But that number started going up in 2007 and spiked to more than 300 last year. If the current rate continues, 2010 will be the deadliest year of the war, nearly a decade after it started. The milestone comes just 24 hours after the single deadliest day for coalition forces in Afghanistan this year. Insurgents killed 12 NATO soldiers on Monday, seven of them Americans. Officials with the International Security Assistance Force say it was no single event but six separate attacks in southern and eastern Afghanistan. It was the most fatalities among NATO troops in a single day since October 26, when 11 Americans were killed in two helicopter crashes. Coalition forces are working to secure Helmand Province and establish a legitimate government there and are launching an offensive to target up to 1,000 Taliban fighters in Kandahar. ""We all expect the fight to get tougher as we carry out the new campaign,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said. Added Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, ""I think we've been very clear for months now that this was going to be a very difficult fight in the south. And the expectations, try to set expectations ... as tragic as it is, for these losses."" A defense official says that American troops and their allies are tightening security around the city of Kandahar but that the operation there will take months and will not resemble a typical battle. More than a million Afghans live in Kandahar, and the Taliban are embedded in the population. The official says the goal will be weeding out the Taliban, as well as the drug gangs and warlords that control much of the area's economy.","Death toll at 1,001 after explosion in southern Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- New York's famous skyline may be getting a new addition: Wind turbines. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he wants to generate alternative energy for the city. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans to generate power from skyscraper-mounted turbines and offshore wind farms as part of an ambitious alternative-energy program. During a Tuesday night speech at an energy conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Bloomberg vowed to ""kick alternative energy production into high gear in the Big Apple."" Bloomberg said the city is already asking companies with strong track records in producing renewable energy for ""their best ideas for creating both small- and large-scale projects serving New Yorkers."" He was not specific about which of the city's skyscrapers or bridges would be candidates for turbines, but aides said some companies are experimenting with smaller turbine models that could be made to appear part of the design, reducing potential changes to the city's famous skyline. For offshore locations, city aides told CNN the city is looking at the windy coast off Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island for turbines that could generate 10 percent of the city's electricity needs within 10 years. Bloomberg said he would also ask investors and private companies to study how these technologies can be built and integrated into the city's fabric. ""When it comes to producing clean power, we're determined to make New York the No. 1 city in the nation,"" he said.  Watch Bloomberg outline his alternative energy hope for New York » .

"(CNN) -- ""We will restore science to its rightful place."" When those words came out of President Obama's mouth during his inaugural speech, public health nerds such as myself rejoiced heartily. We believe that policy, especially health policy, should be based on scientific evidence. Funny, then, that we ignore this important piece of evidence: When scientific facts go up against moral ideologies, ideology usually wins. I've worked for more than a decade in the field of HIV prevention. That means working with sex and drugs -- two areas where there is no shortage of good science, and an abundance of ideology. The science tells us, for example, that making clean needles universally available to drug injectors can more or less wipe out HIV transmission in this group. The ideology tells us that providing such services for injectors is tantamount to condoning an illegal behavior that wrecks lives and families and increases crime. If you were running for election, faced with the choice of paying for clean needles and health services for injectors or with putting more cops on the streets and cells in the jails, which do you think would play best with the voters? Read more about Elizabeth Pisani at TED.com . HIV has taught us something about the nature of democracy as well as the more personal decision-making that my TED talk addresses. The fact is that many of the most effective public health policies have been put in place by governments that Americans think of as ideological, even undemocratic. Iran has one of the world's better prevention programs inside its jails, and sterile needles are available to injectors from dispensing machines around Tehran. The Kyrgyz Republic gives clean needles to prisoners. China makes needles available to injectors through pharmacies at subsidized prices. These countries are not exactly synonymous with liberalism. Government officials can afford to do nice things for junkies because they don't need to worry much about what might happen in midterm elections. And they need to be pragmatic because they expect to be in power for some time. Better to put in place prevention programs that deal with a distasteful headache now than to deal with a much greater headache in the future. That's harder to do in a democracy; if you do something upsetting to the majority of voters now, you won't be around to reap the benefits of your far-sighted action in the future. It's hardly surprising, then, that for the last 20 years, the U.S. Congress put politically popular ideology ahead of science, denying federal funding for needle exchanges. (Congress repealed the ban last year.) At the local level, though, things often look different. Many cities, realizing that they would have to pick up the pieces of the nation's failed war on drugs, have scraped out their pockets and provided services to injectors. The result has been a huge decline in new HIV infections among drug users and their sex partners; the burden on the health system has of course fallen, too. And there is no evidence at all that these programs have led to a rise in injecting -- a specter commonly raised by the ideologues. The truth is, people who've never injected drugs in their life don't suddenly say: ""Oh look, a clean needle dispenser. Maybe I'll try shooting up heroin."" This disconnect between national and local policies is instructive about the way democracy works. At a national level, politicians seem to respond to what they think the electorate wants to hear. Ideology and rhetoric rule. At the local level, however, they are more likely to respond to what the electorate really needs -- workable solutions to real problems. The only workable solutions are the ones that are based on good, solid, scientific evidence. In my little corner of public health, the Obama administration is following through on its promise to put the science back into policy. Since the ban on federal funding for safe injecting programs was dropped in December, the sky has not fallen, and if the government falls, it certainly won't be because of this small piece of pragmatism. But two decades of banging the ""evidence-based"" drum does make me think that we scientists need to learn from the evidence. Scientifically sound solutions can only be implemented where they can be made politically workable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth Pisani.","Elizabeth Pisani says Obama's embrace of science in setting health policy is encouraging .

"New York (CNN) -- Don't think raising money for nonprofits is an overly sexy undertaking? Don't tell actor and activist Edward Norton. ""Crowdrise is pretty much the most fun you can have making a difference without taking any illegal substances,"" Norton said about the online initiative he announced Tuesday at the Mashable Media Summit. The summit, co-sponsored by CNN.com, is part of Internet Week New York. At Crowdrise.com, Norton and his colleagues have set up what they hope will become a crowdsourced community of volunteers and fundraisers to support a host of causes -- from global environmental threats to local clean-up projects. Norton, a longtime activist who's been involved in issues ranging from environmental protection to affordable housing, took his first plunge into online fundraising last year. He ran the New York City Marathon and, in the months leading up to it, took to Twitter and a website to raise pledges that would go to the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Fund -- a charity working for sustainable development in eastern Africa. In that effort, Norton and other supporters offered gifts and other incentives to inspire giving. ""When we came out the back side of it, we definitely felt it was like a beta test on how to create a good tool for anybody to do the same thing we were doing,"" Norton told CNN. ""We took a lot of lessons we learned from the Maasai run and created something that anybody could use."" Norton, whose credits include ""Fight Club"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" said his group wanted Crowdrise to be fun and easy to use. It lets anyone create a profile, register a cause, ask for donations then communicate with supporters in creative ways. Nonprofits already using the site include both large and small organizations. ""Crowdrise is the only website that makes it so easy to turn our base of passionate grassroots advocates into a base of passionate fundraisers,"" said Danielle Murray, associate director of the Conservation Lands Foundation.","Norton, colleagues have set up a web community of volunteers, fundraisers to support causes .

"(CNN) -- The search for a missing 7-year-old Oregon boy is now in its fifth day. Police said they are not ready to call Kyron Horman's disappearance a criminal investigation yet, while the boy's parents have indicated they will release a statement to the public sometime Wednesday. ""We're not prepared to call it a criminal investigation at this point,"" Captain Jason Gates of the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office told reporters Tuesday, ""But we are certainly prepared to call it a missing endangered child investigation."" He also narrowed the scope of the incident. ""What I can tell you is that we have no reason to believe that this is anything other than an isolated case,"" Gates said. Kyron was reported missing by his stepmother Friday afternoon after he did not return home from school, authorities said. According to investigators, Kyron's stepmother said she last saw him Friday morning walking down a hallway towards his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School. The school was holding a science fair at the time, officials said. ""We can tell you that we have completed 99 percent of the interviews with the children at Skyline Elementary School,"" Gates said. ""We've also completed the majority of interviews with the staff and parents at Skyline."" The sheriff's office said no one at the school saw Kyron after 8:45 a.m. Friday and that Kyron never made it to his classroom. Authorities continue to pursue hundreds of tips, most of them from Oregon and Washington. ""The leads that are being provided would not suggest that it would be a national search at this point,"" Gates said. ""We don't have enough information to satisfy the criteria to complete an Amber Alert or issue an Amber Alert,"" Gates explained. ""Amber Alerts are designed to find children very quickly when we have specific information.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The two top executives at struggling Countrywide Financial Corp., the nation's largest mortgage lender, are slated to receive a combined $19 million in payouts, a regulatory filing shows. Angelo Mozilo helped lead Countrywide as it grew into the nation's largest mortgage lender. The payments are part of the company's pending takeover by Bank of America. Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo is set to receive $10 million in stock, and President David Sambol will get about $9 million, according to documents Bank of America filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sambol will receive another $28 million in cash and stock to stay with the combined company, the document states. Their compensation is tied directly to the performance of the company via stock and options that the executives have held over time, according to the filing. Bank of America agreed in January to buy Countrywide for $4 billion. Mozilo and Sambol, along with ex-Citigroup chief Charles Prince, came under fire this month by members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who chastised the executives for helping foster the current mortgage crisis. Lawmakers accused the executives of leaving homeowners at risk of losing their homes while fattening their own wallets. In their defense, the executives said they also lost billions of dollars in the subprime meltdown. Mozilo, Sambol and Prince made headlines in the past year for their lofty compensation after their companies suffered heavy losses in the U.S. housing market. Between 2002 and the close of 2006, the three executives were paid $460 million, according to a report issued by the House committee in March. Mozilo, who grew Countrywide from its modest beginnings into the nation's largest mortgage lender, reportedly stood to collect a windfall of $115 million after his firm agreed to a yet-to-be-completed sale to Bank of America. After facing heavy criticism from lawmakers, Mozilo forfeited $37.5 million in payments tied to the deal. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Italy's World Cup captain Fabio Cannavaro has made a surprise decision to end his career in Dubai. The 36-year-old has signed a two-year deal with reigning United Arab Emirates league champions Al Ahli after failing to find a new club in Serie A following the end of his deal with Juventus. In a statement on its official Web site on Wednesday, the Dubai-based club confirmed that Cannavaro would move to Al Ahli after the World Cup in South Africa, which starts on June 11. ""We announce that we have signed Fabio Cannavaro for two years,"" Abdullah Al Nabooda, chairman of Al Ahli's board of directors said. ""This deal with a player like Cannavaro is one of the most important deals for us because he's a player with great experience and talent, while he's also a leader on the field."" Cannavaro -- who has 132 caps for his country and led the Italians to victory over France in the 2006 World Cup final -- is planning to retire from international football after the South African tournament, which will be his fourth. He played at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before moving to Juventus in 2009, and had hoped to earn a deal with his hometown club Napoli, where he began his career. ""The option to extend my deal with Juventus has expired. I want Napoli, but they don't want me,"" he told Italian sports paper Tuttosport last week. However, Cannavaro said he was now happy to make the move to the Middle-East. ""I am happy to sign for Al Ahli for the next season. I was already planning to go and live in Dubai, I love that city.

"New York (CNN) -- Enjoy hypocrisy? This past weekend you could glut the appetite. On Monday, Israeli ships stopped a flotilla carrying materials that could be used for war, including cement that Israel maintained could be used to build bunkers, to Hamas-ruled Gaza. The crew of one boat resisted violently, triggering a firefight in which nine people were killed, most of them Turkish nationals. Turkey is protesting vigorously. But, question: Turkey is a NATO ally, an applicant to the European Union. What is it doing allowing its nationals to smuggle cement that could build bunkers? Especially when those nationals belong to a group, the Turkish IHH (Insani Yardim Vakfi) that Israel has designated a terrorist organization? The flotilla departed from Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. Turkey's occupation of half of Cyprus is deemed illegal by the European Union and the United Nations. If the government of Turkey feels so strongly about ending disputed occupations, why does it not start with the disputed occupation it is operating itself? The flotilla followed a breathtaking Friday at the United Nations. The 189 signatories of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty agreed on a final list of resolutions for a safer world. The nuclear threat from Iran? Unmentioned. Instead, the NPT resolution targeted -- what a surprise -- Israel. Shamefully, the Friday resolution was joined by the United States. Yes, the Obama administration issued a statement at the same time that ""deplores the decision to single out Israel"" and also ""the failure of the resolution to mention Iran."" The administration deplored -- but it signed. The Obama administration's signature marks an abrupt departure from previous U.S. policy. Since the 1960s, the United States has accepted Israel's nuclear arsenal on condition that Israel not threaten its neighbors. Israel has more than met that condition. In 1973, Egypt outright invaded Israel, in full confidence that Israel would not go nuclear so long as Egypt stopped short of attacking Israel's cities. It's important to understand that Israel (like India and Pakistan) has never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. So Israel's nuclear force violates no commitments or pledges: unlike, say, the nuclear programs of Syria, Libya, Iraq and Iran, to name just four of the Middle Eastern countries that have been caught violating the NPT. Iran by contrast is violating the NPT. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. And Iranian leaders have threatened to use the nuclear weapons they are seeking to annihilate Israel. On Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran has accumulated enough nuclear material for two bombs, when fully enriched. And the latest round of U.N. sanctions will do nothing to stop that bomb, because they omit the most crucial measures: . • A ban on exports of gasoline to Iran (Iran now imports half its gasoline) • Measures to sever Iran's central bank from the global payments system . The measures adopted by the Security Council last week are not only toothless, but they even contain a loophole legalizing the sale of Russian air defenses to Iran, the better to protect nuclear facilities from action by the United States or Israel. OK, so maybe it is not news that the U.N. system is hypocritical and useless. What is news is this: The Obama administration has broken with 40 years of precedent and has affixed its signature to a document suggesting that it is Israel's weapons -- not Iran's -- that ought to be priority No. 1 in the Middle East. And now, post-flotilla, the Obama administration stands in danger of being drawn into the attempt to open Hamas-ruled Gaza to military-capable imports, and to force Israel to engage in some kind of negotiation with Hamas. Former Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, who is close to Obama administration thinking, outlined in the New York Times Monday the contours of just such a deal: . ""The administration needs to work on a package deal in which Hamas commits to preventing attacks from, and all smuggling into, Gaza. In return, Israel would drop the blockade and allow trade in and out."" It's a pretty thought. Pro-Hamas groups did not go to the trouble of organizing a flotilla of supplies that could be used for war in order to end smuggling of war material into Gaza. Nor are pro-Hamas groups seeking to ship the material into Gaza in order to thwart future attacks on Israel. Rebuilding Hamas' bunkers is not a step toward peace. But as with the Obama administration's joining the anti-Israel resolution at the United Nations on Friday, followed by after-the-fact explanations that Israel had nothing to fear, so the Obama administration is now being drawn into another anti-Israel action, again cushioned by assurances that, ""This is for your own good."" Monday morning, ABC'S Jake Tapper reported an unnamed administration official promising ""no daylight"" between the United States and Israel. But the same administration official who promised ""no daylight"" also told Tapper: ""The president has always said that it will be much easier for Israel to make peace if it feels secure."" Meaning: first we soothe you, then we squeeze you? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says Gaza flotilla was carrying war materials .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at Israel and warned the United States against pushing for new sanctions on his country a news conference on the sidelines of an Asian security summit here Tuesday. A key item on the agenda at the summit is last week's Israeli raid on an aid flotilla in the Mediterranean. Ahmadinejad said the confrontation revealed Israel's ""devilish"" nature. ""It showed violence and hatred and war-mongering attitudes,"" he said at the news conference. ""The devilish sound of the uncultured Zionists was coming out from their deceit. ... They were holding up the flag of the devil itself."" The raid led to the deaths of nine people, all Turkish citizens -- including one Turkish-American. Turkey is urging Israel to accept an international probe into the incident. Ahmadinejad congratulated Turkey, which has been in a war of words with Israel following the raid, for its response. Israel's envoy to Turkey later walked out on an Ahmadinejad speech at the conference. Ambassador Gabby Levy walked out in protest when Ahmadinejad started criticizing the ""Zionist regime,"" said Amit Zarouk, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Ankara. Both Israel and Iran are members of Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA). Ahmadinejad and Levy did appear together in a group photo of delegates to the conference, along with dozens of other attendees. ""Beleaguered"" was how one Western diplomat described Levy's disposition during Tuesday's meeting. Host country Turkey, once Israel's close Middle Eastern ally, has called on member countries to condemn Israel's raid on the aid convoy. The incident has pushed Turkey to side with Israel's enemies Iran and Syria, in harshly condemning the Jewish state. Russia, which is also a member of CICA, condemned the attack as well, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in remarks carried on Russian state TV. ""Generally speaking, such actions against civilian vessels are unacceptable,"" Putin said. ""The fact that they were conducted in neutral waters raises many questions, and the incident must be thoroughly investigated. We are sorry for the victims of the incident, and we hope nothing of this kind will happen again."" Iran's nuclear program has been another major topic at the summit. The United States expects to bring a new resolution on increased sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program to a vote in the United Nations Security Council this week. A draft resolution saying Iran had failed to meet international requirements and U.N. resolutions was circulating at the world body on Tuesday. CNN obtained a copy from a Western diplomat. The resolution -- which could still be changed before it comes to a vote -- is set to call for tighter restrictions on people, companies and organizations, including the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The targets of the sanctions are still being worked out, the diplomat said. By calling for a resolution instead of sitting down for talks with Iran, the United States is ""gravely mistaken,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""Within the framework of respect and justice, we're ready to negotiate with everyone. Anyone who is going to resort to the language of force and aggression, the response is clear,"" he said. Ahmadinejad went on to commend Turkey and Brazil for recently negotiating a deal with Iran on a uranium enrichment swap. ""The initiative marked the beginning of a new path -- the beginning of an end to unilateralism in the world,"" he said. The United States, he added, missed an opportunity by not embracing the deal. Putin said sanctions against Iran should not be ""excessive, or put the Iranian leadership, and above all the Iranian people, in a false position that would put obstacles in the way of Iran's peaceful nuclear energy development."" Asked whether the raid on the flotilla last week will change the way countries vote in the Security Council, Ahmadinejad said the raid will actually change many things. For Israel, he said, ""it has actually rung the final countdown for its existence. It shows that it has no room in the region and no one is ready to live alongside it. Actually, no country in the world recognizes it, and you know that the Zionist regime is the backbone of the dictatorial world order."" In fact, many countries recognize Israel. He added, ""Maybe at the Security Council, it will impact temporarily. The Zionist regime, with what it has done, it actually stopped its possibility to exist in the region anymore.""

"(CNN) -- Looking for love, or perhaps just for some cafeteria food or spelling lessons, an alligator was found Monday inside a middle school in suburban Tampa, Florida. Tampa Police were notified around 7 a.m. that the gator had set itself down in a prime spot, ""in front of the cafeteria"" in Stewart Middle School, the department said in a written statement. Although school does not let out for another week, no children were inside the school when the reptile was discovered, said Hillsborough County School District spokesman Steve Hegarty. The school is near the Hillsborough River, so it's not too far-fetched to think an alligator might make its way inside, Hegarty said. Still, he doesn't recall any similar incidents. ""The gator was contained in one of the hallways,"" police said. Trappers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission caught the creature. No one was injured. It's currently alligator mating season. According to the conservation commission's website, alligator ""courtship"" begins in early April, with mating occurring in May or June.","Alligator was trapped inside school by wildlife experts .

"(CNN) -- Police were searching for a wildlife medical dart off the coast of New York on Friday after an unsuccessful attempt to euthanize a beached baby humpback whale Thursday night, according to East Hampton Village Police Chief Jerry Larsen. The dart bounced off the whale and ricocheted into the Atlantic Ocean. Larsen said Friday afternoon that the dart is encased in stainless steel but that it could pose a serious danger to swimmers in the months ahead. ""We're sending divers ... to retrieve the needle as soon as the surf dies down,"" Larsen said. Police also closed the area of beach, saying the dart might wash ashore. The whale was found on Main Beach in East Hampton on Tuesday and was deemed too sick to save, according to Charles Bowman, president of the Long Island-based Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation. ""The whale was debilitated,"" Bowman said. ""It was a thin and a young juvenile still dependent on its mother and couldn't survive on its own."" By Friday, the whale was unable to free itself from the beach, and Bowman's foundation advised the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that it was appropriate to euthanize the whale. ""It's heartbreaking for us. We're used to saving animals, getting them back in the ocean,"" Bowman said. ""It's just one of these situations that there's just no chance for it, [and we are] trying to get people to recognize that."" A NOAA official shot and killed the whale Friday morning.","Baby humpback was beached near East Hampton Village, New York .

"(CNN) -- The proposed super-fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jnr has been thrown into doubt because of a dispute over the timing of a pre-match blood-test according to Golden Boy Promotions. Richard Schaefer, chief executive of Golden Boy who promote Mayweather, announced on the company's official Web site that the Filipino would not agree to blood-testing in the immediate run up to the welterweight fight which had been expected to take place in March. Mayweather's management have requested the fighters submit to Olympic-style blood testing as outlined and mandated by the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) 30 days prior to the bout. But Schaefer claims that Pacquiao has refused to have blood taken so close to a fight with the American. ""Pacquiao would only agree to have blood drawn before the kick-off press conference and after the fight. It is unfortunate to hear this from Manny Pacquiao's representatives, particularly since both parties had worked out all other issues related to this fight,"" Schaefer said on the Golden Boy Promotions Web site. Mayweather, who was informed of Pacquiao's reluctance shortly after Schaefer received word of the impasse, empathized with his possible opponent but hopes he will undergo the tests.  ""I understand Pacquiao not liking having his blood taken, because frankly I don't know anyone who really does,"" Mayweather said. ""I hope this is either some miscommunication or that Manny will change his mind and step up and allow these tests, which were good enough for all these other great athletes, to be performed by USADA."" USA Today reported an angry response from Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank, who said the fight was now in jeopardy. ""The press release is absurd, the plug [on the fight] is pulled. The fight is off as far as we're concerned,"" he said. Arum, who has previously represented Mayweather added: ""It proves Mayweather is a coward and he's looking for a way out of the fight. ""The Nevada commission has been doing drug testing for the last 40 years. To appease Mayweather, we agreed they could do urine analysis anytime they wanted. But Manny doesn't want them to draw his blood when he's in training because it weakens him,"" he told the American newspaper. Pacquiao became a five-weight world champion following his WBO welterweight title win over Miguel Cotto in November, while Mayweather returned from a 21-month retirement to beat Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September. Their super-fight was widely reported to be set for the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on March 13, with only the final details to be thrashed out and an official announcement early next month.","The Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather fight is in doubt over the timing of a pre-match blood test .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A new national poll indicates that white and black Americans don't see eye to eye on last month's arrest of Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates. Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit for beers with the president and vice president Thursday. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday also suggests a racial divide over President Obama's initial comments on the incident. The arrest sparked a national discussion on the issue of racial profiling, which was amplified when President Obama weighed in on the matter. In a prime time news conference on July 22, Obama said ""the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home."" Fifty-four percent of people questioned in the poll said they don't think Cambridge, Massachusetts, police office James Crowley acted ""stupidly"" when he arrested Gates at the professor's home after Crowley responded to a call that someone was breaking into the house. Thirty-three percent said Crowley did act stupidly. But there's a major racial divide, with 59 percent of black respondents saying Crowley acted stupidly compared to 29 percent of whites questioned. Fifty-three percent of those polled felt Gates acted stupidly in the incident, with 30 percent saying no. Broken down by race, 58 percent of whites said Gates acted stupidly, with African-Americans split on the question: 44 percent said yes and 43 percent said no. Two days after Obama's remarks, after criticism from police unions and after speaking with Crowley, Obama said ""because this has been ratcheting up, and I obviously helped to contribute ratcheting it up, I want to make clear that in my choice of words, I think, I unfortunately gave an impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department or Sgt. [James] Crowley specifically and I could have calibrated those words differently. And I told this to Sgt. Crowley."" Fifty-four percent of people questioned said they think the president acted stupidly when he commented on the Gates arrest, with 32 percent disagreeing. But again, the poll indicates a racial divide, with 63 percent of whites feeling Obama acted stupidly and 26 percent of black respondents agreeing. Sixty-one percent approve of how the president has handled race relations, with 92 percent of African-Americans and 56 percent of whites approving. Did Obama's initial comments damage his political standing? ""One-third of whites say that Obama's comments about this matter made them feel less favorable toward him, compared to only 4 percent of whites who feel more favorably toward Obama due to his comments,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""But the majority of whites say that Obama's comments did not affect their views of him, and most whites approve of how Obama is handling race relations."" Fifty-two percent of Americans feel racism among police officers is common, with 44 percent saying it's rare. Whites are split on that question -- 47 percent said it's common, 49 percent said it's rare -- with 86 percent of black respondents feeling racism among police offices is common. Sixty-six percent of whites said a white homeowner would have been arrested for the same behavior. Twenty-five percent of blacks agree. ""That difference may be due to life experiences -- more than half of blacks say they have been treated unfairly by the police because of their race, but only a handful of whites report the same kind of treatment,"" Holland said. The poll indicated that both blacks and whites believe Friday's ""beer summit"" at the White House, in which Obama was host at a meeting with Gates and Crowley, was a good idea. But was it a ""teachable moment,"" as mentioned by the president? ""Not according to the public -- blacks and whites agree that the whole controversy did not teach Americans a lesson that will lead to better race relations,"" Holland said. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday (July 31-August 3), with 1,136 adult Americans, including 226 African-Americans and 773 whites, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample and plus or minus 6.5 percentage points for the breakdown by race.","CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released on Tuesday .

"(CNN)  -- During a recent commencement address at Hampton University in Virginia, Barack Obama described the way today's internet-powered media environment ""bombards us with all kinds of content."" He warned students that iPads, Xboxes, and other popular digital gadgets can turn information into ""a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment"" rather than a means ""of empowerment."" As soon as the president's remarks were made public, knees began jerking throughout the blogosphere. One online pundit said that Obama sounded ""like a grumpy old man."" Another suggested that in criticizing technology he was acting like an ""old fogy."" Even the normally restrained Economist magazine rushed out an editorial accusing Obama of ""technophobia"" and ""Luddism."" By the reaction, you would have thought our BlackBerry-toting president had called for a return to horse-drawn carriages, outhouses, and whalebone corsets. Instead of drawing ridicule, Obama's words should have drawn our attention -- and our concern. Over the past decade, most of us have been dramatically ratcheting up the time we spend surfing the web, exchanging electronic messages, and hanging out in social networks like Facebook and MySpace. At the same time, we've been showering our kids with laptops, iPods, PlayStations and smartphones. The average American today spends more than eight hours a day peering into a screen -- TV, computer, or cell phone -- and the average teen sends or receives well over 2,000 text messages a month. But even as we've been enjoying the seemingly endless bounties of the net, neurobiologists and psychologists have been carrying out studies which suggest that the way we gather information online impedes comprehension, weakens understanding, and in general hinders learning. Worse yet, the ill effects of heavy web use appear to continue to afflict us even when we turn our computers off. The cognitive penalties can be particularly severe for students. In one revealing experiment, researchers at Cornell University divided a class into two groups. One group was allowed to use their laptop computers to surf the web during a lecture. The other group attended the same lecture but had to keep their computers closed. Immediately afterward, the students took a test measuring how well they remembered the lecture's content. The students who used their laptops performed significantly worse on the exam. It didn't matter, moreover, whether they surfed sites related to the subject of the lecture or unrelated sites. All the surfers performed relatively poorly. Other researchers have found that students who read text with hyperlinks, as you routinely find online, end up with a weaker understanding of the material than students who read the same text in a traditional, linear format, as you'd find in a printed book. Each link appears to act as a little distraction, breaking the reader's concentration. As the number of links mounts, comprehension diminishes further. The multitude of messages and other bits of information that the Web fires at us, from emails to tweets to Facebook updates, have also been found to interrupt our thoughts in a way that impedes the formation of memories and the building of knowledge. The more information we juggle, the less able we are to make sense of it all. Last year, a team of Stanford researchers reported that heavy media multitaskers have trouble concentrating even when they're not online. They're considerably less able, for example, to distinguish important information from trivial information than are people who engage in multitasking less frequently. ""Everything distracts them,"" one of the researchers said of the heavy multitaskers. Patricia Greenfield, a leading developmental psychologist who teaches at UCLA, warned in a 2009 Science article that a growing body of scientific evidence indicates that spending a lot of time with computers, smartphones, and other such devices weakens people's ability to think deeply, critically, and creatively. As we rush around the web gathering little pieces of information, we seem to be training our brains to be quick but superficial. Only a curmudgeon would deny the many benefits that our computers and electronic networks have brought us. The internet and related technologies have made it much easier to stay in touch with friends and family members, to discover interesting and useful information, to express ourselves, and to collaborate with others. Since the World Wide Web was invented two decades ago, we have been celebrating these benefits -- and rightly so. But we've been paying much less attention to the negative consequences of our online lives. The time has come for us to take a more balanced view of the net, looking at its costs as well as its benefits. That's particularly true when it comes to educating our children. Sticking a kid in front of a computer screen is probably not the best way encourage the development of a strong, creative, and supple mind. As President Obama implied, information should be a source not of distraction but of enlightenment. As important as it is to be able to find lots of information quickly, what's even more important is to be able to think deeply about the information once we've found it. We need to slow down.","Author says we should pay attention to Obama's words on Internet media overload .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two men -- both decapitated and showing signs of torture -- were found early Sunday in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the state attorney general's office said. The victims were found in the Colony of Los Nogales neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. Their hands and feet had been bound with duct tape, state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. Investigators were still working on identifying the victims, Sandoval said. Attached to the bodies were two notes from a drug cartel, Sandoval said. He would not elaborate on what was written on the notes. ""This phenomenon [of violence] here ... we've been seeing it, and living it in Juarez for the last two years,"" Sandoval said. The killings were the latest in a nearly four-year-old eruption of drug-related violence in Juarez and surrounding Chihuahua state. At least 883 people have been killed in drug-fueled violence in Juarez this year, officials say. According to a report released in April by the Mexican government, Chihuahua is the country's hardest-hit state by drug violence, with more than 6,757 people killed since the start of the drug war at the end of 2006. But despite local reports and contrary to popular belief, the violence in Juarez has lessened recently, said Sandoval. ""Before we had 10 homicides a day, now we have six. This has been constant for the last two years. It comes and goes,"" he added. The body of another man was found Sunday morning dumped in front of a church in the Valley of Juarez two miles outside Juarez proper, Sandoval said. Drug cartels often dump bodies in front of churches in Juarez as a tactic to intimidate priests from repeating details of drug violence heard during confessionals. On Friday in the Valley of Juarez, six men were killed after they were shot by assailants and their van crashed into a kindergarten, municipal police department spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. Two others involved in the crash, identified by police as Enrique Torres, 33, and Francisco Manuel Torres, 26, were injured and were still recuperating in a hospital, according to state prosecutors. ""We have not had a chance to interview them yet, but we will. We're waiting for them to recuperate before we start the interrogation process,"" Sandoval said. ""But we have already started the investigation,"" he added.","Notes from drug cartel attached to tortured, decapitated bodies of two men .

"(CNN) -- The search for a second-grade student who disappeared last week after he arrived at his Portland, Oregon, elementary school intensified Monday. Kyron Horman, 7, did not return home Friday from Skyline Elementary School, police said. According to investigators, the boy's stepmother said she last saw Kyron on Friday morning while he was walking down the hallway toward his classroom. ""There was a science fair here at the school,"" Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby told CNN. ""You had a situation with lots of parents and friends coming through the school, going class to class."" ""Kyron was here with his stepmother, seen with his stepmother,"" Shelby said. The science fair was held before the beginning of classes, Shelby added, ""so working parents could come and participate."" The Multnomah County sheriff's office reported that no one at the school saw Kyron after 8:45 a.m. Friday and that the child never made it to his classroom. Searches in the school area were conducted Friday and over the weekend by several agencies, including the Portland Police Bureau, Gresham Police Department, Fairview Police Department, Oregon State Patrol, and the FBI. Authorities have also utilized Portland Police Bureau's air unit in an attempt to locate the child. ""My heart, and the hearts of everyone who is a part of Portland Public Schools, goes out to Kyron Horman and his family,"" Superintendent Carole Smith said in a written statement. ""We are all wishing for Kyron's safe return as quickly as possible and we are grateful for the efforts of all the law enforcement agencies who have worked so tirelessly over the past 48 hours to determine the cause of Kyron's disappearance, locate him and return him safely home. ""The reported disappearance of a student from one of our schools is unprecedented and deeply troubling. Portland Public Schools is doing everything we can to assist the authorities in their effort to find Kyron."" Counselors have been made available today to children and teachers at Kyron's school, Shelby said. ""Our focus is on supporting the students and staff,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Andrew Wyeth, the American painter perhaps best known for his painting of a young woman in a field, ""Christina's World,"" has died, according to an official with the Brandywine River Museum in Pennsylvania. Andrew Wyeth received the National Medal of Arts from President Bush in November 2007. Wyeth, 91, died in his sleep Thursday night at his home near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to Lora Englehart, public relations coordinator for the museum. The acclaimed artist painted landscapes and figure subjects and worked mostly in tempera and watercolor. He was widely celebrated inside and outside of the art world. Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and President Nixon sponsored an exhibition of Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 2007, President Bush awarded Wyeth the National Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and contribution to American arts and culture. Two years earlier, Wyeth and his wife, Betsy, presented to the White House his painting ""Jupiter,"" which is displayed in the residence's family sitting room. Bush issued a statement Friday saying that he and first lady Laura Bush ""deeply mourn"" the death of Wyatt. ""Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine,"" Bush said. ""On behalf of the American people, Laura and I offer our sincere condolences to Betsy and the Wyeth family."" Wyeth, who lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Maine, ""has been enormously popular and critically acclaimed since his first one-man show in 1937,"" according to a biography in InfoPlease. His main subjects were the places and people of Chadds Ford and Cushing, Maine. ""Christina's World,"" painted in 1948, shows a disabled Maine neighbor who drags herself through a field toward her house in the distance. The painting, displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, has been regarded as Wyeth's most popular. ""His 'Helga' pictures, a large group of intimate portraits of a neighbor, painted over many years, were first shown publicly in 1986,"" the InfoPlease biography says. Those were painted in Pennsylvania. Wyeth, the youngest child of painter N.C. Wyeth, formally studied art with his father as a teen, ""drawing in charcoal and painting in oils, the media of choice for N.C. Wyeth. It was during the family's annual summer vacations in Port Clyde, Maine, that Andrew was able to experiment with other media to find his own artistic voice,"" according to a biography in the Farnsworth Art Museum in Maine.","NEW: Bush says Wyeth's work ""captured America""

"(CNN) -- Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas won the Democratic primary Tuesday, beating back a challenge from Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, whose campaign was fueled by unions and liberal activists. Voters in 12 states held primary elections Tuesday night, but the outcomes of two contests in South Carolina will be delayed by another two weeks. A runoff will be held June 22 for the Republican gubernatorial nomination as well as for a GOP congressional seat in the northern part of the state. California Republican voters chose two women to vie for two of the state's highest offices: Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman will face Attorney General Jerry Brown, a former governor, for the governor's office, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will take on Sen. Barbara Boxer for her seat. And in Nevada, Tea Party-backed Sharron Angle beat the GOP establishment candidate to earn the right to take on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in November. At the same time, embattled Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons, a Republican, became the state's first incumbent governor in 100 years to lose a primary race. The South Carolina GOP gubernatorial contest captured national attention because of accusations of extramarital affairs. The candidates are vying to succeed scandal-plagued Gov. Mark Sanford, a fellow Republican. A year after Sanford made national news for disappearing and then admitting to an affair with a woman from Argentina, allegations of infidelity surrounded state lawmaker Nikki Haley. Haley has denied the accusations over the last two weeks, which she said rival campaigns were pushing. Haley cruised to a commanding lead but fell short of the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff election, scheduled for June 22. She'll face U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett, who came in at a distant second. ""You saw us push against the establishment and push against the money and push against the power,"" Haley said at her election-night celebration in Columbia, South Carolina. ""And boy did they push back."" Haley told supporters, ""Over the last two weeks, we said no to the dark side of politics."" Haley, Barrett headed for runoff . In California, Whitman topped Steve Poizner in the gubernatorial primary. Whitman, who also was an adviser and surrogate for Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential bid, spent around $70 million of her own money in the race. Poizner, California's insurance commissioner and a self-made multimillionaire, injected some $25 million of his money into his campaign. California Republicans batter each other in primaries. The winner in November will succeed Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who can't seek re-election because of term limits. Fiorina easily won the Republican Senate primary, and polls suggest that Boxer faces a tough re-election battle. In neighboring Nevada, Reid also is considered vulnerable in November. A crowded field of 13 Republicans were competing for a chance to challenge the Senate majority leader in his bid for a fifth term in the Senate. Angle, a former Nevada Assembly member, won endorsements from many conservative organizations, including significant financial backing from the Tea Party Express, a national Tea Party group best known for running cross-country bus caravans, and the Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative organization. Gibbons' loss makes him the first incumbent governor to lose a primary this year. Former federal Judge Brian Sandoval won the state's GOP gubernatorial contest. Nevada Republicans in 'slugfest' for right to take on Reid . In Arkansas, Lincoln was able to survive a primary runoff despite an anti-incumbent wave, but she'll face a tough general-election fight against Rep. John Boozman, the GOP nominee. ""We've got a lot worth fighting for. A whole lot worth fighting for. We're going to make sure, as we regroup tomorrow, we put this campaign on a trajectory toward November and a victory in November,"" Lincoln said after the results came in. Lincoln fights 'incumbent' label . Iowa, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia also held primaries Tuesday. Former state Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican, won the runoff in Georgia to fill the seat of former Rep. Nathan Deal. Deal, also a Republican, stepped down this year to run for Georgia governor.

"New York (CNN) -- A man who faces a trespassing charge for allegedly triggering a security breach at the Newark, New Jersey, airport was released from custody early Saturday, Port Authority police said. Haison Jiang, 28, of Piscataway, faces a charge of defiant trespass, the Port Authority said. Security video from the incident Sunday shows an officer of the federal Transportation Security Administration who left his post unattended a few minutes after he asked an unidentified man in a light-colored jacket to stay behind the rope line. Moments later, the man ducks under the rope and walks the wrong way through security to greet a woman, prompting a security breach that shut down Terminal C for hours and forced the rescreening of thousands of passengers. A law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Jiang was arrested in Piscataway, about 25 miles south of Newark. On Thursday, the TSA said the action's of the officer on the video led to the breach. ""We will use this hard lesson to reinforce the sharp focus and tight discipline at all our stations across the country and ensure we maintain the public trust,"" spokeswoman Ann Davis said. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, had called on the man to turn himself in to authorities. ""The message cannot go out to terrorists, people who would do damage to our citizens, that you could take a chance and get in,"" he told reporters Friday night. ""This has to be seen as the equivalent of a terrible crime. ""What he did was a terrible injustice to the 16,000 people who were inconvenienced terribly,"" he said. ""This fellow was responsible for it. As such he has to pay whatever the maximum price is."" The senator praised Port Authority police on the arrest, saying that with it, ""law enforcement will be able to take a closer look into how and why this incident occurred and make sure that it never happens again."" Lautenberg will participate in a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on U.S. aviation security on January 20. Davis said earlier this week that although authorities were unable to locate the man, any threat he may have presented was eliminated ""by rescreening everyone and recombing the airport to make sure he didn't introduce anything to the environment or hand anything off to anyone.""","NEW: Haison Jiang, 28, of Piscataway, faces a charge of defiant trespass .

"(CNN) -- A 54-year-old man accused of fathering seven children with his daughter was arrested this week in Pinheiro, Brazil, police said, according to CNN affiliate Record TV. Jose Agostinho Bispo Pereira was arrested after complaints that he sexually abused his daughter, whom he kept captive, said police chief Adriana Meireles said. According to police, Pereira had sex with his daughter since she was 12 years old. Now 29, the daughter has seven children from her father. ""It is a crime. I know that it is a crime,"" Pereira told Record TV. ""But she was committing the crime as well, wasn't she? Then, I had to do it."" ""A farmer only does things because the other consents, because if the other doesn't consent, the person doesn't do (it),"" he added. Police are now investigating whether Pereira also sexually abused a 2-year-old granddaughter or his other children. ""The authorities are going to request physical exams for the two daughters that Pereira had with his daughter, ages eight and six years old,"" Meireles told Record TV. ""The 8-year-old has already confessed to police that Pereira was touching her, and we are going to corroborate with exams."" The seven children range in age from two months old to 12 years. They were found in poor condition, dirty and with no shoes or clothes, inside the house he shared with his daughter, police said.

"(CNN) -- Taiwan's former leader Chen Shui-bian and and his wife Wu Shu-jen have been sentenced to 20 years in jail, the island's High Court reported. Both had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment after their convictions in 2009 on charges of corruption. The court fined Chen 170 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $5.3 million) and fined his wife 200 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $6.2 million). During his trial, prosecutors said Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $18.5 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for. Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony.  Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor. Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China.","NEW:  Former Taiwanese leader and wife fined total of 370 million New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $11.5 million)

"Washington (CNN) -- Potentially hundreds of American veterans and their family members who were laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery were misidentified or mislocated, including some in an area that includes grave sites from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a new Army investigation. The investigation culminated in a change in leadership at the historic cemetery that has been home to U.S. veterans since 1864. ""I deeply apologize to the families of the honored fallen resting in that hallowed ground, who may now question the care afforded to their loved ones,"" Secretary of the Army John McHugh said. McHugh launched the Army inspector general's investigation last fall after reports of cremated remains being buried in the wrong grave sites, according to Army officials. It was an expansion of an ongoing investigation into cemetery management issues launched by previous Secretary Peter Geren. The investigation cited missing burial records, unmarked graves and burial urns put in a spillage pile, where dirt dug up for grave sites is left. Investigators also said inaccurate burial maps are a ""systemic problem,"" which did not allow them to visit all the graves in question. Army investigators found a ""lack of established policies and procedures, a failure to automate records, and long-term systemic problems,"" documents show. After reviewing the investigation, McHugh made immediate changes but did not fire anyone. Instead, he ordered punishments to the cemetery's leadership. Longtime Superintendent John C. Metzler was reprimanded, and his deputy, Thurman Higginbotham, was temporarily removed pending further review. The general in charge of the Army investigation, Lt. Gen. Steven Whitcomb, said that two of the 211 mismarked graves were those of troops buried in the section reserved for those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. McHugh said those problems had been resolved. The other 209 or so were scattered among three other sites at the cemetery during an unknown period of time, Whitcomb said. ""I don't know that there could be many more, but there could be more,"" he said. With the cemetery holding more than 300,000 graves going back almost 150 years, the Army admits it can't guarantee that all will be accounted for. McHugh would not identify the names of the remains affected by the mismanagement. ""While the inspector general's team found that [cemetery] employees performed their jobs with dedication and to a high professional standard, they also found them hampered by dysfunctional management, the lack of established policy and procedures and an overall unhealthy organizational climate,"" McHugh said. ""That ends today."" Some 330,000 veterans and their family members are buried at the tree-covered and hilly Arlington, Virginia, site overlooking the nation's capital. McHugh said during a Pentagon press briefing Thursday that Metzler, the 19-year superintendent, will receive a letter of reprimand to last three years in his permanent work file. Additionally, Metzler will receive reduced benefits for his poor management of the facility. Before Thursday's announcement, Metzler had filed for retirement effective July 2. But McHugh will not let him serve out his full duties, according to his letter of reprimand. Metzler will be responsible for funeral operations until his retirement, and the cemetery's management duties will be given to an interim superintendent. ""Given your decision to retire, I have elected not to initiate more severe disciplinary action,"" McHugh said in the letter of reprimand. McHugh also created a position to oversee operations at Arlington and will himself oversee the superintendent position. Metzler's final duties will include ensuring a smooth transition for the person coming into this new position. While Metzler is blamed for poor management, deputy Higginbotham is being looked at for improper activities, including making false statements to Army investigators, creating a hostile work environment, having unauthorized access to employee e-mails and signing a false document, according to Pentagon officials close to the case. According to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly about the case, the Army will ensure that Higginbotham will not work at the cemetery. The Army has created a call center to address family concerns regarding burial discrepancies at Arlington National Cemetery. The number is (703) 607- 8199 and will be open from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. beginning Friday.","Hundreds of graves misidentified or mislocated, Army inspection finds .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese court sentenced a man to death Friday for injuring 16 primary school children and a teacher with a knife, state media reported. The attack took place in late April. Although none of the children died in the attack, Chen Kangbing was convicted of murder by Intermediary People's Court of Zhanjiang City in southeastern China's Guangdong province, according to the Xinhua news agency. ""Chen hacked at the children and teacher in a very cruel manner, causing great harm,"" the verdict said. The Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. Chen, a teacher at another primary school, entered Leicheng No.1 Primary School in Leizhou City with a 40-centimeter (16-inch) knife and attacked children on April 28. Since March at least four knife and cleaver attacks on school children in China have been reported. Guns are strictly regulated in China, but until recently large knives were not. Chinese authorities have recently issued a regulation requiring people to register with their national ID cards when they buy knives longer that 15 centimeters. Other measures have been put in place. In April, the Ministry of Education ordered kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools to restrict strangers from entering the campuses. The ministry instructed schools across the country to hire security guards, install security facilities and ensure that pupils were escorted home. Schools were also urged to teach pupils to how to protect themselves. In some schools, security guards have been armed with ""forks,"" long poles with semi-circular prongs that can be used to fight assailants.","Death sentence given to man who attacked children and teacher .

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Now you see it, now you don't. David and Janelle Shimshi 's lack of income has left them struggling to pay for daughter Shalom's preschool. Las Vegas magician David Shimshi used to work as house magician at the famous Mirage hotel and performed with the World's Greatest Magicians show at the Greek Isles Casino. Now Shimshi, as he's known to everyone, including his wife Janelle, has seen his gigs disappear, a victim of the struggling economy. ""We're in a challenging time right now,"" says Terry Jicinsky, senior vice president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Shimshi's job these days is Mr. Mom, taking care of his 3-year-old daughter Shalom, while his wife Janelle works for a local caterer. Janelle Shimshi has her own loss to deal with. Her life-long dream of owning a small business went bust. The Shimshis took their life savings and invested in a Smoothie King franchise. ""It looked so promising and it just grew every month,"" says Janelle Shimshi. But nine months after they opened, the customers stopped coming in. ""You think about it ... Do I want to spend $4.50 on a smoothie or do I want to go put gas in my car?"" she says. The Shimshis aren't the only ones to lose. They once pulled in more than $10,000 each month, much of which they put right back into the Las Vegas  economy.   They cancelled their home phone service, pool service, and a monthly pest control service that kept a scorpion problem in check. Restaurants are out along with the tanning spa for Janelle. When their large-screen TV died recently, there was no money to replace it, said the Shimshis.  Watch the magician's struggle » . The couple's daughter Shalom attended a preschool five days a week. With neither parent working, they couldn't afford the $875 monthly tuition. But the school stepped in to help. Ner Tamid preschool director Lonnie Kritzler says she has been hearing from a family each week that a job is lost and tuition will be hard to make.   ""The Rabbi is helping out,"" says Kritzler. The school is providing ""scholarship money to help in that situation. There's no way we could close the doors to any of the children or their parents."" Shimshi is no vanishing act.

"(CNN)  -- Hosts South Africa opened the 2010 World Cup with a 1-1 draw with Mexico on Friday as the world's greatest sporting spectacle arrived on the African continent for the first time. An estimated global audience of hundreds of millions watched as the home side's Siphiwe Tshabalala crashed home the first goal of the tournament early in the second half to send Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium into ecstatic celebrations. Mexico's Rafael Marquez leveled the scores with 11 minutes left, beating goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune from close range. But South Africa's Katlego Mphela missed a golden opportunity to win the match in the final moments as his shot bounced back off the post. Hosts denied by Marquez equalizer . A deafening drone sounded around the 94,000-capacity showpiece arena as home fans greeted the teams by blowing on vuvuzelas -- the plastic horn that has become a symbol of South African football. South African President Jacob Zuma, Mexican President Felipe Calderon and FIFA President Sepp Blatter were introduced to the two sides before kickoff. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we as a country are humbled by this honor to host one of the biggest tournaments of the world,"" Zuma said. ""Africa is indeed happy. This is the African World Cup. I declare the 2010 FIFA World Cup open."" Earlier, a spectacular tribal-themed opening ceremony featured a dazzling array of dancers in traditional costumes, as well as music from Grammy winner R Kelly. Archbishop Desmond Tutu was among other dignitaries in attendance but former president Nelson Mandela was absent following the death of his great-grandchild in a car crash early on Friday morning. FIFA President Blatter paid tribute to Mandela, who was instrumental in South Africa's campaign to host the tournament. ""A dream came true even if he's not here tonight, but the spirit of Mandela is in Soccer City,"" said Blatter. Mandela misses World Cup ceremony . Fans had gathered outside the stadium hours before the gates opened, many dressed in the yellow jersey of the South African team and carrying vuvuzelas and the country's post-apartheid rainbow flag. Others displayed homemade banners, one reading: ""49 million South Africans vs. 11 Mexicans."" Another said: ""I believe we can win the World Cup! Because this is a country of possibilities."" ""We are all so excited. We woke up at 5 a.m. just to make sure we would get here in time but we only left at 7 because we were singing and dancing at home,"" Hope Zini, who was first into the stadium, told FIFA.com.

The month-long tournament, which takes place every four years, marks the World Cup's first visit to the continent of Africa in its 80-year-history. Ten venues around the country will host 64 matches, culminating in the final on July 11 at Soccer City. Why the World Cup is sports' biggest occasion . Thirty-two teams are taking part with world champions Italy defending the title they won in Germany four years ago. European champions Spain and five-times winners Brazil are considered the favorites. As well as the hosts, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Cameroon and Algeria are carrying African hopes. Star players such as the current world footballer of the year Lionel Messi of Argentina, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, Brazil's Kaka and England's Wayne Rooney are hoping to follow in the footsteps of former legends such as Pele and Diego Maradona by writing their names into World Cup history. How you can sound like a World Cup expert . South Africa's team -- who rank just 83rd in the world -- face a massive challenge if they are to avoid becoming the first host nation to be eliminated in the first round. South Africa have won just one match in their two previous appearances at the World Cup. After Mexico, they also face France and Uruguay, who drew 0-0 later Friday in Cape Town. The top two teams from each of eight four-team groups advance to a knockout round of 16. CNN teams up with Foursquare for World Cup . The tournament could be the loudest World Cup ever due to South African fans' habit of turning up to matches with vuvuzelas -- a plastic horn which has attracted criticism from some players and officials because of its ear-splitting noise levels. ""This World Cup will have a completely different sound to any other,"" said Pinto. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" said CNN's Pedro Pinto. ""Africa is ready for an historic moment. You can really feel the energy in the air."" But there was sadness Friday over the death of Mandela's 13-year-old great-grandchild, Zenani Mandela, in a car crash as he was returning home from a World Cup kickoff concert in Soweto. Mandela, an icon of black South Africans' struggle against white rule, played a key role in bringing the World Cup to South Africa. FIFA President Sepp Blatter said the 91-year-old would be ""be with us in spirit."" ""The entire football family mourns with you and your family, and today we stand by their side,"" Blatter wrote in a letter to Mandela. The World Cup is the world's biggest sporting event with FIFA, football's governing body, predicting a cumulative TV audience for the tournament of more than 26 billion. Just seven countries have won the World Cup, which was first staged in Uruguay in 1930. Brazil have won five times (1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002); Italy four times (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006); Germany (as West Germany) three times (1954, 1974, 1990); Argentina twice (1978, 1986), and England (1966) and France (1998) once each.","South Africa draw 1-1 with Mexico in opening game of the 2010 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Twitter has become a vital tool over the past few years, allowing folks to chronicle everything from the Hudson River plane crash to performances of Romeo and Juliet. A recent study from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign suggests the microblogging site can improve relationships in RL (that's Real Life). But it's also become a venue by which people may -- to put it plainly -- overshare. There's a big difference between tweeting about something personal in an interesting, relevant fashion (like when blogger David Chen live-tweeted his naturalization oath ceremony) and telling your poor Twitter followers every thought that crosses your cranium (""I like pigeons!"" ""Quarters are shiny!"" ""My left boob is bigger than my right!""). It can be tough to recognize when you're beating the TMI drum just a little too loudly -- the need for a reaction from your followers can often outweigh your better judgment -- but sometimes a simple edit is all you need to avoid the dreaded ""unfollow."" Observe: . The TMI tweet: ""OMG! I'm going to Hawaii with my super hot GF & we're gonna lie in the sun!! #FYeahCruise!"" Why people hate you: Hmm, let's see: You're going on a freaking cruise while the average follower is sitting in a cubicle counting down the miserable moments until another sad Happy Hour with his/her single friends. Maybe people are, I dunno, jealous? Twit fix: ""Excited for a well-deserved vacay. Can anyone suggest must-see spots in Maui?"" If you share your joy while also asking for advice, you engage your followers, thereby alleviating the tedium of their comparatively bleak days. Be sure to tweet back at those kind enough to answer. The TMI tweet: ""I just ate a bagel, some chips and a Dr. Pepper. My tummy hurts."" Why people hate you: First, you said ""tummy."" Second, NO ONE CARES. Third, you're whining, and that's annoying. Twit fix: ""Just had a great wrap at Grey Dog Cafe in Manhattan. Get the marinated tofu -- healthy and delish."" If you insist on telling everyone what you had for lunch, at least have a good lunch. Moaning about pretty much any banal First-World problem on Twitter rates high on the annoying scale. Instead, offer your readers some kind of value -- i.e. a fabulous alternative to the brown bag lunch Mom packed (yes, some of your followers likely still live at home). The TMI tweet: ""I just went on the best date ever with the hottest guy ever and I think I love him!"" Why people hate you: In this case, you're more likely to inspire fear rather than outright hate (unless your jealous ex follows you -- and he totally does). If your new love interest sees your tweet, it could come off as a little intense and scare him away. Plus, it sends a signal that you'll probably dish more sordid details as the relationship develops -- and no one wants his sex life to become a trending topic. Twit fix: ""For some reason I have this jam stuck in my head [insert link to ambiguously lovey-dovey song here]."" (Tools like Song.ly and Blip.fm make this super easy.) If homeboy happens to see this tweet, he will be sweetly intrigued. Also, you're providing your followers (remember them? -- the people who actually read your tweets because they care what you have to say?) with a new tune. Everyone wins. The TMI tweet: ""[Insert name here] is about as intelligent as that kid in pre-K who sat in the corner, eating googly-eyes and drooling on the teacher's shoulder."" Why people hate you: Ha. Your followers actually would love you for this -- [insert name here], not so much. Twit fix: Twitter feuds are about as classy as vajazzling (which is to say, not at all.) Just refrain from getting out the claws, or if you must let your negative ions rip, limit your rants to an e-mail to your snarkiest friend (the one with whom you get frequent gossip hangovers).

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the National Football League over its exclusive contract with an apparel maker in one of the most important sports law cases in decades. In a 9-0 decision Monday, the justices said the league can be considered 32 separate teams, not a single business. The court allowed a lawsuit against the league to continue, saying the licensing of intellectual property ""constitutes concerted action"" that is not part of the broad antitrust protection enjoyed by professional baseball. Such protection allows individual teams to act as one business when making a host of financial decisions, including marketing their logos and trademarks. The outcome could affect other sports franchises with similar limited antitrust exemption, as well as businesses that have cooperative networks, such as credit card companies. The National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NASCAR, professional tennis and Major League Soccer backed the NFL in its appeal, seeking similarly broad antitrust protection. ""Decisions by NFL teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that 'deprive the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,' "" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court, ""and therefore of actual or potential competition."" The case involves a lawsuit from American Needle Inc., an Illinois-based sports apparel maker that was one of several companies with long-standing contracts with NFL Properties, a separate corporate entity that develops, licenses and markets the intellectual property of each team. But in 2001, the league entered into an exclusive 10-year contract with Reebok to manufacture hats, jackets and other clothing featuring team logos. American Needle is no longer able to negotiate with individual teams. Some fans have complained that the prices on such gear have skyrocketed in the absence of competition from other apparel makers. A Baltimore Ravens ""replica jersey"" with the name of star quarterback Joe Flacco, for example, now is listed for $108 on the team's Web site. American Needle complained that the deal violated a 120-year-old antitrust law designed to limit cartels and monopolies, and to foster fair competition in the marketplace. The key section of the law bans business rivals from conspiring to blunt competition or hurt consumers, by either increasing prices or limiting choices. ""The court vindicated the position of American Needle,"" said Glen Nager, attorney for the company. The ruling reinstates the firm's lawsuit against the NFL. Nager said the result of the Reebok deal was that the league's 32 teams ""put all of their intellectual property under the control of a single licensee, Reebok, and prices [went] up by 150 percent."" ""The case has to go forward, and American Needle is entitled to its day in court,"" Nager added. He said he was not surprised by the unanimous decision. The ruling overturned of a 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that the league was one, not 32. Baseball is the only sports league that enjoys complete antitrust protection. The NFL has long sought similar status. The dilemma is acute because of the unique nature of pro sports, including American football and its 32 teams. Those teams, including top apparel sellers the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers, compete against each other on the field and off -- for victories, for players and for their own brands. But the league maintains unilateral rules and structure that all teams must follow to ensure parity and an equal playing field. The NFL negotiates national television contracts and deals with the players' union through collective bargaining. The league says trademark licensing primarily benefits the on-field competition. ""A sports league produces a single entertainment product,"" the league told the high court, ""a structured series of athletic competitions leading to a championship, that no member club could produce on its own."" But American Needle countered that the structure does not erase the fact that ""the teams are separately owned and controlled profit-making enterprises. They are actual and potential competitors in numerous areas, including the licensing of intellectual properties."" The Obama administration supported neither side, saying the league can be considered a single business in some areas but not others. Stevens noted that the ruling will not completely hamstring the league. ""Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law,"" he wrote. ""The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions. But the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted activity under the Sherman Act."" The ruling throws the dispute back to the lower federal courts to sort out the parameters of a possibly reworked licensing agreement that presumably would favor American Needle. Retail sales of NFL-licensed merchandise in the United States and Canada was about $3.2 billion in 2007, according to the trade journal Sports Licensing Report. The combined total for football, baseball, hockey, basketball and soccer is more than $9 billion annually. Among those backing the league are credit card companies, fearing that a ruling against the NFL could set a precedent that would hurt the federation of banks that constitutes the credit card network for companies like Visa and MasterCard. Workers' rights groups feared that a win for the sports league could have boosted its power in other off-field activities, perhaps giving owners immunity from lawsuits in areas like television rights, video-game licenses, franchise relocation and possibly athlete salaries. Unions also expressed concern that the current legal fight could lead to labor unrest and possible player strikes, since the leagues might be protected legally from accusations owners conspired to keep down salaries. Athletes say salaries, free agency rights and pensions could also have been affected by a ruling against them. The NFL Players Association backed American Needle in the high court appeal. The case is American Needle v. National Football League (08-661). CNN Radio's Bob Costantini contributed to this report.","American Needle says NFL deal with Reebok violates antitrust law .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican government is requesting a quick and transparent investigation into the fatal shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol agent of a Mexican teen in Ciudad Juarez on Monday night, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. The teen was shot during a rock-throwing incident, Mexican and U.S. officials said. Mexico ""reiterates that the use of firearms to repel a rock attack represents a disproportionate use of force, particularly coming from authorities who receive specialized training on the matter,"" the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday in a news release. The teen's death was the second at the hands of U.S. border authorities in less than two weeks. Monday night's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the United States near the Paso del Norte port of entry, FBI Special Agent Andrea Simmons said. A suspect identified as Oscar Ivan Pineda Ayala was initially detained on the Rio Grande levee, said the FBI, which is leading the investigation. ""Another agent arrived on his bicycle along the cement apron that forms the riverbank on the U.S. side,"" Simmons said in a release. ""That agent detained a second subject, Augustin Alcaraz Reyes, but other subjects ran into Mexico and began to throw rocks at the agent. ""This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat,"" Simmons said. ""However, the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him. The agent then fired his service weapon several times, striking one subject who later died."" Simmons told CNN earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border, but that the agent never left U.S. territory. The body was found on the Mexican side of the border, Simmons said. The attorney general's office in Chihuahua identified the dead 14-year-old boy as secondary student Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca. Belmonte said Hernandez had been shot in the head. ""The young man was not armed,"" Ciudad Juarez spokesman Sergio Belmonte said. ""He did not have the physical size to threaten anyone. The aggression (by the U.S. agent) is evident."" The shooting occurred underneath the Black Bridge, a railroad span that connects the two countries, the Mexican official said. The FBI said the ""area where this incident occurred is a known high-risk crime area where rocks are regularly thrown at Border Patrol agents and where other assaults have been reported."" The FBI, which has jurisdiction in any assault on a federal officer, is leading the U.S. investigation with assistance from the  El Paso Police Department, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies, Simmons said. The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California. San Diego police, who are investigating the death of Anastasio Hernandez, said he was beaten with a baton and shot with a stun gun after he became combative. California medical officials ruled his death a homicide. The investigation in that case continues. Mexican officials complained Tuesday that they see an increasing trend. ""The growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities,"" the Foreign Ministry said. According to the ministry, the number of Mexicans who have been killed or wounded by U.S. border authorities has increased from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 and 17 so far this year. Mark Qualia, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics. But Qualia said there were 799 assaults on border agents from October 1, 2009, through May 31, up from 745 assaults for the same time period in 2007-08 and 658 for the same span in 2008-09. Lethal force, he said, is allowed ""when an agent is in imminent threat of physical or bodily harm, which could cause death or injury or in protection of an innocent third party."" The determination of when to use lethal force, Qualia said, is made by each individual agent at the scene. From October 1 through May 31, he said, Custom and Border Protection agents have used their firearms 31 times. Rock-throwing can be considered a dangerous assault, Qualia said: ""They're not chunking pebbles.""

"(CNN) -- Three human heads and three decapitated bodies with notes aimed at high government officials were found Thursday in different parts of Guatemala's capital, national police said. The notes were addressed to Interior Minister Carlos Menocal and Eddy Morales, the nation's director of prisons. One of the notes said the officials must impose order in the nation's prisons or these atrocities would continue, police said. The other said that impunity against lawlessness must end, according to police. The heads were inside plastic bags, one of them in front of the main doors to the national Congress in Guatemala City, police said. ""That's obviously a first for Guatemala,"" said Samuel Logan, an expert on Latin American gangs and founding editor of the Southern Pulse intelligence report. ""That's something we've seen the Zetas (drug cartel) do in Mexico."" Donald Gonzalez, a spokesman for the national police, attributed the slayings to the Zetas or another narcotrafficking group, the Prensa Libre newspaper reported. Gonzalez did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Logan did not discount the possibility that anti-crime vigilantes could have been responsible. ""It could also be death squads,"" he said. ""Off-duty police officers or other types hired by local businessmen who say, 'Go after the street gangs.' ""There's a lot of moving parts to this story,"" said Logan, who recently wrote a book on the Mara Salvatrucha gang of Central America and is working on a book about the Zetas, which has emerged as Mexico's most ruthless drug cartel. Logan said in an interview last year that there are two main criminal elements in Guatemala: drug cartels that deal in large-scale exportation and street gangs that sell drugs at the retail level and are involved in other crimes, such as robbery and extortion. In some cases, they work together. When those criminals get arrested, they continue their activities inside prison, said Fernando Carrera Castro, director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies in Guatemala City. ""The prisons, in general, are centers of corruption,"" Carrera said last year. ""From inside prison, they direct kidnappings, extortion, drug trafficking."" Prison officials are often targeted for violence. In September, three coordinated attacks killed four prison officials in a five-hour span. Left dead were a prison assistant director, a warden and two guards. One guard and a shooting suspect were wounded, as were three citizens. One of the wounded was a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy, news accounts said. At least three prison guards have been killed and five wounded in five attacks this year, published reports say. Logan said that all of Central America is under attack from organized crime cartels, because the region is pinched between Colombia and Mexico, the two biggest sources of drugs in the area. U.S. interdiction efforts that have targeted the flow of drugs through the Caribbean Sea also have forced cartels to travel through the Central American isthmus, Logan said. Within Central America, he said, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have the worst problems. Among those three nations, Guatemala stands out. ""When you talk about a country being hollowed out by organized crime, Guatemala is at the top of the list,"" Logan said. There are two main reasons, he said: geography and an incompetent and corrupt government. ""Guatemala bunches right up against Mexico,"" Logan said. ""Any spillover effect is almost certainly going south."" Said Heather Berkman, a Central America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, ""The narcos are coming down from Mexico."" In addition, Logan said, the federal government is not able to control large segments of the country. For example, Peten state in northern Guatemala, bordered on two sides by Mexico, is lawless, he said. Berkman made the same point in an interview last year. ""The narcos control about 40 percent of the territory down there, which is pretty amazing,"" she said. Berkman also pointed out that the Guatemalan government reduced anti-crime spending in the 2010 budget because of the nation's dire economic situation. ""If you don't have resources, you can't pay for troops and supplies and intelligence,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The BP oil spill has brought into the public's eye the tragedy of oiled wildlife.  The pictures last week of pelicans completely covered in oil were horrific and rightly produced an outcry of rage from the public. Should these birds, and other oiled wildlife, be saved?  Much like the struggle to contain the oil itself, there are no quick fixes or easy answers. First, we need to emphasize that rescue and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife must be performed by trained wildlife professionals and volunteers. Without proper training, would-be rescuers can inadvertently harm or further stress oiled wildlife or be harmed themselves, either by struggling animals or the oil itself.  Rescuers must go through a weeklong training on the handling of hazardous materials as well as proper wildlife rescue techniques. Wildlife rehabilitation is difficult. It is more than simply retrieving, washing and releasing wildlife contaminated with oil. Rehabilitators not only clean wildlife but provide veterinary care and feeding.  Some animals are desperately ill, while others may need only minimal care.  Each animal is individually assessed and then treated appropriately. Experts may make the difficult decision that some creatures can't be saved. Read why some experts say birds should be euthanized . Even if we do everything right, the long-term survival of rehabilitated wildlife may be uncertain. Beyond the short-term threats of oil poisoning and hypothermia, surviving wildlife face potential loss of their food sources and habitat. And it's not as simple as moving affected individuals to a new location -- if a species moved 500 miles away from where it was originally lived, it might not be able to locate food and in some cases might even return to the original, oil-polluted location. Wildlife at risk from the BP oil spill include five species of threatened or endangered sea turtles, including the most endangered sea turtle in the world, the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, which is largely dependent on the Gulf of Mexico. The brown pelican, in addition to having symbolic importance as Louisiana's state bird, was only recently taken off the Endangered Species List.  For species that are threatened or endangered, every individual is critically important to help contribute to the survival of these species. Some have argued that we shouldn't bother to try to save any oiled birds, that given the long odds many face, we should simply euthanize all of them. That line of thinking overlooks recent advances in wildlife rehabilitation. It also lumps the sickest birds together with ones that may only be mildly ill. More broadly, it misses the point that this isn't just about playing the percentages. Humanity is an important factor in the decision to rehabilitate oiled animals.  People caused this problem, and many feel it is our ethical duty to try to help the wildlife suffering as a result, even if the task is difficult and the outcome uncertain. At the National Wildlife Federation, we've heard from so many Americans who feel a sense of helplessness as the oil continues to gush and as BP's attempts to stop it continue to fail. Knowing that efforts are being made to save the innocent wildlife victims of this disaster not only helps the emotional stress of the public, it also gives them hope and rallies them to get involved, whether it's making a donation to the response effort or contacting their elected officials. The sad reality is that many of the Gulf's most critical species are now swimming against the current.  Rehabilitation is difficult, and survival is uncertain. This only underscores the critical importance of clean energy and climate legislation now so we can prevent these disasters from happening in the future. That's the only real way to ensure that we don't have to see more images of oiled wildlife struggling and dying in disasters of our own making. The best way to help personally is to give, which you can do by texting WILDLIFE to 20222 to donate $10 to the NWF Gulf Oil Spill Restoration Fund.

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Ronnie Lee Gardner, who is set to die next week before Utah's firing squad, said something Thursday he didn't plan to: He supports capital punishment. But, Gardner told the five-member Utah Board of Pardons and Parole, he thinks the death penalty needs to be ""as fair as you can get it."" Testifying at his commutation hearing, Gardner said he accepts responsibility for killing two men and seriously wounding a third. But, he added, executing him on June 18 would not be fair because he's never had the chance to present evidence in court that might have swayed jurors from a death sentence. Gardner choked up as he said he hasn't been able to apologize to the families of his victims, saying they don't want to hear from him. He did not take that opportunity to apologize to the family members who were in the audience at the hearing. ""It makes me sad,"" he said, wiping his eyes. ""I know killing me is going to hurt them just as bad,"" he said. ""I've been on the other side of the gun. I know."" Now 49, Gardner is scheduled to be executed June 18 by firing squad for the murder of attorney Michael Burdell during an escape attempt at a Salt Lake City courthouse. Gardner, who had a long history of violence and escape, was at the courthouse on April 2, 1985, for a pretrial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom. He was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money. An acquaintance handed Gardner a gun at the courthouse; he fatally shot Burdell, who was there for another case, and shot and wounded bailiff Nick Kirk. Friends and relatives of his victims were split Thursday on whether Gardner deserves to die. ""Michael would not have wanted Ronnie Lee killed,"" Donna Nu, Burdell's fiancée, tearfully testified. ""I'm asking to honor his wishes and commute the sentence to life without parole."" But Craig Watson, Otterstrom's cousin, called for Gardner's execution. He testified that Otterstrom died while Gardner was robbing the Cheers bar, walking away with less than $100. Gardner fired a gun in Otterstrom's face and ""blew his head off,"" Watson said. ""In our minds, he did it just for fun."" Kirk's daughter, Tami Stewart, sobbed as she recalled how her father's shooting resulted in years of pain and five surgeries for him, and left him unable to go fishing and camping -- activities they previously had enjoyed as a family. ""That was the day that ruined my life,"" her father, who died in 1995, said of the day he was shot, Stewart testified. Otterstrom's son said he doesn't know what sentence his father's killer should receive. ""I've been told stories of how much my dad loved me, how he was a wonderful father,"" said Jason Otterstrom, who was 3 when his father was killed. ""I will never know. I will never know him."" Otterstrom said he is torn about whether to support the death penalty or life in prison without parole for Gardner. Whatever decision is made, he said, it should be permanent. ""Our families need peace. Our families deserve the opportunity to place this action in the past."" Closing arguments are set for Friday in the hearing, and the board will deliver its decision on Monday. Gardner's attorney, Andrew Parnes, pointed out that jurors in the Burdell murder trial were not given the option of deciding to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Parnes said it was suggested during the trial that if jurors didn't sentence Gardner to death, he might one day be released. Gardner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Otterstrom's death and the Burdell jury was not told of the judge's recommendation in that case that he never be freed from prison, Parnes said. Jurors also did not hear about Gardner's childhood, marked by poverty, neglect and abuse; his use of inhalants beginning at about age 6; and his being institutionalized in a mental hospital at age 10 or 11. Craig Haney, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said he has studied many death-row prisoners, nearly all of whom have had disadvantaged childhoods. ""I can tell you that Mr. Gardner's life stands among the very worst,"" he testified. Gardner's mother asked to be sterilized after his birth, he said, telling hospital personnel she could not care for the children she already had. In 1963, Gardner, then 2, was found wandering in the street, clad only in a diaper. The record of neglect ""never wavered and it never varied"" throughout Gardner's childhood, Haney said. While social workers and others made frequent notes of the situation, no one appears to have done anything to rectify it. His placement in the mental hospital at age 10 or 11 came not because of mental illness, Haney said. Instead, it stemmed from a need to keep Gardner away from his family and, authorities noted, introduce him to a ""normal"" way of life. Doctors at the hospital noted that Gardner was already addicted to sniffing glue and paint, which could have caused brain damage, Haney said. The account painted a picture of a little boy who felt stupid, unloved and with no place in the world. But it did not move ValDean Kirk, bailiff Nick Kirk's widow, who plans to witness Gardner's execution. While many people have bad childhoods, she said afterward, they overcome it. ""He just wants to get out,"" she said of Gardner. While he may have had disadvantages, she said, ""He knew right and wrong. That's all you need to know."" Gardner testified that he realizes he will spend the rest of his life in prison if he is not executed. ""I have changed,"" he said, noting that he -- once a ""nasty little bugger"" -- has had no discipline problems in prison in the last five years and only minor incidents in the last decade. ""It was just time to grow up and accept what I've done,"" he said. Nu told reporters she was never angry about the murder of the man she planned to marry. ""Michael ... believed in life. He didn't believe that when you die, it's over,"" she said. Nu is a member of Summum, a Salt Lake City-based religious movement, as was Burdell. Belief blog: What is Summum? Gardner's execution, she added, is not going to bring peace to the victims' families. ""Closure doesn't come from the outside,"" she said. ""It comes from the inside.""","Condemned killer Ronnie Lee Gardner testifies at commutation hearing .

"(CNN) -- A deathbed photo of Gary Coleman appeared Wednesday on the cover of Globe Magazine, showing the actor's ex-wife staring into the camera next to the former child actor. The man named executor in Coleman's will accused Shannon Price of profiting from her ex-husband's death by selling the image to the tabloid, and suggested she is destined for the ""life of a social and professional outcast."" Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage in a Provo, Utah, hospital. Globe parent company American Media confirmed it bought the photo, but spokeswoman Samantha Trenk would not disclose how much was paid or who sold the image. A Utah judge appointed Dion Mial, Coleman's longtime friend and former manager, as special administrator of the estate while the will goes through the probate process. A will signed in 1999 named Mial as executor. Mial threatened to have Price, 24, arrested unless she returned property he said had been taken from Coleman's home since his death. She must also stay away from the Santaquin home where they lived together, Mial said. While Coleman was not believed wealthy when he died, his personal possessions may be valuable to collectors. ""These items include, but are not limited to, numerous televisions and video game systems, a black 2005 Dodge pick-up truck (registered to Coleman), cargo trailer (registered to Coleman), model train sets, computers, telephones, musical instruments, and furnishings,"" Mial said. ""It is our hope that Miss Price should immediately and respectfully comply with the court's order, so as to avoid the filing of criminal charges against her,"" Mial said. Mial was unable to stop the Globe from publishing the death images, which he accused Price of peddling to tabloids in an ""ongoing desperate attempt"" to profit from his death. ""These actions simply illuminate and magnify the truth that our gift of free will may, ultimately, relegate us to a long life of bondage and imprisonment that the life of a social and professional outcast, indeed, will bring,"" Mial said Wednesday. ""May God bless Miss Price and her 'free will.'"" A statement released by Price's publicist Monday did not deny Mial's accusation, but did say she needed money because she had helped Mial pay for a lawyer. ""Dion, who claims to be a good friend of Gary, would know that Gary's only wishes were to make sure that Shannon would be OK after he was gone,"" the statement said. ""So if Dion was a good friend he would be assisting Shannon, not taking all her money, to pay for his attorney and then use it to take everything from her.""","NEW: Coleman estate administrator says ex-wife will become ""outcast""

"(CNN) -- It's amazing what a little spring cleaning can turn up. Fourth-grade teacher Michelle Eugenio was in for quite a shock when she stumbled upon a document dating back to 1792 while emptying out an old classroom at the school where she teaches in Peabody, Massachusetts. She found the document, apparently a receipt for payment of a debt, buried among some old textbooks and papers. ""I looked at it, and I saw it was in plastic, which kind of told me there was a chance it was real,"" said Eugenio in an interview with CNN Radio. Eugenio says she shared the document with her social studies classes, and her students urged her to find out if it was real. She brought it to the Peabody Historical Society, which was able to authenticate the 218-year-old find. It turns out the document originally belonged to Jonathan Bates, a Vermont man who had served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. The paper appears to convey that Bates had paid off a debt, according to Paul Carnahan, a librarian with the Vermont Historical Society in Barre, Vermont. ""What's fascinating is that this turned up in a school classroom so far from Vermont,"" said Carnahan. How that happened is uncertain. Eugenio says the school building where she found it only dates back to the 1930s. However, she does have a theory. ""The only thing I can think of is that a teacher who was there before me or a student brought it in to show. Then it was put up onto a shelf and forgotten about,"" said Eugenio. The document reveals little else about Bates beyond his military service and his debt payment, according to Carnahan. He says records show Bates was born in Williamstown, Vermont, and died in 1808 at the age of 63. Bates' gravestone was recorded during a WPA inventory in the 1930s and in burial records in Williamstown. But Carnahan says people who have gone to the cemetery looking for the grave in the past week were not able to find it -- possibly because a lot of the gravestones in the cemetery are damaged or have deteriorated over a period of time. You might think a document like this would be worth a pretty penny. But Eugenio says she doesn't plan to test the market. ""If I hold on to it I'll show it to my grade next year. Or, we'll give it to the historical society. The kids are excited. To find something of that kind of historical value is really important,"" she said.","Schoolteacher finds 1792 document buried among textbooks and papers .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of Natalee Holloway's body, but he would neither identify the location nor say what happened to her the night of her disappearance, a Peruvian police official told CNN Thursday in Lima. ""He says he knew the location of the American citizen but that he was going to explain everything to Aruban police,"" said Miguel Canlla, head of the homicide division of the Peruvian national police investigative unit. Van der Sloot, twice detained but never charged in the disappearance of Holloway five years ago in Aruba, was arrested last week in connection with a different case: the slaying of a 21-year-old Peruvian woman in Lima, the nation's capital. He confessed to the Peruvian woman's slaying earlier this week, police said. Van der Sloot was transferred from a police facility to the national attorney general's office Thursday morning, according to images broadcast by CNN affiliate America TV. His attorney, Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, told CNN his client will go from the attorney general's office to the Justice Ministry, where a judge will determine which jail he will go to. The lawyer said he has spoken with the director of jails in Lima to make sure van der Sloot is safe once he is moved to one of the city's maximum-security prisons. Altez said he planned to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot's confession in the Peruvian case, because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. The attorney said police got a public defense attorney to be present at the interrogation and subsequent confession, but that van der Sloot never agreed to this lawyer. Altez also said he has found indications that the handling of the evidence was tainted, especially the way the body was handled during the crime scene investigation. He intends to go to trial, Altez said. The body of Stephany Flores was found last week in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. Hotel surveillance video shows the pair entering his room and van der Sloot leaving alone more than three hours later. Altez said Flores attacked van der Sloot first, after he confronted her for going through his computer. Police said Flores was badly beaten and suffered a broken neck. Van der Sloot confessed Monday night after a seven-hour interrogation to killing Flores, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The Dutch citizen told investigators that he left the hotel room to buy bread and coffee at a gas station next to the hotel, the source said. Upon van der Sloot's return, he found Flores going through his laptop, where she found something linking him to Holloway's disappearance, the source said. At that point, Flores wanted to leave, and the pair started arguing, according to the source. Flores slapped van der Sloot, and he hit her back, and then grabbed her neck, the source said. Van der Sloot told investigators he had smoked marijuana before the confrontation, the source said. Although Flores' body was found half-dressed, there was no evidence that she had sexual intercourse that night, the source said. Van der Sloot, 22, was arrested in Chile on June 4 and returned to Peru the next day. While he was never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance in 2005, he has been charged in Alabama with extortion and wire fraud charges. According to a document from Interpol, van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway, on or around March 29 to ask for $250,000 in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway's remains. Van der Sloot received $25,000 last month, officials said. A representative for Holloway's mother who paid the money was an undercover FBI agent, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. However, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham, Alabama, said Wednesday that the FBI did not supply the money. ""Some news accounts have suggested that the FBI provided $25,000 in funds that were transmitted to van der Sloot. This is incorrect. The funds involved were private funds,"" the FBI and U.S. attorney's office said in a statement. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham arranged for a meeting in which van der Sloot was paid $10,000 in cash and another $15,000 in a wire transfer, a source familiar with the case said. The meeting took place in May, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham. Interpol documents show that the $15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands. The information about Natalee Holloway that van der Sloot provided to the FBI was not true, according to the documents. Although the investigation involving alleged extortion had been in motion for several weeks at the time of Flores' death, ""it was not sufficiently developed to bring charges prior to the time van der Sloot left Aruba,"" the FBI statement said. ""This is not due to any fault on the part of the FBI or the U.S. attorney's office, where agents and prosecutors were working as hard as possible to bring the case to fruition when they learned of the murder. A case based on events outside of the United States is a complex matter, and work was proceeding with all deliberate speed to prepare the evidence, the charges and the necessary procedures to obtain custody of van der Sloot,"" the statement said. CNN's Mayra Cuevas and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: Van der Sloot won't say where body is, official says .

"Cape Canaveral, Florida (CNN) -- Friday's test launch of the Falcon 9 rocket was ""essentially a bullseye,"" SpaceX officials said after the rocket successfully pushed past the earth's atmosphere and deposited a mock-up of its Dragon space capsule in orbit. The successful launch is the latest step toward commercial space ventures that could eventually ferry astronauts and cargo to the international space station. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, sent out the technical details of the successful launch, which he said performed its mission to deposit the Dragon mock-up into a 155-mile (250-km) orbit to near perfection. ""Nominal shutdown and orbit was almost exactly 250 km,"" Musk said in a written statement. ""Telemetry showed essentially a bullseye: 126;0.2% on perigee and 126;1% on apogee."" The capsule is expected to orbit for about a year and eventually burn up in the atmosphere. NASA administrator Charles Bolden congratulated the SpaceX team. ""Space X's accomplishment is an important milestone in the commercial transportation effort and puts the company a step closer to providing cargo services to the International Space Station,"" he said. Former Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweickart was high on the launch's possibilities. ""As a former Apollo astronaut, I think it's safe to say that SpaceX and the other commercial developers embody the 21st century version of the Apollo frontier spirit. It's enormously gratifying to see them succeed today,"" he said. NASA hopes companies such as SpaceX can take over transportation to the international space station. ""It's time for NASA to hand that over to commercial industry who can then optimize the technology and make it more reliable, make it much lower cost and make it much more routine,"" said Musk in an interview with CNN last month. Musk says he believes the United States is at the beginning of a profound, fundamental renaissance in space exploration, perhaps greater than when President Kennedy declared the United States was going to the moon during the infancy of the space program. ""If the country executes and the administration and Congress execute in that direction, the impact of these changes will be on par, perhaps even greater, than ... the task that Kennedy put us on to,"" he said. This push toward the privatization of space is part of President Obama's blueprint to allow NASA to do bigger and better things with its budget, such as a mission to Mars. NASA has been flying shuttles in low Earth orbit and going to and from the space station for 30 years. The administration would like to see whether private companies can do it cheaper and more efficiently, as the shuttle program is about to fly into retirement. NASA selected SpaceX and another company, Orbital Sciences, to each develop an orbital vehicle because the United States will not have its own way to get to the space station. The United States will be renting space from the Russians aboard their Soyuz spacecraft. ""They're standing on NASA's shoulders, so they're designing rockets based on the experience we've had for 50 years or more, going into space,"" said George Musser, editor of the Scientific American. ""And any enterprise that learns from past experience will hopefully do better,"" he said. But the competition is rabid. SpaceX is the first company to reach the launchpad. So far, its spent almost $400 million to get there. ""They probably hate each other's guts, but the competition is really good for space and for all of us,"" said Musser. ""Ultimately, what do we want from this? We want to get into space cheaply, so our kids and grandkids someday can go into space and explore the planets,"" he said. But SpaceX acknowledges there will be failures, as there have been since the the beginning of aviation. ""This is an all-new rocket. There's a lot that can go wrong, and during the test phase -- that's why you have a test phase, because things may go wrong,"" he said. Ken Bowersox is a vice president for SpaceX. In his previous life, he flew five space shuttle missions as a commander and pilot. He also lived on the space station for more than five months as its commander. ""Either way, we're going to learn something,"" he said. ""If we have a problem, we can move forward accepting a higher level of risk. That's how we can be more cost-effective. If all goes as planned after a series of test flights, Musk says SpaceX will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year. If NASA awards SpaceX a contract, Musk says they can begin ferrying astronauts to the space station within three years. He says his company is profitable, but his motivations go beyond dollars. ""We want to see a future where we are exploring the stars, where we're going to other planets, where we're doing the great things that we read about in science fiction and in the movies,"" Musk said.

"Aboard Development Driller III, Gulf of Mexico (CNN) -- The news? They can't watch it anymore. Outsiders criticizing their progress, saying they're not working fast enough or smart enough -- it's too much to bear. They understand how awful the situation is. They are, after all, working on the waters where friends and relatives died. Those losses, and the stories they hear from workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion, are with them every day. It's a weight they carry as the world watches. These men and women are working to drill a relief well -- 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the seafloor, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen says. It is the only surefire way to stop the oil that's spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. ""It takes time to dig a relief well safely and efficiently, which is what we're trying to do,"" Capt. Lee Crowe says. ""Our goal is to stem the flow of oil -- the long-term solution, not the short-term solution."" As of Thursday, BP says the drill for this relief well has reached a depth of 13,978 feet. See a BP image of both relief well statuses, last updated on May 30 . There are fewer than 200 workers on board at any one time. They are marine biologists, scientists, construction and tool experts. They must understand the physics of what they're doing. Simple hired hands? Not even close. They work on the rig in three-week shifts, living in simple quarters and eating in a space not unlike a school cafeteria. Mementos from home, pictures of the families they leave behind to do this work, appear on desks. Most of them come from Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas -- the very places that will be hardest hit by the oil-riddled waters. So for them, what they're doing is more than a job, the kind of job that's been passed on through generations. They are trying to protect their own homes. And they're trying to right what has gone so horribly wrong. ""Part of the problem is that there is a lot of outside scrutiny on what it is that we're doing out here,"" Capt. Nick Schindler says. ""The American population is wanting this well done. They want it now. We all want it done now. But we all have to understand that this is a well that killed 11 people ... and sunk a rig. So we're not going to speed up, and we're going to do this as safe as possible."" To get to where disaster struck on April 20 takes a one-hour helicopter ride from New Orleans, Louisiana. From the air, heading out there, one can see efforts to contain the spreading oil. Large floating booms arc in the water to absorb the crude. The large black slicks or dark pools one might expect to see are not visible. Instead there are orange pancake-like deposits, the result of oil that's been exposed to the elements. Allen, during the flight, notices what no outsider can. The shifting winds change the flow trajectory in the water. Based on this, he predicts Pensacola, Florida, will be hit with oil in a couple of days. A couple of days later, it is. But the smell -- like fresh tar -- can't be missed by anyone. It only grows stronger as the Coast Guard helicopter reaches its destination, landing on Development Driller III. Across the water, Development Driller II works on the backup relief well, while Discover Enterprise tries to cap the gushing oil. It is beneath that rig that underwater cameras are trained on the oil the world is seeing. Support vessels between the three rigs are busy offering their own help to the massive effort. Two boats fire fresh water from their sterns, a move meant to lessen the fumes emanating from the contaminated water. Safety is top of mind on this rig. Visitors landing on the rig must go downstairs to watch a safety video, take off accessories like earrings and put on a hard hat, goggles and steel-toed boots. A woman working at a desk thanks the CNN crew for finally telling the workers' story. Nearby, on a table, are copies of a special magazine memorializing the Deepwater Horizon workers who died. The operation is enormous, the equipment and technicalities overwhelming. In meeting rooms, screens monitor progress and maps dot walls. The diagrams the Coast Guard admiral draws to help explain matters leave a journalist's head spinning. But he tries to explain in simple terms. ""The intention is to intercept the wellbore, well down below the surface near the reservoir, then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up,"" Allen says. ""That will allow them to basically plug or kill the well. Once that's done, you could do things like remove the blowout preventer, bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened."" Get a taste of the chaos that is Adm. Thad Allen's life . On deck, it's a loud and constant operation. Voices call back and forth, giving directions amid massive equipment that towers above. People operating the drill and two cranes maneuver across the rig in a carefully orchestrated ballet. The incessant drilling brings an endless vibration. There is no idle chit-chat for these Transocean employees, who are working 12-hour shifts, around the clock. It's intense, serious, focused. ""I just want everybody to know that we're doing everything we possibly can,"" says Schindler. ""We're not going to rush. We're not going to hurt anybody. We're going to protect everybody, and we're going to remember that this is a place where we had a catastrophic event.""","CNN's Kyra Phillips gets exclusive access to rig drilling relief well to stop gushing oil .

"(CNN) -- Curtis Flowers has stood before five juries in the past 13 years on capital murder charges, accused of killing four people in a Mississippi furniture store. Now, prosecutors are hoping his sixth trial will be the last. Flowers, 40, is believed to be the only person in recent U.S. history to be tried six times on the same capital murder charges. His trial began last week in Montgomery County Circuit Court in downtown Winona, just a few blocks from the furniture store where four people were shot to death nearly 14 years ago. Bertha Tardy, the owner of Tardy's Furniture, and three employees were shot execution-style in the head the morning of July 16, 1996, inside the store, court records say. The shootings rattled the sleepy central Mississippi town, with a population of about 5,500 that has declined in the 14 years since then. Like most of the businesses still operating in downtown Winona, Tardy's was a relic of another era, having opened its doors in the 1940s. Bertha Tardy and her husband were prominent members of the community, and nearly everyone in Winona could claim some connection to the victims. After months of interviews and a $30,000 reward for information, Flowers was arrested in January 1997 on four counts of capital murder. He has been in custody ever since. Flowers has been convicted three times and sentenced to death twice, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed those verdicts and ordered a new trial each time. His two most recent trials ended in hung juries, leading his supporters to question why the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office continues to seek a conviction. The prosecution's case is based largely on circumstantial evidence. There is no DNA, the alleged murder weapon has not been found and eyewitnesses who say they saw Flowers the day of the shooting have provided conflicting accounts. Still, Montgomery County District Attorney Doug Evans says it's a straightforward case of a disgruntled worker taking out his anger against his former employer. Others, who believe Flowers is innocent, say the case has turned into a crusade and suggest that race has played a major role in the prosecution and convictions of Flowers. ""The fact they're trying this case for the sixth time suggests to me there's some racial motivation here, because there's no way in the world I can see a white guy accused of doing the same thing being tried six times to procure a conviction,"" said Jackson City Councilman Chokwe Lumumba, who represented Flowers in his second trial in 1999. Flowers' supporters say it is a classic example of a case built upon weak circumstantial evidence and shaky eyewitness testimony intended to blame an easy target: a poor black man. ""What does it say about the prosecution that they have chosen to ignore two jury verdicts?"" said Alan Bean, executive director of Friends of Justice, a nonprofit organization that monitors due process violations in the criminal justice system. ""I really think the only way to save Winona from this nightmare is to force the Montgomery County district attorney to step aside and appoint the attorney general's office. If you did that, I am convinced you wouldn't see the prosecution of Curtis Flowers, because the evidence just isn't there."" To Evans, though, Flowers' prosecution is about seeking justice for the victims and bringing closure to the community. ""Any time that we feel there is evidence to prove a case, we're going to pursue it,"" said Evans, who tried the five previous cases and will lead the prosecution this time. Evans declined to elaborate on lessons learned from the previous trials or to say if his strategy will be different this time around, but he said the two hung juries did not affect his decision to try Flowers again. ""Any case that's on the docket I want to try and dispose of it,"" he said. Evans and Flowers' current lawyer, Ray Carter, said they expected much of the evidence to be the same this go-round as it has been in previous trials. In all five trials, Sam Jones, an employee of Tardy's since it opened in 1942, testified that Bertha Tardy called him around 9 a.m. on July 16 about coming in to train two new employees. When Jones arrived at the store around 9:30 a.m., he discovered the bodies of Tardy, bookkeeper Carmen Rigby and Robert Golden lying near the counter in pools of blood. Nearby, Jones saw 16-year-old Derrick ""Bobo"" Stewart on the floor, blood pouring from his head with each labored breath. He died a week later. Prosecutors allege that Flowers, a former employee, stole a gun from his uncle's car and shot Tardy because she had fired him two weeks before the killings and docked his pay for damaging a pair of batteries. He allegedly shot the others to eliminate witnesses, and then took money from the cash register, which elevated the offense to capital murder and made him eligible for the death penalty. The .380-caliber pistol used in the shootings has not been found, but investigators matched bullets at the scene to shell casings from the gun owned by Flowers' uncle, which has also not been recovered. Another witness who came forward months after the shooting and said she saw Flowers ""leaning"" on his uncle's car around 7:15 a.m. the day of shootings. The same day, his uncle, Doyle Simpson, reported that a gun had been stolen from his car. A neighbor said she saw Flowers around 7:30 a.m. outside his home wearing Fila sneakers. Another witness testified that he saw two men standing across the street from Tardy's around 10 a.m., and that one of them was Flowers. Another woman said she saw Flowers running out of the store the morning of the shootings while she was driving toward the store with a friend. A trace analyst expert determined that a bloody footprint at the scene came from a size 10.5 Grant Hill Fila sneaker; investigators found a shoebox for a 10.5 Grant Hill Fila at the home where Flowers lived with his girlfriend, but found no sneakers. The three different teams of lawyers to represent Flowers have argued that witnesses who said they saw him that morning came forward with shaky stories months after the shootings, enticed by a $30,000 reward. They also said prosecutors failed to conclusively link Flowers to the weapon or the crime scene through the bloody footprint, and questioned whether the evidence proved that money was taken from the cash register. ""The reward offer really poisoned the case by giving rise to fabricated eyewitness testimony,"" said defense lawyer Lumumba. ""I don't think the witnesses recognized the consequences of what they were doing, that they were going to help put this man to death."" In Flowers' second through fifth trials, the defense called witnesses to dispute eyewitness accounts of the woman who said she saw Flowers running out of the store. Prosecutors at first attempted to try Flowers separately for each murder, but the first two convictions were reversed after the Mississippi Supreme Court found that evidence of the other deaths was improperly introduced. The court found that prosecutors used excessive displays of crime scene photos and testimony regarding the nature of the other deaths. ""By using this tactic or trial strategy, the state improperly prejudiced the jury and denied Flowers his fundamental right to a fair trial,"" the justices wrote in two nearly identical opinions issued in 2000 and 2003. The third trial in 2004 also ended in a conviction that was later reversed after the state Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors dismissed black jurors based on race, fueling allegations of racial bias against the district attorney's office. In the case of one black female whom the prosecution voted to dismiss because of her attitude toward the death penalty, the court noted that her views ""were nearly indistinguishable from those of two white jurors who ultimately served on the jury, suggesting disparate treatment."" The next two trials -- Flowers 4 and 5, as they are called by the lawyers who tried them -- ended in hung juries after the panelists failed to reach a unanimous decision. The first jury was split along racial lines, with five black jurors voting to acquit and seven white jurors choosing to convict. The lone black juror on the panel in the fifth trial, who voted to acquit Flowers, was charged with perjury, but the charges were ultimately dismissed. Flowers' supporters say the first three convictions and the racial divides in the last two trials can be attributed to the racist attitudes that still prevail in Mississippi, especially when a low-income black person is accused of killing a prominent white member of the community. Tardy and two of the other victims were white; the fourth victim was black. ""I'm not accusing white jurors of overt racial prejudice -- maybe some racial insensitivity -- but I think the real problem is they don't have enough social knowledge to evaluate the credibility of testimony and I think black jurors do, and that's what disturbs me about this tendency to eliminate black jurors and to disregard the black jurors' verdicts,"" said Bean. There will be a few differences in the sixth trial. Among them, the absence of two jailhouse informants from Flowers 1, who testified that the defendant admitted to the shootings. The two later admitted to lying under promises of monetary reward from law enforcement, according to Lumumba. Another difference involves the testimony of Charles ""Porky"" Collins, the man who said he saw Flowers across the street from the store around 10 a.m. with another man. It will be read to the jury, because Collins is dead. Bean, who plans to observe the trial, said he is especially looking forward to the jury selection phase, in which prospective jurors are questioned on their beliefs. ""The racial dynamics are right there on the surface. There's no pretense of equal justice, so I'm hoping this story can be instructive in that regard, whatever the outcome may be.""","Curtis Flowers is accused of shooting and killing former employer, 3 others in 1996 .

"(CNN) -- Oil coming ashore on the Gulf Coast has tourists keeping a close eye on conditions. States and visitors bureaus are working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Small bits of tar were found at Henderson Beach State Park, just east of Destin, over the weekend, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""These were easily removed, and no further oil has been spotted,"" said a post this week on the bureau's website. The Emerald Coast area, which includes Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island, is urging travelers to visit. ""Our white-sand beaches remain open and our emerald-green waters remain clear. In addition, offshore fishing is still going strong, with captains simply taking a more easterly course and reporting great success out on the water,"" the site said. Destin Mayor Sarah ""Sam"" Seevers told CNN a few, small tar balls came ashore this week but added that spotting occasional tar balls on the beach there is not unusual. ""We may go five years and not see any tar balls, and then we'll see a few. That's just a way of life on the Gulf of Mexico, Seevers said. Navarre Beach is open, including waters for fishing, according to the Santa Rosa County website. Oil sheen and tar balls have been reported on the Alabama-Florida state line and off Navarre Beach. iReport from Santa Rosa Beach . The water at Pensacola Beach is open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. The National Park Service reported heavier oiling at Perdido Key on Tuesday afternoon. A health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the visitors bureau website said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. The visitors bureau urges beachgoers to take precautions. ""According to [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], tar balls do not pose a health risk to the average person, but visitors are advised not to pick them up,"" the website said. Gulf Islands National Seashore, Mississippi and Florida . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. Light oil occurrences at Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi and Fort Pickens and the Santa Rosa area in Florida have been cleaned up.  Cleanup of heavier oiling at Perdido Key is ongoing. Health departments in both states urge people to avoid swimming in areas affected by the oil spill. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has extended an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou or Old River.

"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- Jason Gerling always knew he would make a major impact as a musician. An accomplished drummer, he was at the top of the local music scene in 1994, winning local drumming competitions and performing regularly at hot spots in the Twin Cities. He was 23 years old, and planned to move to New York, or perhaps Nashville, to launch his music career. Then one night, everything changed. Heading home from a late night gig, Gerling fell asleep at the wheel. ""The car flipped over five or six times, that's what they told me,"" he said.  ""They said I looked like something out of a horror movie ... They had to use the jaws of life to snip through the car doors to get me out."" He was lucky to be alive.  But then came the bad news. ""[The doctors] said 'you're probably never going to walk and probably never going to play the drums again,'"" he remembered. ""It was like a nuclear bomb was dropped on my life. I thought my career was over."" The accident had left him paralyzed from the chest down. Gerling refused to give up his passion from drumming.  Within a few years, he regained the use of his arms. But he never got back the use of his legs.  To this day, Gerling remains in a wheelchair. That has hampered his ability to play a drum set which requires a foot pedal to operate the bass drum and the hi-hat cymbal. For a while, he got by with a special setup that triggered a bass drum noise when he hit a certain pad with a drumstick. That didn't cut it for Gerling. So he invented a system that allows him to trigger a bass drum sound while continuing to play the snares, cymbals, and the rest of the drum set. Gerling uses a mouthpiece trigger provided to him by Origin Instruments, a company with a line of products aimed at helping people with disabilities -- particularly quadriplegics -- operate computers. Gerling rigged the mouthpiece to control tiny rubber sensors under each cymbal. Anytime he sucks on the mouthpiece while simultaneously hitting one of the cymbals, a bass drum noise is triggered from a small subwoofer situated directly inside the bass drum casing. He can move the sensors under any of part of the drum set. ""This is over 10 years in the making,"" he said, smiling behind his state-of-the-art drum set. Despite his hard work, Gerling said he has no desire to patent his invention. ""If people want to know how to build their own triggers, then, by golly, they can just contact me,"" he said.  ""I'll give them the information for free. Encouragement shouldn't come at a price."" One glance at Gerling's Facebook inbox reveals a worldwide fan base many of whom are exactly that: encouraged. He reads over one letter from someone who had their legs amputated last year: ""Thanks for being my inspiration."" Another one reads, ""I'm back playing rock and roll, using some of your techniques. Thanks for being my inspiration."" Another fan writes, ""Thanks for your effort in helping change the paradigm in the music industry."" That particular ""thank you"" note is special for Gerling. Getting the music industry to include more disabled musicians -- to look ""between the wheels"" of his wheelchair as he puts it -- is exactly what he aims to do. ""There's so many musicians who are disabled who don't get the chance to play live,"" he said. ""So I want to tell them to knock on doors and encourage the music industry to be willing to hire a person with a disability."" And he seems to be on his way. On April 28, Gerling debuted his mouthpiece technology -- accompanied digitally by music he composed himself --- for the very first time during a private event at Minneapolis' famous Guthrie Theatre. To him, it was his first step to getting back on the road, doing what he loves more than anything, and at the same time urging others in similar situations to pursue their dreams and change the world. Not surprisingly, the evening was capped off with a standing ovation. Now that he's made his invention public, Gerling said he plans to show others how to create the technology through ""innovative drumming clinics"" that could grow into a music tour with other artists. ""People need encouragement,"" Gerling said, ""and if I can be in the position to help someone else, that's just an honor you can't take lightly.""","A car accident in 1994 left drummer Jason Gerling a quadriplegic .

"(CNN) -- An unusual movie promotion stunt threatened to turn deadly Tuesday when a World War II-era biplane flipped over while landing near the nation's capital. Nobody was hurt, though one of the main runways at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was closed for roughly an hour after the crash, an airport spokeswoman said. The plane was righted by a crane. The 1943 Stearman, a popular training aircraft during the war, was one of nine flying to Reagan National from Virginia's Manassas Regional Airport to help promote the movie ""Legends of Flight,"" a film meant to provide a window into ""a century of aviation trial and error,"" according to its Web site. The two-seat, open-cockpit plane ""took a back-end bounce,"" as it landed, movie executive producer Doug Freeman told CNN. ""The pilot and passenger got out unhurt"" and later relaxed over a cup of coffee. The pilot was identified as Michael Truschel of Nokesville, Virginia -- located near Manassas. The accident occurred at the end of a roughly 20-minute flight under clear skies and light winds. ""It looked like (Michael) was up on the main gear, and then the nose went down and the tail went up,"" said pilot Dave Brown, who was directly behind Truschel's aircraft. ""I sidestepped (Truschel) and landed right behind him,"" Brown told CNN. Air traffic controllers directed the other planes to land on another runway. Brown told CNN that ""by the time it happened, (Truschel) was going really slowly, so when it flipped over on its nose it just went on over on its top wing."" The main body of the overturned plane remained high enough off the ground for Truschel and his passenger to release their harnesses and then climb out. ""It shows how rigid Boeing made the plane,"" Brown noted. ""They were built as trainers for cadets who flipped them like this quite often."" Brown said there was damage to the tail, a wing and the prop of Truschel's plane.","WWII-era biplane flips while landing at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C.

"(CNN) -- The two New Jersey men suspected of attempting to fly to Somalia to join a terrorist organization were denied bail at a court hearing on Thursday. Mohamed Mahmood Alessa, 20, of North Bergen, New Jersey, and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, 24, of Elmwood Park, New Jersey, are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill, maim and murder persons outside of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The men, who were taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday, intended to take separate flights to Egypt on their way to Somalia ""to join designated foreign terrorist organization Al-Shabaab and wage violent jihad,"" according to federal prosecutors. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Newark alleges that in 2007, Alessa and Almonte traveled together to Jordan, where they intended to enter Iraq in order to commit violence against U.S. troops there.

"(CNN) -- Former South African president Nelson Mandela will attend the World Cup opening ceremony on Friday, according to his grandson. Nkosi Mandela said his grandfather would be on hand to greet the crowd at the Soccer City Stadium, but that he wouldn't stay for the entirety of the opening game between South Africa and Mexico. He told a press conference: ""The current discussion is that we afford him time to come in whether it is ten minutes or 15 minutes to walk around the stadium and wave at the crowd. ""But I think to have him sit there an entire 90 minutes of soccer would really impact his state of health because it is winter after all, so we have to guard against that. ""As South Africans we wish him to live for many more years to come."" The 91-year-old played a pivotal role in bringing the World Cup to South Africa but has made limited public appearances recently. However, he did meet the South Africa squad last week. Current president Jacob Zuma paid tribute to Mandela at an event to mark the opening ceremony of the 60th FIFA Congress. ""Nelson Mandela worked hard that we should win the right to host this tournament. We dedicate the World Cup to him,"" he was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""There are a few moments that define a nation's history. We stand on the threshold of one as we draw closer and closer to Friday, June 11 when the World Cup officially begins. ""What an honour and what a privilege for this 16-year-old democracy. Our country has become a stage for the international community to celebrate humanity, achievement and friendship."" As World Cup fever grows in South Africa, thousands of South Africans poured onto the streets of Johannesburg on Wednesday as the national team paraded through the city.","Nelson Mandela will attend the World Cup opening ceremony says his grandson .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Prosecutor Jack Mallard was waiting for the moment Wayne Williams, on trial in the Atlanta child murders case, would take the witness stand in his own defense. ""I knew he figured he could out-talk the prosecutor,"" Mallard says. ""He had tried out-talking everybody else, and I knew I'd be ready."" Under cross-examination, Williams blew up at the prosecutor, saying, ""You must be a fool,"" and then telling Mallard, ""You want the real Wayne Williams? You got him right here."" In his closing statement, Mallard would quote that outburst to the jury in describing Williams as ""a Jekyll and Hyde"" personality. A day later, the jury convicted Williams on two counts of murder. He was eventually sentenced to two life sentences in prison. ""I think I made my point that he had a dual personality,"" Mallard told reporters when the 1982 trial ended. ""I thought I'd stay after him until he showed it. And it took longer than anyone else before."" ""I was my own worst enemy,"" says Williams, who still argues he is innocent. ""I could almost see the shock in the jurors' faces.""  Mallard says, ""I have to admit, it was a high point of perhaps my career."" Now in his mid-70s, Mallard was a prosecutor for 40 years, winning a number of Atlanta's highest profile trials: a drug-dealing lawyer who had his wife murdered in front of their own children to silence her; a woman who poisoned two paramours with anti-freeze. Early in his career, defense attorneys began calling Mallard ""Blood"" because of the way he went for the jugular in the courtroom. In retirement, living on a lake north of Atlanta, Mallard has written his own book on the Atlanta child murders, subtitled ""The Night Stalker.""

"(CNN) -- Israel ""has never negotiated the exchange of nuclear weapons with South Africa,"" its president's office said Monday, after a British newspaper claimed such talks had taken place. The Guardian published what it said were previously secret South African documents saying the two countries' defense ministers had discussed the possible Israeli sale of nuclear weapons to the apartheid-era state in 1975. The newspaper said the documents were the first written proof that Israel had nuclear weapons. Israel has always refused either to confirm or deny that. But Monday, President Shimon Peres' office issued a statement saying, ""There exists no basis in reality for the claims published this morning by the Guardian that in 1975 Israel negotiated with South Africa the exchange of nuclear weapons. ""Unfortunately, The Guardian elected to write its piece based on the selective interpretation of South African documents and not on concrete facts,"" the statement said. Peres was defense minister at the time of the alleged negotiations, and the Guardian says his signature is on one of the memos. Part of that memo has been blacked out, but a part that is visible mentions ""all information, know-how and materials,"" then has several words blacked out, followed by ""schematics, plans and drawings supplied or transmitted... in the course of negotiations or in pursuance of any of the aforesaid agreements."" Much of the rest of the visible part of the document is about keeping the agreement secret. It makes reference to an ""Annex A,"" which does not appear in the Guardian article. The document, posted with others on the Guardian's website, is apparently signed by South African Defense Minister PW Botha and dated April 3, 1975. A signature appearing to be Peres' is not dated. The document is stamped ""Top Secret"" and ""Declassified 2006-05-30."" Another memo, apparently bearing Peres' signature and published on Israeli Ministry of Defense stationery, thanks South African Information Secretary E.M. Rhoodie for his ""great efforts"" in ensuring successful meetings between Israel and South Africa in December 1974. The document says a ""vitally important cooperation between our two countries has been initiated,"" but does not go into details. A third document purports to detail talks between Botha and Peres. Botha asks for ""the correct payload"" and Peres tells him it is ""available in three sizes,"" according to the South African minutes of the meeting. The documents -- all South African -- were obtained by a researcher, Sasha Polakow-Suransky, for a book on the close relationship between the two countries, the Guardian says in its article by Washington correspondent Chris McGreal. The book, ""The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa,"" is due to be published Tuesday, according to Amazon.com. Israel said the newspaper did not seek Israeli official comment before publishing the article.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate engaged in a heated debate Thursday on an issue at the heart of the fight over energy reform: whether the Environmental Protection Agency should have the authority to impose clear limits on the emission of greenhouse gases. The chamber is expected to vote on a ""resolution of disapproval"" drafted by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that would prevent the EPA from further regulation of air pollution from vehicles and industrial facilities. Murkowski has argued that new rules should be created only by Congress, not an executive agency. ""It would amount to an unprecedented power grab, ceding Congress' responsibilities to unelected bureaucrats and move a very, very important debate, a critical debate, from our open halls to behind an agency's closed doors,"" Murkowski argued on the Senate floor. Murkowski's measure is vehemently opposed by environmentalists who say the EPA's decision to regulate greenhouse gases is based on scientific research. ""I believe it's ridiculous for politicians -- elected senators -- to make this scientific decision. It is not our expertise,"" replied Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""We've got to stop this attack on science and health."" It is unclear whether there are 51 votes in the Senate to approve the measure, which has bipartisan support, even though its prospects in the House are slim. Regardless, the administration issued a veto threat on Tuesday. The Murkowski resolution ""would undermine the administration's efforts to reduce the negative impacts of pollution and the risks associated with environmental catastrophes, like the ongoing BP oil spill,"" a White House policy statement asserted. At issue is a 2007 Supreme Court ruling determining that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the rules of the Clean Air Act. In December, the agency concluded scientific findings and declared that carbon dioxide and five other gases constitute pollutants that should be further restricted. In April, the agency announced new rules for vehicles: a mandatory increase in fuel efficiency coupled with reductions in gas emissions, starting with the 2012 model year. ""When the Clean Air Act became law in 1970, only five pollutants were initially listed. Since then, dozens of additional pollutants have been listed, and the air we breathe is better for it,"" argued Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington. Detractors of the EPA contend that the Clean Air Act was never intended to give federal agencies full control over greenhouse regulations but rather to check industrial and commercial structures. Such regulatory decisions, they argue, should be made by Congress. ""EPA regulation of greenhouse gases does not move us any closer to a clean energy future or to reducing our dependency on foreign oil. And furthermore, it simply is the wrong tool for addressing greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Arkansas. Lincoln's sentiment was echoed by fellow Democrats Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Though Murkowski said that she is not a skeptic of global warming and is ""not going after the science,"" many of her supporters have turned the dispute into a proxy debate on the scientific evidence. ""There is nowhere a scientific consensus on one of the EPA's findings that humans are causing warming or that warming is necessarily bad for the environment or for humankind,"" claimed Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Opponents of the resolution claim that their colleagues are choosing to ignore the scientific consensus in favor of electoral politics. ""The Murkowski resolution gives the United States Senate a choice between real science and political science,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois. ""That's what it comes down to."" ""This discussion about global warming is now political, not scientific. And this is absurd,"" added Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson claimed in a Huffington Post column Monday that Murkowski has sided with ""big oil companies and their lobbyists"" in an effort to ""take away EPA's ability to protect the health and welfare of Americans from greenhouse gas pollution."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, has said he wants the Senate to approve new energy legislation this summer to address both global warming and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities on Friday made contact with a 16-year-old American girl who triggered a distress signal while attempting to sail solo around the world. But it could be a day before a French fishing vessel pulls Abby Sunderland and her boat, Wild Eyes, to shore, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. ""She's in the boat. The boat's seaworthy. It's not taking on water, and she's equipped for the conditions down there, we believe,"" said Mick Kinley of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Sunderland triggered the distress signal Thursday during rough seas. ""She's been dismasted. The rigging's over the side and in the water,"" Kinley told reporters Friday. He said Wild Eyes was in the Southern Ocean about 2,000 miles southwest of Perth, Australia, when rescuers contacted her Friday. ""That's a long way from any merchant shipping,"" he said. ""We're just fortunate that the French fishing vessel was in that region."" Family spokesman Christian Pinkston said Sunderland communicated with rescuers via marina radio. ""We know that Australian search and rescue has contacted her ... and she is alive and well,"" Pinkston said early Friday morning. Sunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, wrote on her blog: ""We have just heard from the Australian Search and Rescue. The plane arrived on the scene moments ago. Wild Eyes is upright but her rigging is down. The weather conditions are abating. Radio communication was made and Abby reports that she is fine! ""We don't know much else right now. The French fishing vessel that was diverted to her location will be there in a little over 24 hours. Where they will take her or how long it will take we don't know."" Mom talks about dangers her daughter faces on high seas . Earlier Friday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority had taken over the search for Sunderland, noting the stormy seas that prompted her to activate her distress beacons had calmed. ""The weather is moderating. It is improving slightly,"" Carly Lusk of the AMSA said at the time. ""Now, it's not perfect, but any improvement in the weather is a positive when you're looking at a search and rescue operation."" Sunderland's vessel is adrift in the middle of the Indian Ocean some 2,000 miles east of Madagascar, 2,000 miles west of Australia and 500 miles north of the French Antarctic Islands. Sunderland's family began scrambling to organize a search-and-rescue effort for her after they learned her emergency beacon was detected just an hour after they last spoke to her on Thursday, according to Jeff Casher, an engineer on her support team. The government of Reunion -- a French island -- diverted a fishing boat toward her last known position, but it is not expected to reach the area until Saturday, Casher said. An Australian military ship, more than two days sail away, has also been dispatched, Casher said. Electronic signals from the boat indicate it is drifting at just a mile per hour, which means it is still afloat but not under sail, Casher said. iReporter follows the story . Sunderland began her journey from Marina del Rey, California, on January 23 with the goal of sailing her 40-foot boat around the world without stopping. Mechanical troubles forced her to make two stops for repairs, including at Cape Town, South Africa, in May. She has kept in touch with family and followers through a satellite telephone. Her website has published frequent blog updates, including one posted Wednesday. ""The last few days have (been) pretty busy out here,"" Sunderland wrote in her last blog entry. ""I've been in some rough weather for awhile with winds steady at 40-45 knots with higher gusts. With that front passing, the conditions were lighter today."" Sunderland is a ""very determined"" and ""very capable sailor,"" Thomas said. ""She's pretty much unfazed by most everything, but she had been fatigued by this period of winds which she's been going through for several days now,"" he said. When Abby's older brother Zac sailed around the world alone last year, with stops, he became the youngest person to ever do so at 17. Mike Perham of the United Kingdom, a younger 17-year-old, took over the distinction weeks later. Last month, Australian Jessica Watson, days before her 17th birthday, claimed to have become the youngest person to have completed a non-stop, unassisted solo circumnavigation -- a mark held by then 18-year-old Jesse Martin of Australia since 1999. However, sailing journalists have said -- and her team hasn't disputed -- that Watson's route was less than 21,600 orthodromic nautical miles, which is the length of the equator and the distance generally used for round-the-world sailing records. Abby has been on a schedule to complete her global journey about two months before her 17th birthday, which is on October 19.

"(CNN) -- A few days before the 1968 California Democratic primary, Washington Post reporter Richard Harwood told his editor he wanted to stop covering Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for president. Robert Kennedy's campaign for president lasted 82 days before he died on June 6, 1968. ""I'm falling in love with the guy,"" he said, according to Thurston Clarke's ""The Last Campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 Days That Inspired America"" (Henry Holt). It was easy to see why. During his ill-fated run for the presidency, Kennedy appeared to be that rarest of candidates, the truth teller. By many accounts, he meant every word he said, particularly those about fighting prejudice and poverty. He refused to kowtow to his audiences, and he wore his emotions on his sleeves (adoring crowds sometimes shredded his cuffs). And he pondered questions before offering thoughtful, sometimes stammering, answers. Indeed, if Clarke's careful and moving book has a problem, it's that the author also seems to have fallen a little in love with his subject. The hard-nosed -- the preferred adjective was ""ruthless"" -- RFK who shrewdly managed his brother's presidential campaign gets short shrift. The book sometimes seems to exist in its own bubble, lacking the uncertainty that afflicted Kennedy in fighting his uphill nomination battle. But if you can get past the occasional hagiography, what emerges is a fine addition to the Kennedy canon.   Watch photographer, writer recall RFK's last days » . Clarke's book is illuminated by his interviews with Kennedy beat writers and audience members, which give his retracing of the campaign's exhaustive travels a striking immediacy. Given that there's no shortage of material on the man himself -- Arthur Schlesinger's mammoth 1978 ""Robert Kennedy and His Times"" and Evan Thomas' 2000 biography ""Robert Kennedy: His Life"" come to mind -- that's a worthy achievement. Clarke usually works on a grass-roots level, providing welcome glimpses of Kennedy's sense of humor and showing how even small RFK gestures stayed with people for decades. What they often remember is the challenge of the man, a candidate unafraid of campaigning among the poorest of the poor in cities and on reservations. While Hubert Humphrey preached the ""Politics of Joy"" in that brutal year -- and Eugene McCarthy simply lectured -- Kennedy answered questions with questions, at his best when he asked as much from his audience as he did from himself. Indeed, Kennedy seemed to revel in hostile audiences, Clarke observes. Some he won over with his candor. Others he couldn't have cared less about accommodating. At a speech at the Indiana University Medical School, he faced a stony crowd of doctors-to-be. ""All these programs sound very find and nice and all that, but where's the money gonna come from?"" one student asked about Kennedy's proposals to help the poor. Having listened to several similar questions, Kennedy had had enough. ""From you!"" he roared, pointing at people around the hall. ""From you! ... You!"" Probably only Mr. Smith, ""The Candidate's"" Bill McKay and Jay Bulworth could have gotten away with that. In Clarke's telling, the end comes quietly, two pages after the June 5 shooting. There's no investigation of conspiracy theories, no long recollections by friends. It's appropriate to his tone.  Watch Clarke talk about why RFK resonates » . There is, however, a fascinating postscript. Clarke found RFK's post-California schedule in the Kennedy Library, and the document shows what might have been, at least for 10 days: campaigning in his home state New York primary, bicycling in Central Park, attending a firemen's association event. Whether it would have led to the presidency is a cruel question history never answered. And with Robert Kennedy, questions are all that's left. ""Some men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not,"" he often said, quoting George Bernard Shaw. Edward Kennedy read those words at his funeral.","Reviewer: ""The Last Campaign"" worthy addition to Robert Kennedy books .

"(CNN) -- Civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer made famous the phrase, ""I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."" For me, I'm sick and tired of Democrats having power and being unwilling to use it. I've always respected Republicans when they had power because they were willing to use it and maybe apologize later. Today, President Obama walked into the White House briefing room and took some questions, and one of them revolved around recess appointments. He has watched Republicans block many of his appointments, and now he says he made it clear to them that he will ""consider"" making some when the U.S. Senate goes into recess. ""One senator, as you all are aware, had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state,"" President Obama said. ""In our meeting, I asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months. Surely we can set aside partisanship and do what's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations. If the Senate does not act --  and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees, I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess, because we can't afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well-functioning government."" This is where the president needs to show his toughness and just do it. Forget the threats. The actions of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, and other Republican obstructionists will continue if President Obama allows them to run roughshod over him. When you're the top dog, you do what you have to do to govern. Allowing Republican senators to continue to deny your appointments is nonsense. If all of them choose to support a filibuster, then you take it to the American people and show the obstructionists for what they are. You get your grass-roots movement fired up to stand up and do something. The political right used its base to go after Democrats who blocked appointments to the federal bench and other positions. So why not be just as aggressive? If there are members of your own party who stand in the way, such as Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, then you also blast them and make them pay for acting so foolishly. This president got rolled by the Senate over health care. His team made some boneheaded mistakes, and now they are paying for them. Continuing to play footsie with opponents will only get him into more trouble. He should set a deadline to have his folks confirmed. If not, appoint them all during the recess and go on about your business. Obama's critics keep blasting him for Chicago-style politics. So, fine.

"(CNN) -- Climate scientists are getting desperate. After years of enduring politically motivated attacks, they are still scrambling to defend their findings. In a letter last month to Science, 255 of the nation's most prominent scientists -- all members of the National Academy of Sciences, including 11 Nobel laureates -- repeat conclusions that by now should be entirely familiar, even tedious, to anyone who has followed the science at all. Our planet is warming because of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused most of the increase. Climate change is a threat to coastal communities, food and water supplies, and ecosystems. And contrary to some recent claims, it is not too late to do something about it. The scientists conclude, in obvious exasperation, that one ""snowy winter in Washington does not alter"" these basic facts. The immediate trigger for the letter Virginia State Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli's recent demand that climate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, produce a large volume of paperwork related to his scientific research and communications with fellow scientists during his years at University of Virginia from 1999 to 2005. ""McCarthyite"" is how the scientists characterize Cuccinelli's action, filed under the state's Fraud Against Taxpayers Act. Many have dismissed Cuccinelli as silly, particularly in light of his efforts to impose Christian modesty on the state seal of Virginia, and his actions could be shrugged off if they were isolated. But they are the latest example of a persistent, and worrisome, trend: attacking scientists who have done key work that demonstrates the human impact on climate. Mann is the principal author of the ""hockey stick curve"" -- a graph that boldly illustrates the dramatic rise in average global temperatures over the past 50 years, a rise unlike anything in the previous 1,000 years. Because the hockey stick curve is visually compelling, it's been reproduced many times, and in 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change featured it in their third assessment report. It's also made Mann a target for those who don't want to admit that global warming is a real problem. Mann testified about his work in the U.S. Congress in 2003, in hearings sponsored by Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has called global warming a ""hoax."" Two years later, Texas Rep. Joseph Barton demanded that Mann supply copious documentation related to his testimony, based on what Barton, who has no scientific training, alleged were ""methodological flaws and data errors"" in his work. Peter Gleick, the lead author of the Science letter, was threatened with a lawsuit by contrarian Patrick J. Michaels in 2003. Michaels has long denied the scientific evidence of human-caused warming, and  Gleick said those views flew in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and  likened them to believing in a flat Earth. In 1995, a group called Global Climate Coalition, composed of the American Petroleum Institute and a host of fossil-fuel dependent corporations, attacked Benjamin Santer, a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who had done key work demonstrating the human ""fingerprint"" on climate. Without any substantive evidence, the group accused Santer of committing ""scientific cleansing"" of the IPCC's Second Assessment Report by removing mention of uncertainties to make global warming appear more certain than it was. A handful of physicists attached to another think-tank, the George C. Marshall Institute, splashed the accusation onto the pages of the Wall Street Journal, ensuring millions of Americans saw them. Santer was later vindicated -- all the co-authors testified he had made no unauthorized changes. Yet the impression of wrong-doing remained. Perhaps no scientific name is more associated with global warming than Roger Revelle, mentor to Al Gore, who first warned of the risks of human-caused climate change in the 1950s. In 1992, a paper was released that claimed Revelle had changed his mind about global warming and no longer believed it was a problem. The claim was repeated many times in the mass media, including The New Republic and The Washington Post. Revelle was elderly and seriously ill at the time, and died before he had a chance to respond. His graduate student, Justin Lancaster, tried to set the record straight by publicly disputing the claim. He was soon sued by the author of the claim, and lacking funds to defend himself, was forced to settle out of court, leaving his personal and professional life in tatters. But it isn't just climate scientists who have been vilified, personally attacked, and threatened with lawsuits and congressional investigations. Since the early 1990s, there has been a sustained history of attempts to undermine any science that suggested that contemporary industrial society might be doing irreparable harm to human health and the natural environment. This included the science that demonstrated the harms of DDT, the dangers to children of second-hand smoke, the causes of acid rain, and the reality of the ozone hole. Often the same people were involved in several or even all of these attacks. The common feature in all these cases was a link to think tanks promoting free markets and opposing government regulations. One doesn't have to be a conspiracy theorist to see the pattern: People are loath to admit that our free market system has created problems that the free market has proved ineffectual to solve. Nicolas Stern, former chief economist at the World Bank, has called global warming ""the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen."" Deaths from tobacco smoking, environmental destruction from DDT and other pesticides, acid rain and the ozone hole were market failures, too. Insufficiently regulated market capitalism created these problems, and it took government interventions -- and in some cases, international agreements-- to fix them. If you tried to argue that global warming is not a market failure, you'd just look silly. So extremist defenders of the free market have found themselves an easier target. Science is arcane and scientists are frankly often incomprehensible. But the important point for us to understand is this: Scientists have done nothing wrong. On the contrary, they've been repeatedly vindicated in their work on environmental change. The real crime is not to be found in some pile of obscure scientific documents or the e-mails of harassed scientists. The real crime is that our best science is being undermined by ideologues, confusing us about some of the most important issues of our time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Oreskes, Conway: 255 scientists wrote letter to reiterate global warming findings .

"(CNN) -- Amnesty International has joined the ranks of those criticizing the U.S. Border Patrol, calling for a ""full, impartial and transparent investigation"" into a shooting this week that left a 15-year-old Mexican boy dead. ""This shooting across the border appears to have been a grossly disproportionate response and flies in the face of international standards which compel police to use firearms only as a last resort, in response to an immediate, deadly threat that cannot be contained through lesser means,"" said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement Wednesday on the organization's website. The Mexican government also has requested a quick and public investigation into the fatal shooting at the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Monday night. The teen was shot during a rock-throwing incident, Mexican and U.S. officials said. On Wednesday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the United States will ensure a thorough investigation. ""We pledge that (the) investigation will be fully transparent,"" he said. ""We understand the concern that they have about not just this incident, but multiple incidents where we've had tragic loss of life at the border,"" Crowley added. A long-term solution to avoid these kind of incidents would be the passage of comprehensive immigration reform, he said. Border Patrol agents responded to a call of a possible immigrant smuggling taking place on the border, the FBI said. The agents were able to apprehend two suspects while others crossed back into Mexico and threw rocks at an agent, who then fired shots. Sergio Adrian Hernandez Huereca was killed by a shot to the head, officials said. It was unclear whether Hernandez was on the U.S. or Mexican side of the border when he was shot, though his body was found on the Mexican side, the FBI said. There were videocameras in the area that the FBI is reviewing, El Paso FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons said. Simmons said the FBI will decline further comment until the investigation is complete. The agency's version of events is based not just on the Border Patrol's statements but on interviews with civilians and other evidence, Simmons said. ""I don't want it to seem like it was one-sided information,"" she said. The border patrol agent ""was a coward. He shouldn't have done that because my son was in Mexico, not the United States,"" Hernandez's mother, Maria Guadalupe Huereca, told CNN en Español on Wednesday. The boy was not going to cross into the United States, she said. Instead, he had gone to visit his brother, who works for the Mexican customs agency, to pick up some money so he could by school supplies, Huereca said. After picking up the money, the boy went near the international bridge, where he hid behind a pillar when the shots rang out, she said. ""If (the border patrol agent) has children, he will see my child's face when he killed him,"" Huereca said. ""May God forgive him for what he did to my son."" The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California. San Diego police, who are investigating the death of Anastasio Hernandez, said he was beaten with a baton and shot with a stun gun after he became combative. California medical officials ruled his death a homicide. The investigation in that case continues.

"(CNN) -- Millions of sea turtles have been the unintentional victims of the world's fisheries in the past 20 years, according to a report published Tuesday. The first ever global survey of sea turtle bycatch conducted by Conservation International and Duke University in the United States suggests that the Mediterranean and the Eastern Pacific are locations where the marine turtle populations are in danger of collapse. The report says that the increase in fishing gear, like longlines and gillnets, in marine habitats is directly linked to the increase in the accidental capture of sea turtles. Bycatch occurs when fishing gear inadvertently snag animals other than the intended catch. Sea turtles, along with sharks, dolphins, and albatrosses, are among the most frequently accidentally captured. They often perish as a result of swallowing sharp J-shaped hooks, or by drowning in nets. The report, published this week in ""Conservation Letters"" investigated the impact of bycatch on sea turtles around the globe from 1990 to 2008. Their findings show that tens of thousands of marine turtles have been reported as bycatch in the past 20 years. Dr. Bryan Wallace, Science Advisor for Conservation International's Sea Turtle Flagship Program believes the number may be far higher. ""Because the reports we reviewed typically covered less than 1 percent of all fleets, with little or no information from small-scale fisheries around the world, we conservatively estimate that the true total is probably not in tens of thousands, but in the millions of turtles taken as bycatch in the past two decades,"" he said in a press statement. Sea turtles are highly migratory animals that cover vast areas of ocean between nesting and feeding grounds. They are subject to several threats, including capture for their meat and collection of eggs, destruction of nesting beaches and pollution of the ocean. However, Wallace and the reports' co-authors believe bycatch is the most serious threat to sea turtle populations around the world. Six of the seven marine turtle species are currently categorized as ""vulnerable"", ""endangered"", or ""critically endangered globally"" by the International Union of Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. They include loggerheads, leatherbacks, hawksbills, Olive Ridleys, Kemp's Ridleys and green sea turtles; the flatback, an endemic to Australia, is currently categorized as Data Deficient. The highest reported bycatch rates for longline fisheries occurred off Mexico's Baja California peninsula, the report said, adding that the highest rates for gillnet fishing took place in the North Adriatic region of the Mediterranean and the highest rates for trawls were found off the coast of Uruguay. The report suggests that a lack of integrated management of fishing in the Mediterranean Sea is to blame for the region's high bycatch rates. It has some of the world's highest concentrations of longline fishing and trawling. ""We have only begun to scratch the surface about the realities of sea turtle bycatch,"" said Wallace. ""Our review revealed important data gaps in areas where small-scale fisheries operate, especially Africa, the eastern Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia."" ""Sea turtles are sentinel species of how oceans are functioning. The impacts that human activities have on them give us an idea as to how those same activities are affecting the oceans on which billions of people around the world depend for their own well-being."" said Wallace. ""Our hope is that this study gives governments and fisheries alike the impetus for bolstering on-going efforts to reduce sea turtle bycatch and to promote more sustainable fishing practices as soon as possible.""","Millions of turtles believed to have died as fishing bycatch in last 20 years .

"Langley, Arkansas (CNN) -- One person remained missing Monday from last week's flash flood at an Arkansas campground that left 19 dead, and ""there's still a possibility there could be others,"" Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN. Rescuers found a 19th body over the weekend about half to three-quarters of a mile downstream from the campground, Arkansas State Police Capt. Mike Fletcher told reporters. Eighteen of the 19 bodies recovered so far have been identified, Fletcher said. A wall of water swept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area before dawn Friday, when most campers were sleeping. The park is located along the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers, and the flood struck so quickly there was little chance for campers to escape, officials said. ""I don't think any of this has been a good day,"" Fletcher said. ""I think we need to keep these families in our thoughts and our prayers."" But, he said, ""We're just going to keep on doing what we do and come to a conclusion on this."" More than 100 people combed the rugged woodlands of the Ouachita National Forest until nightfall Sunday, said Mike Quesinberry, the head of the rescue effort for the U.S. Forest Service. Fletcher said one searcher was overcome by heat exhaustion in Sunday's sweltering temperatures, which ranged into the mid-90s with high humidity. Quesinberry said the last two bodies found have been in piles of wood, rock and other debris along the riverbanks, and those are now the focus of the search. Six dog teams were included in the rescue effort, and authorities were planning to bring in more dogs and new equipment, he said. ""Some of these piles are just massive amounts of rock and debris,"" Quesinberry said. ""It's unsafe to get individuals in there with chainsaws and those type tools, so we've got heavy equipment coming in."" Funerals for two of the victims killed in the flash floods at a federal campground in Arkansas were scheduled for Tuesday. Services for Kylee Sullivan, 7, will be Tuesday morning, while her grandmother, Julie Freeman, will be buried that afternoon, Texarkana Funeral Home Director Kendall Hudson said. Authorities released the names of 15 of the dead Saturday, with six children among the victims, including one girl as young as 2 years old. Ages of the adult victims ranged from 23 to 69. Several groups of people with the same last name were listed. The victims identified were largely from Texas and Louisiana, with one person from Foreman, Arkansas. The warning system intended to notify campers on federal land about potentially devastating weather will be re-examined in Arkansas and throughout the nation, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Saturday.","NEW: ""There could be others"" as search for flood victims goes on, governor says .

"(CNN)  -- Schalke striker Kevin Kuranyi will not be going to the World Cup after Germany coach Joachim Loew publicly ruled out his participation in the finals in South Africa next month. His superb form in the Bundesliga this season, with 18 goals for the title challengers, had led to speculation that the 28-year-old could win a recall to the German squad, which is to be unveiled later this week. ""After full consideration in the training team we came to the conclusion that we have other ideas for the make-up of our World Cup team, both tactically and when it comes to personnel,"" Loew told a press conference on Monday. ""I said this quite openly to Kevin."" Kuranyi, who has 52 international caps, has not played for Germany since his controversial walkout after being left out of the squad for a World Cup qualifier against Russia in October 2008. Loew vowed never to pick him again, but last month he appeared to soften his stance and said he was mulling over whether to include Kuranyi in his plans. But he insisted that his past indiscretion had nothing to do with his decision to ignore his claims. ""The disciplinary event ... didn't matter to me at the end of the day. It would not have been a problem to have given him another chance in the national team. ""Kevin ... has the character of a consummate professional, in my view."" Germany will announce their full squad on Thursday and Loew has plenty of striking choice with Bayern Munich pair Miroslav Klose and Mario Gomez, Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling and Cacau of Stuttgart pressing for inclusion. The squad will be whittled down to 23 after a training camp in Italy. Kuranyi said he accepted Loew's decision and wished the team well. ""I gave all I could this season on the pitch, but sadly it wasn't enough,"" Kuranyi told AFP. ""But it is the national coach's decision, and I respect and accept it.""","Kevin Kuranyi ruled out of Germany squad for World Cup finals .

"(CNN) -- Two New Jersey men arrested last week at John F. Kennedy International Airport allegedly on their way to fight with an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Somalia were followers of an extreme Islamist group based in New York, CNN has learned. CNN has obtained an image of the two suspects, Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, attending a protest in New York organized by the Islamic Thinkers Society on June 1 of this year. They appear to have been taking part in a demonstration against Israel. One is holding a banner, the other an Islamic Thinkers Society poster that includes the slogan, ""Exterminate the Zionist Roaches."" The society's video of the event, posted on its YouTube channel, has since been removed. The rally took place just a week before the two suspects were arrested at JFK airport. ""My soul cannot rest till I shed blood. I wanna like be the world's [best] known terrorist"" Alessa is alleged to have told an undercover agent in the United States late last year. Later he said, ""We'll start doing killing here, if I can't do it over there."" Another image -- from late in 2008 -- shows Almonte at a different rally, holding a poster that says ""Death to all Juice"" (sic). It's not clear whether that rally was organized by the Islamic Thinkers Society. Several calls to the Islamic Thinkers Society about Alessa's and Almonte's involvement with the group were not returned. On its website, the Islamic Thinkers Society says, ""Our struggle is always intellectual & political non-violent means."" But counterterrorism officials say that the group and another called Revolution Muslim have come under scrutiny for their anti-Western rhetoric and for endorsing the actions of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. The two groups often hold joint events. While they have few full-time members and their rallies are sometimes sparsely attended, the Islamic Thinkers Society and Revolution Muslim have thousands of followers online, many of them American. According to counterterrorism officials they also organize private gatherings in the greater New York area. ""In a sense they are almost bug lights for aspiring jihadists,"" the director of intelligence analysis of the New York Police Department, Mitch Silber, told CNN earlier this year. ""They've got an anti-Western, anti-democratic, anti-U.S., pro-al Qaeda message."" In April, Revolution Muslim posted a warning on its website that the creators of the cartoon ""South Park"" risked being killed for their depiction of the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit. The warning was widely seen as a threat. Alessa and Almonte are by no means the first Americans alleged to have had links to the groups. CNN revealed in its recent documentary ""American Al Qaeda"" that Bryant Neal Vinas, a Catholic convert to Islam from Long Island, moved in Islamic Thinkers Society circles in New York before he left the United States. Vinas went to Pakistan determined to wage jihad against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He subsequently confessed to helping al Qaeda plot a bomb attack on the Long Island Railroad. CNN revealed in the documentary that followers of the Islamic Thinkers Society not only helped radicalize Vinas, but also helped him connect with militants in Pakistan. Several other Americans recently charged in terrorism cases were followers of these groups. Counterterrorism officials say Colleen LaRose, a Pennsylvania woman also known as Jihad Jane, was an online follower of the Revolution Muslim YouTube Channel. LaRose was charged in March with plotting to assassinate a Swedish cartoonist; she has pleaded not guilty. Tarek Mehanna, a Boston resident, was charged last year with planning violent jihad in the United States -- including planning to attack shopping malls. He had connections with members of Revolution Muslim, according to Yousef al Khattab, one of the group's founders. CNN cannot independently confirm those connections. Khattab has since left the United States, says he has quit Revolution Muslim, and is now living in Morocco. Mehanna has not entered a plea. Counterterrorism officials tell CNN that before he founded Revolution Muslim, Khattab was the chief ideologue of the Islamic Thinkers Society. In an interview with CNN's Drew Griffin last year, Khattab said he had met Vinas, the Long Island al Qaeda recruit, and made no secret of his radical views. ""I love Osama bin Laden like I can't begin to tell you,"" Khattab said. The Islamic Thinkers Society and Revolution Muslim are offshoots of Al Muhajiroun, a pro-al Qaeda British extremist group that has seen several of its supporters convicted of terrorism offenses in the United Kingdom. Like Revolution Muslim, the Islamic Thinkers Society is still active on New York streets. In April it held a protest rally outside the Israeli Consulate. After the rally, the group's spokesman, Abu Mujaddid, told CNN that the group plans to step up its activities in New York and was successfully recruiting supporters. The activities of both Revolution Muslim and the Islamic Thinkers Society are protected by First Amendment guarantees. ""As much as the Islamic Thinkers Society might put out an extremist message, it seems they go right up to the line of the First Amendment. For the most part they, themselves as a group, aren't acting,"" NYPD's Silber told CNN recently. Terrorism experts believe that groups like the Islamic Thinkers Society are dangerous nonetheless. According to Marc Sageman, a former scholar in residence at the NYPD, ""Even if they do not have the connections to help [young radicals] go further, they articulate the glory of fighting Jihad, the glory of doing something, of being active. And this very much inspires young people.""","Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Eduardo Almonte spotted at earlier rally .

"(CNN) -- Lightning strikes apparently caused a major fire at a gasoline pipeline company's ""tank farm"" in North Carolina early Sunday morning, fire officials said. The blaze started at Colonial Pipeline Company in Greensboro after midnight, said David Douglas, an assistant fire chief in Greensboro. A tank holding about 20,000 barrels of gasoline -- about half that tank's capacity -- caught fire. While some of the gasoline burned, some of it was safely transferred to another tank, according to Steve Baker, Colonial Pipeline's director of communications. Firefighters used foam to extinguish the flames on the tank, Baker said, adding that Greensboro firefighters kept water hoses trained on other tanks in the sprawling complex to keep them cool and prevent the fire from spreading. The huge facility is near Piedmont Triad International Airport, and the massive blaze sent plumes of smoke throughout the area. The blaze caused the temporary closure of a portion of Interstate 40, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. There were no evacuations, Douglas said. CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this story.","Lightning suspected in major fire at gasoline pipeline company .

"Olympia, Washington (CNN) -- The news that Al and Tipper Gore are breaking up after 40 years of marriage has generated an outpouring of emotion. Although we don't have -- and shouldn't seek -- the inside details, the couple says the decision was mutual and the process will be mutually supportive. Friends have told journalists that no third party was involved; the two simply grew apart. It leads couples to wonder: ""Could this happen to us?"" and ""Could it already be happening to us?"" One woman called in to a radio show I was on and said plaintively, ""I thought I could count on my marriage after 22 years. You mean we have to keep working at this for the rest of our lives?"" As a family researcher, I understand why the Gore breakup scares people. Divorces after 40 years are rare, but in 2008, of people who reported divorcing recently, one-quarter had been in marriages that had lasted two decades or more. And divorces among couples 55 or older seem to be rising moderately, even as divorce rates in general have fallen from a high of about 23 divorces per 1,000 married couples in 1979 to less than 17 per 1000 in 2005. Many people assume that late-life divorces are precipitated by some crisis, typically a man leaving his wife for another woman. But a 2004 AARP survey of people who divorced at older ages found that two-thirds were initiated by the woman, often to the surprise of the man. Although men are more likely to instigate a divorce when they have another partner in sight, women are more likely to say they just couldn't stand to be with this partner any more, which jibes with the research showing that women are physiologically and emotionally more sensitive to the negative effects of an unsatisfying relationship. The rise in divorce rates for older people, which is occurring in Great Britain, Canada and Japan, as well as the United States, results from the confluence of two new trends. The first is that we expect more from marriage than in the past. It's no longer enough for the other partner to be a good provider or a good housekeeper. We want marriage to include friendship, sexual satisfaction and an interesting give-and-take between equals. The second is that if a marriage ceases to meet their needs, older people have many more alternatives than they used to. Today individuals remain active and healthy much longer than in the past, so that staying together ""until death do us part"" means that 65-year-olds in an unhappy marriage will likely have another 20 years to wait it out, when they could be traveling, working, even re-inventing themselves. And opportunities for repartnering after age 55 are much greater than they used to be. Are late-life divorces a tragedy? Sometimes, perhaps -- but three-fourths of the divorced individuals in the AARP survey felt their divorce had been the right step for them. And having to stay in an empty marriage can be a tragedy, too. For a new book on the women of ""The Greatest Generation,"" I interviewed women who were wives and mothers in the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Many described being ""trapped"" in empty marriages, longing ""to be free."" But in those decades they simply couldn't imagine being able to support themselves, much less make new friends as a ""divorcee,"" or meet a potential partner. One woman told me, ""We thought: You're fat at 40 and finished by 50."" It's scary to think that one's own marriage could become so unbearably confining. It would be nice if every couple could grow together instead of growing apart. But it should be reassuring to know that if your marriage does become deeply unsatisfying, you have other ways to live the rest of your life, and you can end your marriage civilly instead of through humiliating public misconduct or explosive mutual recrimination. The Gores raised four children and were there for each other when they needed to be. Now that they have decided to part, they are trying to do so in a way that is fair and respectful. That doesn't sound like failure to me. For the rest of us, the Gore breakup is a reminder that we can't take our marriages for granted. But we should see that as a good thing rather than a scary one. People need to grow, and growing together can be fun. One of the best ways to renew marital affection and interest is to face new challenges together, whether that means learning new skills, braving a white-water rafting trip, or traveling to a new place. Let's take this as a lesson to stop working so hard in our marriages and spend more time playing in them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Coontz.","Stephanie Coontz says news of the Gores' breakup makes older couples fret: Could that be us?
Contrary to assumptions, late-life divorces usually instigated by women, she says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan  President Hamid Karzai and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, say  they've secured backing from local leaders for an upcoming military operation in  the province. McChrystal  took Karzai and some of his security chiefs to Kandahar, considered the heartland of Taliban  country. With  McChrystal in the front row, Karzai delivered a full-court press to a group of  about 300 tribal leaders Sunday, in a bid to get their support. The group  sat on carpets and cushions on the floor as they listened to Karzai passionately  talk about increasing security and ending corruption. He also had  a stong message for the Taliban. ""First I  call on the Taliban for peace. Do not kill your country men and children. Do not  kill innocents,"" Karzai said. ""Separate yourself from al Qaeda and the  terrorists."" McChrystal  and Karzai believe they got approval for the coming offensive, which has already  been delayed once.  About a month and a half ago, another military plan  presented to locals by Karzai was rejected. McCrystal  said securing support from Afghan leaders before the start of a new offensive  was critical to success.  He added that this is a lesson learned from previous  offensives in the country. Tribal  leaders had mixed reviews for the plan.  Some doubted Karzai's government was  capable of mounting such an offensive.  Others expressed faith in the president,  but objected to the involvement of U.S.  troops. Karzai did not say when the upcoming  military operation would take place.  But initial reports indicate that Afghan  troops will take the main role in the center of Kandahar, while U.S. troops will be mainly on the  perimeter.","Afghan President Harmid Karzai and U.S. Gen.

"(CNN) -- Robert J. Wussler, a pioneering television news executive at CBS before he joined Ted Turner to help build Turner Broadcasting System and CNN into cable industry giants, died on June 5 at his Connecticut home after a long illness, according to a family spokesman. He was 73. Wussler's career spanned five decades in which he became the youngest head of a major U.S. television network at 39 and later was instrumental in development of the cable television industry. After starting as a mail-room clerk at CBS in 1957, he eventually became president of CBS Television News and CBS Sports and produced coverage of  major stories of his era, including the assassinations and funerals of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.; President Richard Nixon's trip to China; and the Apollo 11 lunar landing that put man on the moon for the first time. He won seven Emmy awards and created ""The NFL Today,"" the pre-game show that became a standard for major sports broadcasts, said Arthur Sando of Sando Communications, who provided biographical information on Wussler. In 1980, Wussler joined cable pioneer Ted Turner at Turner Broadcasting System and took part in developing and managing CNN, Headline News, TBS Sports and TNT. He also was involved with Turner in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and Atlanta Hawks basketball team. ""Bob Wussler was instrumental in helping Ted Turner build Turner Broadcasting and CNN,"" said Tom Johnson, a former CNN president. ""Bob brought his prior network experience to the creation of TBS and served as a key adviser on many of Ted's major decisions during that pioneering era of the company."" Terry McGuirk, a former TBS chief executive officer who now holds that post for the Atlanta Braves, said Wussler ""brought a new level of professionalism to Turner Broadcasting."" ""His arrival at TBS validated the maturity of programming in the cable industry and the businesses that Turner Broadcasting was building in that programming arena,"" McGuirk said. When Turner wanted to hold an international sporting event to help bridge political divisions, it was Wussler who helped him create the Goodwill Games, McGuirk said. ""He actually was Ted's go-between with the Russians,"" according to McGuirk. ""So much of it was about television production and building it from scratch. He and Ted personally went to Moscow in 1986 and made that happen."" The Goodwill Games were staged six times from 1986 to 2001, at locales in the former Soviet Union, the United States, Russia and Australia. Born on September 8, 1936, in Newark, New Jersey, Wussler was a graduate of Seton Hall University. Wussler was regarded as an innovator, playing a role in expanding satellite usage in news coverage and the advancement of small cameras and recording devices in both the studio and in the field. In 1978, Wussler formed his own production company, Pyramid Enterprises, which created unique, syndicated programming for the international marketplace, specializing in Japan, France and the former Soviet Union. He later served as president and CEO of Comsat Video Enterprises, the largest provider of satellite-delivered entertainment to the U.S. lodging industry; and managed the acquisition of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. Other awards received by Wussler included the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Trustees (NATAS) Award, four Awards for Cable Excellence (ACE) and the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) President's Award.

"(CNN) -- The 2010 Census is nearly under way, but don't expect an e-mail from the U.S. Census Bureau asking you personal questions in its head count of America. Cyber criminals have information about millions of people, but they don't use it against everyone. If you do get one, it's a scam. ""Like most large organizations, we have seen e-mail scams and phishing attacks that cite the U.S. Census Bureau,"" agency spokesman Neil Tillman wrote in an e-mail. The Census Bureau stresses that it will not request personal information from you via e-mail, such as PIN codes, passwords, Social Security numbers, credit-card numbers or other financial account information. A news-based phishing scheme like this one is one of several risks you face online. Cybercriminals have gotten craftier, often looking toward popular trends and events -- such as tax season, the mortgage meltdown and the growth of social media -- to scam people into giving them sensitive information. To protect their privacy online, computer users need to stay informed about the criminals' methods and to learn basic principles of caution. Online attackers have information on millions of consumers, said Ravi Sandhu, a professor of cyber security at the University of Texas at San Antonio. However, he added, the rate at which they can use that information is considerably lower. ""It's a bit like a lottery. To have identity theft actually occur against you, you need to have a little bad luck. There is some comfort in numbers,"" Sandhu said. In addition to criminal scams, corporate data breaches can leave your privacy compromised. As of September 22, there have been 379 data breaches reported by the Identity Theft Resource Center in 2009, affecting more than 13 million records. Companies with data breaches included financial institutions, travel companies, health care operations and schools. ""It's not one or two companies that are acting irresponsibly with consumer data,"" said Andrea Matwyshyn, a law professor who teaches technology regulation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""It's a large-scale problem where industry norms of care are arguably not adequate to address the challenges of data security optimally."" Safeguard your Social Security number . Exercising caution before you submit sensitive information can save you a lot of aggravation down the line. For instance, most businesses really won't need your Social Security number, the key number for identity theft, so think twice before you provide it online. Social Security numbers are used ""to establish new lines of credit or for tax purposes. How many things are you doing online that have to do with taxes?"" said Linda Foley, co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center. So before you share the information, be certain that you are on that Web site of a real company -- as opposed to an imposter conducting a phishing scheme. Also, ask yourself why a Web site would need your Social Security number, said Michael Kaiser, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance. ""I always encourage consumers to supply the minimum amount of information possible. A lot of times, you get these long forms and you get the little star that's required, but people are collecting other [data about you],"" Kaiser said. ""Don't fill it out if you don't want to."" Still, even visiting a legitimate Web site has its share of risks, because online attackers may inject malicious content onto them by hacking them or placing advertisements that deliver malware, Sandhu said. If a criminal does obtain your Social Security number and creates a fraudulent identity, it can be a much bigger hassle than if he or she uses your credit card number. Credit card companies often pick up the tab for fraudulent charges, and they send you a new card with a different number. It's more difficult to get a new Social Security number, and a stolen identity could affect your credit rating. Where is your information going? If you conduct an online transaction that requires you to reveal personal data, the online privacy policy will explain whether your information could be shared with third parties. A company may tell you in that policy it will share your data with its ""trusted partners"" and however it deems appropriate in the course of business, said Matwyshyn, editor of the upcoming book ""Harboring Data: Information Security, Law, and the Corporation."" ""That's a signal that your data is going to be licensed many times over, and it's going to be touched by a greater number of hands."" That becomes a problem, Matwyshyn said, because ""you're only as good as the weakest link in the chain."" That is, the ""trusted partners"" who can access the data may not have optimal security. Storing sensitive data such as a credit card number on a business' Web site, though convenient, may also pose a risk, Matwyshyn said. ""The longer they store that credit card number in their systems, the longer the period of time that someone else can gain unauthorized access to that credit card number,"" she said. Privacy at the mercy of others . Even if you practice a high level of caution with how much you reveal about yourself online, other people may inadvertently expose information about you. For instance, a friend or relative may post a photo of you on a blog or social networking Web site that reveals your name, shows a street sign indicating your address and displays your car's license plate number, Kaiser said. Kaiser recommends periodically looking up your name on one or two search engines to see the personal information about you on the Internet but adds that search probably won't tell you whether someone stole sensitive information, such as your credit card, address or Social Security number. For that, monitor your credit report for suspicious activity, suggests the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act allows you to access a free credit report each year from each of the three credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. ""Just like in health care, you should be the first one to notice when something goes wrong with you,"" Sandhu said. ""If you don't perceive a symptom and convey it to a physician, nobody's going to be able to help you,"" he said. ""So here, also, consumers need to be vigilant and watch over their accounts and look out to see if anything strange is happening.""","Cybercriminals have data on many people but can use it only against a finite number .
Most businesses don't really need your Social Security number .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The alleged leader of a regional branch of the Los Zetas drug cartel was arrested by the Mexican Army Wednesday, Mexico's state news agency Notimex reported. Hector Raul Luna Luna, known by the alias ""El Tori"" was arrested during a ""precision operation"" by the personnel of the Seventh Military Zone in Monterrey, in northern Mexico, the agency said. The military command said that Luna confessed to participating in a grenade attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey on October 12, 2008, under the orders of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, alias ""El Canicon"" who was arrested on March 20 of last year, Notimex reported. There is also evidence that Luna was responsible for killing six members of the Mexican Army and was the perpetrator of an attack against the secretariat of public security in the municipality of Escobedo, in Coahuila state, near the Texas border, and the subsequent attack on the then-secretary of public safety, retired general Hermelindo Lara Cruz. The military also arrested one of Luna's accomplices, David Eduardo Fuentes Martinez, known by the aliases ""El Chile"" and ""El Mantequilla,"" who was carrying an array of weapons, including a 55 mm Barrett rifle, commonly used for piercing through shields and other materials, said Notimex. Brig. Gen. Edgar Luis Villegas Melendez said in a news conference Thursday that the alleged criminals were arrested as part of the country's comprehensive strategy to combat drug trafficking. During the arrests, the military also seized weapons including a 40 mm grenade launcher, a 5.7 x 28 mm pistol, two fragmentation grenades, two 40 mm grenades, chargers and 30 cell phones. Additionally, they seized 20 kilograms of marijuana, 110 doses of the same material, and 58 doses of cocaine, Notimex reported. Luna and Fuentes Martinez were brought to the facilities of the secretary of national defense Thursday.","Regional leader of Los Zetas arrested in Monterrey, Mexico .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- He's been labeled by many as the ""reformist,"" a man who can take Iran beyond the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Moussavi was not seen as a reformer during his stint as prime minister during the 1980s. So, when Iran's government announced over the weekend that Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country's next president, young Iranians took to the streets by the thousands alleging ballot fraud. Thousands of others around the globe championed the cause on social-networking Web sites and agreed to wear green on Monday in solidarity with Moussavi's supporters. But what is often lost in the outrage is whether Iran would look different under a Moussavi presidency.  Watch more about the vote » . Though the 67-year old is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a ""firm radical."" He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, which led to the break in ties between the countries. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents and backed the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. ""I wouldn't go as far as (call it) a 'Velvet Revolution,'"" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said of the phrase many are using to describe the rallies in Iran. ""At the end of the day, Moussavi has been more involved and been there from the very beginning of the revolution in a way that Ahmadinejad never was,"" Parsi told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Sunday. ""Moussavi was one of the founders of the revolution."" Moussavi was named prime minister in 1980. A year earlier, Iran had become an Islamic republic after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The same year, a group of students in support of the Islamic revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. In an interview with The New York Times in 1981, Moussavi defended the hostage-taking as the beginning of ""second stage of our revolution."" ""It was after this that we rediscovered our true Islamic identity,"" he said. The incident, Moussavi added, ended the ""problem of pro-American circles and their following in Iran. ""After this, we felt the sense that we could look Western policy in the eye and analyze it the way they had been evaluating us for many years."" In 1988, author Salman Rushdie released his fourth novel, 'The Satanic Verses,' which Iran said insulted Islam. The country's supreme leader called for the death of Rushdie. And Moussavi, in a radio broadcast, said the order would be carried out. Moussavi told the Financial Times in April that he would not halt Iran's uranium enrichment program if he were president. ""No one in Iran would accept suspension,"" he said. Since his stint as prime minister, Moussavi has been absent from politics. For the past 10 years, his official job has been to head the state-owned Art Center. He is a painter. The long ""20 years of silence,"" as the Iranian media dubbed it, is working to Moussavi's advantage. Of Iran's population of 70 million, almost 60 percent are younger than 28 -- too young to have lived through the 1979 revolution. To them, Moussavi represents a sea change from Ahmadinejad. While the president calls the Holocaust a myth, Moussavi has condemned the killing of Jews. While Ahmadinejad has unleashed the morality police to ensure that women cover their hair in public, Moussavi has pledged his support for women's rights. Most importantly, the youth are unhappy about the faltering economy under Ahmadinejad, with the unemployment rate topping 30 percent by some accounts. They are hungry for anyone who represents change, analysts have said. ""We have really an interesting moment of historic irony here,"" Afshin Molavi, a fellow at the New America Foundation, said on the CNN talk show Fareed Zakaria GPS. ""Moussavi is a child of the revolution. Moussavi was never a real reformer, either, when he was prime minister. ""And now he's being faced with the question: Should he unleash the young people out onto the streets who supported him -- thus threatening the very system that he fought for?""

"(CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed and 45 others wounded in a bombing and gunfire near Iraq's central bank in the capital on Sunday, according to the Interior Ministry. After the initial blast, clashes broke out between security forces and armed men trying to rob the bank, the official said. There were conflicting reports about what the blast was, which hit at around 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). One Interior Ministry official said at least three roadside bombs exploded outside the bank, while another official said it was a suicide bomber. The spokesman for the Baghdad military command, Maj. Gen. Qassi, al-Moussawi, told state television that it was one roadside bomb. The casualties figures offered by the Interior Ministry only include civilians and security forces. The power generator for the bank caught fire and the burning fuel caused a large black plume of smoke seen over the capital, the first Interior Ministry official said.The bank is located in central Baghdad's Rasheed street. The bombing comes amid political uncertainty, a day before Iraq's parliament is set to convene for it's first session three months after national elections.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Michael Jackson took more than 10 Xanax pills a night, asking his employees to get the prescription medicine under their names and also personally traveling to doctors' offices in other states to obtain them, said a confidential document from 2004 that CNN obtained Thursday. Los Angeles detectives are waiting on the coroner's report on the death of Michael Jackson. The document from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department contains confidential interviews conducted with two of Jackson's former security guards as officials prepared for Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005. The singer was acquitted after the 14-week trial. But the information about the pills, and the lengths Jackson went to get them, adds to a growing mountain of claims tying the insomniac singer to drugs in recent days. According to the drug's Web site, Xanax is for the treatment of panic disorder. Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton said Thursday detectives have spoken to a number of doctors who have treated Jackson over the years, and are looking into the singer's prescription drug history. Doctors who did not cooperate with investigators were issued subpoenas, a source told CNN Thursday. If needed, authorities will issue more, the source said. Jackson died on June 25. Authorities are awaiting toxicology reports from the coroner's office to determine the exact cause of death. ""And based on those, we will have an idea of what it is we are dealing (with): are we dealing with a homicide or are we dealing with an accidental overdose?"" Bratton said. The speculation that prescription drugs, particularly sedatives, could have played a role in Jackson's death keeps coming up with each new nugget of information -- and there have been many. The Jackson family knows that the probe into his death can turn into a criminal case, a source close to the family told CNN on Thursday. ""The family is aware of a potential criminal prosecution,"" said the source, who did not want to be identified. The amount of Xanax that Jackson allegedly took surprised CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta. In addiction cases, people develop a tolerance to drugs and have to take more and more pills, Gupta said. ""No matter how you cut it, this is an extremely high dosage of Xanax,"" Gupta said. ""It is a huge red flag, even with the tolerance that I was talking about. This dosage is exceedingly high for any human being."" Jackson's attempt to battle sleep disorder . The 2004 document details a dark picture of Jackson's attempts to battle his sleeping disorder. One security guard that sheriff's deputies interviewed said he expressed his concern about Jackson's use of 10-plus pills a night to another staffer. The second staffer replied: ""Jackson was doing better because he was down from 30 to 40 Xanax pills a night,"" according to the document. One of the guards said he and three other employees would get prescriptions for Jackson under their names. The second guard backed up the claim, saying he had picked up medicines for the singer that were in other people's names. The document contains the names of five doctors -- some in California, some in New York and Florida. It was not immediately clear whether police have spoken to them as part of their investigation into Jackson's death. After the doctor visits, Jackson would be ""out of it and sedated,"" one guard said. According to the sheriff's office document, the guard who provided the bulk of the information quit his job after Jackson ""fell on his face"" in a hotel room and hurt himself. The employee told Jackson he was not comfortable getting prescriptions for him and left, he later told investigators. Years later in 2006, Jackson was in Las Vegas, Nevada, trying to jump-start his career. Deal-maker Jack Wishna, who was helping the singer land a long-running show in Vegas, told CNN the singer would appear ""drugged up"" and ""incoherent"" -- often so weak and emaciated he had to use a wheelchair to get around. The comeback shows were canceled because of Jackson's condition, Wishna said. Around that time, sister Janet Jackson was so worried about Jackson that she tried to stage an intervention with assistance from her other brothers, two sources close to the Jackson family told CNN Wednesday. Jackson reportedly ordered his security guards not to let the family members in. He also refused to take calls from his mother, Katherine, CNN has learned. At the time, the Jackson family released a statement to People magazine denying the alleged intervention. But Janet Jackson was not among the signatories. Along with the police investigation, which is being aided by the state attorney general's office and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Los Angeles County coroner's office has also drawn up a list of Jackson's doctors and is trying to talk to them to determine what drugs they may have prescribed him. Among them are Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist, and Dr. Conrad Murray, his cardiologist. Klein told CNN Wednesday that Jackson was addicted to drugs at one point but had kicked the habit. Murray, who has been interviewed by police, has repeatedly said he will withhold comment until the coroner's tests are back. Among others who have indicated that Jackson may have been using dangerous prescription medication are a nutritionist, Cherilyn Lee, who said Jackson pleaded for Diprivan despite being told of its harmful effects. Sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night and ""bring him back up"" during a world tour in the mid-90s. Another source involved with the probe told CNN that investigators found numerous bottles of prescription drugs in the singer's $100,000-a-month rented mansion in Holmby Hills. The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times, citing unnamed sources, said police found Diprivan. Diprivan is a powerful sedative that is administered intravenously and is known by its generic name Propofol. Bratton did not elaborate on what was discovered. ""At the time of the death with search warrants, we were able to seize a number of items from the residence where the death occurred and those will assist in the investigation,"" he said. CNN's Randi Kaye, Susan Chun, Scott Bronstein and Nancy Baker contributed to this report.","2004 document details security guards' accounts of singer's pill consumption .

"(AOL Autos) -- Some drivers would say that the United States is a crazy quilt of speed limits, with an emphasis on the ""crazy."" A sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by Interstate 10 outside of the West Texas town of El Paso. Since 1995, states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits, leading to long debates on safety standards. To some folks, the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high, depending on their views about what makes driving safe. Advocates of low speed limits won't find much to like about Texas. True to its frontier roots, it stands out as the land of the fast getaway. The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner. This includes parts of Interstate 10 between Kerrville and El Paso and of I-20 between Monahans and the I-10 interchange. The speed limit for rural roads in Montana is 75 mph. As a result, it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from Billings to Butte at the posted speed. But that's much slower than a Montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999. At that time there was a six-month speeders' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds, partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling. St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum. In the U.S. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country. When it comes to accident rates, though, you would be far better off on a Montana interstate than competing with the island's frenetic drivers on the way to Paradise Point. Nationwide, maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in Hawaii to 75 in most of the West. Meanwhile, much of the eastern Midwest and the Northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph, although Michigan and Indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the South and the Great Plains states. So if you are cruising west along I-90 out of Ohio, you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of Indiana before Illinois' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in. As you continue west, interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in Iowa, and then you can maintain a steady 75 from Nebraska through to the California line, where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again. Should you choose to detour into Oregon, you're back down to 65. From a highway safety standpoint, the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense. Speeds are slower in more populous Eastern states and faster in the wide-open West, although the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety argues that some of the new, higher speed limits out West and elsewhere are costing lives. It estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits. But some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways, if not on city streets and rural two-lanes. They point to the lower fatality rates on European highways, even though the speeds are generally higher. The maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in Poland, Austria, France and a few other countries. There is no speed limit on much of Germany's autobahn, although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less. Ironically, the new regime of U.S. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous. Political scientist Robert Yowell, a professor at Northeast Lakeview College in Texas, examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995. With the federal 65 mph limit gone, it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect. The results were clear: ""By and large, across the 50 states, there was no discernible effect from the higher limits,"" Yowell said. ""Two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities."" Once speed limits are raised on interstates, drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes, Yowell said. Furthermore, the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher-speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving. The less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly. While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's ""not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety,"" he said. ""They are a function of revenue generation as well. There have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that's not a proper use of the law."" In part, Yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits. ""It may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety,"" he said. His research doesn't surprise Jim Baxter, president of the Waunakee, Wisconsin-based National Motorists Association. His organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits. Baxter's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed. That's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below. But it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set. With the speed limit set at that level, traffic tends to move smoothly, reducing the risk of accidents, Baxter said. If you put the limit below that speed, some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers, creating the most dangerous conditions of all. Baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills. St. Thomas is a case in point, albeit an extreme one. With its congestion and rugged terrain, the island is bereft of performance cars; many of the vehicles are older pickups, aging Japanese compacts and SUVs. The treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law. As Joe Aubain, executive director of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce, puts it, ""Even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster, you couldn't,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- BP began deploying pressure sensors on its ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday in an effort to fine-tune estimates of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, government and company officials said. BP used remote-controlled submarines to begin positioning the sensors inside the well, located 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf, company spokesman Mark Proegler said. The sensors were requested by federal experts who have been trying to gauge how much oil has been pouring from the well, which experts say could have been spewing as much as 1.7 million gallons of oil a day into the Gulf. But Proegler said the devices may not yield accurate information for several days. ""It's not as if they'll plug these sensors in and get readings right away,"" he said. Researchers recently doubled estimates of how much oil has been flowing from the ruptured well, saying last week that up to 40,000 barrels -- or 1.7 million gallons -- a day may have leaked for weeks. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point man on the disaster, said the sensors will help give those researchers a better picture of the flow rate. ""We think we need some independent pressure readings to validate the estimates that have been made by the scientists looking at the video and some other acoustic data,"" Allen said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" Allen's deputy, Rear Adm. James Watson, has given BP until Sunday to provide alternative plans that adequately address substantially higher rates of oil flow. The company said Saturday that it was reviewing a letter from Watson, but no response had been disclosed late Sunday. The oil is believed to have been pouring into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sank the offshore drill rig Deepwater Horizon, killing 11 workers. The spill now dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Allen said the battle against the oil ""continues to widen,"" with efforts now being focused on the stretch of open water between the wellhead and about 15 miles off the coast. ""Rather than trying to capture all around the well head, we've got to get our skimmers further offshore and protect it so we minimize the amount of oil that comes ashore,"" he said. Allen's comments came on the eve of President Barack Obama's fourth scheduled visit to the stricken Gulf region, a two-day trip that will be followed by a Tuesday night address to the nation. Obama is scheduled to visit Mississippi, Alabama and Florida on Monday and Tuesday, then meet with BP executives on Wednesday. BP has captured some of the gushing oil through a containment cap that has been pumping the crude up to a drilling ship for about a week. BP said it collected more than 15,000 barrels of oil on Saturday and more than 7,700 by noon Sunday. But despite this advancement, pressure has not been removed from BP. White House adviser David Axelrod said Sunday the Obama administration wants BP to set up a massive, independently administered fund for cleaning up the oil-stricken Gulf states. ""The president will use every legal device at his disposal to make sure that this money is escrowed and that there is an independent administrator so that claims are not slow-walked, people can get the relief they need in a timely fashion and that we don't create more victims from this terrible disaster,"" Axelrod told reporters. He said administration lawyers have advised ""that we have the authority to compel such an escrow fund, if it comes to that."" Estimates of the cleanup costs and the damages BP will owe to businesses and residents on the Gulf Coast range from $3 billion to $40 billion. BP said it already has spent more than $1 billion trying to cap the spill and clean up the areas affected by the oil. Axelrod did not discuss how much money might be set up in the fund. But Allen told CBS that BP was ""a company that's got a lot of wealth inside it."" And a group of 54 Senate Democrats -- nearly all the Democratic caucus -- has called on BP to put $20 billion in trust for the spill. In a letter to the oil company's CEO, Tony Hayward, they note that the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound cost $7 billion, but Exxon paid far less for damages while continuing to make major profits. Alabama Gov. Bob Riley told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he didn't care how the money was paid out. But he said BP owed ""every one"" of his state's Gulf Coast businesses. ""I don't think there is a dividing line,"" said Riley, a Republican. ""I don't think you can say that one group is going to get it and another one doesn't. If a restaurant in Gulf Shores, Alabama, is off 50 percent because the tourists didn't come, I think he is owed 50 percent of his revenues from last year. ""The same thing with anyone in these areas, because the whole economy is based on the tourist market,"" he said. ""And when it goes away, someone's got to compensate them, because most of these people are not going to be here next year if we don't."" Riley also criticized the Obama administration's handling of the disaster, saying the ""unified command"" set up with the federal government and BP is mounting a disjointed response. ""You can't have a committee making the decisions that are going to impact this entire coastal area. You can't have someone come in and say, 'Well, if it gets onto the beach, we'll clean it up and we'll clean it up rapidly,' and then OSHA come in and say, 'Well, the people can't work but 20 minutes out of an hour or two hours a day,' and get it cleaned up. Someone is . going to have to be in charge of each one of these operations,"" he said. Riley, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist are scheduled to meet with the president during his two-day visit. Barbour told CBS he was pleased to hear Allen talk of trying to fight the oil offshore rather than on the beaches, but said he would push Obama to end the six-month moratorium he slapped on offshore oil exploration since the disaster began. Obama has said no drilling should go forward until investigators determine the cause of the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. But Barbour said Obama ""is going to hurt the national economy"" if the temporary ban isn't lifted. ""There have been more than 30,000 oil wells drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in the last 50 years. This is the first time something like this has ever happened. And we need to get to the bottom of it, find out what happened, make sure it doesn't happen again. But I think it is very reasonable to continue to drill,"" Barbour said.","NEW: Deadline for new plan nears .

"(CNN) -- Steve Miller admits he has no idea why it took him 17 years to release a new studio album. He also admits he was in no rush to do so. ""We continued to sell records from our touring, and we were really in this sort of magical place where we didn't have to make records until I really wanted to,"" said Miller, 66, in an interview with CNN Radio. ""I've recorded lots of projects, but just haven't bothered to release them."" ""BINGO!"", however, is not remaining on the shelf. Steve Miller Band's first new studio album since 1993's ""Wide River"" hits stores on June 15, and sees Miller embracing the blues music he immersed himself in growing up in Dallas. ""BINGO!"" features his interpretations of tracks like B.B. King's ""Rock Me Baby,"" Jimmy Reed's ""You Got Me Dizzy"" and Jimmie Vaughan's ""Hey Yeah"" -- the album's first single. ""This is my pop music. When I was a kid this is what I was listening to on my car radio -- Lowell Fulsom singing ""Tramp."" ""Tramp"" is another one of the 10 songs on ""BINGO!"" (a special edition includes four bonus tracks and expanded artwork.) However, Miller cautions fans this isn't a traditional ""covers"" album. ""I didn't just want to do a cover of somebody's record,"" said Miller. ""I wanted to get some material and make it my own, and these songs all lent themselves to that."" Miller recorded ""BINGO!"" at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch in California. In fact, he cut 42 tracks in all during the sessions there, some of which he says will end up on a second album that has no set release date at this point. Miller says ""BINGO!"" can also be considered a ""guitar player's album."" ""Lots of lead guitar and cool guitar parts have been worked out. It just got better and better and better as we worked on it,"" he said. Indeed, one of the guest artists on the album is renowned guitarist and 15-time Grammy nominee Joe Satriani, who trades solos with Miller on ""Rock Me Baby"" and Vaughan's ""Sweet Soul Vibe."" ""He just plays beautifully,"" said Miller about his fellow guitarist. ""It blows your mind when you hear him. He is a monster guitarist -- a wonderful musician."" Miller says the feedback to ""BINGO!"" has been entertaining to say the least. ""When we first took the record around to play it for different record guys there were a bunch of young people who really didn't know these songs who said, 'Did Steve write all those.?' It sounds just like the Steve Miller Band!"" Reaction from fans has been gratifying as well, according to Miller. He is in the midst of what has become an annual summer tour of North America and has been giving audiences a sneak preview of the tracks on the new album, mixed in with hits like ""Fly Like an Eagle,"" ""The Joker,"" ""Rock'n Me,"" ""Take the Money and Run,"" and ""Abracadabra."" ""The audiences nowadays are really hipper than they were in the mid '90s. When our last record was out we'd say, 'OK, we're gonna do a few new songs from our new album ""Wide River.""' 5,000 people would get up and leave and go get a hot dog until they heard me start the opening riff of ""The Joker."" It was such a conservative audience, and now the audience is much more interested in the new music."" Miller thinks the reason behind this is the role the internet has played in the music industry. ""We now have the ability to hear so much more music,"" he said. ""I find that a lot of kids today, their musical horizon is as broad as mine was when I was a kid. I was exposed to jazz and blues and gospel and country music and rock, and I was the only kid I knew who knew about that stuff. Now everybody does."" However, Miller says the meshing of the music world and digital world has been a curse along with a blessing, and he feels that it has hurt the industry and its audiences. ""We're putting people out of work,"" he said. ""It's very frustrating to have someone like (Apple co-founder) Steve Jobs portrayed as this great genius. At the same time he's a thief, he's creating machines that steal things. Thirty years from now the people who created the computers we're using will all be indicted for destroying everybody's hearing and for stealing music and intellectual property. But at the same time, we'll know more. It's as damaging as it is enabling."" An Apple spokeswoman refused to comment on Miller's remarks. Miller says he spent $700,000 in two years making ""BINGO!"" He predicts no one will follow that business model again because the popularity of downloads ensures musicians won't be able to make a profit off it. Miller says touring is ultimately the most foolproof way he has of making a living. ""I'm OK, I have this huge live audience and you can't copy my show. If you want to see what it's like to see human beings play this music right in front of you for real, you have to buy a ticket. That's the only thing that we really have left that can't just be copied and spread over the place -- actual live performance,"" he said. Miller grew up in a musical family. His mother, Bertha, was a singer and his father, Dr. George (Sonny) Miller, was an amateur tape recordist. A young Miller even learned some chords from his father's friend, guitarist Les Paul. However, he says he realizes not everyone has a chance to get that kind of exposure to music at home. So he's devoting part of his summer tour in support of ""BINGO!"" to raise money for a new music education initiative. The ""text to donate"" campaign benefits the Kids Rock Free music education programs at the Fender Center in Corona, California. Miller helped start the programs 11 years ago, and says that during that time 12,000 young people have received free and low-cost music lessons. ""What I'm trying to do is build these schools in everyone's community,"" said Miller. ""It costs about half what a Wendy's restaurant would cost to build. If folks really want music in their community they can do it very cheaply. It doesn't have to be a $50 million program. All we need is just a little real estate."" During his shows, Miller is encouraging people to donate by texting ROCK to 50555. A one-time $10 donation is then added to mobile bills. The fruits of the Kids Rock Free program are also on display during Miller's summer tour. Two of its students are joining the Steve Miller Band at a handful of shows to play guitar with the band for a bit. ""The guitars look huge on them and they play on a couple of tunes and just knock everybody out!""","""BINGO!"" features interpretations of B.B. King, Jimmie Vaughan tracks .

"(CNN) -- The 16-year-old California girl rescued from her stricken boat in the Indian Ocean says she is ""safe and sound"" and argues that her age shouldn't be blamed for the problems she encountered while at sea. ""Storms are part of the deal when you set out to sail around the world,"" Abby Sunderland wrote in a blog on her website dated Saturday. ""As for age, since when does age create gigantic waves and storms?"" Criticism has emerged that she was too young to embark on such a journey, which apparently has ended. Abby lost satellite contact on Thursday and issued a distress call after what was described as a rogue wave hit the boat, damaging its mast and communications equipment. A French fishing vessel reached a remote area in the Indian Ocean on Saturday morning to fetch her. ""There are plenty of things people can think of to blame for my situation; my age, the time of year and many more,"" Abby said in the blog. She added that ""it was just a Southern Ocean storm."" ""The truth is, I was in a storm and you don't sail through the Indian Ocean without getting in at least one storm."" It will be several weeks before she is home in California, rescuers said. Her parents praised people from France and Australia for their help in reaching their stranded daughter. ""Their professionalism and the great value that they placed on Abby's life has been a gift to us that we can never repay. Thank you for caring for our daughter as if she were your own, for answering all of our many questions cheerfully and completely and for going above and beyond our wildest expectations to keep Abby safe,"" Laurence and Marianne Sunderland said in a post on the girl's website. The parents, who also briefed reporters in Thousand Oaks, California on Saturday said they were overjoyed their daughter was found. As for her boat, Wild Eyes, it had to be left in the middle of the ocean, and Abby said she's ""still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again."" Responding to questions from reporters on whether Abby was too young to take such a voyage, her father defended her skill. ""What this is about is a young lady who has a great skill on the ocean and a passion for bluewater sailing.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Huang Guangyu, once China's richest man, was sentenced Tuesday to 14 years in prison, state media reported. Huang -- the head of Gome, one of China's leading retail chains -- was charged with stock-market manipulation, insider trading and bribery. The sentence, handed down Tuesday, also fines Huang 600 million yuan ($87.8 million) and confiscates property worth 200 million yuan ($29.2 million), said the Xinhua news agency. The 41-year-old Huang went on trial in late April. He emerged as a rags-to-riches entrepreneur in the late 1980s, when young Chinese pursued business ideas and turned them into multi-million dollar ventures. Born to a poor family in southern Guangdong province, he moved to Beijing in his late teens and, with a capital of 30,000 yuan ($4,391), set up with his brother a home appliances distribution company. He founded Gome Electrical Appliances Holding in 1987 and built it into a flourishing retail chain. Huang ranked first on Hurun's China Rich List, a local publication, in 2008 with an estimated fortune worth $6.3 billion. Such a top ranking is usually not celebrated in China because of the scrutiny it brings. Huang typically kept a low profile despite his wealth and influence. His meteoric rise has captured the popular imagination in and outside China. He also inspired many aspiring Chinese entrepreneurs. Police detained Huang in November 2008 for an investigation into suspected ""economic crimes."" Little was heard of him or of the investigation, but the police dragnet gradually grew wider, ensnaring government and police officials in charge of fighting financial crimes. Huang resigned from Gome's company board in January 2009. In February, after 15 months in custody, Huang was formally charged.","Huang Guangyu, once China's richest man, was sentenced Tuesday to 14 years .

"(CNN)  -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria . Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. ""When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price. They almost got a draw -- we missed loads of chances,"" Maradona told AFP. ""Players such as Leo Messi and Higuain knocked in around 60 goals last season between them, yet today it was almost as if they couldn't set their sights on goal. ""But the win means we can be calm -- we are in the right track."" Enyeama's tip over from a Messi shot led to the early corner from which the unmarked Heinze scored to spark scenes of wild celebration on the Argentina bench, led by Maradona. Messi and Gonzalo Higuain might both have had hat-tricks as Argentina's attacking flair was evident, but at the other end Nigeria also had opportunities to salvage a point. Midway through the second half, Taye Taiwo found space to toe-poke a shot from the edge of the area which went just wide of Sergio Romero's left-hand post. CNN's World Cup twitter.buzz . As the clock ticked down, Enyeama blocked Messi as he looked certain to score but in a swift counter attack Nigeria then had their best chance of the match as Aiyegbeni Yakubu crossed from the right and Kala Uche made a hash of his volleyed attempt from 10 meters out. At the final whistle it was a deserved victory for Argentina, but they will face a sterner test in their next match in five days' time against South Korea. Nigeria, who have lost five and drawn once since their last World Cup finals victory in 1998, will be looking to break that winless run against the Greeks, who also have a poor record in football's global showpiece. South Korea 2-0 Greece . Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against a poor Greek side, who never looked like getting on the score sheet. Central defender Lee opened the scoring in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free-kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung, but goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas saved to send the ball onto the roof of the net. The second half carried on where the first finished off, and it was no surprise when Park Ji-Sung added a second goal after 52 minutes. Latching on to a mistake made by Loukas Vyntra, the Manchester United midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless Tzorvas. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute, but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display. Moments later, Lee Chung-Young nearly added a third for South Korea at the other end. The result means Greece continue their winless World Cup finals record. Their only other appearance in 1994 yielded no goals and no points.","Argentina beat Nigeria 1-0 in their World Cup Group B opener at Ellis Park .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Kristie Lu Stout zips all around the globe on assignment for CNN, but she doesn't have to go far to enjoy first-class cuisine, gaze at a world-famous skyline or walk the streets of a beautiful metropolis. Lu Stout makes her home in Hong Kong, China, a city as stunning by day as it is by night -- and memorable for its harbor, shiny skyscrapers and ""unique blends of Eastern and Western traditions,"" in the words of the Hong Kong Tourism Board. About 7 million people live in Hong Kong and about four times as many visited the city last year. If you're going for the first time or returning for another visit, Lu Stout offered the following tips about her favorite Hong Kong spots. Where can you get the best view of the city? On a clear day, the Peak Morning Trail. Just walk 15 minutes around the bend from the Peak Terminal. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Chesa at the Peninsula for its classic Swiss fondue and dark chocolate mousse with Gruyere cream. (It's a bit more romantic than the dive that serves my other favorite comfort food -- squid ball noodle soup.) Where is the best place to people watch? Ride the subway. Just take a seat on any MTR train (which is always clean and efficient), plug in your earbuds, and watch Hong Kong commute away. What is your favorite neighborhood? Wanchai. Yes, it's Suzie Wong's old 'hood. But step away from the red light district and toward the Ship Street area where to find a fabulous mix of old heritage buildings and new structures. How do tourists stick out and what's the best way to blend in? Want to blend in? Lose the slow gait and stop staring at the skyscrapers. Walk quickly and look straight ahead. What's the biggest misconception about Hong Kong? That Hong Kong is just a city of concrete and steel ... when it has vast areas of natural beauty in its many country parks. Where do you go to relax? The Foreign Correspondents Club for its high ceilings and colonial ambience, comfort food, and extensive selection of magazines and newspapers from all over the world. It's members only, so have a friend get you in. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? Have a walk around the interlinked Hong Kong Land buildings in Central to have an idea of just how convenient Hong Kong is. This is a place literally engineered for high productivity and maximum efficiency. (And you can pick up a few gifts while you're at it -- a vintage print at Picture This in Prince's Building and a Chinese tunic at Blanc de Chine in the Landmark.) What's the biggest tourist trap? Electronics stores in Tsim Sha Tsui. Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? Take the Star Ferry. Be sure to board the ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central at night, that way you can enjoy the dramatic Hong Kong skyline in its full neon glory. It's only a 10-minute journey, but it's one the world's greatest rides. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? A dinner of organic Hong Kong village cuisine at Yin Yang, followed by drinks at The Pawn. It's a former pawn shop that dates back to the 1900s that now houses an excellent bar and restaurant. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Typhoon Shelter Crab at Hee Kee, Michelin-starred dim sum at the Four Seasons, egg tarts at Tai Cheong Bakery, and Hong Kong milk tea gelato at XTC. What is a good local souvenir? For the ladies, get your cheong sam made. A slender, form-fitting gown with a high collar -- a silk cheong sam is classic Hong Kong haute couture. Shanghai Tang offers on-site tailoring.","Hong Kong has vast areas of natural beauty in its many country parks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Who is Kim Jong Il, leader of the most secretive country in the world, rooting for in this year's World Cup? Chollima, of course. That translates to ""mythical horse."" And it's the nickname of the North Korean team. The team is as mysterious as the Communist country it represents. It practices in secret and it remains sequestered from other teams in South Africa before games. If Kim Jong Il refuses to play political ball with the rest of the world, should the rest of the world allow North Korea to play soccer in the World Cup? Popular belief dictates that a rogue nation like North Korea should be punished and isolated. But North Korea is crazy about soccer, its top sport and a source of national pride. Banning the country's team when it is eligible for the world's most popular championship series would bring global shame. The U.S. government says: ""Play On."" ""This is a tournament where countries have national teams and they compete for the right to play. And North Korea has survived the, you know, the qualifying competition,"" said P.J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman. FIFA, the soccer's governing body, does not like to mix politics and sport, said Paul B. Stares, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As far as I'm aware, they have never suspended a national team because of the policies or human rights record of the national government, but rather because of political interference by that government in the selection [or] running of the team,"" Stares said. He said South Africa was banned during the apartheid era because the national team was not integrated. ""To make an example of one team would immediately raise questions about another and they just don't want to go down that road,"" he said. Cutting broadcasts of the games could be another option, but China's state-run TV stations would probably step in to help North Korea get a television signal, Stares said. And a more subtle and potentially effective way to shame the country's leadership is to allow the team to play and let the North Korean people watch, giving North Koreans -- and billions of viewers worldwide -- a first-hand glimpse of condemnation of their country. ""No one likes to see innocent players be punished for the sins of their government,"" Stares said. ""Neither is it desirable for the poor citizens of North Korea to be denied one of the few pleasures they have in watching their national team. However the World Cup is a huge global stage to embarrass and shame the North Korea regime for its recent actions."" Last year, Iranian players wore green -- the color of the opposition movement -- wrist bands in a World Cup qualifying game to show support for anti-government protesters. ""This [wristbands protests] would be difficult for censors to hide from those able to watch, particularly the elites with access to TV and international media,"" Stares said. Even in the world of soccer, where fans know endless details about individual players, virtually nobody knows any of the North Korean squad. But Chollima has three players attracting attention, according to a team report by CNN's sister publication TIME magazine. Forward Hong Yong Jo, good enough to play in Russia when not playing for his home team, is considered the man to watch. Striker Jong Tae Se, and midfielder Mun In Guk, are the ""glue"" of the team. And the man who would get the least envy if the team does not fare well? Manager Kim-Jong Hun. The North Koreans entered the competition as the lowest qualifier, and expectations are low. But the team is well known for its surprise performance in 1966. The Korean War had ended and Vietnam was raging while the United States and the Soviet Union were racing to space and trying to outdo each other in the nuclear arms race. North Korea was already an isolated state run by the late Kin Il-sung, though it was hardly the security threat it is considered to be today. That year, North Korea went further than anybody had expected. They even surprised dominant Italy, beating them to make it to the quarter final. Today the country is so secretive that virtually nobody, including U.S. intelligence agencies, really knows what goes on inside its borders. That includes how its soccer team will do. Even the team's jersey is hard to find in stores because nobody really has the rights to make and sell them, according to news reports. So why the hype around Chollima? The team provides a rare window into its country. Not many people see North Koreans on a day-to-day basis. When the team takes to the field it will be the first chance for many people to see North Koreans up close and personal. Chollima's chances of winning might be as mythical as the horse of their name. But the one thing North Korea has managed to do -- both on and off the field -- is surprise the world. And this World Cup may be no exception.","North Korean team is as mysterious as the Communist country .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Andrew has denied knowing anything about his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson's alleged offer to an undercover tabloid newspaper reporter to sell access to Queen Elizabeth's second son for £500,000 ($723,000). His comments came after News of the World posted a video on its Web site Sunday that appears to show Ferguson accepting money from an undercover reporter in exchange for an introduction to Prince Andrew. Ferguson is also filmed on hidden camera telling the reporter -- who was posing as a wealthy businessman -- that a payment of £500,000 ""opens doors"" to Andrew. She then shakes hands with the reporter after he accepts the deal. On Monday the royal family moved quickly to distance itself from Ferguson, who has never been far from the headlines since she married Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, in 1986. The couple separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. ""The Duke of York categorically denies any knowledge of any meeting or conversation between the Duchess of York and the News of the World journalist,"" Buckingham Palace said. Prince Andrew has carried out his role as a British trade envoy since 2001 ""with complete and absolute propriety and integrity,"" the palace said. In a statement issued Sunday, Ferguson, 50, apologized for the incident. ""I very deeply regret the situation and the embarrassment caused,"" the statement said. ""It is true that my financial situation is under stress, however, that is no excuse for a serious lapse in judgment and I am very sorry that this has happened."" The tabloid said its reporter and Ferguson met on two occasions, once in New York and another time in London. Read more about Ferguson . In the heavily edited, roughly four-minute video, Ferguson appears to accept $40,000 as a down payment for a meeting with Andrew, then later discusses a wire transfer of the larger sum. ""If we want to do a big deal with Andrew, then that's the big one,"" she says. When asked how she would receive the £500,000, she tells the reporter, ""You send it to the bank account that I tell you to send it to."" ""Then that, is then like you open up all the channels whatever you need, whatever you want ... and then you meet Andrew and that's fine. And that's ... when you really open up whatever you want. But then that opens up everything that ever you would ever wish."" The tabloid said Prince Andrew, 50, who has been the UK's special representative for international trade and business since 2001, was not aware of the deal. In the video, Ferguson tells the reporter that Andrew ""never does accept a penny for anything. ... He does not and will not and he is completely whiter than white."" In her statement Sunday, Ferguson confirmed Andrew ""was not aware or involved in any of the discussions that occurred. ... The duke has made a significant contribution to his business role over the last 10 years and has always acted with complete integrity.""

"(CNN) -- Serge Betsen has told CNN he is ready to step out of international retirement and help France's charge for the Rugby World Cup in 2011. The experienced flanker won 63 caps for his country over a ten-year period before he announced he was quitting the game in January 2008. He was subsequently tempted out of retirement by English Premiership club London Wasps soon after and has just extended his contract at the club until next year. Now he has told CNN that he hasn't ruled out an emotional comeback for what would be his third World Cup, under current coach Marc Lievremont. He said: ""Why not? When I see my teammates like Simon Shaw and Joe Worsley who are still playing for the England team, yes, I would like to but ask Marc Lievremont."" The 35-year-old says he has been impressed with France's Six Nations campaign in which they sealed their first Grand Slam since 2004. He told CNN: ""France started very well in the Six Nations and game after game they built a very strong team. Marc Lievremont deserves this title. ""The team for the next World Cup is ready to go to New Zealand and try to reach for the trophy."" France edged past England in the climax of their Six Nations campaign but Betsen says the World Cup would be a totally different prospect. He should know -- Betsen's two World Cup experiences as a player ended in defeat to England. He said: ""Like always at the end of a big, big meeting like the World Cup England will be there. ""That's my concern about the French team because I played twice against England for my two World Cup's and twice again I was beaten by this team. We need to be focused as a team for the next World Cup.""","Serge Betsen tells CNN he is considering coming out of international retirement .

"(CNN) -- South Africa will host the FIFA World Cup in June and July, and Cape Town's gleaming new Green Point Stadium is one of the two semifinal venues for the quadrennial soccer championship. Cape Town sits at sea level at the foot of Table Mountain on the Cape of Good Hope. Its most significant historical landmark may be the notorious Robben Island prison. Kim Norgaard, CNN's bureau chief in Johannesburg spent the early part of his life in Cape Town before moving overseas. ""I try to get back to the 'Mother City' as often as I can,"" Norgaard said. Where can you get the best view of the city? Cape Town is blessed with amazing views -- you can either see the ocean, the iconic mountain or what is called the City Bowl from most areas. Just take your pick depending on the weather and wind. The most stunning is always from the top of Table Mountain on a clear day or atop Signal Hill looking down at the City Bowl. From both spots you can see Nelson Mandela's prison, Robben Island, and get a real sense of being at the tip of Africa. Further south and you are in Antarctica. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Cape Town is Africa's gourmet hotspot as the best vineyards this country offers are within an hour's drive. Staying in Cape Town, my favorite special occasion restaurant is La Colombe at the Constantia Uitsig winery. There is also a more casual River Café at the winery ideal for a lazy lunch and wine sampling. If in the wine country, my personal favorite is Le Quartier Francais in Franschhoek. This restaurant continues to receive awards as one of the best in the world. For a more relaxed dinner or lunch, try Wakame in Mouille Point. Just sit and watch the sun set over the Atlantic while enjoying local seafood and white wine. Doesn't get better than this. Where is the best place to people watch? If you want to look at tourists go to the V&A Waterfront. But if you want to see the locals, with all their blemishes, hang out at Hout Bay waterfront or Long Street in the city. What is your favorite neighborhood? Anywhere within the City Bowl. The mountain always looms behind and the sea in front. Melissa's in Kloof Street is a great neighborhood spot for lunch and people watching. How do tourists stick out and what's the best way to blend in? They are unprepared for Cape Town's changing weather. Winter is cold, rainy and windy. Summer evenings can be brisk and chilly. So always come with a good variety of clothes. Otherwise you might be that tourist freezing in his flip-flops, T-shirts and shorts. What's the biggest misconception about your city? That somehow Africa is backwards. Cape Town has the most amazing contemporary art scene and some of the greatest modern designers. It is a hub of creativity. Don't just get stuck buying cheap tribal masks. Instead, go to Woodstock and explore the original designs at the Haldane Martin, Gregor Jenkin or Whatiftheworld studios. Where do you go to relax? Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens and Constantia just around the corner. There are many botanical gardens but nothing quite like Kirstenbosch. If you just want to walk, have a picnic, listen to a concert or just enjoy life in the southern tip of Africa, this is the place. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? Go for a drive and really enjoy the majestic scenery that the city offers. From the airport drive through the city, enjoy the mountain looming over it and head over to Camps Bay. With the Atlantic Ocean on your right drive past Llandudno and then all the way to Hout Bay. Now you are looking at the Indian Ocean. From there take the inland route through Constantia -- a suburb that is home to some of Africa's oldest vineyards. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? The V&A Waterfront is just another shopping mall but in an amazing location. However, you need to go there to take the ferry to Robben Island. Visiting the prison on this island where Nelson Mandela spent many years is a must to understanding where this country has come from. Just make sure you book ahead of time. Where was your most memorable meal? At the Cellar Restaurant at the Haute Cabriere wine estate in Franschhoek. Every meal was matched to one of their wines and the lunch lasted for hours. I can't quite remember what was paired with our desert or receiving the bill but it a memorable meal nonetheless. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Go to one of the great restaurants and then head home to enjoy one of the cities many boutique hotels. My personal favorite is a small bed and breakfast, run by a British couple, called twentytwo. Sitting in the hip lounge for a nightcap after a dinner is special. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? The local wines. Klein Constantia has always been one of my favorite vineyards as they consistently deliver great quality. Also, it is always a sentimental visit for me as I grew up nearby. What is a good local souvenir? If you want a really memorable souvenir that isn't a wooden giraffe, go for good local design such as a Haldane Martin ostrich feather lamp or Zulu Mama chair. A great place to find other locally produced art is the Cape Craft and Design project by the city. They can direct you to the unique local designers.","La Colombe at the Constantia Uitsig winery is ideal for a special occasion .

"(CNNMoney.com) -- Is it possible to retire by 50 with an income under $60,000? Ryan and Hope Wells think so. Hope and Ryan Wells, who make a combined $56,000 per year, want to retire early with more than $2 million. Married since 2005, the young Arkansas couple is just starting out. Ryan, 25, works as a used car salesman, and Hope, 23, works as a medical billing coder at a hospital. Together they earn an annual $56,000 -- above the national average, yet still not exactly easy street in today's economy. But with a little discipline, they think they can meet their goal of an early retirement. ""I feel pretty comfortable with a target of a little over $2 million,"" Ryan says. It may sound ambitious, but the Wellses have a plan: put roughly 10% of their earnings toward retirement, 10 percent toward bills, 30 percent toward debt reduction, 15 percent into taxable mutual funds, and 35 percent to daily expenses and emergency savings. The Wellses have a lot going for their finances. They're young and have no kids yet. They live in Pottsville, Arkansas, an area that has one of the lowest costs of living in the country. And they're aggressive investors for their age, currently putting $530 per month into stock-only mutual funds. ""Right now, I am really trying to build a strong foundation in our portfolio so that when children or anything else comes along, we are in a very strong position,"" Ryan said. But their financial picture isn't all rosy. Like many American families, they're saddled with credit card debt: about $4,500. But they continually roll their balances onto new zero percent APR promotional credit cards to avoid paying interest. They plan on making steady payments of $100 a month and paying off their debt in less than four years. They bought a one-year-old used Ford Mustang for $19,000 about four months ago and put monthly payments of $330 toward the $17,500 left on the loan. Ryan and Hope think they'll be ready to start a family in about five years, but haven't yet started planning for kids. Meanwhile, they're working to pay off Hope's student loans, which total $5,500. For the more distant future, Ryan maxes out his IRA, which currently stands at about $22,000. His job doesn't offer a 401(k) plan, but Hope has access to a company-sponsored plan through the hospital. She only contributes the 2 percent that her employer matches, but sometime in the near future she expects a promotion that could nearly double her salary. When her salary increases, she will also max out her retirement contribution. ""We each have some room to grow based on income potential,"" said Ryan, who has fairly steady pay despite earning his entire salary on commission from car sales. Ryan and Hope say their priority now is to replenish their emergency fund, which they recently depleted to pay down some debt, as the promotional period on one credit card was ending. They would like to get their savings up to about $10,000, or six months of expenses. Our expert's take . With their current plan, Ryan and Hope are on their way to millionaire status, but maybe not as soon as they'd like, according to Diana DeCharles, a Certified Financial Planner with AIG Financial Advisors. She says that even with an aggressive 9 percent to 10 percent annual return on their investments, the Wellses will be worth about $1.3 million at age 50 -- no small sum, but probably not enough to retire so young. And that's at their current rate of savings, without any children in the picture. ""Kids are pretty expensive,"" DeCharles points out. Between higher costs and education savings, they might have to pull back on their aggressive saving once they have children. DeCharles believes that the Wellses are smart to prioritize their emergency savings, which she recommends they keep in a money market fund with no stock exposure. ""Forget the funds for now,"" DeCharles said. ""Especially with the market heading down, they have to build up their cash reserves first."" She also thinks the Wellses are managing their debt well, but they should be wary of opening too many cards. ""Although they are moving their balances to new cards with zero percent interest, if they continue to open new cards to do this they are bringing their credit score down,"" she said. ""Their credit score will take a hit for having cards that are maxed out, getting inquiry hits, and opening new cards."" To save up, she suggests the Wellses cut into their monthly entertainment expenses. ""Cook at home, or get movies from the library -- they're free!"" said DeCharles. But overall, DeCharles thinks Ryan and Hope are in a good position, even if they can't retire by 50. ""They're doing pretty good, frankly. They did pretty well with their home, and it's great that they're saving so much."" E-mail to a friend .","Ryan and Hope Wells hope ambitious financial plan will make them millions .

"(CNN) -- France have won the Six Nations rugby title for the first time since 2007 following defending champions Ireland's shock home defeat to Scotland on Saturday. The Irish needed to win by a big margin and then see Les Bleus handsomely defeated by England in the evening match to have a chance of retaining their crown. However, Scotland spoiled any hopes of a tense finale by snatching a 23-20 victory in the last rugby union match to be held at Dublin's Croke Park as Dan Parks kicked a last-minute penalty for a personal haul of 18 points. France then defeated Martin Johnson's much-criticized England team 12-10 in Paris to end the tournament with five wins from five, clinching their first such Grand Slam since 2004. England led with a sixth-minute try from Ben Foden, but France built a 12-7 halftime advantage thanks to three penalties from Morgan Parra and a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc. Jonny Wilkinson, dropped to the bench for only the third time in his 12-year career but brought on as a replacement for center Riki Flutey, kicked the only points of the second half. Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll scored an 11th minute try to give his side a perfect start, but Scotland moved into a 17-7 lead thanks to a try from No. 8 James Beattie and three penalties and a drop-goal from Parks. Tommy Bowe crossed for a controversial try to put Ireland level, awarded with 16 minutes to play despite appearing not to properly ground the ball, but Parks held his nerve to give the visitors their first win of the tournament. Scotland's victory, coming after last weekend's 15-15 draw with England, condemned Italy to bottom place. Wales finished fourth for the second year in a row after beating the Italians 33-10 in Cardiff earlier on Saturday, with center James Hook scoring two tries.","France win the Six Nations rugby title for the first time since 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Entrepreneur and media mogul Jimmy Lai is not afraid of a challenge. He took on Hong Kong media barons to set up his publishing company in 1981 and provoked the wrath of the Chinese government when he spoke out against the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown against pro-democracy protesters. On topics ranging from China to the economic crisis, Jimmy Lai opened up to CNN's Talk Asia. Despite taking on such formidable opponents, he continues to run a successful publishing company in Hong Kong and Taiwan and remains outspoken defender of a free press and freedom of speech. ""I think when you are not free you don't have dignity. And to me it's not a political issue whether you have democracy or what, it's a moral issue,"" he told CNN from his offices in Hong Kong. These days the Chinese Government tend to turn a blind eye to Jimmy Lai, but his criticism of them post Tiananmen -- calling then prime minister Li Peng a ""turtle's egg"" (an unpleasant insult in China) in an editorial -- precipitated his downfall in the clothing business. After the controversy he had to sell his stake in Giordano, the clothing company he set up in 1975 or risk the closure of all his shops in mainland China. It cost him millions in lost business opportunities. He's suffered other business failures; a shopping web site set up during the first dot.com boom was one of a number of causalities when the bubble burst. Lai, however, remains philosophical about money. ""I think I'm a bit different to other people because I'm actually from a very rich family so I had the riches, I had the sense of it. I was never insecure about money. I was very poor, but I never felt sorry."" Hailing from southern China, Lai's family was wealthy but marginalized by the communist government. After working as a railway porter boy, Lai dabbled in the black market before being smuggled into Hong Kong when just 12 years old, taking a job as a child laborer and earning just over $1 a month. ""You know I was free. I was full of hope. When I saw people in a Rolls Royce, in a Mercedes Benz, there was no envy, there was no jealousy, there was just hope that one day I was the one that will sit there,"" he told CNN. ""You know the opportunity is there. You know that it is open for you. That was a wonderful society. You know that if you try hard, you will get it."" Lai's can-do attitude and the heady free-market environment have proved to be a winning combination. However, Lai insists that freedom to make money is not the only thing that inspires him to run his publishing company. He remains politically aware and often an outspoken critic of China at a time when many try a more diplomatic policy of engagement. ""It's the dictatorship that rubs me up the wrong way. It's the freedom that we, the Chinese people, are not allowed to flourish. I think when you are not free you don't have dignity. And to me it's not a political issue whether you have democracy or what, it's a moral issue,"" he said. Optimistic, determined, sometimes contrary, Lai is committed to pursuing his business interests in Hong Kong and Taiwan, as both value the freedom of press. He believes Taiwan will be a ""very powerful catalyst that will change China"". ""In China you have a vacuum of moral infrastructure...It's just the free market and the government. So if the market fail and the government is dragging down with it, what is hold the whole society up?"" he said. ""I think if China has to make decisions to take measures which are so painful, without the mandate of the people they can't do it. That will be the beginning of a new China. China will have to go through a political restructuring.""","Lai is a Hong Kong publishing tycoon and outspoken pro-democracy campaigner .

"(CNN) -- A rare letter evincing a display of affection between President Theodore Roosevelt and his youngest son is up for sale by a dealer who obtained it from a Roosevelt family friend. Roosevelt sent the letter to his 6-year-old son, Quentin, during a trip to Yellowstone National Park in 1903. It is the only letter from the trip to his family to reach the market, and its existence was unknown to scholars and institutions until its discovery in the possession of a family friend, said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection, which is selling the letter through its Web site. ""The relationship between Theodore Roosevelt and Quentin, his favorite son, is not one many people know about, so finding a letter like this to Quentin is a once in a lifetime discovery made even more poignant by the fact that it's unpublished,"" said Raab, who values the letter at $25,000. In the letter, Roosevelt addresses his son by his nickname, ""Quenty-Quee,"" and provides a brief glimpse into life on the trail, including a small sketch of the mule that carried his gear on the trip. ""I love you very much. Here is a picture of the mule that carries, among other things, my bag of clothes. There are about twenty mules in the pack train. They all follow one another in single file up and down mountain paths and across streams."" The letter is signed, ""Your loving father."" Share the most treasured letter you ever received . Raab said, ""This offers another side of Theodore Roosevelt, who was this rough rider, men's man, yet had this warm, loving affectionate, relationship with a son, who shared a lot of his father's physical and intellectual attributes. He was the apple of Theodore Roosevelt's eye."" Quentin Roosevelt, the youngest of Edith and Theodore Roosevelt's six children, was 3 years old when his father was elected president. He was known for his rambunctious behavior in the White House and eventually for his scholastic aptitude, drawing comparisons to his father. He joined the United States Army Air Service and became a fighter pilot during World War I at the nudging of his father, an ardent promoter of the war. He was killed in aerial combat over France when he was 20. His death profoundly affected the president, Raab said. ""His friends said he was never the same man again, and you see the love he had for his son in this letter,"" Raab said.","Letter to 6-year-old son Quentin shows affectionate side of President Roosevelt .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal battled hard to overcome Roger Federer's conqueror and give himself a chance of a record-equaling 17th Masters 1000 tournament title in Italy. The Spaniard dropped his first set on clay this season before defeating young Latvian outsider Ernests Gulbis 6-4 3-6 6-4 in Saturday's semifinals in Rome. World No. 3 Nadal can move ahead of Federer and join American legend Andre Agassi in the all-time Masters list if he beats compatriot David Ferrer in Sunday's final. Gulbis, who will rise six places in the world rankings to 34th next week, gave himself every chance of repeating his shock second-round win over No. 1 Federer as he blasted 50 winners to Nadal's 18, firing 13 aces to none. But the 21-year-old paid the price for making 56 unforced errors against the defending champion's 23. Nadal, who won three successive titles in Rome from 2005, will seek to match the mark set by Agassi in 2004. He has not lost to Ferrer since the 2007 season-ending Masters Cup, and has a 10-3 advantage in career meetings. Whoever wins, Spain is guaranteed an eighth victory in 10 years at the event, which was known as the Italian Open until 2002. Ferrer earlier reached his first Masters final with a 7-5 6-3 win over compatriot Fernando Verdasco, avenging his defeat to the sixth seed in last weekend's semifinals in Barcelona. Verdasco was unable to repeat his fine showing from Friday's energy-sapping three-hour victory over world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, last year's runner-up, as he faded after taking a 5-1 lead in the opening set. The world No. 9 had won 12 of his past 13 matches on clay, losing to Nadal in the final in Monte Carlo last month. ""Until 5-1 things were going okay for me and also he wasn't playing his best and made some mistakes,"" Verdasco told the ATP Tour Web site. ""Later, perhaps he saw that I was tired, not from 5-1 but since I got up this morning. ""The match yesterday was long and very physical against Novak and I was feeling good mentally but my body wasn't feeling the same as before, so I was slower and with less power. I was making mistakes and I wasn't playing a good game."" Meanwhile, Belgian comeback queen Justine Henin will face Samantha Stosur in the final of the women's Stuttgart Grand Prix on Sunday. Henin, the 2007 champion, is seeking her first title since ending her 18-month retirement in January. The former world No. 1 cruised to a 6-3 6-2 semifinal win over Israel's Shahar Peer, who on Friday knocked out third-ranked Dinara Safina. She reached the 60th WTA Tour final of her career as she spoiled Peer's 23rd birthday celebrations before fellow wildcard Stosur continued her fine run on clay with a 7-5 6-3 win over Russian qualifier Anna Lapushchenkova. The Australian is unbeaten in 11 matches on the surface after winning the Family Circle Cup in Charleston in the United States and then winning both rubbers on Fed Cup duty against Ukraine.","Rafael Nadal seeks to equal Andre Agassi's record of 17 Masters 1000 tournament titles .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Roger Federer overcame an early scare to reach the semifinals of the Estoril Open in Portugal on Friday, but second-ranked Novak Djokovic's defense of his Serbia Open title was ended by health problems. Federer was broken in the first game by French veteran Arnaud Clement but bounced back to win 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 as he continues his build-up to the French Open, which he won last year. Djokovic's own hopes on the red clay of Roland Garros seem less positive after he was forced to retire having lost the first set of his quarterfinal 6-4 against young compatriot Filip Krajinovic at his home event in Belgrade. The top seed has been struggling all week with allergy problems and fatigue, according to his personal Web site. Federer is on track to win back the title he claimed on his only other appearance at Estoril in 2008, but admitted he was not yet at his best ahead of Saturday's semifinal clash with defending champion Albert Montanes. The Swiss star, who is closing on Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks at No. 1, needed to save a set-point at 6-5 in the tie-break. ""I didn't play beautiful tennis. I had to play safe, which isn't something I'm used to doing. I have always struggled against him and today you could see that,"" Federer told the ATP Tour Web site. Fourth-seeded Spaniard Montanes moved into the last four by beating Uruguayan eight seed Pablo Cuevas 6-4 6-3. He has lost all three previous encounters with Federer, two of them on clay. In the other semifinal, fifth seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez takes on world No. 133 Frederico Gil, having progressed when fellow Spaniard Alberto Martini retired due to illness. Gil went through after beating compatriot Rui Machado 4-6 7-6 (7-1) 6-3 in the first all-Portuguese quarterfinal at an ATP World Tour tournament. The 18-year-old Krajinovic, a wildcard entry, will play American third seed Sam Querrey for a place in the Belgrade final. Querrey defeated Russian Igor Andreev 6-3 2-6 6-4 to reach his fourth semifinal this season. The winner of that match will play either big-serving American second seed John Isner or Swiss No. 4 Stanislas Wawrinka. In Munich, top seed Marin Cilic reached the semifinals of the BMW Open by beating sixth-seeded Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 6-2. The Croatian world No. 11 will next play fifth seed Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, who beat 2007 champion Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4. Second seed Mikhail Youzhny, the runner-up for the past two years, also moved into the semis with a 6-1 6-3 win over Czech Jan Hajek. The Russian will next face world No. 45 Philipp Petzschner, who upset defending champion and third seed Tomas Berdych 1-6 6-3 6-4.","World No. 1 Roger Federer reaches semifinals of Estoril Open in Portugal .

"(CNN) -- Jonny Wilkinson's international rugby career could be coming to a close after the former World Cup hero was dropped by England for Saturday's Six Nations finale against title hopefuls France. The fly-half was widely regarded as the planet's best player after kicking England to glory at the 2003 World Cup, but has been almost as largely vilified this year due to his team's uninspiring performances. The 30-year-old will be replaced by Toby Flood in Paris, having been dropped for only the third time in his England career. Wilkinson went off after a heavy blow to the head against Scotland last weekend, when Flood made a big impression after coming on as a substitute to earn England a 15-15 draw. The result ended England's slim title hopes. Wilkinson has been passed fit to take his place on the bench against the French, who have won all four games so far and would need to suffer a heavy defeat to allow Ireland to retain the title. England coach Martin Johnson, the team's captain in 2003, said he was happy to give the 24-year-old Flood a starting chance. ""Jonny took a number of bangs and heavy blows. We need at least two players in every position and we would have been happy to pick Toby in every game so far,"" he told the UK Press Association. Wilkinson's career has been blighted by injuries since 2003, and his failure to regain his form as England's influential playmaker in this year's Six Nations tournament means he will struggle to feature at the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2011. Younger players such as Flood are likely to be given their chance to shine in the November internationals against Australia, Samoa, South Africa and New Zealand. Johnson has made six changes for Saturday's game, with captain Steve Borthwick named in the squad despite being in doubt with a knee injury. Winger Chris Ashton will make his debut in a backline that sees veteran World Cup winner Mike Tindall recalled at center and Ben Foden start at fullback, with Delon Armitage dropped from the squad. Lock Simon Shaw returns from injury, while flanker Lewis Moody starts in place of James Haskell. France welcome back center Mathieu Bastareaud, with David Marty making way despite scoring two tries in last weekend's win against Italy. The French have not beaten England since the 2006 Six Nations, losing in the World Cup semifinal in 2007 and then again in Paris the following year before another defeat at Twickenham 12 months ago. Les Bleus have not won the championship since 2007, which was their second in a row. In Saturday's other matches, Wales host Italy and then Ireland take on Scotland in Dublin before the Paris match starts.","Former World Cup hero Jonny Wilkinson dropped by England for clash with France .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A jailed Italian mobster claims he can prove American student Amanda Knox, her former boyfriend and a drifter are innocent of murdering Knox's British roommate because he knows who the real killer is -- his brother. Luciano Aviello, 41, made the statement during a videotaped interview with Knox's lawyers. He said he had tried to write the Italian court several times to say that Knox and the others were innocent, but no one ever contacted him, defense and prosecution officials said. A source close to the case tells CNN that Aviello, who has been in and out of prison since age 17, was out of prison, living down the street from Knox and Meredith Kercher and under a ""protection program"" at the time of the murder. Aviello is serving 17 years in an Italian prison because of his association with the Camorra crime family. According to Italian media reports and Britain's Daily Mail, he has testified against the mob at several trials, always from behind a screen to shield his identity. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, were found guilty in December 2009 of Kercher's murder and are serving sentences of 26 and 25 years, respectively. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, plead guilty to the murder and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. In March, Aviello contacted Knox's attorneys, who visited him in prison to learn more about his story. Aviello told Knox's lawyers during the videotaped interviews that his brother, who was staying with him at the time of Kercher's murder, came home one night and said he had killed a girl during a botched robbery. British and Italian media have reported the brother's whereabouts are unknown and neither the lawyers for Knox nor the prosecution would comment further. ""When he came to my house he had a bloodstained jacket on and was carrying a flick knife. He said he had broken into a house and killed a girl and then he had run away,"" Aviello said in his statement. Originally from Naples, Aviello says he was living in Perugia at the time of the attack. ""I know [he was involved] because my brother confessed to me that he had killed Meredith and he asked me to hide a blood-stained knife and set of keys,"" he said, according to an attachment to Knox's appeal documents. Aviello told the lawyers that his brother said he and an Albanian man broke into the house and found ""the poor English girl,"" Kercher, ""who started screaming like mad"" The brother ""stabbed her in the throat then he tried to stifle her screams,"" Aviello said. ""Meredith defended herself like mad, scratching and hitting out at him."" Aviello said he can prove Knox's innocence and his brother's involvement because of evidence he buried at his home. ""I had everything under a little wall behind my house,"" he said. ""I am happy to stand up in court and confirm all this and wrote to the court several times to tell them but was never questioned."" Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who led the case against Knox and Sollecito, told British and Italian media that Aviello's claims were irrelevant since the court already deemed him not credible and didn't interview him. See the evidence presented in the Knox case . Mignini told CNN on Thursday he couldn't comment much on Aviello's assertions because ""we need to verify his claims, in general, all of what he is saying."" Mignini said he has not yet interviewed Aviello, but will begin looking into his background as part of an investigation. That investigation will include checking out the burial of the key. Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he hopes a judge will allow Aviello to testify at Knox's appeal hearing, which is likely to take place in the fall. ""The court should have vetted the reliability of the person and the worthiness of his claims,"" Dalla Vedova said. ""We have posed again the same request to the appeals court. In filing an appeal, Dalla Vedova pointed to Aviello's letters to the courts, saying they show Knox was not able to present all the witnesses, and that may have influenced the verdict. Mignini disputed the claim. We ""can't simply investigate in the course of a trial every claim that comes up,"" Mignini told CNN. David Marriott, a lawyer for the Knox family, said that while they don't yet know whether Aviello's claim is valid, he feels it is only right that Knox get to air all the evidence in court. Even if the story isn't true, Knox and her lawyers should at least get the chance to investigate it and have his claims heard, Marriott said. ""The fact that the court didn't even decide to question him or at least look further into the claims is a part of what Amanda's appeal is all about,"" he said. ""We don't know the truth, but the court has the responsibility to check it out."" Marriott also said he thinks it's possible Aviello's statements weren't checked out because Italian police and prosecutors believed they already solved the case. ""There's no motivation I would guess for the police to actually pursue it,"" he said, when asked if the keys, clothing or knife Aviello claims were buried were ever dug up. ""In their minds not only is it over, but why would they investigate something that might show their initial investigation was faulty.""","Luciano Aviello says his brother told him he killed Meredith Kercher in botched robbery .

"(CNN) -- The governing body for Rugby Union in Wales has confirmed that international player Andy Powell has been dropped from the national side after police charged him with driving a golf cart while drunk. Powell was arrested just hours after helping Wales beat Scotland 31-24 in the Six Nations Championship at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, and now faces a court hearing in Cardiff on March 2. The 28-year-old back-row forward was stopped and breathalyzed by police in the early hours of Sunday morning at a highway rest stop close to the hotel where the Wales team were staying. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said in a statement: ""This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated in a professional, elite sporting environment and we have acted quickly and incisively in order to leave no ambiguity over the dim view we take of this situation."" Powell, who has won 14 caps for Wales and toured South Africa with the elite British and Irish Lions side, took part in a thrilling game against Scotland the day before in which Wales clinched a last-minute victory.

The WRU went on to say: ""The player has made his private apologies to the Welsh management team as well as apologizing in a public statement. ""We will now leave the [police] to conclude the matter."" Powell's agent Mike Burton told BBC Radio: ""Andy was disappointed and embarrassed to find himself in this position.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United will be without Wayne Rooney for Sunday's English Premier League clash with Blackburn, but manager Alex Ferguson expects the England striker to return from injury next weekend. Rooney made a shock comeback in Wednesday's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich, but had to go off with an hour to play after aggravating his ankle problem as United crashed out of Europe's top club tournament on away goals. Ferguson believes the injury is not serious and that Rooney will be fit for second-placed United's clash with local rivals Manchester City next Saturday. ""I don't think it's as serious as we said when he got the injury the first time, but I think he'll be ready for the City game,"" the Scot told reporters on Friday. ""We've got more time to work on it, anyway. Other than that, everyone else is fit."" Ferguson said he was ready to put faith in Dimitar Berbatov for the short trip to North-West rivals Blackburn, despite keeping the Bulgarian forward on the bench until the final 10 minutes of the 3-2 win against Bayern. ""Yes, I still trust him,"" Ferguson said. ""He is a good player and there is absolutely no reason why we should doubt that. ""Dimitar has done well in a lot of games recently but we prefer to play with one striker. When we got the man sent off on Wednesday there was no need to bring a striker on because all we were trying to do was go over the line in terms of defending."" Ferguson hinted that he will rotate his squad as United seek to win and move a point above leaders Chelsea, who take on Aston Villa in the semifinals of the FA Cup on Saturday. ""Given the nature of the game on Wednesday and the energy spent, we have to address the situation of freshness,"" he said. ""We've got a a squad to use -- we have the likes of Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville and we also have John O'Shea back now.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A CBS producer accused of trying to extort $2 million from ""Late Show"" host David Letterman pleaded not guilty Friday in a Manhattan courtroom. Robert Joel Halderman pleads not guilty Friday to first-degree attempted grand larceny. The producer, Robert Joel ""Joe"" Halderman, 51, of Norwalk, Connecticut, allegedly told Letterman last month that he would disclose Letterman's dalliances with his show's staffers unless he paid the money. Halderman is charged with first-degree attempted grand larceny. He has been suspended from his CBS job. Prosecutors at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court had sought $500,000 bail, calling Halderman a flight risk. ""The evidence is compelling,"" Assistant District Attorney Judy Salwen told the court. It shows that Halderman was trying to ""destroy"" Letterman's reputation and ""humiliate his family,"" she said.  Watch to learn more about Halderman » . ""The defendant was desperate and willing to do anything,"" Salwen added, saying Halderman was in debt. Defense attorney Gerald Shargel said his client has worked at CBS for 27 years and has two children, ages 11 and 18. After the arraignment, Shargel said he believed that Halderman would post the bond and said Halderman denies the allegations. Halderman was seen in a car pulling away from the courthouse after the hearing. ""This story is far more complicated than what you heard this afternoon,"" the lawyer said, without elaborating. ""It's not the open and shut case you just heard about."" Shargel said Halderman has ""an impeccable reputation"" and has never before been in trouble with the law. He said he expected to take the case to trial. Documents filed in Stamford Superior Court in Connecticut show that Halderman was required to pay about $6,800 a month in child and spousal support to his ex-wife. Prosecutors declined to say whether Halderman had financial problems or other motives. Earlier Friday, Shargel said he met with his client briefly at the jail. ""He is not dispirited,"" the lawyer said. ""We're prepared to fight this case."" Halderman told Letterman in a proposed script that his ""world was about to collapse around him"" unless he received $2 million, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said. The one-page ""screenplay treatment,"" which was attached to a letter, referred to Letterman's great professional success and his ""beautiful and loving son,"" Morgenthau said at a news conference. The contents of the letter were not revealed at the briefing. A screenplay treatment is similar to an outline. It describes the proposed plot and subplots, character interactions and tone of a story, such as a melodrama or romance. Letterman acknowledged on his show Thursday night that he'd had sexual relations with members of his staff and that he revealed those liaisons during grand jury testimony for a case involving an attempted extortion. A representative for Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants Inc., said Friday that the relationships Letterman referred to ""when discussing the matter on the Late Show predated his marriage"" to longtime partner Regina Lasko. The couple, who have been together since 1986, wed in March. They have a son, Harry, 5. Morgenthau said Letterman gave Halderman, a producer for the CBS news magazine ""48 Hours,"" a $2 million check Wednesday, and Halderman deposited it in a bank account in Connecticut. He was arrested Thursday outside CBS offices, the district attorney said. Halderman's uncle, Richard Smith, told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that he last spoke to his nephew late Tuesday. ""We could tell that he was slightly down,"" Smith said. ""He wasn't his normal, bubbly, cheerful self. He sounded very tired."" Smith described Halderman as a ""very loving individual"" who ""loved his job with CBS."" Halderman could face five to 15 years in prison if convicted. Morgenthau said the alleged extortion incidents were carried out between September 9 and September 30. According to the indictment, Halderman waited outside Letterman's Manhattan home at 6 a.m. September 9 to deliver the letter and other materials. Letterman said on his show that he saw the package when he went out to his car to leave for work. Halderman said he needed to ""make a large chunk of money"" by selling Letterman the ""screenplay treatment,"" Morgenthau said. The materials from Halderman also said Letterman's ""world was about to collapse around him"" if the information on his private life was unveiled, leading to a ""ruined reputation."" The letter asked Letterman to meet with Halderman that day to make a deal, Morgenthau said. He said Letterman, who had reported the alleged extortion to his attorney and the district attorney's office, met with Halderman several times. The last two meetings were audiotaped. ""The message of this indictment should be clear. New York City will not tolerate the coercion or extortion of anyone, be the victim rich or poor, famous or anonymous,"" Morgenthau said. ""The law prohibits conduct like the defendant's and attaches severe penalty to it. We intend to enforce the law."" Letterman told his audience that he testified before the grand jury Thursday, ""something I've never done in my life."" ""I had to go downtown to testify before the grand jury"" and ""tell them all of the creepy things that I've done,"" referring to his sexual dalliances.  Watch Letterman say he slept with members of his staff » . ""I have had sex with women who work on this show,"" he said. ""Would it be embarrassing if it were made public? Perhaps it would, especially for the women."" ""I feel like I need to protect these people; I need to certainly protect my family,"" Letterman said. ""I need to protect myself ... hope to protect my job."" ""It's been a very bizarre experience,"" Letterman said in closing. ""I don't plan to say much more about this.""

"(CNN)  -- Unfashionable Blackpool will be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea next season after beating Cardiff City 3-2 in the Championship playoff final at Wembley on Saturday. The club from a famous English seaside resort attract home attendances of less than 10,000 fans to their tiny ground and only sneaked into the playoffs on the final weekend of the regular season. But inspired by coach Ian Holloway, they fully deserved victory after a pulsating first half in which all five goals were scored. ""I'm so proud, not just for my team but for the area we come from,"" Holloway told Sky Sports. ""I cannot tell you what a difference this is going to make for the people in Blackpool. ""They're going to get so much money now from the Premier League. I can't put this into words. I'm bursting with pride."" Cardiff striker Michael Chopra gave them an early lead, but Blackpool's star player Charlie Adam equalized with a stunning free kick almost immediately. Despite having the vast majority of possession, Blackpool fell behind for a second time when Joe Ledley finished off a neat passing move. But the Seasiders quickly equalized again through Gary Taylor-Fletcher, who had hit the post just before heading the ball home after a corner. To end a frenetic half, veteran striker Brett Ormerod forced home what proved to be the winning goal. David Jones' men pushed hard for an equalizer after the break and Chopra hit the crossbar from outside the area while Ledley headed just wide, but Blackpool held on for a famous victory. The club are best known for their exploits in 1953 when the legendary Stanley Matthews inspired their victory in the FA Cup final. But backed by Lavtian millionaire Valeri Belokon, Blackpool have climbed from the third flight of English football to the elite in just four years and now stand to see their coffers boosted by £90 million ($130 million) in revenues from the lucrative Premier League. For this reason, the Championship playoff is often billed as the richest match in football.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's official supporters club is hoping the intervention of former chairman David Moores will hasten the departure of unpopular owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks. In a 3,155-word letter to the Times newspaper, Moores said he ""hugely regrets"" selling the English Premier League team to the American pair in 2007 and called on them to sell up as soon as possible. Under Hicks and Gillett, Liverpool's debts have spiraled to $507 million and the club's finances are further imperiled by the failure to qualify for next season's European Champions League. Hicks told Sky Sports News on Wednesday that they hope to sell the club by the end of the year. James McKenna, spokesperson for the ""Spriit of Shankly"" supporters club, said he hope Moores' letter will encourage the banks who have loaned money to the Americans to put pressure on their clients to sell. ""If the previous owner admits it's a mistake, and the fans all see it as a mistake then surely those who allow them to stay in control, like the Royal Bank of Scotland will realize that,"" McKenna told CNN. ""I think if anything it gives a bit more impetus to fans to ramp up the pressure on Hicks and Gillett. It is about time they walked away."" In his letter, Moores explained the checks that were run on the Americans before they were allowed to seize control, but admitted that more could have been done to investigate where their money was coming from. ""I call upon them now to stand back, accept their limitations as joint owners, acknowledge their role in the club's current demise, and stand aside, with dignity, to allow someone else to take up the challenge,"" Moores concluded. ""Don't punish the club's supporters any more - God knows they've taken enough."" McKenna described the Americans' reign as ""disastrous"" and said there was a real danger of the club falling to financial ruin, unless new backers are found soon. Portsmouth became the first Premier League club to enter administration last season. ""Once we fall out of the top four and we are not meeting the same revenues, how are we going to meet these interest repayments of £110,000 a day?"" he said. ""It simply isn't sustainable at the present time and it will become very quickly a real risk of administration if the situation worsens."" With Liverpool out of Europe's top competition and little money available for new recruits, the British media has speculated that manager Rafael Benitez will be forced to sell key players such as Spanish top scorer Fernando Torres and England midfielder Steven Gerrard. ""There's a real fear that players may be forced out because there's no investment,"" said McKenna. Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina and Javier Mascherano - world-class players like that need to be playing in a world-class team, challenging and winning honors year in year out."" Speaking to Sky, Hicks said the club was in ""healthy"" financial state and did not need to sell Gerrard or Torres.","Liverpool fans welcome former chairman David Moores' plea for owners to sell .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti has admitted he is resigned to manager Jose Mourinho leaving the club to join Real Madrid. Moratti invited Mourinho to dinner at his house on Monday night and tried to convince the Portuguese coach to stay in Italy. Mourinho steered Inter to the treble of Italian league, cup and European Champions League this season, but has been strongly linked with a move to the Spanish capital. ""There's always hope, but we also have to respect the wishes of someone who thinks he has fulfilled his duty,"" Moratti told Inter's Web site. ""The approach of the coach is that of someone who is already thinking of going to Real Madrid,"" he added in quotes carried by the UK Press Association. Mourinho, who previously coached Porto and English champions Chelsea, declined to comment on his future following the meeting with Moratti. ""The only thing that I can say is that I have enjoyed very much eating with my president. You always eat well at Moratti's house,"" he told PA. Meanwhile, former Inter player and coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has quit as coach of Catania, fueling speculation he could be in line to replace Mourinho at the San Siro. ""I hope to soon find a job which legitimizes my decision and my professional ambitions,"" the Serbian told Inter's Web site. Elsewhere, Jean Tigana has been named as the new coach of French Ligue 1 side Bordeaux.

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for Howard K. Stern says the longtime partner of late sex symbol Anna Nicole Smith will fight conspiracy charges announced Thursday. Krista Barth, an attorney for Howard K. Stern, says it's not appropriate to talk publicly about details of the case. Stern was Smith's ""chief enabler,"" obtaining a variety of prescription drugs to keep the former Playboy model sedated and compliant, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said in announcing the charges against Stern and two doctors. Lisa Bloom of In Session and guest host Joy Behar questioned Stern's attorney Krista Barth Friday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" BEHAR: Did Howard see this all coming? BARTH: No, we did not see this coming. We knew that there was obviously the raid earlier on Dr. [Sandeep] Kapoor's office. But this was something that we honestly never expected.  Watch part of the discussion » . BEHAR: Well, they are very serious charges. There are so many counts here, eight felonies. Will he plead not guilty? What's he going to do? BARTH: Well, he will plead not guilty because he is not guilty. BEHAR: Now, the attorney general, Jerry Brown, called Stern ""the principal enabler"" in what he says was a conspiracy among three individuals. Do you have a reaction to that? BARTH: I think it's reminiscent of what happened at Duke. I don't think that this was something that should have been stated in a public forum. I think it's contrary to the rules of professional conduct regarding trial publicity. And you have to wonder why such a statement was made. But to say that something like that would not bias my client is beyond me. I can't even be -- I can't even venture a guess. BLOOM: Krista, the difference, though, between the Duke case and this case is that we know that she had at least 11 different medications in her system, the very same medications that are in this criminal complaint. We know that she was taking these drugs for years. We saw her zoned out of her mind with the slurred speech on her reality show and every awards show. So it was pretty common knowledge that Anna Nicole was an addict. And I think your client has even admitted that. There's a substantial amount of evidence here. It doesn't mean your client is guilty. But I think it's enough to raise eyebrows so that ever since she's died, people have wondered: How did she get all of those medications? How was it possible that doctors were giving her all that stuff? BARTH: The most basic tenet of our judicial system is that Mr. Stern is presumed innocent. ... And the concern that I have is that the public nature of the statements by the attorney general in the state of California is a bit troubling. And when I make the analogy to the Duke case, I think you're missing the point, in that that was done during an election campaign. There are sometimes political motivations for things that are done. You have to ask why is this case important to so many when what Attorney General Brown is talking about is a pervasive, over-prescription of prescription drugs. BEHAR: How much responsibility do the tabloids have in this case? I mean, it really was all over the place. BLOOM: I think that's going to be part of the defense, that they got prescriptions under false names because the tabloids were after her and they wanted every detail and she wanted some privacy. And as a celebrity, she may be entitled to that. I think that may be a valid defense as to why they were under false names. But there's no defense that I can see why thousands of pills. BEHAR: Krista, where did she get thousands of pills? BARTH: Well, you know what? Discussing the details of this is not appropriate. I think that the most important thing to focus on here is the way that our judicial system is supposed to work. I mean how often does that happen, that we're talking about a situation, you are not supposed to say, and I'm quoting here, something that you know reasonably should,  or reasonably should know will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in this matter?","California attorney general's comments are prejudicial, lawyer says .

"OAKLAND, California (CNN) -- Richard Lee greets students, shopkeepers and tourists as he rolls his wheelchair down Broadway at the speed of a brisk jog, hailing them with, ""Hi. How ya doin'?"" Marijuana activist Richard Lee is a local celebrity in the small district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam. In this nine-block district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam, Lee is a celebrity. Oaksterdam is Lee's brainchild, a small pocket of urban renewal built on a thriving trade in medical marijuana. The district's name comes from a marriage of Oakland and Amsterdam, a city in the Netherlands renowned for its easy attitude toward sex and drugs. Lee is the founder of Oaksterdam University, which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana: how to grow it, how to market it, how to consume it. The school, which has a curriculum, classes and teachers, claims 3,500 graduates. Lee also owns a medical marijuana dispensary, a coffee house, a large indoor marijuana plantation, and a museum/store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana. ""I really see this as following the history of alcohol. The way prohibition was repealed there,"" Lee says, adding that he believes he is close to achieving his mission. Lee is organizing a petition drive to place a marijuana legalization measure on the ballot in 2010, and he thinks the measure stands a good chance of being approved by voters. A recent California Field Poll showed that more than half the people in the state, where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago, would approve of decriminalizing pot. The state's faltering economy is one reason why. If legalized, marijuana could become California's No. 1 cash crop. It could bring in an estimated $1 billion a year in state taxes. Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the California Assembly. He believes the state's need to increase tax revenues will work in his bill's favor. ""I think it's a seductive part of the equation,"" he says. Ammiano says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed, ""It could be a Walgreens, it could be a hospital, a medical marijuana facility, whatever could be convenient. Adequate enforcement of the rules. Nobody under 21. No driving under the influence."" Even California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, says legalizing marijuana deserves serious consideration. ""I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana,"" Schwarzenegger says. But Ammiano says selling a legalized marijuana bill to his fellow legislators remains a delicate matter. ""If we held the vote in the hallway, we'd have it done,"" Ammiano says. ""But people are necessarily cautious. They are up for re-election."" And that is why Lee believes voters will approve a marijuana initiative long before the state Assembly acts. Sitting under grow lights in a warehouse filled with hundreds of marijuana plants, Lee sums it up this way: ""For some people cannabis is like a religion. As passionate as some people are about their religions and freedom to think what they want and to worship as they want."" But all of that is baloney to Paul Chabot. He is president of the Coalition for a Drug Free California. He says voters should not be fooled by promises of big bucks flowing to the state from marijuana taxes. ""It's their way of sort of desensitizing our communities, our state and our nation to a drug problem that we clearly need to put our foot down on, and say, 'No more. Enough is enough.' "" Chabot points out that California's medical marijuana law has been poorly regulated, and he expects more of the same if marijuana becomes legalized for everyone. But a substantial number of Californians seem to believe that no amount of enforcement is going to make pot go away -- and that it's time for the state to begin taking a cut of the action.","Oaksterdam University specializes in how to grow, market and consume marijuana .

"(CNN) -- The final of the European Champions League will see two of the continent's giant clubs meet in the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, in a battle to decide the champions of the most lucrative competition in world soccer. The match, which takes place on 22 May, will also pitch two heavyweight coaches against one another in the shape of Portugal's Jose Mourinho and Holland's Louis Van Gaal. Mourinho, who won the European Cup with Porto in 2004, is hoping to cap a treble for the Nerazzurri after already wrapping up the Italian title and domestic cup prior to the game. Bayern are also looking to seal the capture of three pieces of silverware for the campaign, after beating Schalke to the Bundesliga title and also having won their domestic cup.

"(CNN) -- UEFA president Michel Platini says he is disappointed that the buildup to Saturday's Champions League final between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich has been dominated by the coaches, and not the players. The showdown in Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium has been widely billed as a battle between Inter Milan manager Jose Mourinho and Bayern boss Louis Van Gaal. The fact that Mourinho worked under Van Gaal at Barcelona has added intrigue to a match featuring two teams who won the league and cup double in their domestic leagues. Both managers have made bold statements in the run-up to the match, with the Portuguese Mourinho describing the contest as bigger than the World Cup final, while Dutchman Van Gaal claimed that Bayern play more ""beautiful football"" than Inter. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? Platini, who said the final was ""too unpredictable"" to call, lamented the focus on the managers but suggested it may be a deliberate ploy to take the pressure off their players. ""It's not good because the football belongs to the players, not to the coach, for me,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""But they are two big personalities; they've had some problems in their countries at the beginning. They won both the league and the cup, and now they come to the final and perhaps it's a philosophy to protect the players being in front of everybody, it's a tactic."" Mourinho and Van Gaal are vying to become only the third manager after Ottmar Hitzfeld and Ernst Happel to win the Champions League with two different clubs. Mourinho won the European title with Porto in 2004 while Van Gaal triumphed with Ajax in 1995. Profile: Inter's maestro, Jose Mourinho . ""Tomorrow myself or Louis van Gaal will for sure become the third man in that group,"" said Mourinho. ""Hopefully, and I speak for myself and also for Louis because I saw him today and he seems to be in very good shape, if we continue in our jobs the one who doesn't do it tomorrow (Saturday) will do it in the future. ""I feel we will both join that group, one tomorrow and one later."" Mourinho, 47, worked as an assistant to Van Gaal for three years when the Dutchman was in charge of Barcelona. ""I think I educated Jose a little but he trains to win, I train to play beautiful football and win,"" said the 58-year-old Van Gaal. ""My way is more difficult. ""I think Mourinho is more defensive tactically but he has good players who can decide the outcome of a match. ""I think Inter Milan are a very difficult opponent and I think their matches against Chelsea and Barcelona have proved that."" Profile: Bayern boss Louis Van Gaal . Both teams will be missing key players through suspension, with Bayern lining up without French winger Franck Ribery and Inter lacking Brazilian midfielder Thiago Motta. But in keeping with the build-up to the match, Mourinho spent very little of his press conference on Friday talking about his team, and far more time fending off questions about his own future. Reports have linked the Portuguese with a move to Spain's nine-time European Cup winners Real Madrid next season.Mourinho said he was fully focused on the final and that ""none of us can think about anything else. ""After four or five days I'll decide, but when the game ends tomorrow I won't be able to say. When I won with Porto I knew before that I would leave for Chelsea, but right now I can't say,"" he added.","Michel Platini says coaches have dominated buildup to Champions League final .

"London, England (CNN) -- ""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death... I assure you it is much, much more important than that."" As Bill Shankly, the legendary former manager of English club Liverpool, pointed out shortly before he passed away in 1981, the significance of the beautiful game can never be underestimated -- and that doesn't just apply to fans of the sport, either. Soccer can affect lives on a national and international scale, inspiring revolutions and causing wars as well as having the capability to create peace and lift entire nations. The ""Football War"" between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport's wider implications. The two Central American nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 World Cup. Pedro Pinto's World Cup predictions . But this wasn't the first time, and definitely won't be the last, that the worlds of football and politics collide with remarkable results. 1. Mussolini manipulates the ""man in black,"" 1934 . ""Il Duce"" was determined to use this World Cup on home soil to showcase his fascist Italy. Mussolini had his own trophy created for the event -- the Coppa Del Duce -- which was six times the size of the Jules Rimet, and to this day allegations remain the tournament was fixed so that only Italy would collect it. According to the BBC's ""World Cup Stories"" book by Chris Hunt, there were suggestions that the Italian dictator himself picked the referees. In the semifinal against Austria, Mussolini's Azzurri team won 2-1, but after the game their opponents complained the game was fixed. The World Cup's missing men . ""The referee even played for them,"" said Austrian striker Josef Bican. ""When I passed for the ball out to the right wing, one of our players, Cicek, ran for it and the referee headed it back to the Italians. It was unbelievable."" 2. Austrian star humiliates Nazis, 1938 . Austria had one of the game's greatest sides in the 1930s, but when the Nazis annexed their neighbors, the nation's ""Wunderteam"" were forced to withdraw from the World Cup and merge with Germany. Star striker Matthias Sindelar so opposed his nation's loss of independence that he refused to play for Germany. He pleaded old age, but Germany's manager Sepp Herberger would later recall: ""I almost had the impression that discomfort and rejection, linked to the political developments, had prompted his refusal."" Who will be the World Cup's best player? During a so-called ""Reconciliation Game"" to mark the merging of the two sides, Sindelar made his feelings quite clear in a 2-0 win for Austria. According to German historian Nils Havemann's book ""Fussball unterm Hakenkreuz,"" the center-forward scored his beloved country's first and then, when the second goal went in, he danced in celebration in front of Nazi officials. In 1939, Sindelar and his girlfriend were killed in his apartment by a gas leak. Controversy still reigns over whether it was murder or suicide -- or just an accident. 3. Algerians play for independence, 1958 . Halfway through Algeria's War of Independence, the French national team called up a handful of Algerians playing in the French soccer league for the World Cup in Sweden. Given the chance of glory, fame and fortune, the players chose national identity instead. Rather than attend a pre-tournament friendly against Switzerland, they decided to flee France, gather at the headquarters of the Front Liberation National in Tunisia and launch an ""illegal"" national team, risking arrest for desertion in the process. Who will win the World Cup? Rachid Maflouki had won the French championship with Saint Etienne before getting the call from Les Bleus, but decided there were more important matters at stake than his personal success. ""I didn't hesitate,"" he told Ian Hawkey, author of ""Feet of the Chameleon."" ""Okay, I would have to give up my club. And yes, I was thinking about the World Cup, but what did that count for in comparison with my country's independence?"" 4. Zaire players crack under Presidential pressure, 1974 . It's remembered as one of the World Cup's funniest moments, but the truth is much darker. Already 3-0 down and facing a Brazilian free-kick, Zaire's right-back Ilunga Mwepu seemingly forgot the rules of the game, charged at the ball and hoofed it away before the whistle had even been blown. The Leopards, the first sub-Saharan African nation to reach the finals, had already been humiliated 9-0 by Yugoslavia before losing 2-0 to Scotland, and were told by President Mobutu's henchmen that if they lost to Brazil by more than three goals they wouldn't be allowed to return home. Ten World Cup headlines yet to be written . ""Do you think I'd deliberately make myself look like an idiot? You have to remember we were playing for our lives,"" he said in the book ""Death or Glory, the Dark History of the World Cup"" by Jon Spurling. Mwepu's act of ""madness,"" it turns out, was in fact a very sane attempt to waste time. 5. The German nation divided, 1974 . East Germany versus West at the 1974 World Cup was perhaps the most politically-charged match of all time. After the Second World War, the divided nation had become the main arena for the Cold War, and this fixture in Hamburg represented a head-to-head between the two ideologies. Although the game was actually the last in the group and it had become clear that both teams would qualify from the group stage, that did not diminish the tension surrounding the clash. Ten shocking World Cup moments . With home advantage, European champions West Germany were favorites but it was the East German Jurgen Sparwasser who scored the only goal of the game. East Germany heralded their triumph, but the victory was rendered a little hollow after they were knocked out in the next round and their bitter rivals went on to win the tournament. 6. Argentine junta swaps grain for glory, 1978 . Argentina's junta, which had seized power just a couple of years earlier, was determined to use the World Cup it was hosting as propaganda for the regime. According to a 1986 article by journalist Maria Laura Avignolo of Britain's Sunday Times, and supported by David Yallop in his book ""How They Stole the Game,"" the junta used bribery and intimidation to help win the cup. Controversy over new World Cup ball . In the group stages, Argentina needed to beat Peru by four goals in their last game to progress. General Jorge Videla made a timely pre-match visit to the Peruvian dressing-room to talk to the players about ""Latin American unity"" before the host nation rattled six past a side that had previously held eventual finalists Holland to a goalless draw. Avignolo claimed that in the weeks following the Peru game, an impromptu cargo of 35,000 tonnes of wheat left Argentina for Lima and that the military regime issued an interest-free loan of $50 million to the Peruvian government. 7. Iran's football revolution, 1998 . They may have been two of the least significant footballing sides at France '98, but nevertheless this fixture caught the world's imagination because Iran and the United States had been at loggerheads since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Although political relations were strained, the clash of civilizations never quite happened on the pitch. Instead, both sides showed the utmost respect, swapping flowers, gifts and photographs before the kick-off. The Iranians won 2-1, but, celebrations back home had a destabilizing effect as hundreds of thousands of young people, including women, partied in the streets in defiance of government warnings. ""In my neighborhood everybody goes out into the streets,"" one young Iranian told the BBC's Jim Muir. ""It's a good excuse for boys and girls to mix, and in a way it's political, because it's a demand for social change."" 8. Germany enjoys ""Partyotism,"" 2006 . The tournament slogan ""A time to make friends"" pretty much said it all. The organizers of Germany 2006 set out to woo the world, and in the process the country learned to love themselves. A combination of a flawless summer and coach Jurgen Klinsmann's free-flowing football injected a feel-good factor back into the national psyche, and Germans realized they could enjoy patriotism again -- or as the local media billed it, ""partyotism."" ""In the space of one month, Klinsmann managed to bring together a society ashamed of displays of nationalism and still divided along East-West lines, turning Germany into a nation of face-painting, flag-waving patriots,"" Hunt said in his ""World Cup Stories"" book. ""Never mind the final,"" Britain's The Times newspaper wrote. ""Germans are the real World Cup winners."" 9. The Koreas refuse to play nicely, 2008 . North and South Korea both successfully managed to qualify for South Africa 2010, but there were plenty of bad-tempered squabbles along the way. The bickering got so bad that world governing body FIFA eventually had to intervene after North Korea announced it would not let the South play its national anthem or wave its flag on their territory. So determined were the North Koreans that they were even prepared to play their ""home"" game abroad. In the end, the fixture took place in Shanghai, where the North Korean coach complained that their rivals had poisoned their food. In a statement about the match, the North's football association said: ""It was beyond all doubt that the incident was a product of a deliberate act perpetrated by adulterated foodstuff as [the players] could not get up all of a sudden just before the match."" According to a report by the BBC, the South's soccer federation -- Korea Football Association -- said a sports doctor had examined the North Korean players and found no serious problem. 10. Football diplomacy between old enemies, 2008-09 . Serious sport is war minus the shooting, remarked English author George Orwell. So it was refreshing last year when Armenia and Turkey used the beautiful game to make peace. The leaders of the two countries met up to watch a World Cup qualifier between their nations after almost a century of bitterness following the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by Turks during World War One. Turkish President Abdullah Gul attended the initial game in Armenia in 2008, which the hosts lost 2-0, and his counterpart Serzh Sarkisian agreed to join him for the return fixture the following year for further thawing of diplomatic relations. No doubt the fact that neither side had a chance of qualifying for South Africa helped keep things civil.","Argentina's right-wing junta allegedly bribed Peru with grain and a $50M loan in 1978 .

"(CNN) -- Sevilla have won the Spanish Copa del Rey for the second time in four years, and fifth time in their history, after beating Atletico Madrid 2-0 in the Nou Camp final on Wednesday. A superb early strike from Diego Capel set Sevilla on their way and a late breakaway goal from Jesus Navas secured victory and prevented Atletico from adding to their Europa Liga triumph over Fulham last week. The Andalucians -- who beat Getafe 1-0 in the final in 2007 -- got off to a perfect start when they went ahead in just the fifth minute. A Navas shot from the right was blocked by the Atletico defense, but the ball fell superbly to Capel on the edge of the area, who let fly with a powerful left-foot strike that gave goalkeeper David De Gea no chance. Atletico poured forward looking for an equalizer and top scorer Diego Forlan was denied on more than one occasion -- notably when Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop made a superb save in the 79th minute. But their constant attacking left gaps at the back and in the final minute Sevilla broke clear, leaving Navas time and space to round De Gea before firing the ball home, sending the Sevilla fans -- who were out-numbered by the Atletico supporters -- into raptures. The result completes a memorable four days for Sevilla, who have added the cup to their success in snatching fourth position in La Liga on Sunday -- and a place in next season's Champions League.","Sevilla defeat Atletico Madrid 2-0 at the Nou Camp to win the Spanish Copa del Rey .

"Editor's Note: James Carville, a Democratic strategist who serves as a political contributor for CNN, was the Clinton-Gore campaign manager in 1992 and political adviser to President Clinton. He is active in Democratic politics and a party fundraiser. James Carville says the president's trip to England was a success. (CNN) -- If a statesman is one who looks to the next generation and a politician one who looks to the next election, a political consultant must be one who looks to the next tracking poll. Well, I'll go one better and just look at today -- April 2, 2009. This has most likely been President Obama's best single day since inauguration. His and first lady Michelle Obama's first foray onto the world stage since being elected cannot be dubbed anything but successful. Obama appeared to be quite comfortable and confident as president of the United States at the G-20 summit that produced an unprecedented global economic recovery package. The president's polling numbers at home are coming in at an impressive rate. A Democracy Corps poll taken this week found that the percentage of likely voters saying the country is going in the right direction is up to 38 percent, the highest level recorded in more than three years. His budget was passed Thursday by Congress. And the recent special election in New York's 20th Congressional District in which Democrat Scott Murphy initially trailed by more than 20 points -- but wound up slightly ahead before officials count absentee ballots -- shows that the GOP is making few, if any gains among voters. To top it all off (at least for now), the financial markets are expressing confidence in the president's leadership as they are expected to close up for the fourth straight week. However, the real measure of how well the president is doing is indicated by two stunning events in the Republican Party just Thursday. First, on Rick Sanchez's program on CNN, Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tennessee, completely dissed the de-facto leader of the Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh, by referring to him as an ""entertainer,"" which is the more common description only the left-wing blogosphere would dare to use. Wamp went on to say that he didn't pay attention to Limbaugh. I'll bet that the Zachster did a little polling in Tennessee and discovered that El Rushbo would be a pretty heavy load to carry around the Volunteer State in his run for governor. Then my friend and a recent guest at my class at Tulane University, GOP strategist extraordinaire and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, became so frustrated with the Republican congressional leadership that Thursday in Missouri he opened up the possibility of a third party forming before the 2012 election. ""If the Republicans can't break out of being the right wing party of big government, then I think you would see a third party movement in 2012,"" Gingrich reportedly said. Clearly a day does not make a presidency. But if President Obama has more like April 2, 2009, he'll be able to govern much more like a statesman than a politician. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville: Obama is quite comfortable and confident at G-20 summit .
Carville: At home, 38 percent say U.S. is headed in right direction, the most in 3 years .
Meanwhile Carville says, GOP is mired in bickering over Limbaugh .
It's so bad, he says, Newt Gingrich says a third party may form by 2012 ."
"(CNN) -- Could another deep water -- or even shallow water -- oil drilling disaster be looming ahead? Experts warn it certainly could happen again. The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, they say, highlights flaws in the drilling industry's main defense against oil and gas explosions -- the blowout preventer, which is supposed to shut down an oil and gas well if something goes wrong. Oil companies have treated such devices as virtually fail-safe. ""They're certainly not fail-safe because they didn't close this well. If they had been 100 percent fail-safe they would have sealed, they would have closed,"" said Petroleum Engineering Professor Paul Bommer of the University of Texas at Austin. Indeed, there have been numerous rig blowouts, including a large gusher in the Timor Sea off the coast of Western Australia last year. A growing number of blowouts have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier in the past decade. There were 72 spills that dumped 18,000 barrels of oil into U.S. federal waters from 2000-2009, compared to just 15 spills that put 2,000 barrels into the water during the prior decade, according to data compiled by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Interior Department, which regulates energy exploration. (The database excludes spills of less than 50 barrels). Avoiding such spills depends upon the reliability of the blowout preventer, which is essentially a faucet on top of the oil well that keeps oil and gas from gushing to the surface. Rig workers use the preventer to keep a well under control, especially when oil and gas surge or ""kick up"" from a well. When its valves don't do the job, the blowout preventer can choke off the drilling pipe-- like squeezing a straw while drinking. And, if that fails to work, a blowout preventer has yet another line of defense -- huge shear rams -- like giant scissors that are supposed to be able to cut and seal the drilling pipe. But, a mile underwater, where the pressure is intense, drill pipes need to be thick, especially the joints between them. And those joints are very hard to cut. ""There are some parts of the pipe that the shears were never meant to cut,"" said Ford Brett, an expert in petroleum project management who is advising the Interior Department's oil drilling safety review. ""No one's equipment will shear the drill collar body. That's a lot of metal. It's not going to be possible to shear certain things,"" added Benton Baugh, another advisor to Interior's review of the Deepwater incident and President of Radoil, which designs and manufactures oilfield and subsea drilling equipment. A 2002 study for the Minerals Management Service warned of such trouble in shearing drilling pipe deep underwater. Initial research painted, ""a grim picture of the probability of success when utilizing this final tool in securing a well,"" wrote consultant West Engineering Services. West Engineering would not comment to CNN on its studies for the government. ""The blowout preventers had a probability of failing to crush that pipe that approaches 50 percent,"" said Professor Robert Bea of the University of California at Berkeley who is familiar with the study. ""It would be like getting on an airplane having a 50 percent chance of making it to your destination,"" added Bea. Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea is warning government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources. ""You can keep on pushing equipment to the point of where it breaks, and I think we broke it. All of the drilling operations underway of this nature in the world today depend on these devices as the final line of defense."" In the harshest of environments, a mile underwater or in the Arctic Tundra, blowout preventers operate under great stress, increasing their potential vulnerability to wear and tear. ""It is a mechanical piece of equipment. It is utilized in harsh environments. Yes, it can wear out,"" said Professor Steve Sears, chair of the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Louisiana State University. In fact, BP told congressional investigators there were several leaks in the hydraulic system that was supposed to power the shear rams of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventer. ""It was a coupling that had not been tightened down adequately. It was several turns loose,"" said a person with knowledge of the investigation. BP officials also discovered a dead battery. The final safety switch for a blowout preventer that has lost communication with its oil rig is the ""deadman"" system that's supposed to trigger the blowout preventer to shut the well. It did not activate during the Transocean April 20th rig explosion. Another study West Engineering Services prepared for the Minerals Management System in 2003 found flaw with the deadman system. ""The most serious drawback to this system ...is the mind set of the rig personnel. Many operator and contractor personnel refuse to arm the system from fear that it will either not operate when needed or activate inappropriately, causing downtime."" Such downtime can be extremely costly. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10-million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh. Given the multiple problems with blowout preventers energy experts concede the oil industry must quickly raise its safety bar. ""We must improve the safety systems of blowout preventers. Obviously it's time to take it to the next level,"" said Baugh. ""There are more strenuous conditions occurring and we must have more strenuous solutions for them."" The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is in the process of toughening rules for offshore oil exploration. ""We must ensure that offshore drilling is conducted safely and in compliance with the law,"" said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Drilling operations not subject to the administration's six-month deepwater drilling moratorium have until the end of the month to: . -- Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers; . -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup); . -- And, adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers. By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of sheer rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency. The Interior Department says such steps will ""increase the safety in offshore oil and gas development,"" but concedes they, ""represent only the beginning of the Department's work.""","Blowout preventers are supposed to cut off flow from oil wells .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho will lead his Italian team into their first European Champions League final in 38 years on 22 May. His task will be to drive Inter Milan to their first European Cup title since 1965 by defeating German champions Bayern Munich at the Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid this Saturday. Like Bayern coach Van Gaal, the 47-year-old is targeting a treble, having already secured the Italian League and Cup titles this year. A victory for the Italians would also signal a second treble for Mourinho who last achieved the three required victories at Porto back in 2004. Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? Inter's run to the final of the European competition was made all the more impressive with a win over title holders Barcelona in the semifinal. Record . After promising but brief spells coaching at Portuguese sides Benfica and Uniao de Leira, Mourinho brought home his first silverware while in charge at Porto where he claimed the league and cup titles in his first year, and treble in the second. Mourinho then moved on to English Premier League side Chelsea where he won six trophies in his three years at the helm, including the league titles in 2005 and 2006 and the FA Cup and League Cup in 2007. Since 2008 Mourinho has been at Inter Milan where he won the Serie A title in his first year as coach, successfully defending the title in 2010 as well as winning the domestic cup. If the team go on to win the Champions League final, it will be the first time the Milan side has done so since they beat Benfica in the final in 1965. Perhaps the most impressive stat to Mourinho's name is his run of 136 unbeaten home matches across his reigns at Inter Milan, Chelsea and Porto -- his last league defeat on home turf coming at Porto in 2002. Personality . ""Don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one,"" were the first words spoken by Mourinho upon his arrival at Chelsea in 2004, and he has since been dubbed ""The Special One"" by the English press. Mourinho has never failed to provide the media with entertaining press conferences and many memorable quotes though such outspoken comments have caused trouble down the years as well as making Mourinho a big personality. However, his ambition on the football field cannot be underestimated and there is speculation that Mourinho might leave Inter for Real Madrid after the final. He has been quoted in the past as saying he has dreams of coaching in England, Italy and Spain, so it would not be a surprise if his next challenge was at the Bernabeu. Previous clashes . Mourinho learnt his trade working as assistants at Estrela Amadora, Porto and Barcelona. At the Spanish club he was first a translator for English manager Bobby Robson and then second in command to Louis Van Gaal, who he says he learnt a lot from in the early stages of his career. ""Van Gaal is a very confident person and at a moment when a coach like me was young, that was very important. He gave me the confidence to coach the team on the pitch,"" Mourinho said. The rivalry between the pair intensified when Mourinho became the first coach in history to guide three different teams to the semifinals of the Champions League -- only for Van Gaal to do the same a day later. And whoever finishes on top on Saturday will join an even more elite group of those to have coached more than one team to the final of the competition. Austrian Ernst Happel and German Ottmar Hitzfeld are the only two coaches to have done so in the past. Whether or not he can do it this weekend Mourinho is confident that he will at some point in his career. ""I will do it one day, but I would love to do it now because of the circumstances of Inter not winning the competition for a long time."" Tactics . Mourinho has been praised for his team's resilience in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal against Barcelona, when despite being reduced to 10 men they still managed to keep the Spanish challenge at bay and go through 3-2 on aggregate. The Inter coach is reported to be a big fan of long fitness sessions and punishing long training runs to keep his squad in shape -- a technique also used by Van Gaal -- and it is this which is thought to have helped get Mourinho's side through to the final. He will be hoping that this will also stand them in good stead in the final against Bayern Munich, especially as like the German team who are without Franck Ribery, they will be missing a key player through suspension -- midfielder Thiago Motta. Mourinho will be looking to veteran captain Javier Zanetti, Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder and Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o -- who has won two Champions League titles with Barcelona in 2006 and 2009 -- to take him to victory in the competition that he has described as ""even bigger than the World Cup.""","Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho will lead his Italian team into their first European Champions League final in 38 years .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- If more women worked, Japan could add millions of employees to its rapidly shrinking workforce, a government study released Tuesday said. The key is better pay and a more flexible work culture. If women did not quit their jobs due to marriage or childbirth, the report says, Japan's workforce would increase by up to 4.5 million people. Female workers numbered 27.7 million in the Japanese workforce in 2009, compared to 38.4 million men. The annual document analyzes the role of women in the Japanese economy and, this year, urges more flexibility so women can maintain careers and raise children. There is a significant drop in the number of women working in their 30s, according to the report. Pay may be one of the reasons. Total compensation for women equals about 40 percent of what men make in Japan, the government said. Hourly wages for women are about 70 percent of that for their male counterparts. Although Japan has world's second largest economy, it also has the world's fastest aging population and one of the lowest birthrates on the planet. By 2050, the government estimates 40 percent of Japan's population will be over the age of 65. The numbers represent a shrinking tax base for the Japanese economy -- one that has the world's largest debt to gross-domestic-product ratio, at nearly 200 percent. Paying that debt off will be an increasing challenge for Tokyo, if the number of taxpayers dwindles every year.","Government report says women could boost Japanese workforce .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- High net-worth individuals will always find ways to enjoy, celebrate and flaunt their wealth -- the yacht at Monte Carlo, the chateau, the vineyard and the Rolls Royce Phantom. The very wealthy add to this their private jets -- Gulfstreams and Lears -- providing mobile bedrooms and boardrooms for upwards of four people. The lavish interior of the custom Airbus A380 . But now those who are not just very wealthy, but super wealthy, have a new option -- the chateau in the sky. The arrival of the -- much delayed -- Airbus A380 ""super"" jumbo aircraft, which is due to make its debut revenue-earning flight with Singapore Airlines later this year, heralds a whole new era of super private jet. The A380 is a four-engined, twin-decked, wide-body jet aircraft built at Airbus's factories throughout Europe and assembled at its facility in Toulouse, France. Larger than any previous civil aircraft, the A380 is 30 per cent bigger than the current largest jetliner, Boeing's 747-400. In standard three-class layout, the A380 can hold 555 passengers. In an all-economy configuration, the A380 could hold more than 800. This allows the private buyer an unrivalled space in which to create the ultimate statement of luxury and power. Private jets have been on the market since the 1960s. But they tended to be far smaller than commercial passenger aircraft. Some private customers wanted the comforts afforded to those heads of state who had their own large jetliners at their disposal. Most famous of these, of course is Air Force One, the official jet transport -- though actually there are two Air Force Ones, both modified Boeing 747-400s -- of the President of the United States of America. The demand for larger-scale private and corporate jets has been such that the major aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing, now offer modified versions of their passenger aircraft -- the Boeing BBJ (Boeing Business Jet) and Airbus CJ (Corporate Jet). Both of these are based on short-haul, narrow-bodied types -- the Boeing 737 series and Airbus A320 series -- both of which seat fewer than 200 people in commercial passenger configuration. But the A380's massive size -- the combined floor-space of the two decks is over 6,000 square feet -- dwarfs these otherwise capacious aircraft. In comparison, the total floor area of an Airbus CJ is 905 square feet. As soon as Airbus announced it was to embark on a project to develop the first ""super"" jumbo in 2001, it received an order for a private variant of the jet (then known by its codename of A3XX) from a client in the Middle East. The aircraft's size is one thing. But a luxury purchase of this magnitude also needs a sumptuous interior. This was to be provided by design consultancy Edése Doret from its offices in New York, London, Paris, Kuwait and Sri Lanka. Over the years the company has been called upon to design bespoke interiors for aircraft including the BBJs and CJs, and widebody aircraft including the Lockheed L1011 Tristar, Airbus A340-600 and Boeing 747-400. ""We were excited when we were awarded the contract,"" says the company's president Edése Doret Jr., ""and at the time no one had ever conceived of designing a private interior for such an aircraft. Unfortunately for us, the client backed out of the project and opted for a smaller [A340-300] aircraft. ""We only created very preliminary layouts and basic renderings of the interior. We were then approached in early 2005 to design the interior of the A380. We felt very fortunate to get a second opportunity to design the cabin for this new customer."" Beneath the two passenger decks of this modified super jumbo is an Air Force One-style air-stair -- allowing access to the tarmac without the need for a sky-bridge or external staircase -- and a crew dining area, crew gallery, crew bathroom, sleeping quarters for eight on bunk beds, a communications room and spiral staircase leading to the main deck. The main deck contains an entry lounge, grand lounge, dining area with seating for 14, main deck galley and staff seating. Then the upper deck houses a stateroom, master bathroom (with shower and hot tub), office, library, VIP bedroom (en-suite), guest bedroom (en-suite), upper deck galley, family dining area with seating for eight and an ""Oasis lounge"". The cost of the interior adds a further $150 million to the basic $350 million cost of the aircraft. Edése Doret won't disclose the identity of the client, leading to much internet speculation. It's most likely, however, that the client is the ruler of an oil-rich Gulf state rather than a captain of industry (Bill Gates, famously, travels economy class).","Luxury private jet based on Airbus A380 ""super"" jumbo .

"(InStyle) -- The plot details are still super-secret, but there's at least one thing that fans of ""Sex and The City"" can count on when Carrie and her crew return to the big screen next week: a visual feast of outrageous, over-the-top fashion. To celebrate the arrival of the hotly anticipated sequel, InStyle sat down with series costume designers Patricia Field, Rebecca Weinberg and Eric Daman -- as well as our very own fashion director Hal Rubenstein -- to compile a list of Ms. Bradshaw's greatest hits. #1: The Famous Tutu . Carrie does Degas! According to Weinberg, ""Sarah Jessica Parker was always very inspired"" by the French impressionist's paintings of dancers, ""and there were many moments when she captured that."" This pale pink tutu, originally purchased for $5 and then reproduced by the series' skilled seamstresses ""because,"" Weinberg said, ""we knew it was going to get wet,"" was first spotted in the series' title sequence. When Carrie tried it on again in the first film (while cleaning out her closet) it was still the most iconic -- and literal -- interpretation of the ballerina look. Carrie's best looks ever . #2: Patricia Field's Favorite . Asked to identify her favorite piece, Field didn't hesitate to name the drop-dead Versace gown Carrie wore while waiting (and waiting) for Petrovsky on her first night in Paris, towards the end of season 6. ""It took you out of reality,"" she said. Rubenstein agreed: ""It's acres and acres of tulle and chiffon, in this darkly romantic color -- the perfect dress to be dumped in. There's nothing more woeful than seeing a beautiful woman all dressed up with nowhere to go."" #3: The Do-Or-Die Dress . Carrie chose this Richard Tyler number for a post-breakup meeting with Big at the Central Park Boathouse in the season 3 finale. ""That was a moment where it was either happening, or it wasn't; either he loves her, or he doesn't."" Weinberg said. They didn't get back together -- that time -- but don't blame the dress: ""This is vintage Carrie,"" Rubenstein said. #4: The Nameplate Necklace . ""One day, I had to take the train,"" Weinberg recalled, ""and I saw all these Italian girls wearing nameplate necklaces."" From there, a trend was born. ""We wanted to establish things that the audience would associate with Carrie,"" Weinberg explained. ""Finding those familiar pieces was a big part of our success."" ""SATC"" character transformations: Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte . #5: High and Low Mix . ""This is a fun combination of high and low,"" Rubenstein said, referring to Carrie's season 5 ensemble, which included a sweater from mall staple Club Monaco, a dress by department store favorite Nanette Lepore and a Chanel jacket. Added Weinberg: ""I love the color!"" #6: The Fashion Statement . Field didn't mind revealing that Carrie will revisit past favorites, like this Dior newsprint dress, in the new movie. ""There's a reason for it,"" she hinted. ""She has an experience that merits re-wearing it."" Is the original context -- she donned this dress in season 3, when she apologized to Natasha for her affair with Big -- a clue? #7: Runway-Ready Separates . By the time Carrie was preparing to marry Mr. Big in the first movie, she (and the ""SATC"" costume designers) had no trouble securing super-current styles, like this Proenza Schouler runway look. ""Everyone wanted their clothes on the show,"" Weinberg said. ""Boxes and boxes would arrive daily."" Star Q&A: ""Which ""SATC2"" character's closet would you most like to raid?"" #8: Carrie's Signature Flower . ""The oversized corsage is iconic Carrie,"" Daman said. And it's very Sarah Jessica, too: Weinberg reported that Parker was ""really into"" her character's signature accessory. ""They started small, and one day she said, 'Let's do a big flower,' and then they got larger and larger until it escalated into a comedy of flowers!"" #9: Tres Chic Stripes . ""These were costumes, not clothes,"" noted Rubenstein. ""You can't forget that. They have to telegraph the mood of the scene."" Case in point: Carrie's super-Gallic striped Sonia Rykiel from season 6. ""I wouldn't love this on the streets of Manhattan, but she's in Paris, so she's wearing classic Parisian knitwear. It's perfection!"" ""SATC"" style secrets from the set . #10: Show-Stopping Shoes . The ruffled, rose Louboutins that Carrie chose for her goodbye to Big at the end of season 4 were only one pair in a long line of truly stunning stilettos (good thing, too, as they were wrecked when Miranda's water broke all over them). Carrie spent, by her own reckoning, tens of thousands of dollars on shoes over the course of the series, but Weinberg insisted that it was writer/director Michael Patrick King who turned many a shoe designer into household names. ""He was the one who said, 'Let's talk about Manolo."" ""If you look at ""Sex and The City"" as Fashion 101,"" Rubenstein cautioned, ""you're missing the point. This is fashion to the max!"" Indeed, for many fans, the clothes are a crucial part of the drama. Moviegoers are eager to discover whether sparks fly when Carrie runs into old flame Aidan in the new flick, of course, but many are arguably even more excited to see what she's wearing when -- and if -- she does.

"(CNN) -- New Zealand scored a last-gasp equalizer to deny Slovakia a victorious World Cup debut in South Africa on Tuesday. The 1-1 draw left all four teams in Group F on one point after Paraguay held defending champions Italy to the same score on Monday night. A 50th-minute goal from striker Robert Vittek in Rustenburg had seemed set to settle a clash between two of the tournament's smaller nations -- Slovakia has a population of around 5.4 million; New Zealand has about 4.3 million people. But a stubborn New Zealand side, returning to soccer's biggest stage for the first time since their debut in 1982, hit back in the third minute of time added on to secure the nation's first-ever point from their fourth World Cup finals game. Defender Winston Reid, who had been beaten in the air by Vittek for the opening goal, ghosted in behind the Slovakian defense to glance a header from Shane Smeltz's cross into the net off the base of the post. Italy stutter to draw with Paraguay . It was a bitter blow for the European side -- which gained independence from the former Czechoslovakia in 1993 -- after having dominated the second period. ""It is just a nightmare. We could have had three points, and at the end it felt like we have lost the match,"" Smittek told AFP. His coach Vladimir Weiss added: ""During the match we were the better team, it is just a pity we did not take the opportunities we had. ""The mood in the dressing room is very sad but that is football. We have to cope with the sadness and I hope we will perform well in the next match."" ""We are very, very proud. You would have to say this is our best ever result. We have never picked up a point in a World Cup before. We have come and thrown some extremely good punches and got what I thought was a fully deserved result."" New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert went to the finals in Spain 28 years ago, where his team lost to Brazil, Scotland and Russia. ""We are very, very proud. You would have to say this is our best-ever result,"" he told AFP. ""We have come and thrown some extremely good punches and got what I thought was a fully deserved result."" New Zealand had the better chances of the first half as Chris Killen failed to test Jan Mucha with an early close-range header and then fellow striker Smeltz fired a stinging shot that the goalkeeper turned into the sidenetting. The Kiwis, known as the ""All Whites,"" mixed battling defense with some shaky moments at the back as goalkeeper Mark Paston was lucky to escape after a complete miskick and some ineffectual attempts to clear crosses. And it was the aerial route that provided Slovakia's breakthrough five minutes after halftime as Vittek managed to evade Reid and head home a cross by Stanislav Sestak. Reid made a goal-saving challenge on Vittek in the 69th minute, and Slovakia's failure to capitalize on their possession gave New Zealand the chance to mount a late assault. Smeltz, the top scorer in the Australian A-League, should have found the target with a header in the 88th minute but made amends when he curled a tantalizing cross towards Reid in injury-time. New Zealand next play Italy in Nelspruit on Sunday, when Slovakia face Paraguay at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.","Winston Reid heads injury-time equalizer to give New Zealand first point at any World Cup .

"(Health.com) -- For Marika Holmgren, fighting breast cancer was an uphill battle -- literally. She got back on her mountain bike shortly after her diagnosis in February 2007, smack-dab in the middle of chemotherapy. ""The treatment is so intense -- it strips everything away. You're physically and completely changed,"" says Holmgren, 40. ""I was trying to retain some sense of normalcy. And truthfully, I felt a little badass being on my bike during treatment. I was giving cancer the middle finger."" Health.com: My Breast Cancer Diary in Pictures . Tooling around on a mountain bike during chemotherapy sounds intense, maybe even unadvisable. But just the opposite is true: Holmgren was being a model patient. In the past, doctors often told cancer patients to take it easy during treatment. Although the appropriate amount of exercise varies from patient to patient, that conventional wisdom is now considered old hat. In fact, new guidelines on cancer and exercise from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) urge cancer patients to be as physically active as possible both during and after their treatment. ""The idea that you should be staying put and resting is ultimately doing more harm than good,"" says Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, in Philadelphia. Schmitz, who studies the role of physical activity in chronic diseases, presented the guidelines at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting last week. Health.com: 30-Minute Workout, No Gym Required . The last thing people overwhelmed by cancer's psychological and physical impact may want to hear is ""exercise more."" During treatment, bone-crushing fatigue, nausea, and body-changing surgery -- not to mention the emotional drain of coping with worried children, friends, and life partners -- often puts exercise very last on the list of priorities. Still, experts now say that exercise may help with -- not add to -- those problems. It boosts energy, helps stave off the weight gain often associated with treatment, and provides a psychological pick-me-up at a time when a person's morale is likely to be battered. Even small amounts help . How much exercise is enough? The ACSM recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, which works out to about 20 minutes a day -- the same amount recommended to the general public. That said, the organization is realistic about how cancer and its treatment can alter mood and energy levels. Any kind of activity -- even a short walk -- is better than none, the ACSM says. Health.com: 5 Ways to Stay Healthy After Breast Cancer . ""The risk of inactivity for cancer patients is so great that it's best to just get started with something,"" says Schmitz. If you begin to feel worse or overtired, Schmitz recommends discussing it with your doctor. People who were sedentary before their diagnosis should start by walking for 10 minutes each day, says Schmitz, and gradually increase their time by 10 percent to 15 percent each week until they can do 30 minutes at a stretch, five times per week. There may be days when you feel nauseous, exhausted, or utterly despondent. But friends or family can help. ""A lot of it will be up to the caregivers, because they are the ones who will know how to motivate patients facing an uphill battle,"" says Schmitz. ""They're the ones who can say, 'Hey, let's get dressed today,' and then, 'Hey, let's get dressed and walk around the house.'"" It's important to pick an activity you enjoy, says Alyson Moadel, Ph.D., the director of the psychosocial oncology program at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, in the Bronx, New York. ""It is not a one-size-fits-all answer, since patients may be more responsive and adherent to different fitness programs,"" she says. ""It's important to allow patients a choice and to tailor a fitness program to each patient."" Fortunately the options are greater than ever before, as exercise programs for cancer patients have become increasingly popular nationwide. In 2007 the Lance Armstrong Foundation partnered with the YMCA to provide physical activities designed specifically for survivors, and more and more hospitals are creating their own programs as well. Cancer patients who aren't willing or able to travel to a facility on a regular basis can sign up for programs that can be delivered by mail, phone, or the Internet. ""Right now we're working to develop a variety in the types of programs available,"" says Schmitz. Health.com: The Joy Workout . Holmgren -- a longtime mountain biker -- took to the San Francisco hills with a group of women who ride with the Bay Area chapter of Team LUNA Chix, a group of amateur bikers, runners, and triathletes affiliated with the Breast Cancer Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in San Francisco. ""I had no hair, no eyelashes, and no eyebrows, and yet I didn't think they would know I had cancer,"" says Holmgren. ""The women were so fun and inspiring, and they never babied me. They just let me do my thing at my own pace."" How exercise helps . Dozens of studies have demonstrated the benefits of staying active both during and after treatment. Regular exercise can help fight the weight gain that often comes with cancer treatment, including breast cancer. ""It's about what the typical American could expect to gain over the course of a couple of years, but it's happening all at once,"" says Schmitz. But exercise is also important for cancer patients whose treatment can cause them to lose weight. Prostate cancer, cancers of the stomach and gut, and head and neck cancers can all lead to a significant decrease in muscle mass, as well as a loss of taste and an inability to process certain foods. ""Those patients really need to focus on resistance exercises,"" says Schmitz. ""That will help them increase their muscle mass and gain that functional tissue that they need."" Even though most patients won't be able to accomplish the same physical feats they were capable of before their diagnoses, adds Schmitz, staying active helps them achieve ""a whole lot more than they would have been able to if they hadn't been exercising."" Health.com: Fit at Any Age: Your 50s Strength Workout . Exercising has more intangible benefits as well. In a 2007 study that followed advanced cancer patients who exercised while undergoing chemo, the participants were asked to keep diaries. Many of them noted the positive mental aspects of exercise. ""It feels good to have a sense of an everyday life again,"" wrote one participant. ""I have become incredibly energetic,"" wrote another. In addition to making patients feel normal again, staying active is a way for patients to measure the progress of their recovery. Holmgren stuck with her rides all summer while undergoing chemo. ""They became a real benchmark for me,"" she says. ""The more I would ride, the more I felt like I was getting back to my old self."" Though Holmgren still can't match some of the climbs she conquered pre-diagnosis, mountain biking has helped her make peace with her changed body. ""The hormone treatment, early menopause, early arthritis, the weight gain, the surgeries -- breast cancer takes a huge toll on your body,"" she says. ""I knew I was going to feel bad no matter what, so I figured I might as well be feeling bad on my bike doing something that I used to do -- and something that people not going through cancer might not be able to do.""

"(CNN) -- Former President Clinton said he sees parallels in the mood of the country now and on April 19, 1995, when the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City killed 168 people while he was in the White House. ""There's the same kind of economic and social upheaval now,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an interview to air Friday on ""The Situation Room."" ""Then, you had the rise of extremist voices on talk radio. Here, you have a billion Internet sites,"" Clinton said. And although the hard-core, anti-government radicals are still a minority, ""they can communicate with each other much faster and much better than they did before. The main thing that bothered us since the time of Oklahoma City was that already, there was enough use of the Internet that if you knew how to find a Web site -- and not everybody even had a computer back then, but if you knew how to find it, you could learn, for example, how to make a bomb."" ""Now, everybody has got a computer; Web sites are easily accessible. And you can be highly selective and spend all of your time with people that are, you know, kind of out there with you,"" he continued. Clinton said the Oklahoma City bombing -- then the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history -- was the ""last in a series of very high-profile violent encounters"" during the 1990s between anti-government activists and authorities. He said the country is better protected to prevent such an attack now. But when asked whether the anti-government mood now is more intense than in the 1990s, Clinton said, ""Now, there are all of these groups, you know, saying things like the current political debate is just a prelude to civil war, all of that kind of stuff."" In an interview with the New York Times on Friday, Clinton warned of the affect that angry political rhetoric might have on antigovernment radicals like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh; he pointed to Rep. Michele Bachmann calling the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress ""the gangster government"" at a tax day Tea Party rally on Thursday. ""They are not gangsters,"" Clinton told the newspaper. ""They were elected. They are not doing anything they were not elected to do."" Clinton said that demonizing the government with incendiary language can have effects beyond just rallying a crowd. ""There can be real consequences when what you say animates people who do things you would never do,"" Clinton told the newspaper, pointing out that McVeigh and his conspirators ""were profoundly alienated, disconnected people who bought into this militant antigovernment line."" But Clinton said he didn't want to draw too tight of an analogy between then and now. He added that it's not his intent to stifle criticism of government. ""I'm not interested in gagging anybody. I actually love this political debate,"" Clinton said. ""Most of the Tea Party people, though, are explicitly political. You've got to give that now,"" he said. ""Forget about whether we disagree with them or not. It's really important to be able to criticize your government and criticize elected officials. That doesn't bother me. ""Most of them have been well within bounds,"" Clinton said. ""And they're harsh but limited criticism; in other words, they're not advocating violence or encouraging other people to do it. ""But I just think that we have to be careful,"" the former president added. ""We've been down this road on more than one occasion before. We don't want to go down it again.""","Former president analyzes mood of country now and leading up to Oklahoma City bombing .

"London, England (CNN) -- British troops dressed in red jackets and black bearskin hats put on a military spectacle in London on Saturday to mark Queen Elizabeth's official birthday. They marched to music as other troops sat on horses for the annual ceremony, known as Trooping the Color. It took place on the Horse Guards Parade, the marching ground within sight of the queen's residence at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a lilac outfit and hat decorated with bow of pink and green, sat front and center to watch what many consider the most celebrated event on the British royal calendar. The queen, who turned 84 this year, was born on April 21 but celebrates her birthday on a Saturday in June when the weather is better. Trooping the Color dates at least to the early 18th century, when the colors -- or flags -- of the battalion were ""trooped"" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by all the soldiers, according to Buckingham Palace and the British Army. Since 1748, the ceremony has also marked the sovereign's official birthday, the palace said. Queen Elizabeth has attended it every year except for 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace said. A limited number of tickets are available to the public to watch the event at the Horse Guards Parade. It is also shown live on TV, and others can watch the troops go by on The Mall, which leads from the palace to the parade. The ceremony is carried out by fully operational troops from the Household Division of the British Army. Only one color can be trooped at a time, and the five Household Regiments -- Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh Guards -- take their turn each year. This year it was the turn of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who recently returned from Afghanistan. At the end of the ceremony, the queen climbed into an open-top horse-drawn carriage for the ride back to Buckingham Palace. The crowds along The Mall, lined with Union Jacks, cheered as she went past. The queen then stood on the palace balcony to watch a military fly-past that ended with aircraft trailing red, white, and blue, the colors of the British flag. She waved to the crowds and was joined by other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip; her son, Prince Charles; and her grandson, Prince William. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Annual Trooping the Color held to mark queen's birthday .

"(CNN) -- More than two dozen leaders of the American Outlaws Association motorcycle gang have been arrested and one was killed in a shootout during a wide-ranging roundup by federal authorities Tuesday. A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted 27 members of the gang on charges that included attempted murder, kidnapping and assault, according to court documents unsealed Tuesday. Outlaws National President Jack Rosga and 26 others are named in a 12-count indictment that also lists robbery, extortion, witness intimidation, drug dealing, illegal gambling and weapons violations. One member of the motorcycle gang was killed in a shootout in Old Orchard, Maine, as authorities tried to execute an arrest warrant relating to the indictment, said Mike Campbell, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Campbell said members of an ATF Special Response Team pulled up to a house in Old Orchard to arrest Thomas Mayne and Kenneth Chretien when shots were fired at them from the house. ATF agents returned fire, killing one person, Campbell said. Authorities did not release the name of the victim, but said that Chretien was taken into custody. The Outlaws are an organized criminal enterprise that involved itself in a number of illegal activities, the indictment states. ""Today's arrests of the national president and leadership of the American Outlaws Association mark another aggressive attempt by the Department of Justice to dismantle what the indictment alleges to be a gang whose entire environment revolves around violence,"" U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said in a statement. Arrests were made in Wisconsin, Maine, Montana, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina and Virginia. As many as 50 Outlaws were initially targeted in the raids, officials said. The acts of violence and conspiracy charges are related to the Outlaws' efforts to gain territory from rival motorcycle gangs, most notably the Hells Angels. According to the Justice Department, the Outlaws have more than 1,700 members, who belong to 176 chapters in the United States and 12 foreign countries. The Outlaws are involved in the production, transportation and distribution of methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana, according to the department. Among the examples mentioned in the indictment is a 2005 incident where members of the Outlaws struck a member of a rival motorcycle club with a vehicle. The rival member was thrown off his motorcycle and rendered unconscious. The Outlaws members removed the rival's vest and left him there, according to the court document. Also mentioned in the indictment is the 2009 Outlaws assault of members of the Desperados Motorcycle Club in Virginia. According to the court document, Outlaws members planned an assault where they would send three of their smaller members into a bar occupied by the rival gang in an effort to lure them into a fight. Hidden inside and outside of the bar, other Outlaws members were ready to fight and threaten the Desperados with weapons. Police arrived at the scene and broke up the fight, the indictment states. CNN's Carol Cratty and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Top leaders of American Outlaws Association arrested .

"(CNN) -- Ah, fandom, it's a curious and wonderful thing. When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of ""Rock Band,"" fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited. The band that helped turn the '90s punk-rock revival into a more mainstream, pop-radio movement would be getting some major attention in the digital world. When the game was released on Tuesday, I couldn't wait to get home and see if I could play like Tre Cool or sing like Billie Joe Armstrong. But with so many other versions of ""Rock Band"" out there, why would you want to spend money on this game? Well, for starters, any fanboy or fangirl will love the loading screens with Green Day specific graphics and sounds. You also get to view cool memorabilia, like still photos and rare video footage of the band, for completing songs in career mode. Playing songs like ""When I Come Around"" and ""Pulling Teeth"" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put ""All By Myself"" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album. Maybe an Easter egg is hiding in the shadows for us to discover? There are also unique drum lessons written specifically for this version of the game. From what I've seen, even veteran Rock Band players will need them. Most of the songs included in the game are ones that fans of Green Day can listen to again and again. Now we can also tell our friends, ""yeah, I five-starred 'Brain Stew/Jaded!' "" Hardcore ""Rock Band"" fans have posted videos on YouTube of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars, which is something that not even the members of Green Day were able to do, according to a recent interview with MTV. The graphics are really well done in this game and the motion-capture technique used to animate the Green Day doppelganger is pretty impressive. When the piano opening to ""Viva La Gloria (Little Girl)"" starts playing, Billie Joe encourages the audience to clap and fakes surprise when the piano stops before the song kicks into high gear. It's almost like being at a concert -- I nearly forgot I was supposed to start singing. Also notable is that the band's clothing choices match the theme and era of each album. ""21st Century Breakdown"" has an almost steampunk feel to it. In the Oakland venue the band is decked out in waistcoats, trousers and pin-striped shirts to match the vibe of the album. As with most of the ""Rock Band"" games, when you earn four stars or more on a song, you get a reward. In this case, you get ""cred"" instead of ""fans"" and with that the ability to open up more sets with tougher songs like ""Peacemaker"" from ""21st Century Breakdown"" -- a fun, fast-paced song about death and destruction. All the members of Green Day play an instrument and sing at the same time, which is no small feat given the technical difficulty of the bass lines and Tre Cool's blazing fast drumming speed. My other ""band mate"" was busy clacking away on his guitar and wouldn't have been able to sing if he tried, nor would I when behind my electronic drum kit. Sore arms and scratchy voice aside, ""Green Day: Rock Band"" is a lot of fun. Fans both new and old will enjoy playing along with their favorite songs. We may not all be able to unlock achievements like ""It's All Fun Until Someone Gets Hurt"" or ""Louder Than Bombs or Eternity,"" but we'll have fun trying.","The video game's career mode offers rare video footage of the band playing .

"(Mashable) -- Starting July 1, Starbucks will offer free Wi-Fi nationwide, with no registration or account required. Even better, Wi-Fi will not be time limited. Starbucks joins an increasing list of brands and chains to offer free Wi-Fi in its stores. For example, last December, McDonald's rolled out free Wi-Fi to nearly all of its restaurants across the country. Panera Bread also offers a similar program. McDonald's and Starbucks both have partnerships with AT&T, which, while often criticized for the quality of its wireless data network, is one of the largest Wi-Fi hotspot providers in the United States. Starbucks was one of the first chains to offer Wi-Fi access to its patrons, first via an agreement with T-Mobile and then with AT&T. Starbucks visitors have been able to enjoy up to two hours of free Wi-Fi from their favorite coffee house, provided they are either an AT&T customer or they use a Starbucks Card to login. The new program will do away with any sort of registration, which will make those of us who always forget either our AT&T account information or can't find our Starbucks cards extremely happy. In addition to the new free Wi-Fi program, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Wired's Chris Anderson that the company is also planning on rolling out a new Starbucks Digital Network in partnership with Yahoo later this fall. This network, which will only be accessible in U.S. company-operated stores, will offer customers free and unrestricted access to paid sites and services like WSJ.com and other content providers on their phones, tablets or laptops. Bringing the Starbucks Experience Online . We spoke with Stephen Gillett, CIO, EVP and GM of Digital Ventures at Starbucks about the new plan for free Wi-Fi and the Starbucks Digital Network. According to Gillett, the goal is to bring the overall Starbucks in-store experience online. The first step is in providing an overall better online experience. This is where one-click logon comes into play, as well as the ability to connect with your device, be it a laptop or phone or iPad. The second part is the branded Starbucks online experience. Rather than just trying to create an aggregated portal of sources, Starbucks will be bringing quality content that is usually behind a pay wall to customers to access for free while in Starbucks stores. Different categories, like business news, lifestyle, music, entertainment, etc. will provide access to different content. This means that you can visit the Wall Street Journal uninhibited, as well as Zagat and also get local content from services like Foursquare pulled into your default Starbucks page. Furthermore, stuff like the Starbucks ""Pick of the Week"" iTunes promotion can now be integrated online, meaning that you can download the free weekly track from your iPhone or iPad or laptop, instead of having to use the cards with the redeem codes. The physical cards will still be available but for connected visitors, this is an easier way to access free content. The opportunity for premium service providers is that by offering free content to users while they are at Starbucks, they are potentially gaining new customers. A user might find they really enjoy some of the pay Wall Street Journal content and look at subscribing at home, for example. More and more providers will be announced as the launch date gets closer and Starbucks is committed to finding the best pay wall content it can bring to its audience.

"Dareta, Nigeria (CNN) -- In remote northern Nigeria, it is now a race against time to prevent a catastrophe in the world's worst-ever recorded outbreak of lead poisoning. Officially 163 people have already died in Zamfara state -- 111 of them children. But no one knows the true figures. ""You read about it in the literature but several hundred children have died here as a result of what happened here,"" says Ian von Lindern from the environmental engineering organization the Blacksmith Institute, which is heading the clean-up operation in the region. Children began to die in January, but only now in June has the clean-up operation begun in the mud-hut village of Dareta. Using the only tools available -- crude metal hoes normally used for farming -- local villagers are trying to clear the contaminated topsoil from the worst-affected housing compounds. Dug up, the soil is put into plastic bags and buried far from the village. Young children look on as their friends and family wear unfamiliar white protective suits and face masks. And they inhale more of the stirred-up dust. The U.S.-based Blacksmith Institute -- a global leader in pollution clean-up operations -- has found disturbingly high levels of lead across the village. ""The fact that this is 10,000 parts per million -- which is 1 percent lead -- that's very high,"" explains Casey Bartram of the Blacksmith Institute. In the U.S., the standard for residential-area soils is normally 400 parts per million. ""Because lead particles are so small, the levels so high, and because in this environment the kids are always in contact with the soil -- it's extremely dangerous for them to be exposed to levels like these,"" says Bartram. The Blacksmith Institute currently is trying to help clean up a toxic lead site in Senegal where, in the last few years, 18 people died. Until now, it was the worst case of lead poisoning anyone had seen. ""We were asked if we'd come over and look at this [site] so we only planned on a four-day visit -- but it's so bad we just have to stay and do what we can,"" says von Lindern. Many of the men in the region are gold miners. They bring the metal ore mined from the local mines back to be crushed by their wives and children in their homes. Unbeknownst to them, the gold ore contains extremely high levels of lead. The ore processing has since been moved out of most of the villages and, in theory, the lead could be cleared away. ""I will instruct all the people to excavate their houses,"" the local chief, Mohammed Bello, declares. ""But it will be difficult to enforce because of poverty."" There are also many other problems. Just getting to Dareta village takes several hours' drive -- a journey that will soon be made almost impossible with the oncoming rains. And with the rains coming, the young men working to clear away the contaminated earth are anxious to get to their farms. Simba Terima of the Blacksmith Institute is helping train them in safely removing the contaminated soil. ""This is a local problem, this is not an international problem,"" he says. ""So if they can own it, it'll be very good because long, long after we're gone they will be here."" It is hoped that Dareta village will be cleared in 26 days, but manpower is still lacking. The local government, apart from handing out red election hats for an upcoming vote, is almost nowhere to be seen. ""I tell you that the problem has now been contained and we are now on remediation,"" explains Abubakar Maru, the local environmental commissioner. ""I'm sure these measures are good enough."" The government claims there have been no more fatalities since it first identified the problem as lead poisoning. However, Dareta is only one of seven villages identified with extremely toxic levels of lead -- and the only village in the region receiving an on-going clean-up operation. From reports, some of the other villages are not being monitored properly. And there has been no thorough report on whether there are more villages suffering from the same toxic levels of lead. ""We hope to do just this village before the rainy season, but by mid-July there'll be so much rain we won't be able to, and we'll have to wait until October,"" says von Lindern. ""The kids will still be exposed."" On Sunday, the village cleared its first compound. For now, villagers are just taking it one home at a time.","Outbreak of lead poisoning has killed 163 in remote northern Nigerian state .

"(CNN) -- On Monday afternoon, the Pulitzer Prizes -- print journalism's highest honors --  were announced. Among the names not on the list: The National Enquirer. It wasn't for lack of trying. The bastion of supermarket check-out lanes, home of Elvis and Roseanne, was being considered for its work breaking the John Edwards sex scandal, a story it followed when much of the so-called ""mainstream media"" was looking the other way. The weekly paper, which has a paid circulation of just under 800,000, was entered in two categories -- investigative reporting and national news reporting -- but apparently fell short. (The winners were the Philadelphia Daily News with ProPublica; and the staff of The New York Times, respectively.) Enquirer executive editor Barry Levine told CNN last week that winning would have been an honor, and he liked hearing the Enquirer's name mentioned among the titans of the mainstream media. ""It helps our credibility around the world,"" says Levine. ""Credibility"" may not be the first word associated with the Enquirer -- but it has had some surprising journalistic scoops in years past, including the Gary Hart sex scandal and a number of leads during the O.J. Simpson trial. With the Edwards story, it had some support from mainstream media observers. ""Had the Enquirer not exercised a very tenacious reporting on this -- which we respect in the journalism world, right? -- would we not have known that this scandal was occurring?"" said Geneva Overholser, director of the school of journalism at the University of Southern California. ""Would Edwards perhaps have been nominated [for president]? ... I mean, there's no question the course of history would have been different."" But the Enquirer's reputation is as a scandal sheet that revels in humanity's foibles. Never mind that such publications have been a mainstay of journalism for more than a century, says Joan Saab, a cultural studies professor at the University of Rochester. Indeed, the new respect for the Enquirer is another sign that, in the Internet age, the old divisions between ""serious"" news and tabloid-style coverage have broken down, Saab says. Levine, the Enquirer's executive editor, worked for mainstream outlets, including The Associated Press, before moving towards tabloid journalism. ""Even most [mainstream news organization] Internet homepages will have all the gossip,"" Saab says. ""It makes us wonder about the validity of categorization."" The Enquirer has many forebears, but if it wins, it may want to tip a fedora to Confidential, the ""most scandalous scandal magazine"" of its time, in Tom Wolfe's wonderfully emphatic words. Founded in 1952, the pulp magazine was the brainchild of Robert Harrison, a dapper, high-living New York-based publisher who made some money with 1940s soft-core girlie magazines such as Titter and Wink. Pairing with editor Howard Rushmore, who had made the journey from muckraking Communist to muckraking anti-Communist, Harrison relied on a formula of Hollywood scandal, redbaiting exposes and occasional investigative pieces to make Confidential, at a quarter a throw, the top newsstand seller of its time. It was the first of a postwar breed of magazines to take advantage of the breakdown of the Hollywood studio system which, with back-scratching and arm-twisting, had protected stars' private lives from prying columnists. Americans were also showing a more open interest in gossip. As Humphrey Bogart once said, ""Everybody reads it, but they say the cook brought it into the house."" With its lurid red-and-yellow covers and its colorful, often alliterative prose, Confidential published brazen stories that revealed stars' homosexuality, tawdry pasts and domestic battles -- usually carefully vetted and written to protect against lawsuits. It was a side of celebrities Americans had seldom seen, and it contrasted with the airbrushed images presented by more mainstream publications: The same month Look magazine published a glowing profile of ""I Love Lucy"" stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Confidential headlined a story, ""Does Desi Really Love Lucy?"" and showcased an old Arnaz affair. ""Confidential came out and said, 'This is what life's really like,' "" says Henry Scott, author of the new book ""Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential."" Harrison got away with it, Scott said, because he didn't care what the moguls thought. ""Harrison was not obligated to Hollywood. His business model wasn't dependent on advertising."" Confidential's rise earned enemies as quickly as profits, and its fall came fast and hard. Rushmore left, later to die in a brutal 1958 murder-suicide that would have made prime Confidential fodder, had the magazine not been faltering. The year before, Confidential got careless on a story about Maureen O'Hara. The actress sued for libel and won. With many of its sources exposed, Confidential's information pipeline dried up and it soon dropped the celebrity exposes. Harrison sold it in mid-1958; its spark was gone. But its impact, said Scott, lives on as the forerunner of today's gossip blogs, supermarket tabloids and celebrity glossies -- including the Enquirer. Indeed, former Enquirer editor Iain Calder, who guided the publication from the '60s well into the '90s, riffs on Enquirer firsts with the brio of a character out of ""The Front Page."" His own book, 2004's ""The Inside Story,"" describes searching through Henry Kissinger's garbage (which revealed allegedly secret memos), getting a photo of Elvis Presley in his coffin (it became the cover of the Enquirer's best-selling issue) and covering the ""Dallas""/""Dynasty"" TV battle. It's the kind of coverage that's harder to do nowadays, said Calder, lamenting the financial squeeze that's hit media companies. ""I had the highest-paid, best investigative reporters ever in America,"" he said in his engaging Scottish brogue. ""I could hire a private jet and put 40 reporters on a major story."" In those days -- the late '70s and early '80s -- the paper routinely sold more than 5 million copies weekly. Indeed, Levine faces a more competitive media landscape. Along with all the celebrity glossies and supermarket tabloids, there are a plethora of TV shows, Web sites and blogs treading on his territory. But he said the Enquirer is holding its own, thanks to such stories as the Edwards affair, the Tiger Woods scandal and the Sandra Bullock story. And though more mainstream publications scoff at the Enquirer's ""checkbook journalism"" and in-your-face headlines, those same publications are doing things they might not have considered 10 years ago. Media watcher and former journalist Richard Laermer, who said last week that the Enquirer deserved the Pulitzer, points out that The Washington Post has hired a raft of bloggers who ""say the craziest but most germane things about our culture."" ""I think more people are going to use the Web to get those pajama-clad journalists. They'll aggregate them instead of compete with them,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think to myself that maybe we're too caught up in what is an opinion and what is fact. Maybe what people want is the mix."" Not to mention a mix of styles: gossip and hard news, celebrities and human interest, investigative exposes and mundane process pieces. Not all of it will qualify for a Pulitzer, but maybe that isn't the point, said Calder. ""We didn't want to be like other papers,"" he said of his Enquirer days. ""Why do [journalists] care what other journalists think? There was only one thing I wanted to do, and that was to get stories to sell papers."" Somewhere, Robert Harrison is smiling.

"El Paso, Texas (CNN) -- On Monday, a U.S. Border Patrol officer shot and killed a 14-year-old boy, Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, under one of the international bridges that connects or, these days, divides, El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. The boy lay dead on the Mexican side and the Border Patrol agent was removed from the scene by U.S. officials. American officials say it was a case of self-defense. Mexican authorities condemned the killing as the use of excessive force. The facts are still coming out, but based on the English and the Spanish news reports, it is easy to see that the two sides do not agree on the particulars, much less on their interpretation. To people across the two nations who see reports of the death on TV or in the papers, it's a dramatic news story -- a boy with a bullet in his head and an agent under investigation. But here at the border, the scene, the actors, the act -- as if carefully choreographed, chosen and scripted -- read like an up-close metaphor for everything that is broken with our border and with immigration. At a basic level, the incident at the Black Bridge seems to reveal two nations moving ever further from acknowledging our inevitable common destiny. As the two countries face the economic call-and-response of illegal immigration and the drug trade, we seem to cast each other increasingly as enemies. In this context it becomes justified to deal with each other with violence: throwing rocks and shooting bullets. One could say that that boy represents the aspirations of many Mexican people because -- whether, as some reports have suggested, he intended to cross the border or as others have said, was being used as a decoy for others to make a run -- the spot where he died is known as a place where people try to cross illegally in search of work and a better life. At the same time, a dehumanization plays out at the border, where some lives are worth more than others -- a calculus that usually runs along wealth lines, as those with money can afford visas to cross over the bridge and the poor have to stay out or risk their lives by crossing under it. Additionally, the episode highlights the blunt instrument -- barriers and increased militarization -- that the United States has chosen to deal with the countries' 2,000-mile border. Thousands of Border Patrol agents have been added in the past few years alone, and last month President Obama promised to send an additional 1,200 National Guard troops. An ineffectual fence stretches in fits and starts along about 30 percent of the border; it has been breached thousands of times, according to the Government Accountability Office, and costs thousands more to patch. More fences, more walls, more armored vehicles and the National Guard, more helicopters and drones, more sensors and infrared goggles, more cameras and guns, and thousands of increasingly armed agents are all part of the border's choreography. From October 1 through May 31, Custom and Border Protection agents have used their firearms 31 times, a spokesman told CNN. In these circumstances, it is only a matter of time before more deaths occur. In this incident lies the inability of the Mexican authorities to protect their people and the apparently questionable practices of our own Border Patrol, which, for one thing, sends bike-patrol officers to a well-known trouble spot and for another seems unclear about whether they can or cannot shoot across the borderline. Neither side seems to believe that we deserve much more than these poorly pieced-together strategies, which reflect failures of both the Obama and the Calderón administrations. Mr. Calderón has been unable to face squarely the inequalities of his people: More than one in three Mexicans would leave the country and move in search of a better life, according to data collected for a Pew Global Attitudes Project report. And the event speaks to the political inability of President Obama to coax Congress toward immigration reform -- to include an orderly flow of low-skilled workers, easing the pressure on the border itself and thereby acknowledging the continued integration of the two countries' labor markets. Now a Border Patrol officer will have to live with the idea of having cut short the life of a young boy whose death, regardless of what he was doing at the bridge, means pain and sorrow for a family likely under the stress of 30 months of outrageous drug-related violence in Ciudad Juárez. It is mindboggling to think that $50 billion a year in trade makes its way back and forth over the bridges that divide El Paso and Juárez, but bullets and rocks are now traded right under them. So, we have to ask: Is that what we want the future of our border to be? An incident such as this should not spur us to finger pointing but to acknowledging that we have a problem; that we desperately need to sit down to order and shape our interactions and take joint control of our future. If we forget or justify this incident, we will be condemning ourselves to many more like it.

"(CNN) -- Jazz has always been a popular form of music because its improvisatory nature is easily adapted by a community or nation to reflect its individual identity. Polish policemen watch a demonstration near the University in Warsaw in December 1981. In Poland, jazz has been intertwined with its politics and through it, has gained its own particular identity and recognition, as has Poland as a nation. The First World War marked a turning point in Polish history. After 300 years of divided rule under Prussia, Austria and Russia, Poland became an independent democratic republic lasting until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. The end of the First World War also marked the spread through Europe of American jazz. According to polishjazz.com, the first Polish jazz band was started in 1923 by Zygmunt Karasinski and Symon Kataszek, calling itself simply Karasinski & Kataszek Jazz-Tango Orchestra. It was an almost immediate success, playing in popular Warsaw venues of the time. Other popular dance bands established themselves during the 1920s and the first jazz recordings were being recorded by Polish record label Syrena Records. With the rise of the Nazis and accompanying anti-semitism under Adolf Hitler in neighboring Germany, Jewish musicians such as Ady Rosner and Erwin Woheller came to Poland, enriching the Polish jazz scene with their talent. Rosner became the best and most popular jazz musician, who later on in his life became a driving force of Soviet jazz. Throughout the 1930s, the music of American jazz artists such as Duke Ellington was widely available and popular, as were the first music magazines from London, Paris and America. This flourishing scene came to an abrupt end with the invasion and occupation of Poland by the German Army. The end of the war saw Poland being occupied yet again, this time by the Soviet Red Army. Poland, now called People's Republic of Poland, became a Soviet-controlled puppet state. Music fell under Soviet control too and jazz, with its syncopated rhythms and free style, did not fall into the prescribed mould. In Stalinist Poland, jazz was banned and went on to develop its own style underground. During the first half of the 1950s, the death of Joseph Stalin and Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment as First Secretary in the Polish regime had a more liberalizing effect on the country. Jazz was out in the open once more; being listened to, talked about and played without fear. The first jazz magazine behind the Iron Curtain was published; official jazz clubs were created and the Polish Jazz Federation was started by Jan Byrczek in 1964. Byrczek went on to found the Polish Jazz Society which became one of the largest jazz organisations of Europe. The 50s also saw the first official jazz festival taking place in Sopot beginning a tradition of jazz festivals in Poland that lasts to this day. Initial hopes that Gomulka's reforms would move towards democratisation were dashed but despite political obstacles, Poland's cultural and intellectual life continued to grow and flourish during the following decade. Jazz was being featured in TV programmes; jazz critique was growing as were jazz festivals. In 1964, the Jazz at the Oder River festival in Wroclaw started. Another milestone of the decade was the start of the recording of ""The Polish Jazz Series"" by the official recording label Polskie Nagrania-Muza. It continued doing so until well into the Eighties, later re-releasing all the volumes in CD format. During the 1970s, Edward Gierek replaced Gomulka as First Party Secretary. He, being on a more friendly footing with Western neighbors than his predecessors, received loans and with them, the slow trickle of Western goods (notably Coca Cola) and TV shows into Poland. The government's pro-Western stance also allowed Polish culture to reach out to the West. The leading Polish jazz magazine Jazz Forum was being published in Polish, English and German and distributed in 103 countries. Trumpeter Tomasz Stanko came to the fore during this period, receiving the first European Jazz Award in 2002 as one or Europe's most outstanding jazz musicians. Towards the end of the 70s, Gierek's political career came to a close after a wave of labor strikes resulting from his policies. It was in this turbulent time that the independent trade union, the Solidarity Movement, was started in the Gdansk shipyards by Lech Walesa. Solidarity's growing strength led General Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in Soviet Russia; pressure from Polish Pope John Paul II and Western leaders forced the Communists to the negotiating table. This led to Solidarity's participation in semi-free elections 1989 resulting in a coalition government. Walesa became President of Poland until 1995. The political events were reflected in the jazz scene. The early 80s brought the ""Young Power"" movement lead by Krzysztof Popek. According to allaboutjazz.com, musician Cezary Lerski described his movement as being ""verbally critical and musically adventurous,"" revolutionzing Polish jazz. Popek is still a driving force of Polish Jazz today. One of the purely Polish streams of jazz are the interpretations of the music of Polish composer Frederic Chopin started by pianist Andrzej Jagodzinski. Reflecting the new freedom brought by democratisation another important band came to the fore at the beginning of the 90s. This was ""Milosc,"" playing free jazz, going so far as to describe its form of jazz as ""yass"" thereby creating a new stream or genre in Polish jazz. But it too followed the path of the Young Power Movement by becoming more mainstream. Current jazz reflects the diversity that democratic and economic freedom have brought Poland. A multiplicity of small jazz clubs have sprung up throughout the country as have a number of jazz festivals and independent record labels. Lersky writes that Polish jazz is"" mature, vibrant and evolving"" -- a reflection of the politics of the day?","History of Polish jazz has been intertwined with its politics .
Born in democracy; banned by Communists; now evolving in new democracy .
Jazz is a popular, individual genre characterised by improvisation ."
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Five Americans arrested in Pakistan on suspicion of plotting terror attacks claimed again Tuesday they are being tortured in jail. The suspects wrote their claims on tissue paper that they threw to reporters from a van that drove them to a court hearing. ""Since our arrest, the U.S.A., FBI, and Pakistani police have tortured us. They are trying to set us up. We are innocent. They are trying to keep us away from the public, media, our families and our lawyer. Help us!"" The note contained the first names of all five suspects. The five men worshipped together at a mosque in Alexandria, Virginia, until they went missing in November and turned up in Pakistan. They are accused by Pakistani authorities of being connected to terror organizations and plotting attacks. They were arrested in the small city of Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad, in December. The five are identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam. The five first claimed at a court hearing in January that they had been tortured in jail. At that time Muhammad Ameer Khan Rokhri, the former defense lawyer for the accused, said the court ordered medical checkups for them. Richard Snelsire, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad told CNN that the United States categorically denies and rejects any claims of torture. Pakistani police have also denied the claims. A prosecutor was scheduled to submit a charging sheet to the court at the hearing Tuesday that would allow the suspects to be charged with specific crimes. However, the hearing was adjourned without the prosecutor taking that action. Another hearing was scheduled for February 16. The suspects include two Pakistani-Americans, two Yemeni-Americans and an Egyptian-American.

"(CNN) -- A Roman-era mummy was recently unearthed in a Bahariya Oasis cemetery, about 190 miles southwest of Cairo. The 3-foot-tall female mummy was discovered by Egyptian archaeologists. The figure was found covered with plaster decorated to resemble Roman dress and jewelry, said Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities in a press release Monday. In addition to the female mummy, the Supreme Council of Antiquities said archaeologists found clay and glass vessels, coins, anthropoid masks and 14 Greco-Roman tombs. Director of Cairo and Giza Antiquities Mahmoud Affifi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said the tomb has a unique design with stairways and corridors, and could date to 300 B.C. Bahariya Oasis is not new to archaeological investigations. In 1996, a team of Egyptian archaeologists found 17 tombs and 254 mummies at the site. This most recent find came as a result of excavation work for the construction of a youth center. The Supreme Council of Antiquities has halted the construction work. Efforts Tuesday by CNN to reach the archaeologists and Zahi Hawass, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, were unsuccessful.","A 3-foot-tall female mummy was discovered by Egyptian archaeologists .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A Nebraska man is expected to plead guilty next week to launching a cyber attack that shut down the Church of Scientology's Web sites, federal prosecutors said Monday. Brian Thomas Mettenbrink, 20, of Grand Island, Nebraska, was accused of participating in an attack orchestrated by a group that called itself ""Anonymous."" The group led protests against the church in various parts of the country before announcing in January 2008 that it would launch a cyber offensive, said Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Mettenbrink admitted in court that he downloaded software from an ""Anonymous"" message board and used it to launch ""denial of service"" attacks on Scientology Web sites. In such attacks, hackers flood a target site with so much traffic that it is unable to handle the volume and slows to a crawl or crashes altogether. As a result, the site is then unavailable to legitimate users. The group targeted the church after it forced Web sites to yank a leaked video of actor and church member Tom Cruise fervently making the case for Scientology. The video was intended for attendees at a church award ceremony in 2004 where Cruise was being honored. ""We are the authorities on getting people off drugs, we are the authorities on the mind, we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals,"" Cruise says in the video. In 2008, the video was leaked online and widely ridiculed. The church responded by threatening to sue Web sites unless they removed the clip. ""Anonymous"" then launched its attack. As part of its offensive, the group asked Internet users to not only download the ""denial of service"" software from its message board, but also to place prank phone calls, post proprietary church documents online, and send black pages to church fax machines to waste ink. The group posted a YouTube video that said it aimed to ""expel Scientology from the Internet."" ""Expect us,"" the video ended. The attacks targeted local and global sites of the church. Mettenbrink is expected to plead guilty in federal court next week to a misdemeanor charge of accessing a protected computer with authorization. He agreed to serve a year in prison, Mrozek said. Mettenbrink's is the second successful prosecution connected to the ""Anonymous"" attacks. Last year, Dmitriy Guzner of Verona, New Jersey, was sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison for attacks on Scientology sites. The Church of Scientology, founded by the late science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, is well known for its high-profile, celebrity members. In October, film director Paul Haggis left the church for its alleged public support of Proposition 8, which eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry in California. Also in October, a French court convicted the church and six of its leaders of organized fraud. The court imposed fines totaling more than $1 million on the church and the convicted staff. The plaintiffs focused their complaints on the use of a device that Scientologists say measures spiritual well-being. Members used the electropsychometer, or E-Meter, to ""locate areas of spiritual duress or travail so they can be addressed and handled,"" according to Scientology's Web site. The plaintiffs said that, after using the device, they were encouraged to pay for vitamins and books. They said that amounted to fraud. The church has called the decision a ""modern Inquisition"" and said it would appeal the verdict.","Nebraska man admits role in attacks on Scientology Web sites .

"Everett, Washington (CNN)  -- After more than two years of delays, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner made its maiden flight Tuesday in a three-hour trip that the maker described as a success. ""Today is truly a proud and historic day for the global team who has worked tirelessly to design and build the 787 Dreamliner -- the first all-new jet airplane of the 21st century,"" said Scott Fancher, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, in a news release. ""We look forward to the upcoming flight test program and soon bringing groundbreaking levels of efficiency, technology and passenger comfort to airlines and the flying public."" More than 12,000 employees and guests watched as the plane took off at 10:27 a.m. from Paine Field in Everett, Washington. It landed more than three hours later and about 40 miles away at Seattle, Washington's Boeing Field after having flown at a speed of 207 mph at 15,000 feet -- typical for a maiden flight, the company said. During their time aloft, the chief pilot and captain tested some of the airplane's systems and structures while flight data were transmitted electronically to engineers at Boeing Field. ""The flight marks the beginning of a flight test program that will see six airplanes flying nearly around the clock and around the globe, with the airplane's first delivery scheduled for fourth quarter 2010,"" Boeing's news release said. Boeing promises passengers ""a better flying experience"" that includes bigger windows, more luggage space and better lighting. It promises airline operators greater efficiency by burning 20 percent less fuel than current models of comparable size and by providing as much as 45 percent more space for cargo. So far, 55 customers have ordered 840 of the planes. The official price of one is $150 million. ""We think this is going to be a very efficient airplane,"" Jim Albaugh, Boeing executive vice president and CEO, told CNN. ""It's going to change the way people travel."" Despite the delays, Boeing's first new commercial airliner in more than a decade will still be relevant, Albaugh said Monday. ""It's more environmentally friendly, it's more efficient, uses less fuel, it's going to cost the operator less to fly, it's going to allow the passengers to pay less and feel better when they land,"" he said. Boeing's fuel claims are linked to its design. It is the first major airliner to be made mostly of composite materials and, as a result, is lighter. Depending on the configuration, the plane can seat 200 to 300 passengers and can travel more than 2,500 nautical miles. But production delays and technical problems have stolen some of the Dreamliner's luster. Many of the snags in the supply line have been blamed on the army of partners Boeing brought in to help with the construction. ""They did too much outsourcing, too soon, with too little oversight,"" said Scott Hamilton of the aviation consulting firm Leeham Co. ""The customers have been mightily [upset] over the creeping delays."" Albaugh acknowledged that, ""in hindsight,"" the level of outsourcing may not have been the best strategy. ""There a few things we might have kept inside, yes,"" he said. With 10 months of flight tests ahead, the 787s won't start flying commercially until at least 2011, the company said. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" Albaugh said.","NEW: 787 Dreamliner completes three-hour test flight .

"The NBA finals will go into a seventh and deciding game after the Los Angeles Lakers kept their title defense alive by destroying the Boston Celtics 89-67 at home on Tuesday night to level the series at 3-3.

The Celtics could have taken the title for a record 18th time if they had won game six, but instead they slumped to their lowest-ever score in an NBA finals clash, hampered by the injury of Kendrick Perkins who was forced to sit out after hurting his knee in the first quarter.

They led Boston by a 20-point margin at halftime, a gap which from which the East Coast side were unable to recover despite a strong finish from Ray Allen, who scored 17. Lakers center Andrew Bynum -- another player struggling with a knee problem that forced him to miss much of game five -- only managed a first-half appearance, but is feeling confident about playing in the decider.

""It's about who comes out and provides the energy on the floor and plays the kind of game and dictates the kind of game they want to dictate."" And after L.A.'s dominant performance in game six, Jackson's team will be feeling confident they can retain the NBA title on their home court, but Boston are sure to put up a fight.

"(CNN) -- A far-right party recorded the biggest ever share of the vote for a political party in Switzerland's history on Monday, after a controversial campaign that blamed foreigners for much of the country's crime. A Swiss People's Party supporter waves a sticker featuring the Swiss flag during Sunday's elections. The nationalist Swiss People's Party headed by Christoph Blocher rode a wave of anti-immigration sentiment to gain 29 percent of the vote. The Green Party also scored well in Sunday's vote winning 20 seats in the 200-seat National Council, Switzerland's lower house of parliament. It previously held six seats, making this the Green Party's best ever showing. The Social Democrats remain the second-largest party, despite dropping to 43 seats after gaining 19.5 percent of the vote, while the People's Party added seven extra seats, taking its total to 62. The nationalists dismissed criticism of their campaign -- derided as racist by leftist groups -- and insisted that they were only trying to address legitimate public concerns. ""Public security in Switzerland is in danger. We have a lot of foreigners committing crimes. And the Swiss people are very sensitive to that,"" Gregor Rutz, the party's Secretary General told CNN. The gains made by the nationalists will not result in radical changes to the make-up of the government, however, since Switzerland is run by a form of consensus politics. Under the Swiss system, a multi-party coalition runs the country by convention with ministers appointed from the main parties. Although the make-up of the government will stay almost unchanged, political analysts said the success of the People's Party and its hostile rhetoric reflected a growing, but worrying trend in Switzerland. ""This may be a surprise for those outside of Switzerland but not for us,"" Hans Hilter, a political scientist at Bern University, told CNN. ""This type of very negative campaigning has been a feature of previous campaigns by them (the People's Party) and reflects concerns among a wide number of people that immigration levels are too high."" Foreigners comprise a quarter of the Swiss workforce and make up around 20 percent of the population of more than 7 million. The immigrant community is dominated by Albanians, Bosnians, and Turks, though most were denied a vote in Sunday's election because of the difficulty of gaining Swiss citizenship. On the streets of this Alpine country, the polarizing campaign provoked accusations of racism against the Swiss People's Party and rioting in the capital Bern. Blocher's party was widely criticized after an ad campaign featuring a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag. The party also called for immigrant families to be thrown out of the country if their child committed a crime. In this usually tolerant country, the hardline approach proved popular as voters unhappy at rising immigration levels handed the Swiss People's Party the best-ever election result, surpassing the Radical Democrats' victory of 28 percent of the vote in 1919. At the same time as the nationalist gains, the country elected its first black politician to the National Council, Ricardo Lumengo, who accused Blocher's party of ""scapegoating"". ""They are showing that we foreigners are responsible for everything that is bad and we found that they are just simple arguments. We condemn it,"" he told CNN. Lumengo, who came to Switzerland as an asylum seeker from Angola, added: ""It shows that in this country there is no social justice. A part of the population, they are living well, they have a good salary. But a big quantity of the population, they are living in the phenomenon of the working poor."" E-mail to a friend .

"New York (CNN) -- The man who rescued an 11-year-old girl lost in a dense Florida swamp said Wednesday that God led him directly to her and that finding her was no surprise. James King said he set out on his own to look for Nadia Bloom on Tuesday, trusting that he was going in the right direction even when that meant through water or dense brush. ""I was expecting to hear her voice,"" King told CNN. ""So I'm yelling, 'Nadia!' and at one point, I yell, 'Nadia!' and I hear 'What?' And I said that way -- right there."" Tanya Bloom, Nadia's mother, said later Wednesday that the family is ""so fortunate God used him to bring her back."" ""She's doing remarkably well,"" Bloom said. ""She has swollen feet and lots of bug bites and scratches, but she's doing great."" Dr. Mary Farrell, who treated the girl when she arrived at the hospital, said that Nadia was in good shape but that she would remain hospitalized a little longer because of a bacterial infection. ""When she got here, she was a little bit dehydrated but she had been resuscitated pretty well,"" Farrell said, ""and she looked remarkably well considering she had been out for four and half days."" King said he was surprised at the good shape Nadia was in. She had been missing since Friday. Shoeless and covered in insect bites, she was in otherwise good condition, he said. ""She was not panicked. She looked like she had been sitting there, waiting on me,"" he said. The two of them then stayed in the swamp, near Lake Jesup in central Florida, while King called authorities. When he got hold of the 911 dispatcher, he put Nadia on the phone. ""Hi. This is Nadia. I'm the girl who got lost,"" came the little girl's voice. King said it took him ""two hours of rough time"" trekking through the swamp to find Nadia. He said he figures it took Nadia just as long to reach the same spot. She told King that she had gone on a nature walk and simply got lost. ""We are so, so grateful,"" Nadia's father, Jeff Bloom, said. ""I can't even express how we felt when she was found -- beyond words."" The swamp was so dense, King said, that the rescuers who carried Nadia out on a black cloth stretcher Tuesday had to use machetes to cut through the brush, bushes and trees. ""I see it as an answer to a lot of people's prayers,"" King told CNN. ""I'm just very thankful, I'm thankful that God used me as a part of it to be able to find her. It's definitely a miracle. ""I didn't know where she was. The only person who knew where she was was God, and I asked him and he led me directly to her, straight -- well, as straight as you can go through the swamp."" King said he prayed the whole time he was searching, even when it seemed like he was going in the wrong direction. In one case, he said, there was water all around and he didn't know where to go. ""He said, 'Go that way.' And I'm looking at water. I said, 'Lord, are you sure?' He said. 'I got ya.' And as soon as I start walking, the ground under the water is solid. It's only about a foot and a half deep. He took care of me all the way there."" The disappearance of Nadia, described as mildly autistic, had sparked an Amber Alert that was canceled when King found her. Both King and Nadia's family at one time attended the same church, Metro Church in Winter Springs, Florida, but they didn't know one another -- though King said Nadia did seem to register him as a friendly face when she was found. The church held an open-air thanksgiving service to celebrate Nadia's return Tuesday evening. ""Give the glory to God,"" Nadia's father told reporters after seeing his daughter Tuesday. King had brought trail mix and drinks to give to Nadia if he found her, but he also brought another important item -- toilet paper. The swamp vegetation was so thick that the helicopter that came to retrieve Nadia and King couldn't see them on the ground. King said he heard the chopper overhead and tried to give the dispatcher directions for the pilot, but it still didn't work. ""I had brought toilet paper for signaling, and so I covered the top of a couple of bushes that were in more of an open area than I was in,"" King told CNN. ""They still had a hard time finding me, but I used that on the top (of the bushes) and they finally were able to locate it.""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. and Cuban officials are set to sit down together in Washington on Friday to discuss immigration and other issues, according to a State Department spokesman. ""The U.S. views the migration talks as an important opportunity for both the United States and Cuban governments to discuss policies and procedures that promote safe, legal, and orderly migration,"" State Department spokesman Michael Tran told CNN Sunday. Relations between Washington and Havana have deteriorated in recent months, in part because of Cuba's detention of American contractor Alan Gross, who has been held in Cuban prison since December. The two countries have not formally held immigration talks since February and next week provides another chance for the U.S. to call for his release. ""The United States is focused on the welfare of Alan Gross and we believe he should be released and permitted to return to his family,"" Tran said. ""This is a matter we have raised on multiple occasions with the Cuban government and that we will continue to raise with them."" In recent weeks, the United States did have discussions with Cuba about the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. And earlier, the two countries talked about earthquake assistance to Haiti. ""We intend to review trends in illegal Cuban migration to the United States, and to improve operational relations with Cuba on migration issues,"" Tran said about the agenda for Friday. ""Other matters of mutual concern may arise in our meetings, but the main purpose is to discuss migration issues.""","Talks slated for Friday .

"(CNN) -- Country music artist and sausage entrepreneur Jimmy Dean died at his home in Varina, Virginia, Sunday evening, police said. He was 81. Dean, a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, was with his wife, Donna, at the time of his death, which appears to be from natural causes, said R.J. Clark of the Henrico County Police department. Musically, Dean is best known for his song ""Big Bad John,"" which made it to No. 1 on both the country and pop charts in 1961 and was honored with a Grammy. His narrative style of song also produced hits like ""Little Black Book"" and ""P.T. 109"" -- a song about John F. Kennedy's command in the South Pacific during World War II. Starting in 1963, he hosted a successful variety show on ABC called ""The Jimmy Dean Show,"" which ran for three years. Regulars on the program included Roger Miller and puppeteer Jim Henson, making Rowlf -- a piano-playing dog -- an early Muppet favorite. In the late 1960s Dean also appeared regularly on the NBC series ""Daniel Boone."" He played Boone's friend Josh Clements. At about the same time, Dean started the Jimmy Dean Meat Company. Dean eventually sold his meat company to Sara Lee Foods in 1984, but remained its chairman and TV spokesman, which kept him in the public eye until recent years. Dean was born Seth Ward in Olton, Texas, on August 10, 1928. His mom taught him piano starting at age 10, but he also learned how to play the guitar, harmonica, and accordion. After his discharge from the Air Force in 1948 he put together a band called the Texas Wildcats and played in the Washington, D.C., area . ""We played every dive in Washington at one time or another,"" Dean said in his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame website. ""And dives is what they were."" Dean was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame this year. CNN's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","Dean was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame this year .

"(CNN) -- Former Sunday School teacher Melissa Huckaby apologized Monday in a California courtroom after being sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing her daughter's 8-year-old playmate. ""It is not enough to say that I'm sorry, but that is all I can do,"" a tearful Huckaby told a hushed courtroom about the death of Sandra Cantu, whose body was found in a suitcase in a pond on a dairy farm 10 days after she disappeared in Tracy, California, in March 2009. ""From the day Sandra has died, I've had to live with the consequences of what I have done,"" said the tearful 29-year-old woman as she daubed her eyes and blew her nose. ""For the rest of my life, I am going to have to live with these feelings of responsibility for her death. Not a day, not an hour goes by that I don't think about her."" She added, ""I loved Sandra a great deal. She was a sweet, innocent little girl who did not deserve to have such a short life. I alone am responsible for Sandra's death."" Dressed in a red prison jumpsuit and seated next to her lawyer, Huckaby directed comments to the victim's family. ""I know that I have caused you a great deal of grief, and for that I am truly sorry,"" she said.  ""I should not have taken Sandra from you, and I want you to know she did not suffer and I did not sexually molest your daughter."" Huckaby also apologized to her own family -- including ""my own daughter, whom I have lost"" -- and thanked them for their support. ""I wish I could give you an explanation,"" she said. ""I still cannot understand why I did what I did. Every day, I try to discover my motivation, but I still do not have an answer. This is a question I will struggle with for the rest of my life."" In a plea deal that removed the possibility of the death penalty, Huckaby admitted to the special circumstance of murder during the course of a kidnapping, which translates into life without parole. She has 60 days to appeal. Prosecutors had charged Huckaby with murder, kidnapping, lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14, and rape by instrument. San Joaquin County Superior Court Judge Linda Lofthus lifted a gag order and said she would consider unsealing documents related to the case.","Former Sunday School teacher sentenced to life without parole for kidnap, murder .

"(CNN) -- President Obama lauded the U.S. military in Baghdad on Tuesday during an unannounced visit to Iraq, reminding troops that the next 18 months will be difficult as the United States plans to start withdrawing its forces. President Obama greets troops during a visit to Camp Victory on Tuesday. ""I was just discussing this with your commander, but I think it's something that all of you know. It is time for us to transition to the Iraqis,"" Obama said, according to a transcript from the White House. ""They need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty. ""And in order for them to do that, they have got to make political accommodations. They're going to have to decide that they want to resolve their differences through constitutional means and legal means. They are going to have to focus on providing government services that encourage confidence among their citizens."" Obama reiterated that Iraqis must do those things themselves, and ""we can't do it for them."" ""But what we can do is make sure that we are a stalwart partner, that we are working alongside them, that we are committed to their success,"" he added.  Watch Obama thank the troops » . Obama said that in terms of training the Iraqi security forces, the U.S. must make sure ""they know that they have a steady partner with us."" Obama's visit to Iraq was the last stop on his first trip overseas as president. The president thanked the troops for giving Iraq ""the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country."" Read the transcript . The president addressed about 1,500 service members, civilians and contractors who gathered in the rotunda of the Al Faw Palace, one of dozens of palaces that were used by former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The palace is now headquarters for the Multi-National Corps. Obama last month announced the United States' plan to withdraw most of its troops from Iraq by the end of August 2010. A residual force of between 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain until December 31, 2011. There are 142,000 American troops in Iraq now. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, met Obama shortly after Air Force One landed Tuesday in Baghdad at about 4:42 p.m. The troops ""are doing extraordinary work,"" Obama said shortly after landing. ""They're just putting their heart and soul into this."" About 600 troops assembled to greet the president at Camp Victory, near the Baghdad airport. Yassin Majid, the spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, said Obama met with the prime minister, and they discussed bilateral relations and other issues. Obama also was to meet with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and the nation's two vice presidents. Ali Jalal, a businessman, called Obama's visit ""a good sign to Iraqi people, and will solve the political crisis."" ""If God wills, he [Obama] should know that Iraq belongs to Iraqis,"" Jalal said, then added, ""I ask the U.S. President Barack Obama to solve the problems of Iraqi people and to speed up the withdrawal of U.S. troops."" Government employee Nazar Sami-a said, ""His visit is for Americans' interest and not for Iraqi interest."" Obama arrived in Europe last week for a series of summits, initially meeting with world leaders at the G-20 summit in London, England, to discuss the global financial crisis. At the NATO summit in France and Germany, the president was hoping to get a boost in resources for the war in Afghanistan. He did get allies to pledge about 5,000 troops, but in the form of police and security trainers, not combat troops. During the campaign season, Obama visited Iraq on a multi-stop overseas trip. That trip also included stops in Afghanistan, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 79 percent of Americans surveyed feel that Obama has had a ""more positive"" effect on how people in other countries view the United States. Only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he's had a ""more negative"" effect. The poll also indicated that only 35 percent of Americans currently approve of the U.S. war in Iraq; 65 percent disapprove. Almost seven in 10 Americans agree with Obama's plan to remove most U.S. troops from Iraq by next August, while leaving a residual force of between 35,000 and 50,000 troops.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Melting glaciers in the Alps may prompt Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders near the Matterhorn, according to parliamentary draft legislation being readied in Rome. Glaciers in the Alps near the Matterhorn are receding, forcing the border to be redrawn. Franco Narducci of Italy's opposition Democratic Party is preparing a bill to redefine the frontier with neighboring Switzerland, his office said Wednesday. Narducci is a member of the foreign affairs panel in Italy's lower Chamber of Deputies. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini has authorized the bill. Switzerland also has cooperated with Italy on the matter. The Italian Military Geographic Institute says climate change is responsible for the Alpine glaciers melting. ""This draft law is born out the necessity to revise and verify the frontiers given the changes in climate and atmosphere,"" Narducci said. ""The 1941 convention between Italy and Switzerland established as criteria [for border revisions] the ridge [crest] of the glaciers. Following the withdrawal of the glaciers in the Alps, a new criterion has been proposed so that the new border coincides with the rock."" The border change only affects uninhabited mountaintop terrain. The deputy excludes the possibility of any family having to change citizenship. The border between Italy and Switzerland was fixed 1861, when Italy became a nation, but it has been occasionally modified, the Military Geographic Institute said. The border was last modified in the 1970s when the Switzerland-Italy highway was built at the Brogeda crossing. The bill is expected to become law by the end of April, Narducci said. Unlike Switzerland, Italy can change its border only with new laws approved by parliament. Narducci said the same negotiation will be proposed to France and Austria . ""Once upon a time, the border line demarcation between two nations was synonymous to war and bloodshed,"" he said. ""Instead , today we proceed with photograms.""","Melting glaciers in Alps forcing Italy and Switzerland to redraw their borders .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- One of the sweeping criminal complaints unveiled Thursday in New Jersey against 44 public officials and others includes a New York man accused of trying to arrange the private sale of a kidney from a donor in Israel. Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, who lives in Brooklyn and is not a licensed physician or medical professional, faces charges of acting as a human organ broker. He offered to obtain a kidney for an undercover FBI agent and a confidential witness working for authorities, the criminal complaint says. The price was $160,000. ""I am what you call a matchmaker,"" Rosenbaum is quoted as saying at a July 13 meeting with the two undercover agents. The undercover FBI agent told Rosenbaum one of her uncles needed a kidney because he had been on dialysis for two years and on a transplant list at a Philadelphia hospital, the complaint says. The first meeting took place at Rosenbaum's home on February 18, 2008, three days after the confidential witness contacted Rosenbaum by telephone, the document says. At that meeting, the complaint alleges, Rosenbaum said he could obtain a kidney for $150,000. He later raised the price to $160,000. ""I'm doing this a long time,"" the complaint says Rosenbaum told the two agents. He then added: ""Let me explain to you one thing. It's illegal to buy or sell organs. ... So you cannot buy it. What you do is, you're giving a compensation for the time."" At their last meeting, on July 13, Rosenbaum said he had been arranging kidney sales for 10 years, the complaint says. Asked how many transplants he had brokered, Rosenbaum is said to have responded, ""Quite a lot. ... Quite a lot."" Rosenbaum also told the agents he had brokered a transplant two weeks before their meeting, the document says. According to the complaint, the undercover FBI agent called a person who was the recipient of a kidney brokered by Rosenbaum, who had provided the telephone number as a reference. The person, a New Jersey-area resident identified in the complaint as Recipient 2, had paid cash for the kidney a little more than a year before the February 2009 call. The surgery was performed at a hospital outside the New Jersey area. Asked about the donor's motive, the kidney recipient replied, ""I guess he needed the money,"" according to the complaint. All of the donors ""come from Israel,"" Rosenbaum is alleged to have said. The price had gone up to $160,000, he said, because ""it's hard to get people,"" noting that Israel had passed laws prohibiting the sale of human organs, the complaint states. The agents had already paid $10,000 and were told to bring another $70,000 at a meeting scheduled for this week. ""I prefer you do it with cash,"" the complaint quotes Rosenbaum as saying. The remaining $80,000 would be due ""when I get the donor in the hospital, check them out,"" the complaint says.","Levy Izhak Rosenbaum offered to get kidney for undercover agent, complaint says .

"(CNN) -- Thailand deported about 450 Hmong refugees to Laos Monday and plans on evicting 3,900 more from a refugee camp, the government said. The forced repatriation prompted concern from human rights groups who say the refugees risk persecution in Laos. Many Hmong sided with the United States during the Vietnam War when the conflict spread to Laos. When the Communists assumed power in 1975, thousands of Hmong fled to neighboring Thailand. The U.S. State Department said Monday that the Thai government had determined that many of the Hmong were in need of protection, and that such returns would ""imperil the well-being of many individuals."" The Thai government says the Hmong at the Huay Nam Khao Camp in Petchabun province in the north had left Laos not for fear of persecution but for financial reasons. They entered Thailand illegally and could not claim political asylum, the government says. On Monday, the Thai army put 448 Hmong on buses that were headed for Laos. Many refused to leave peacefully, Army Col. Thana Jaruwat said on national television. If they did not comply, the army will have to ""enforce the law,"" he said without elaborating.","Thailand deports 450 Hmong refugees to Laos, plans on evicting 3,900 more .

"(CNN) -- An Internet video from what its posters said was one of the anti-government demonstrations last weekend in Iran shows police vehicles driving into crowds of protesters and running over at least one. In the video -- shot Sunday, according to the posting on the Web site YouTube -- green-and-white police trucks rush into crowds of protesters in the capital, Tehran. Demonstrators scatter, but one truck drives into a crowd trapped in a narrow street with a wall on one side and parked cars on the other. The camera follows the truck as it backs away, and a person briefly can be seen crumpled in the street where the truck had been. When the camera returns to the spot, another police truck drives over the person. Other protesters rush to the downed person's aid; it was not clear whether that person was killed. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, or another one obtained by CNN that shows a woman who was reportedly killed when hit by a car driven by members of the Basij, an Iranian paramilitary group. That video shows protesters transferring her body from a clinic near where she was reportedly killed to another hospital to keep her remains out of reach of security forces. Iranian authorities have said seven people were killed during Sunday's protests, which were held on the Shiite Muslim holiday of Ashura. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday the demonstrations were staged by ""the Zionists and the Americans,"" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. The demonstrations were the deadliest since June, when protests following the country's disputed presidential election left eight dead. Iranian security forces reportedly have been holding the bodies of protesters killed during the clashes. Iranian authorities say they are holding the bodies for autopsies, but the delay prevents family members from burying the bodies within 24 hours, as Islamic custom requires. Iran's chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, told reporters that seven people were killed in Sunday's clashes. Most died after being struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes,"" Dolatabadi said.","Video's posters say it shows Iranian police driving into crowds of demonstrators .

"New York (CNN) -- The mother of one of the two New Jersey men arrested last week at a New York airport allegedly on their way to fight with an al Qaeda-affiliated group in Somalia says the two men are guilty of stupidity -- but not of the sinister plan described by authorities. ""Anything makes him angry. But he's not a terrorist; he's a stupid kid,"" Nadia Alessa said of her U.S.-born son, Mahmood. Mohamed Mahmood Alessa, 20, of North Bergen, New Jersey, and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, 24, of Elmwood Park, New Jersey, are charged with one count each of conspiracy to kill, maim and murder persons outside of the United States, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The men, who were taken into custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport on June 5, intended to take separate flights to Egypt on their way to Somalia ""to join designated foreign terrorist organization Al-Shabaab and wage violent jihad,"" according to federal prosecutors. The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Newark alleges that in 2007, Alessa and Almonte traveled together to Jordan, where they intended to enter Iraq to commit violence against U.S. troops there. Nadia Alessa told CNN that her son went to 16 or 17 psychiatrists for what she called ""anger management issues"" that surfaced when he was a boy. He lived at his parents well-kept home, where his angry outbursts were common. However, she said, he wasn't particularly religious. ""He slept late. If he was devout, he would make his prayers on time. He didn't,"" she said. She helped him pack for his trip to Egypt, though she said she resisted the idea from the start. Nadia Alessa said she was reassured by a man named ""Bassim,"" who had befriended her son and Almonte. ""He said we're gonna study Arabic. I said but here there are many schools. But he say in Egypt, they're better,"" she recalled being told by the man when she expressed concerns about Alessa moving to Egypt. ""Don't worry, I take care of them,"" she said Bassim told her days before her son and Almonte were arrested boarding a flight to Egypt. She said she believes the man was an undercover federal agent who recorded her son making incendiary comments against the United States and continued to build the case against him and Almonte. ""Since I saw him, I warned my son and Carlos,"" Nadia Alessa said. ""But my son say 'Always you say about my friends they are undercover.' "" The Alessa family invited CNN on Saturday also talk to a woman who said she was set to marry Mahmood Alessa upon his arrival in Egypt. Nadia Alessa said she met her son's girlfriend the night before. The 19-year-old woman, who said her name is Siham, sat at the family's home, cloaked in a niqab, a veil that covers the entire body and face with only a sheer cloth revealing the eyes. She said she met Mahmood Alessa in an online chat room. Siham showed CNN her passport stamped June 9, 2010, indicating her arrival at Kennedy airport from Paris, France. She also produced her airline itinerary, which shows that her trip started in Cairo -- where, she says, she was waiting for Alessa. ""We were supposed to get married and study awhile in Egypt. That was the plan,"" Siham told CNN. She said she moved from Sweden, where she was born to Egyptian parents, to Cairo at Alessa's behest a few months ago. When he didn't arrive in Cairo on June 6, she was shocked to learn from a friend in New York that her soon-to-be fiance had been arrested. ""She told me that Mohamed got arrested for terrorism and that they were saying he was going to Somalia,"" Siham said in disbelief. ""So I didn't know what to do; words can't explain what I felt. I was in shock and I couldn't stop crying."" She said she boarded a flight and arrived in New York a day before Alessa's arraignment Thursday. It was then that she saw him for the first time, through a veil in a federal courtroom. ""I didn't have any ticket booked or anything. I just went to the airport and I booked a ticket from there, and I left,"" Siham said. CNN recently learned that Alessa and Almonte were followers of an extreme Islamist group based in New York. CNN obtained an image of the two suspects attending a protest in New York organized by the Islamic Thinkers Society on June 1. They appear to have been taking part in a demonstration against Israel. One is holding a banner, the other an Islamic Thinkers Society poster that includes the slogan, ""Exterminate the Zionist Roaches."" The society's video of the event, posted on its YouTube channel, has since been removed. The rally took place a week before the two men made their way to Kennedy airport and were arrested. ""My soul cannot rest till I shed blood. I wanna like be the world's [best] known terrorist,"" Alessa is alleged to have told an undercover agent in the United States last year. Later he said, ""We'll start doing killing here, if I can't do it over there."" Another image -- from late 2008 -- shows Almonte at a different rally, holding a poster that says ""Death to all Juice"" (sic). It's not clear whether that rally was organized by the Islamic Thinkers Society. When asked about the rallies Alessa attended, Siham insisted his presence was a show of outrage -- not intent. ""But that doesn't make him a terrorist. That only shows how much he dislikes what the people are doing to the Muslims,"" she said. ""That doesn't show he was going to Somalia and do anything.""","Mother of New Jersey terror suspect insists son ""not a terrorist""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican lawmakers from more than 20 states across the country are willing to take federal funding, but only on their terms. Some state lawmakers are pushing for sovereignty from the federal government. From Montana to South Carolina, lawmakers in mostly red states have pushed ahead with measures calling for state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment, saying the federal government has overstepped its bounds with the stimulus package. The states are calling for the right to ignore laws they deem unconstitutional. Oklahoma state Sen. Randy Brogdon, a Republican and the first to introduce this type of legislation last year, originally pursued it because he thought then-President Bush and Congress exceeded their authority with the Real ID Act, which required states to include certain information on driver's licenses. He called the stimulus package ""immoral and unconscionable"" and said it was ""the final straw that broke the financial back of America."" Brogdon's bill passed the state Senate on Wednesday and the state House approved a similar measure. The office of lead House sponsor Republican Rep. Charles Key said it is confident a joint resolution will get through. The legislation would be binding. So, if the governor signs it, it theoreticallly would allow Oklahoma to ignore laws that are not ""enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution,"" as stated in the Tenth Amendment. ""I'm sick and tired of Congress overreaching and underachieving,"" Brogdon said. He added, ""If we have an opportunity to salvage freedom and protect sovereignty, it has to be done at the state level."" Similar legislation is moving along in South Carolina. The bill already passed in the state House and a state Senate panel approved it on Tuesday. Republican state Rep. Lee Bright said he chose to sponsor the South Carolina measure because he thinks the stimulus package grants the federal government more power than the Constitution allows. ""The federal government is living beyond the scope that the Constitution grants it and states should put it on notice,"" Bright said. ""I haven't been pleased for some time with what the federal government gets involved in, but it came to a head with the stimulus bill."" The Republican lead sponsor of the bill in Virginia, state Rep. Christopher Peace, said his state has used only a small portion of the money allocated in the stimulus package. He said local officials are the best managers of Virginia's budget and the federal government shouldn't interfere with how the state chooses to spend its money. ""I'm not saying we don't benefit from some of the money, but it's important to question what are the roles and boundaries, and ask if Congress is exceeding them,"" Peace said. ""Our representatives in the federal government represent the same people we do and they need to work to keep the government small and limited and efficient."" All the bills invoke the Tenth Amendment, which states that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" Most are symbolic measures and none have passed yet, but local officials are hoping to send a message to Washington to back off. Many states are criticizing the stimulus package, while others are trying to assert authority over other issues, like abortion in Missouri and exempting firearms from federal regulations in Montana. Many of the bills include a provision that once the bill is passed, a copy will be sent to President Obama and Congress. ""It's time to send a message to Congress that we're sovereign,"" said state Rep. Judy Burges, an Arizona Republican. ""We have many states doing this and if you have enough sending the same message, they're going to have to step back and take a look at what they're doing.""","GOP state lawmakers pressing the issue of state sovereignty .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama outlined his final version of a health care bill Wednesday and urged Congress to bring the plan to a conclusive vote within the next few weeks. The president said his nearly $1 trillion proposal is a compromise plan that combines the best ideas of both Democrats and Republicans. He asked Congress to ""finish its work"" and end what has become a yearlong vitriolic legislative showdown over his top domestic priority. ""Everything there is to say about health care has been said, and just about everybody has said it,"" he said. ""Now is the time to make a decision about how to finally reform health care so that it works, not just for the insurance companies, but for America's families and America's businesses."" He also came out in support of a controversial legislative maneuver known as reconciliation, which would allow changes to the health care bill to be passed by the Senate with only 51 votes -- a bare legislative majority. The bill ""deserves the same kind of up-or-down vote"" that was used to pass President George W. Bush's signature tax cuts and welfare reform in the 1990s, Obama said at the White House. ""At stake right now is not just our ability to solve this problem, but our ability to solve any problem,"" he said. ""The American people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future. They are waiting for us to act."" He said he doesn't ""know how this plays politically,"" but knows that ""it's right."" Top Republicans have repeatedly said Obama's proposal amounts to a government takeover of the private health care system that will do little to control spiraling medical inflation. In recent weeks, they have reiterated their calls for the president to scrap his plan and start over. GOP leaders also fiercely oppose the use of reconciliation, saying it was never meant to be used for such a major policy change. ""I am disappointed that Democrats are moving ahead with the nuclear option,"" said Michigan Rep. Dave Camp, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. ""Big social policy changes should have bipartisan support and the support of the American people. This bill has neither. But as bad as the process for moving this bill is, the policy and its impact is far worse."" Multiple Democratic sources have told CNN that the emerging consensus plan is for the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill and send it to Obama. A package of changes that mirror the president's plan would then be passed through both chambers under reconciliation rules. Democrats increasingly brought up the prospect of using reconciliation after losing their 60-vote, filibuster-proof Senate majority in January, when GOP Sen. Scott Brown won the Massachusetts Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat. Observers note, however, that it remains unclear exactly which health care provisions can be approved under reconciliation, which is reserved for legislation pertaining to the budget. If enacted, the president's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The White House says it would extend coverage to 31 million Americans. Among other things, Obama's plan would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate increases by health insurance companies. It increases the threshold -- relative to the Senate bill passed in December -- under which a tax on high-end health insurance plans would kick in. The president's proposal also includes significant reductions in Medicare spending, in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program. It does not, however, include a government-run public health insurance option -- an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed by Republicans and key Democratic moderates. It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill worked in by Sen. Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat, that exempts that state from paying increased Medicaid expenses. Administration officials say Obama's measure would cut the deficit by $100 billion over the next 10 years. They estimate the total cost of the bill to be $950 billion in the next decade. Obama extended a final bipartisan olive branch to GOP leaders Tuesday, saying in a letter that he is willing to consider several of their ideas in a compromise plan. Among other things, the president said he is willing to commit $50 million to fund state initiatives designed to reduce medical malpractice costs. He backed undercover investigations of health care providers receiving Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs. The president also backed Medicaid reimbursement increases to doctors in certain states, and supported language ensuring certain high-deductible health plans can be offered in the health exchange. The president said his decision to consider the GOP ideas was a result of last week's health care summit. GOP leaders, however, have said they are unsatisfied with Obama's concessions. ""The only thing that will be bipartisan about this proposal will be the opposition to it,"" promised Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""The American people are not for this."" McConnell predicted that ""every election in America this fall will be a referendum on this issue.""","NEW: ""Now is the time to make a decision"" about health care reform, president says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Marathon talks between Hollywood's largest actors union and producers broke off early Saturday, with the Screen Actors Guild saying it will ask its members to authorize a strike. Screen Actors Guild members and supporters stage a rally in June at SAG's headquarters in Los Angeles, California. SAG's contract with Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers expired June 30 with the two sides unable to agree on how actors would be paid when movies and TV shows are distributed through ""new media,"" such as mobile phones and the Internet. ""As previously authorized by the national board of directors, we will now launch a full-scale education campaign in support of a strike authorization referendum,"" SAG said in a statement Saturday. There was no mention of when a strike referendum might be called. ""Let's review the facts: SAG is the only major Hollywood guild that has failed to negotiate a labor deal in 2008,"" the producers' group said in a Saturday statement. ""Now, SAG is bizarrely asking its members to bail out the failed negotiating strategy with a strike vote -- at a time of historic economic crisis. The tone-deafness of SAG is stunning."" SAG and AMPTP representatives came together under the guidance of a federal mediator Thursday for their first talks since July. The effort ended at 1 a.m. Saturday after 27 hours of talks. The producers' alliance has demanded that SAG accept terms similar to those in contracts concluded over the past year with six other unions representing writers, directors, stagehands, casting directors and a smaller actors union. ""Taken together, these six new labor agreements will keep our industry at work, allow producers to experiment with new media, and give everyone in our industry a stake in the success of new and emerging markets,"" the producers' group said Wednesday. The SAG statement suggested that a strike authorization would not immediately trigger a walkout but would strengthen the actors' bargaining position. ""Now it's time for SAG members to stand united and empower the national negotiating committee to bargain with the strength of a possible work stoppage behind them,"" it said. SAG's board of directors voted last month to ask for a federal mediator to help with the negotiations. At the same board meeting, it authorized a strike referendum in the event the mediation effort failed. Approval of a strike referendum, which requires the support of 75 percent of SAG's members, is not a foregone conclusion because Hollywood is still recovering from a costly writers strike that dragged on for 100 days just a year ago. SAG's 120,000-plus members include many who no longer pursue acting jobs or who work only occasionally. A member who joined after having just one line in one show has a vote equal to Hollywood's highest-paid stars, as long as his or her annual dues are paid.","NEW: Producers say SAG is asking members to ""bail out"" failed talks with strike vote .

"(CNN) -- Gonzalo Higuain scored the first hat-trick of the 2010 World Cup as Diego Maradona's Argentina took a big step towards qualifying for the second round by crushing South Korea 4-1 in Johannesburg on Thursday. In a tournament so far largely lacking attacking flair, the South Americans showed fine style in following up their 1-0 opening Group B victory against Nigeria, who later slipped to their second defeat as they went down 2-1 to Greece in the second match of the day in Bloemfontein. Argentina's winning margin was the second-highest so far at the South African event, behind only Germany's 4-0 thrashing of Australia. ""I have to commend my boys for the great job they have done, the only way South Korea would have made our lives difficult would have been if we had allowed them to,"" Maradona told AFP. ""We were never worried about them and they never upset us."" South Korea, who defeated the Greeks in their opening match, had battled back to 2-1 just before halftime after conceding an unlucky early own-goal, but could not contain the counter-attacking prowess of an Argentina side spearheaded by the mercurial Lionel Messi. But while Messi was an ever-present threat, it was Real Madrid striker Higuain who reaped the rewards with three close-range finishes, two in the final 15 minutes. The Koreans made the worst possible start when striker Park Chu-Young inadvertently deflected the ball into his own net off his knee in the 16th minute after teammate Park Ji-Sung failed to cut out Messi's curling free-kick from wide on the left. Higuain doubled the lead just after half an hour with a header when a cross by Maxi Rodriguez -- starting in place of the injured Juan Sebastian Veron -- was flicked on by substitute Nicolas Burdisso. Burdisso had entered the fray just minutes earlier when central defender Walter Samuel went off injured. South Korea pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as Lee Chung-Yong pounced on an error by Argentina defender Martin Demichelis, but Yeom Ki-Hun squandered a golden chance to level in the 58th minute. Argentina and South Korea win openers . Higuain made it 3-1 in the 76th minute after Messi's first shot was blocked by the legs of goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong and his second rebounded kindly off the base of the post. Messi and substitute forward Sergio Aguero then combined superbly to set up Higuain for another header four minutes later. Argentina will be without Jonas Gutierrez for the final game against Greece after the makeshift defender -- who usually plays as a winger -- received his second booking of the tournament. Victory for Greece was their first in the World Cup finals but owed much to a moment of madness by Nigeria's Sani Kaita. The Super Eagles led through a free kick from Kale Uche after 16 minutes which crept past Alexandros Tzorvas in the Greek goal. They were generally in charge until Kaita kicked out needlessly at Vasileios Torosidis and was shown a red card after 33 minutes. Greece pressed forward and equalized just before halftime as Dimitrios  Salpingidis saw his shot deflected into the net off Nigeria's Lukman Haruna. Catch CNN's World Cup twitter.buzz . It was the first-ever goal in the World Cup finals for the Greeks. The highlight of the second half was a spell which saw Theofanis Gekas  superbly denied by Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama before Nigeria broke  upfield with Yakubu Ayegbeni forcing Tzorvas into a smart save and Chinedu Ogbuke Obasi missed a clear chance on the follow-up. But soon after pulling off his fine save, Enyeama was deceived by a powerful shot by Alexandros Tziolis and Torosidis smashed in the rebound from close range for the eventual winner. The results mean Argentina are all but assured of qualification for the last 16, but still need a point in their final group game against Greece to make absolutely sure. Even Nigeria are not entirely out of it, but would require a big win over South Korea to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage.","Argentina on course for second round of World Cup after defeating South Korea 4-1 .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Long truck convoys inched their way through heavy traffic in Haiti's capital Thursday, bringing relief efforts into full view in parts of Port-au-Prince. A 40-vehicle convoy that seemed to be coming from the neighboring Dominican Republic headed into town Thursday afternoon on the Route Nationale in western Port-au-Prince. Escorted by heavily armed United Nations troops, the convoy had more than two dozen tractor-trailers, in addition to water and fuel tankers and even an armored car toward the back of the caravan. Some of the trucks carried the insignia of the Catholic Relief Services organization, while other vehicles bore markings identifying them as being from the Dominican Republic. Other aid and military vehicles traveled elsewhere in western Port-au-Prince, particularly on Boulevards T. L'Ouverture and 15 de Octobre. Residents as well as caregivers had complained earlier this week that aid was not getting out quickly enough. Full coverage | Twitter updates . For the second day in a row, the city gave indications of coming back to life. The sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks, and many small food stores were open. Dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut-filled dirt side street. A smaller market on a street corner saw some business. On the Route Nationale, residents crowded around the back of a parked brown semi-tractor trailer for hours before the back doors opened and local aid workers handed each person a six-pack of bottled water. The throng seemed relatively orderly, and no commotion was noticed. Long lines formed in front of some of the city's money-transfer offices, which opened for the first time since the January 12 quake that shattered large parts of Port-au-Prince. Haitians in line were there to pick up money sent to them from elsewhere, mainly the United States. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Streets were choked with tap-taps, the brightly painted small pickup trucks that have been converted into passenger minibuses, with 10 or 12 people sitting on two facing benches on the truck bed. Many tap-taps carry Christian inspirations such as ""Jesus saves"" on their windshields and have intricate designs and messages on the side walls. Haitian police and U.N. military vehicles were common, and local authorities seemed to take an increased posture. Five national police officers, easily identified by their camouflage uniforms, jumped out of their truck at an intersection in the Cite de Soleil neighborhood near the harbor. They investigated men at the rear of two small pickups stopped there. One officer dropped to his right knee and briefly pointed his rifle toward the men. He and the other officers then abruptly turned around and walked away a few seconds later. Impact Your World . Cite de Soleil is the poorest and roughest neighborhood in the city, known more for its rampant crime and violence than its poetic-sounding name. Like all other parts of Port-au-Prince, many residents say it has fallen into increasing disrepair since the 1980s. A nearby neighborhood, Carrefour, was once a tourist destination but has become a run-down, lower-class neighborhood.","A 40-vehicle convoy loaded with supplies heads into western Port-au-Prince .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Henry Ford once described history as ""one damned thing after another."" And he didn't even live in Louisiana. Much has been made of my ""outburst"" toward the Obama administration on May 26, with George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America,"" when I exclaimed, ""Man, you got to get down here and take control of this! Put somebody in charge of this thing and get this moving. We're about to die down here!"" But those emotions had been percolating below the surface like the crude that threatens our way of life today. While it is important to note that both BP's and the administration's tepid responses to this catastrophe are unacceptable, it is also essential that the rest of the country understand that this feeling of neglect has festered amongst South Louisianians for generations. It's just one damned thing after another, so the anger rising out of the Gulf is not new. For too long, the federal government and industry alike have simultaneously abused and neglected, patronized and plundered, and now polluted the people of Louisiana. And our plight now is a national emergency. We felt the effects of this neglect for the past five years, after rebuilding a city which was 80 percent flooded due to shoddy construction of flood control systems and levees by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. And we feel ourselves ever more vulnerable due to the nonstop degradation of our wetlands, which serve as our first line of defense against hurricanes and powerful storm surge. For decades, massive engineering projects across the country have made us more vulnerable. We lose a chunk of land the size of a football field every 38 minutes. Since World War II, we've lost wetlands the size of the state of Delaware. I bet Joe Biden would be screaming on national television too if it was happening on his turf. Or if the Hamptons lost 16,000 acres a year, you bet there'd be a Million Hedge-Fund Managers March on Washington to demand action. And the loss of coastal wetlands has everything to do with activities across the rest of the country, starting with the deprivation of natural sediment that the Mississippi River should carry to its mouth and dump at the Gulf of Mexico to nourish our barrier islands. The Mississippi River system drains more than 30 states. Part of the sediment is lost by the damming of rivers in the system in the 1950s to provide electricity as well as flood protection for states like North Dakota and Missouri. According to historian John Barry, our sediment level is only 30 to 40 percent of the natural amount, which is why we are losing such valuable land so quickly. Then the oil companies dredged canals in the marshlands in an attempt to grow an industry which now provides the country with more than 30 percent of its domestic oil and natural gas. Saltwater intrusion is killing the marsh. These marshlands provide jobs for tens of thousands of fisherman in an industry that provides over 30 percent of this country's domestic seafood supply. Canals were also dredged for shipping. Five of the nation's top 15 ports are located in South Louisiana. So in essence, we are the gateway of commerce to much of the lower 48 states. Add that to the fact that we have not seen a single penny of royalties for oil produced more than six miles off our coast. We assume all of the risk, produce seafood and oil and gas, with none of the reward. Royalties totaling $165 billion have gone to the federal treasury when they could go to help repair this pressing issue. But there's more. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, federal judge Stanwood Duval Jr. found that the Army Corps of Engineers had displayed ""gross negligence ... insouciance, myopia, and shortsightedness."" He continued, ""The Corps not only knew, but admitted by 1988, that the [Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Project] threatened human life."" And yet, nothing was done about it until recently. And then BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster hits, which is the deadliest combination imaginable of corporate greed and governmental malfeasance. We've been lied to by BP at every turn, from oil-flow estimates to the existence of plumes to health effects. There's also the blatant malpractice and corruption in the Minerals Management Service. Free meals, cushy seats at sporting events, and other gifts from the folks they were trying to regulate seemed to cloud the judgment of too many MMS officials to be bothered with protecting the interests of our residents and our way of life. In case anyone misses the point here, let me state it bluntly: There is nothing natural about the great engineering failure of 2005 in Orleans and Saint Bernard Parishes. There is nothing natural about the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico today. Both were the result of shoddy engineering on the part of private industry, which was in both cases supposed to be regulated and overseen by the federal government. Every penny that has been allocated to the hurricane recovery in Orleans and Saint Bernard is owed to us, and every penny in the future that will be allocated as a result of this current catastrophe is owed to us. We do not seek charity, but we do demand justice. So we've had two monumental, mostly preventable man-made disasters in five years, which brings us to the moment where I said on television the thing that every person who lives south of the Interstate 10/Interstate 12 corridor agrees with. We've been abused, neglected and exploited for too long. And to be brutally honest, part of my frustration is a sense of personal shame that I have known this was going on for a long time, and I was ineffective in making Louisiana's case in my years in Washington. But let me say that it's now time to draw a line in the alluvial mud. We want our fair share of oil revenues now so that we can protect ourselves. And we want to be treated like we matter. And we're not whiners. We produce oil and gas and produce seafood and allow goods to flow freely to the heartland. We assume the risks with little reward. Jobs and livelihoods are at stake. In the end, whatever past transgressions by the country toward us or whatever our failures to articulate our plight have been, we should be reminded of the words of Admiral Lord Nelson just before the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805: ""England expects that every man will do his duty."" And in this, the most critical hour in our region's long, tortured, and yet glorious history, let's remind ourselves that Louisiana expects every person to do his or her duty. This is a struggle for the preservation of our culture, way of life, and the land we love. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville: Louisiana has been abused and neglected too long .

"(CNN) -- Motorists in Ohio, beware: Speeding is in the eye of the beholder, especially when police are the ones guesstimating. The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled a trained officer's ""visual estimation"" of a vehicle going over the posted speed limit is enough to convict a motorist. Local law enforcement agencies say the ruling in their favor does not mean they will stop using radar guns, while the guilty driver's lawyer says the decision ""stinks."" That man was cited for going nearly 20 mph over the posted limit. The state high court by a 5-1 vote said a trained officer's guess was, by itself, enough to allow a ticket for speeding. ""A police officer's unaided visual estimation of a vehicle's speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of [state law] without independent verification of the vehicle's speed if the officer is trained, is certified by the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of the communities they serve,"" wrote the state justices. The said a radar gun was ''not necessary to support a conviction for speeding.'' The case involved Mark Jenney, who was traveling along Route 21 near Akron two years ago in his black SUV. Officer Christopher Santimarino of the Copley, Ohio, Police Department was in his parked patrol car and saw Jenney drive by and determined the motorist was speeding. He was cited for going 79 in a 60 mph zone. At trial, the officer testified the radar unit he was using at the time clocked the vehicle at 82 mph but that reading was tossed by the judge after Santimarino could not producer a copy of his radar-training certificate when requested. Santimarino -- who said he had performed ""hundreds"" of past visual estimations -- claimed he cited Jenney for only 79 mph ""to give him a break on the personal appearance in court."" The judge in upholding the conviction concluded the officer's ""strongest"" testimony was his visual estimation, but amended the citation to say Jenney was only going 70 mph. For his part, Jenney said he was not speeding and that the real culprit was a tractor-trailer that was passing his SUV at the time. Copley police defended their officer's actions. ""Officers can rely on their unaided visual estimation of a vehicle's speed, but the intent is not to allow officers to routinely issue tickets based solely upon unaided visual observations,"" said Chief Mike Mier. John Kim, the attorney representing Jenney, said the decision ""stinks"" and expressed disappointment the state court did not rule on his main point -- when radar readings are disqualified, visual estimations should also be dismissed. ''I'm really surprised,'' Kim said. ''I never expected the ruling to come out this way.'' Jenney paid the $177 fine, and his lawyer says he has no further plans to appeal. The case is City of Barberton v. Jenney (2010-Ohio-2420).","Ohio court rules police can ticket speeders with ""visual estimation""

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- In the hours after a 2005 refinery explosion that left 15 people dead, a BP executive suggested a holiday weekend and the national furor over a Florida woman's last days would eclipse the tragedy. With the oil company now battling to save an image tarnished by the worst oil spill in U.S. history, the lawyer who found that e-mail among a mountain of BP documents says nothing appears to have changed. ""Their strategy is the same every time ... And it's always, first, damage control,"" Brent Coon told CNN. ""And with damage control, they accentuate the positive, downplay the negative, tell everybody they're sorry, they're gonna fix it, they're gonna do better, and not to worry."" Coon represented many of the victims of the March 2005 explosion at BP's refinery in Texas City, near Houston. The blast killed 15 workers and injured 180, with many of the survivors suffering severe burns, amputations and broken bones. During litigation that followed, Coon extracted about 7 million documents from the company, including the e-mail that discussed whether the upcoming Easter weekend would push the explosion off the public stage. SIU blog: Internal e-mail shows how BP handles a crisis . ""Looks like injuries and loss of life are heavy. Expect a lot of follow up coverage tomorrow. Then I believe it will essentially go away -- due to the holiday weekend,"" BP America public relations chief Patricia Wright advised other executives. Wright added, ""This is a very big story in the U.S. right now -- but the Terry Schiavo story is huge as well."" Read the email . Schiavo was the severely brain-damaged Florida woman whose case became the centerpiece of a national right-to-die battle, and the controversy was reaching a climax just as the Texas City explosion occurred. Coon said the document made him ""sick to my stomach."" But he says the stacks of paper, e-mails and slides uncovered after the Texas City blast offer a rare insight into the culture of BP and may take on a new meaning in light of the massive Gulf spill. BP is now under fire for its failure to shut down a ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico, a spill that now dwarfs the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Critics say it has downplayed the scale of the disaster, underreported the amount of oil leaking and is trying to keep images of the gusher under wraps. With its stock plummeting and the environmentally friendly image it spent years cultivating taking a beating, the company has taken out full-page newspaper ads and aired television spots in which CEO Tony Hayward apologizes for the spill and vows, ""We will make this right."" But Coon said BP appears to be following ""the same course of conduct"" it did after Texas City. ""I don't think there's a shred of evidence in BP's favor that shows that they've done anything to change their corporate safety culture,"" he said. BP has not responded to multiple requests for interviews with either CEO Tony Hayward or another executive familiar with the Texas City documents. At least four of the people included on Wright's e-mail are still working as spokespeople for BP, CNN has found. The Gulf spill began when the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon, owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd., blew up and sank off Louisiana, taking 11 workers with it. BP, Transocean and oilfield services contractor Halliburton all have pointed fingers at each other in hearings in Washington and in New Orleans. Coon says the documents his law firm unearthed in the Texas City case showed BP employees warned that corners at the plant were being cut, and dangerous conditions were being ignored. ""Quit waiting for a known possible disaster to happen before correcting the problem,"" one worker wrote. Another stated, ""This company deliberately put my life in danger to try and save a buck."" A third complained, ""If this facility was an aircraft carrier, we would be at the bottom of the ocean."" Read BP employees' comments . ""What was shocking was that we didn't just find that smoking gun,"" Coon said. ""We found an entire arsenal. You could have fitted an army with all of the smoking guns that we found in this."" Also among the documents that turned up in the lawsuit was a guide to filling out incident reports, created by lawyers hired by BP, that urged workers to ""avoid language that is negative, inflammatory or implies criminal intent or willful misconduct."" Coon dubbed one slide from the BP presentation the ""dirty words document,"" which tells workers to avoid terms like ""reckless,"" ""careless"" or ""incompetent."" ""They don't want to have anything in any of their reports or anything in writing that indicates that they did anything wrong,"" he said. The Texas City blast killed 15 BP contractors who were housed in a trailer near the site of the explosion, which originated with equipment used to boost the octane levels in gasoline. In 2007, BP pleaded guilty to a felony, agreed to pay $21 million in fines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and paid another $50 million in criminal penalties in connection with the disaster. The plea agreement required the company to fix the problems that led to the explosion. But when that didn't happen, they fined BP again in 2009 -- an $87 million proposed penalty that would be the largest in the agency's history if upheld. BP is contesting those citations and the assessed penalties. Coon said the Texas City case shows BP ""has a lot of systemic problems that they are never going to change unless somebody makes them change."" ""If they don't make them change, something worse is going to happen,"" he said. ""And it won't be that long.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Blogger Perez Hilton said he has no regrets about posting a Twitter message that linked to a controversial upskirt photo of Miley Cyrus this week. Suggestions that Hilton violated child porn laws reverberated online because some people believed it showed the 17-year-old singer-actress's private parts. Hilton, appearing on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show"" Thursday, said people ""are getting upset over an image they didn't see."" ""You didn't see anything down there,"" Hilton told Behar. ""I can't help it, Joy, if America has a very dirty imagination."" The photo appeared to have been digitally altered to give the impression that Cyrus was not wearing underwear, according to Behar, who saw a copy of the photo provided by Hilton. ""I feel like if everyone saw this image in question, they would clearly see that you're not seeing anything down there that you're not supposed to,"" Hilton said. ""It's definitely not child pornography and it's definitely not illegal."" A spokesman with the U.S. Attorney office in Los Angeles said there was no criminal investigation into Hilton's posting. Other photos taken at the same time clearly showed panties under her white dress, Hilton said. ""The point of me choosing that one photo is because it was showing Miley getting out of the car in an unladylike fashion,"" he said. ""And I just thought that was funny and in keeping with her shocking behavior of late, because she was very well aware that she was in a public place at a video shoot and that there were paparazzi present."" Hilton has frequently satirized Miley Cyrus, a teenaged Disney star who is approaching adulthood with cameras constantly tracking her. ""It's not actually doing anything worse than Miley herself has been doing recently, from grinding up on her 40-something-year-old director to pole dancing to all the over-sexualized things that she has been doing and turning herself into this creature,"" he said. The photo never appeared on Hilton's celebrity gossip website, but was linked to a message he sent to the 2 million followers of his Twitter account. ""I would have posted the image on my site had I been able to, but it was taken by one photo agency that I don't have a deal with,"" he said. ""So I've learned my mistake in the past about using photos that I don't have licenses to."" The offending photo disappeared from its original online location by Monday morning, although it was republished on some other sites. Hilton thrives off such controversies, including when he asked Miss California about her same-sex marriage views at last year's Miss USA pageant. Carrie Prejean, who was a runner-up in the competition, became the center of a public frenzy as a result. While the controversy may drive readers to Hilton's site, he acknowledged that it also drove an advertiser away. ABC pulled ads for its TV show ""The View"" from his site, he said. ABC is owned The Walt Disney Company, which also produced Miley Cyrus's show.","Hilton linked to controversial photo in a Twitter message .

"(CNN) -- A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund. The Cat Ba leopard gecko is found exclusively in Cat Ba Island National Park in northern Vietnam. The discovery of 100 new plants, 28 fish, 18 reptiles, 14 amphibians, two mammals and one bird species highlights the extent of the biodiversity in the region, said Barney Long, head of the WWF's Asian Species Conservation program. ""It's a melting pot of diverse habitats. It has some of the wettest forests on the planet, high mountains, and a diverse array of terrestrial and marine habitats, including the Mekong River,"" he said. ""We continue to find new species of fish, primates and mammals, and nowhere else compares to the amount of large mammals that have been discovered in the region. It shows how little we know about species in the region,"" he said. ""From a biodiversity perspective, there are still huge amounts to discover about region."" The Greater Mekong consists of the countries through which the Mekong River flows: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Yunnan Province of China. With 16 global ecoregions -- areas defined by their shared ecological features and animal communities -- the Greater Mekong has more protected spaces than anywhere else on mainland Asia, according to the WWF. The colorful Cat Ba leopard gecko of northern Vietnam has large, orange-brown ""catlike eyes"" and a body of leopard stripes, according to a report released Friday. Its name refers to its place of origin, Cat Ba Island, the largest of 366 islands in Cat Ba Archipelago and home to many rare species that can only be found on the island. Scientists believe the high number of species unique to the island might be due to the long separation of the island from continental Vietnam, the report says. Limnonectes megastomias -- a fanged frog with an appetite for other frogs, insects and birds -- has only been found in three remote areas of medium-to-high altitudes in eastern Thailand. Globally, new species of mammals are rare finds, but in 2008 alone, new species of the mouselike musk shrew and a tube-nosed bat emerged from the region.  See photos of newly discovered species » . War and political unrest have kept large parts of the region, particularly Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, off-limits to scientific exploration up until the past two decades, Long said. Since 1997, nearly 1,200 new species have been discovered, many that cannot be found anywhere else, said Dekila Chungyalpa, director of WWF's Greater Mekong Program. But the rapid pace of development in the Mekong region, coupled with the effects of climate change, are threatening to drive the species into extinction, Chungyalpa said. ""As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing,"" she said. Chungyalpa said conservative estimates by the WWF project a 1-meter rise in sea level on the delta's coastline over the next decade, which will affect not only marine life, but also people who rely on the delta as a source of sustenance and employment, she said. In 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Fourth Assessment Report, which projected that global sea levels could rise from 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) over the next century based on six possible scenarios. Already, Chungyalpa said, the area has been affected by an increase in tropical storms off the coast, which brings in more seawater and changes the flooding patterns in the delta. Some researchers, however, have questioned the link between climate change and more intense tropical storms. Apart from climate change, construction of dams and hydropower plants along the delta could further disrupt its waters, potentially displacing millions, destroying sources of drinkable water and disrupting the production of rice, Chungyalpa said. ""The delta is the rice bowl of the region. What will happen to people who depend on it if it's no longer there?"" she said. The WWF says it supports the idea of an agreement among the Mekong countries on how to respond to infrastructure development and climate change in terms of protecting its natural resources and people. ""Climate change is making it obvious that we can't treat development like it's a separate issue,"" she said. ""We need to be addressing this issue now. It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it.""","Discoveries highlight extent of region's biodiversity, World Wildlife Fund says .

Students start groups on social networking Web sites to discuss the dogs they left at home. (UWIRE) -- For freshman Elise Chen, home is only a phone call away. It's keeping in touch with Sammy, her collie-lab mix, that's the problem. ""I can talk to my dog on the phone, but I don't get anything out of it,"" Chen said. Chen is not the only student who misses her pet, an integral part of many families. According to membership in Facebook groups dedicated to the topic, at least 44,845 others are in the same boat. There are at least six groups dedicated to missing one's pet on the social networking site; the largest, ""I love college, but I miss my dog,"" stands at 31,056 members. The group's wall is full of declarations of love for dogs at home, often accompanied by pictures and funny stories in the photo and discussion board sections. Chen, one of the group's newest members, said she joined when she realized the forum was a literal representation of missing her dog. In some respects, Chen said, she actually misses her dog more than she misses her parents. ""My dog never says 'Go to bed,' or 'You have to be in by two,' "" she said. ""My dog just says, 'I'm happy to see you, even if it's 2:30 in the morning.' "" GW's Facebook network has its own group for pet lovers: ""I Miss My Dog."" Its 89 members frequently post pictures of their ""four- and sometimes three-legged friends at home,"" as the group's description states. The group's active members use it as a way to further express themselves on Facebook and to cope with missing their animals back home. Like Chen, junior Jared Stone said he did not realize how much his dogs were a part of his life until he came to college. ""In the past, I had always been at home and always been around my dogs,"" Stone said. ""I was used to having them nearby and petting them while watching TV. So in college, their absence hit me and I found the group on Facebook an accurate representation of how I was feeling."" Although a freshman like Chen is still adjusting to college life away from pets, Stone has learned that students must learn to deal with missing their pets. ""Friends fill the gap so much, but can only go so far,"" he said. ""I've overcome it, but it's still nothing you can really get over."" Many students, including law student and ""I Miss My Dog"" member Rebecca Rodgers, hope to eventually have dogs of their own, but they know that college is not conducive to pet ownership. ""My studio is no place for a dog and definitely not with a crazy law school schedule,"" Rodgers said. When Rodgers misses her Australian shepherd, Missy, she turns to the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube. ""I tend to watch (my) particular breed of dog, Australian shepherds,"" Rodgers said. ""Seeing other people's dogs makes me miss mine a little less."" Chen also uses technology to cope, though in a more personal manner. ""I video chat with my dog,"" she said. Although she does not plan on getting a dog on campus any time soon, she jokes about adopting a ""hallway dog"" for Lafayette, where she lives this year. The Internet and hopes for the future, though good coping aids, can only help those missing their pets to an extent. Rodgers said, ""Sometimes I look over my shoulder and expect a dog to follow me around.""","College student: I miss my dog more than I miss my parents .

"(Mental Floss) -- Although Portuguese striker Eusebio scored nine goals in the 1966 World Cup and England's Geoff Hurst booted four goals to lead the home team to victory, neither of them was the real most valuable player of that year's Cup. That distinction went to an English pooch named Pickles. As part of the ramp-up to hosting the 1966 World Cup, English soccer officials had been displaying the Jules Rimet Trophy that went to the Cup's winner in various places around the country. That March, the trophy had been residing in Methodist Central Hall in the Westminster area of London under the watchful eyes of five guards. Mental Floss: 7 really tiny towns . Something went awry on the morning of March 20, though. The guard who normally stayed at the trophy's side had the day off, and at some point when the other four members of the security detail were enjoying their coffee or a quick trip to the bathroom, thieves broke in a back door of the hall and swiped the trophy. As you might imagine, this theft didn't reflect too well on England. Hosting the World Cup is a complex, logistically difficult operation, and while everything may not go totally smoothly, FIFA at least expects host countries not to lose the trophy itself. The theft immediately became the biggest story in the British press, and crackpot theories and false leads soon inundated Scotland Yard. Mental Floss: Weird stolen items like Hulk Hogan's toilet seat . Eventually, the police received a ransom demand: the thief would return the trophy in exchange for £15,000 in small bills. Scotland Yard and soccer officials reluctantly went along with this plan, but a trailing police van spooked the thief before he led them to trophy. After police apprehended the suspect, a petty grifter named Edward Betchley, he claimed he was only a middleman who was working for a shady, possibly fictitious character known as ""The Pole."" Mental Floss: 10 stars who started on Sesame Street . The police had their man, but they were still short one Jules Rimet Trophy. That's where Pickles, a four-year-old mutt, entered the picture. On March 27, Pickles was out for a walk with his owner, David Corbett, in South London when something under a hedge distracted the pup. Pickles insisted on investigating this hedge and eventually pulled out a newsprint parcel tied together with string. When Corbett opened the parcel, he realized that Pickles had found the Jules Rimet Trophy. It's still not clear how the trophy ended up under the hedge in the first place. Mental Floss: Look what the dog swallowed! Corbett ran the trophy to his local police station, but the cops thought the story of Pickles miraculously finding the trophy in a hedge was a bit far-fetched. They initially thought Corbett was a suspect for the theft; detectives even questioned him until 2:30 a.m. and made him stand in a lineup before clearing his alibi for the day of the burglary. Once Corbett was cleared, the media got the story, and Pickles became an international star. Offers to visit foreign countries rolled in for the heroic hound, and he received a free year's supply of dog food. Pickles even starred in a feature film, ""The Spy With the Cold Nose."" At the height of Pickles' popularity, he was earning £60 a day for Corbett. Mental Floss: Why do hockey fans throw things on the ice? Better still, when the English team won the World Cup that year, the players asked for Pickles to attend the celebratory banquet and even let him lick their plates clean. Corbett received a £3,000 reward that he used to buy a house in Surrey. Sadly, Pickles didn't live to see the next World Cup. And the Jules Rimet Trophy wasn't much luckier. When Brazil won the Cup for the third time in 1970, it earned the right to keep the trophy in perpetuity; the familiar FIFA World Cup trophy someone will win next month made its debut in 1974. Thieves stole the Jules Rimet Trophy from a locked case in Brazil in December 1983. Tell your pups to keep their eyes open; the purloined trophy still hasn't been recovered.

"(CNN) -- A Food and Drug Administration review of data on the effectiveness of flibanserin -- a pill anticipated to become the first ""female Viagra"" -- resulted in questions about how well the drug will actually work in treating premenopausal women suffering from low sex drive. According to a report posted on the FDA website Wednesday, when compared with a placebo, the response rate of Flibanserin was ""not compelling,"" and the drug yielded only slight improvements for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder or HSDD. On Friday, an FDA committee composed of reproductive health experts will be voting on the efficacy and safety of Flibanserin for use in women with low desire -- a sexual disorder that could impact nearly 40 percent of women in the United States, according to some estimates. Currently, there is no medication approved to treat HSDD in women. A spokesperson for Germany-based Boehringer Ingelheim, the manufacturer of flibanserin, says the company is still optimistic. ""We remain confident that our data demonstrates Flibanserin is safe and effective in balancing the chemicals in the brain linked to sexual desire,"" says Peter Piliero, executive director of U.S. medical affairs for Boehringer Ingelheim. ""We have conducted a robust program showing that flibanserin shows improvement increasing satisfying sexual events, in improving sexual desire and lowering distress,"" he adds. Even if the data show only ""slight improvements,"" the benefits of approving the drug are vast, contends Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California. ""HSDD is a horrible tragedy in women,"" says Goldstein, who treats patients suffering from low sex drive, and who has also been on the drug manufacturer's international advisory committee for several years. He says flibanserin would be ""the beginning of an era"" for women, and that having a safe and effective drugs is a ""unique and historic opportunity for women in the U.S. and for the FDA.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran announced Wednesday that it successfully tested another ""Sajil"" missile, a surface-to-surface missile with a range that makes it capable of reaching parts of Europe. Image purportedly shows the test launch of Iran's new Sajil surface-to-surface missile. A similar test was carried out in November. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he understood Wednesday's test of the missile, with an approximate range of 1,200 miles, was successful. State media reported that the missile, a Sajil-2, was launched Wednesday morning from the northern Iranian city of Semnan and reached its target. The report did not say where it landed. The missile was test-fired successfully, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a group of residents in Semnan province, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Ahmadinejad said the missile ""met the predetermined target,"" according to the news agency. Gates said he could not confirm that it had hit the intended target. A White House official said the test is noteworthy. ""I think it is a significant technical development,"" said Gary Samore, special assistant to the president on nonproliferation, in a Washington speech Wednesday. ""Of course, this is just a test, and obviously there is much work to be done before it can be built and deployed. But I see it as a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capacity to deliver weapons,"" Samore said. ""And I think it actually helps us in terms of making a case to countries like Russia, which were skeptical in the past whether Iran actually poses a threat. This is a very clear demonstration that Iran is moving in the direction of longer-range missiles."" An Israeli official, meanwhile, said the test should be more of a concern to Europe than to Israel, since previous missiles tested by Iran could already reach the Jewish state. ""If anyone had any doubt, it is now clear that the Iranians are playing with fire,"" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said Wednesday in an interview on Kol Israel Radio. ""We know that the Iranians are developing capabilities of thousands of kilometers, that could reach the coasts of the United States."" ""The Iranian clock is ticking fast and it must be stopped,"" Ayalon said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama ""expressed ... his great concern, his continued concern, about Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and nuclear weapons technology."" The Sajil is a new generation of surface-to-surface Iranian-made missiles that ""demonstrates a significant leap in Iran's missile capabilities,"" Uzi Rubin, the former director of Israel's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, told Jane's Information Group after the November test. ""Regardless of the success of the test, this missile places Iran in the realm of multiple-stage missiles, which means that they are on the way to having intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities,"" he said. Sajil missiles are powered by solid fuel, which uses smaller containers and helps the rockets travel longer distances, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Iran says the missiles have a range of almost 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles). If that is true, the missile brings Moscow, Russia, Athens, Greece, and southern Italy within striking distance from Iran, according to Jane's, which provides information on defense issues. Gates said the missile was probably ""on the low end of that range."" After the November launch, the United States restated its objection to such tests, saying they violate Iran's obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions. U.S. officials have cast doubt on the success of past missile test launches by Iran, including a rocket launch in August and a series of missile tests in July. Wednesday's reported test comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss how to deal with the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran. He met Tuesday with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner. Obama, who met with Netanyahu on Monday, stuck by his refusal to commit to an ""artificial deadline"" for Iranian negotiations on its nuclear program. But he also warned that he would not allow such talks, which he expects to accelerate after the Iranian presidential election in June, to be used as an excuse for delay. He said the United States is not ""foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious."" Netanyahu wanted a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions, with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached. Asked if the missile launch will dampen Obama's efforts to reach out diplomatically to Iran, Gibbs said, ""The president and the prime minister [Netanyahu] both agreed on Monday that engaging the people and the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, something that hasn't been tried for the past many years, is something that makes sense."" Both Israel and the United States believe that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program; Tehran denies the accusation. Israeli leaders have pointed to Ahmadinejad's calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, and argue that quick action is needed. Netanyahu called Iran the biggest threat to peace in the region. ""If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, could actually give [them] nuclear weapons. And that would put us all in great peril,"" he said. Obama is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the Arab and Muslim world than Netanyahu. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Pam Benson, Charley Keyes and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Iran says it fired a Sajil missile, which uses solid fuel and travels long distances .

"KINGSTON, Ontario (CNN)  -- For Shona Holmes, simple pleasures such as playing with her dog or walking in her plush garden are a gift. Canadian Shona Holmes, who had a brain tumor, sought medical care in the United States. After suffering from crushing headaches and vision problems, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor four years ago. She was told if it wasn't removed, she could go blind or even die. ""They said to me that you had a brain tumor and it was pressing on your optic chasm and that it needed to come out immediately,"" Holmes said. Holmes is Canadian, but the ""they"" she refers to are doctors at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, where she turned after specialists in her own government-run health care system would not see her fast enough. ""My family doctor at that time tried to get me in to see an endocrinologist and a neurologist,"" Holmes recalled. ""It was going to be four months for one specialist and six months for the other.""  Watch Holmes talk about her experience in getting treatment » . Even with the warning from U.S. doctors in hand, Holmes said she still couldn't get in to see Canadian specialists. Because the government system is the only health care option for Canadians, she says she had no choice but to have the surgery in the U.S. Her treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona cost $100,000, and she and her husband put a second mortgage on their home and borrowed from family and friends to pay for it. When she recounts that part of her painful story, she weeps. ""That's the stuff that I find so tragic -- having dinner with my friends and I know how much money I owe them,"" Holmes says, tears streaming down her face. With the health care reform debate raging in the U.S., Republicans in Washington are seizing on Holmes' story and other accounts from Canada to warn against government involvement in the health care system. The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asserted several times on the Senate floor last month that a government-run health insurance option, which President Obama and Democrats want, could lead to a government-controlled health care system like Canada's. Watch McConnell talk about Canada's health care system . McConnell singled out Kingston General Hospital in Ontario as a prime example of what Americans should be fearful of: staggering delays in treatment. CNN went to Kingston General and played a DVD for its chief of staff Dr. David Zelt of McConnell slamming the hospital. Zelt insists McConnell's numbers -- an average of 340 days wait time for knee replacements, 196 days for hip replacements -- are an exaggeration. ""I find it very frustrating that someone of that stature would not really have true knowledge of the numbers he is actually quoting on things,"" Zelt told us, saying the average wait time for a knee replacement is actually 109 days, and a hip replacement is 91 days.  Watch Zelt talk about Canada's health care system » . However, Zelt does concede that in Canada's system, where every Canadian citizen is covered, there are limited resources, shortages and often delays. ""In our health care system, we're looking at what we have to do to prioritize patients -- critically ill versus purely elective surgeries,"" Zelt said. ""I'm not going to say we don't have issues with timeliness for some things. It does happen. But again take the other side of the coin -- these patients have access. They're on somebody's waiting list if they have a problem, and I think the senator would need to look at that issue. Yes it may take time, but they will get seen."" McConnell's remarks have not only ruffled feathers with Ontario's doctors but also with government officials across the border. Canadian Sen. Hugh Segal, whom we met up with at Kingston's picturesque waterfront, says his ""fellow conservatives"" to the south are dead wrong about Canada's health care system. ""The notion that we have some bureaucrat standing next to every doctor between the patient and that doctor is a complete creation, there is no truth to that at all,"" Segal said.  Watch Canadian senator challenge McConnell's assertions » . ""What you have is a longer life span, better outcomes and about one-third less costs. That's what you have."" What Segal, Zelt and other Canadian officials underscore is that their government-run system is driven by the value of the care and that the quantity of tests and procedures don't necessarily equal quality. ""You can have a patient from the hospital with abdominal pain as an example, and you can run him through every high-tech equipment, CT scan, MRIs -- it's unlimited,"" Zelt said. ""But then you have to take a step back and look at that. What's the cost of doing those types of investigations, and what's the value really added to the patient?"" Despite Shona Holmes' horror story about her inability to get timely treatment for a brain tumor, Canadian officials and doctors insist most life-threatening cases are treated quickly. Toronto's Doug Wright can attest to that. The 40-year-old father of three young boys found out last month he has cancer -- a tumor on his leg. But he says he never had to wait more than five days to see a specialist or get a test. And from diagnosis to surgery, it will be just over a month. ""The community medical system thought this process could not have been any better. I have not had to wait to see some of the best specialists in the country, who are renowned internationally,"" Wright said.  Watch Wright talk about his treatment » . An investment adviser, Wright has the money to go to the U.S. for his care, but says there is no need. But Wright recognizes one reason he has gotten such a rapid response from Canadian doctors is because he has cancer. ""The bad news is I didn't have to wait for anything, because you don't have to wait when it's a serious issue,"" he said. Still, people can wait for months, or even years, for elective surgery. Wright's friend Rick Hession has a heart condition that could cause a stroke, but he has a three-month wait or more for an operation to help correct it. He says he can't exercise the way he would like to until he gets the surgery, but he's willing to wait. He calls it a small price to pay for free health coverage for all Canadians. ""I'm OK with it, and I think most people I talk to find they really are [willing to wait],"" says Hession.  Watch Hession talk about waiting for treatment » . The reality is that despite GOP rhetoric to the contrary, no Democratic plan now on the table calls for a Canadian-like government run health care system. But in talking to doctors, government officials and even average Canadians, they concede their system is far from perfect, but there is one statistic they are quite proud of: All Canadians have health coverage. That's 33 million people, compared with the 47 million uninsured in the U.S.","Woman with tumor said wait would have been too long; she got costly U.S. treatment .

"(CNN) -- The FBI announced Wednesday that it is working with Illinois state and local police to review evidence related to the 1982 Tylenol murders. James W. Lewis served time for sending a $1 million extortion note to Johnson & Johnson. ""This review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity,"" the FBI said in a written statement. ""Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence."" The anniversary coincided with a number of tips to law enforcement agencies related to the crimes, the FBI said. Agents on Wednesday searched the Cambridge, Massachusetts, house of James W. Lewis, who was convicted of sending an extortion note to Johnson & Johnson but denied having anything to do with the poisonings. Lewis's wife LeAnn is listed as administrator of a Web design company called Cyberlewis.com. Its Web site lists the company's address as the same address that authorities searched Wednesday. On its Web site is posted a note that says, in part, "" ... I was villified (sic) globally as the Tylenol Man, accused of being the mass murderer who spiked Tylenol with cyanide in Chicago back in 1982, killing seven. Those grotesque accusations obviously were false, otherwise I could not be writing these words. After 25 years, the Tylenol murders remain unsolved. I have lived a long, bizarre life and I have seen a lot, yet I am literate and lucid enough to view and describe, compare and contrast hugely diverse worlds, cultures and topics, without a moment of boredom, all with an eye to professionalism, demographics and marketability plus ears and heart sensitive to good taste and victims' feelings."" A call to LeAnne Lewis' telephone number was not immediately returned. FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkiewicz said two searches in Cambridge were under way ""related to an ongoing investigation."" She would not say whether they were related to the Tylenol case. Criminal charges have not been filed in the seven Chicago-area killings, which occurred after Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules were laced with potassium cyanide. The killings led to changes in packaging of over-the-counter drugs. Johnson & Johnson, parent of the drug maker, McNeil, was widely credited for its aggressiveness in recalling the product and its openness in dealing with the killings, and the product quickly bounced back in sales. It remains a popular analgesic. ""Johnson & Johnson cannot comment on the status of any ongoing investigation into the murders of 1982,"" said company spokesman Jeff Leebaw.

"New York (CNN) -- A  free concert in Manhattan by Canadian  rapper Drake and pop trio Hanson was canceled Tuesday evening because of an unruly crowd, police said.

One  third of Hanson, Zac, talked about the incident on his offical Twitter account: ""Had to cancel the free NYC show  today because of a crazy audience that was breaking things at the mixing  board."" The  mayhem erupted before Drake, whose widely anticipated new album hit stores  Tuesday, took the stage. ""NYPD will not let me go on stage tonight,"" he tweeted  shortly before he was supposed to perform. A  spokeswoman for the NYPD disputed the idea that police called off the concert,  telling CNN that the event's promoters made that call. Paper Magazine, a sponsor of the  event along with Ray-Ban, explained via Twitter that ""the crowd was much larger  than we anticipated."" A promotional poster said organizers were expecting a  crowd of 10,000-plus. Two  concertgoers were arrested and some others sustained ""minor injuries,""  the NYPD spokeswoman said.","Drake and Hanson concert canceled in New York .

"(CNN) -- Gary Coleman's remains were cremated Thursday and his ashes will be locked away until a court decides who should get them, the special administrator of his estate said. ""The proceeding was conducted in accordance with Mr. Coleman's desires as expressed in his will, that no funeral service, wake, or other ceremony memorialize his passing,"" attorney Robert Jeffs said Thursday. A Utah judge appointed Jeffs to control the estate while he decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray. Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo, Utah, hospital. Price, 24, claimed in a petition that she was still Coleman's common-law wife. She filed a handwritten document from 2007 that, if validated by the court, would give her Coleman's estate. A will signed by Coleman in 2005 named Gray as executor and awarded all of his estate to the Portland, Oregon, woman. It is expected to take Utah District Judge James Taylor several months to hold a trial to decide which document is Coleman's last legal will. Until then, Jeffs said he would lock the actor's ashes in a vault. Coleman was best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Coleman was cremated Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A flight attendant with a pilot's license ditched her normal duties and stepped in for a sick copilot of an American Airlines flight before the plane landed in Chicago, Illinois, airline officials said. The first officer had become sick with ""flulike"" symptoms Monday, according to Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American Airlines. ""He went back into the passenger cabin,"" he said. ""That's when the captain began to solicit help from any passengers with a pilot's license."" One of the five flight attendants on board flight 1612 from San Francisco, California, told the captain that she is a commercial pilot, and she immediately took over the first officer's responsibilities, Wagner said. The Chicago Tribune has identified the flight attendant as Patti DeLuna, 61. ""I was the best available [backup pilot] they had on the plane,"" DeLuna told the Chicago Tribune. ""I spent a lot of time in the cockpit looking at the flight deck and asking questions. My first question to the captain was, 'Where are the brakes?'"" The plane, carrying 225 passengers and seven crew members, landed safely at O'Hare International Airport at 4:24 p.m. Monday. The first officer, who is based in Chicago, was immediately taken to the hospital by paramedics waiting on the ground. He was treated and released and was resting Tuesday, Wagner said. ""The entire incident was handled very well on all accounts,"" Wagner said. He was not able to elaborate on the flight attendant's background Tuesday afternoon or provide any details of her piloting experience.

"(CNN) -- Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who will develop a long-term plan for the restoration of the states affected by the massive oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, is a former governor of Mississippi whom the White House has called a proven leader. The 61-year-old Mabus was selected by President Obama on Tuesday to help draw up the government's plan for recovery efforts in conjunction with officials in the Gulf Coast states. ""The plan will be designed by states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists, and other Gulf residents. And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region,"" Obama said in a nationwide address from the Oval Office. Last year when Mabus was selected to lead the Navy, the Obama administration released a statement that said: ""The president nominated Governor Mabus to be secretary of the Navy because he has the proven leadership and experience our nation needs to serve in this important position."" Mabus was born and raised in Mississippi, attending college at the University of Mississippi. He earned a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University before enlisting in the Navy near the end of the Vietnam War. He served as a surface warfare officer on the USS Little Rock in 1971 and 1972. After the Navy he attended Harvard Law School. The Democrat was elected to office for the first time in 1983, becoming Mississippi's state auditor. Five years later, Mabus became governor at age 39, the youngest state leader in the nation at the time, according to the Mississippi Historical Society. Mabus was named one of Fortune magazine's Top 10 education governors in 1990, according to his biography on National Governors Association website. He was defeated in his re-election bid by Kirk Fordice. In 1994, Mabus was appointed by then-President Bill Clinton as the ambassador to Saudi Arabia where he served for two years before returning to Mississippi to become a businessman. His divorce in 2000 made national headlines because it involved secret recordings of conversations with an Episcopal priest and his first wife, Julie Hines. During the recordings, she revealed an affair, and the tapes helped Mabus win legal custody of the couple's two daughters, according to the New York Times. They share physical custody. Hines sued the priest and the church, citing privacy rights, but the suit was dismissed in 2006, the Times reported. Mabus led Foamex, a maker of cushion products, out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007, according to his biography on the Defense department's website. He was chosen by Obama to be Secretary of the Navy in May 2009.","Ray Mabus was governor of Mississippi from 1988-1992 .

"(CNN) -- He wears more eyeliner than Adam Lambert, his voluminous locks put Snooki's poof to shame and one can only guess how long it takes him to get into his skinny jeans -- though there's a good chance he'd tell you if you asked. So are the pants and the eyeliner to blame for the fact that it's been nearly impossible to avoid Russell Brand this summer? Between interviews for his new film ""Get Him to the Greek"" and red-carpet appearances with his fiancée Katy Perry, Brand has certainly been making the rounds. And judging by ""Greek's"" respectable box-office run, Americans are not getting tired of this British comedian any time soon. ""He's completely electric and always on,"" says Sean Woods, a senior editor at Rolling Stone. ""It's like non-stop with the jokes. It's one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed. ... He takes chances and that's what makes a great comedian."" One of those chances was Aldous Snow -- the supporting but momentous character in 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" The role, which was originally written  to be to be a writer who looked more like Hugh Grant than Keith Richards, was changed to a Russell Brand-like rock star following the comedian's authentic audition. Cut to two years later and Brand is carrying his first big Hollywood film, ""Get Him to the Greek."" The road-trip comedy has performed similarly to ""Sarah Marshall,"" earning an estimated $17.4 million its opening weekend and a respectable $36.5 million to date. ""The truth is as funny as 'Sarah Marshall' and 'Greek' have been, it's the tip of the iceberg for him,"" says MTV news movies editor Josh Horowitz. ""No one has truly captured how funny Russell is in person. He can host MTV's [Video Music Awards] twice in suitably unpredictable fashion, he can riff on any subject, and yes he can act."" But there wasn't an immediate embrace of Brand, says Horowitz. The British press were all over Brand in 2008 when he resigned from the BBC after making a lewd phone call to actor Andrew Sachs during his radio show. ""It's taken U.S. audiences a little while to catch up, but to those in the know, Russell is something special -- an erudite improv master who can go blue or highbrow depending on his unpredictable mood,"" Horowitz says. Whether it's the remarks about former president George W. Bush or the fact that he repeatedly poked fun at the Jonas Brothers for wearing purity rings, it took Americans some time to get used to Brand's humor, says Jenny May Finn, who created The Russell Brand Fansite in 2005 after watching Brand on ""Big Brother"" in the U.K. ""All he wants to do is make people laugh,"" says Finn, who lives in Dublin, Ireland. Finn has met Brand several times since starting the site. ""To see a comedian who's quite stylish instead of the dorky or angry comedian that's so typical. ... He's a nice looker, which always adds to the liking of someone,"" she says laughing. Brand's ""Greek"" cast-mate Elizabeth Moss told CNN  that people might be surprised to know just how professional Brand truly is. ""He's a hard worker and it's important to him to be funny,"" she says. We're finally beginning to appreciate Brand's honesty and accept him as the great comedian, actor and rock star he is, Woods says. ""There's a bit of pain in Russell,"" he says. ""It allows him to make jokes about real-life situations. ... Most of us do turn some of the tragedies in our lives into humor."" Brand channeled his past when he reprised his role as Aldous Snow in ""Greek"" and when writing his book, ""My Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs and Stand-Up,"" released in the U.K. in 2007 and the U.S. in 2009. His memoir, which details his rough childhood and past with drug and alcohol abuse, quickly became a best-seller in Britain. ""There's something kind of endearing about him. There's an honesty and an innocence that people respond to,"" Woods says. Finn says she often receives e-mails from recovering drug addicts thanking Brand for being an inspiration to them. ""They just kind of resonate with him for being so frank and honest,"" she says. But how is the honesty that originally turned people off suddenly the very thing that's making us fans? ""He has a quality about him that I think we can sort of praise and like in our rock stars, but in our comedians, we say, 'Hey, he's not Mick Jagger. What the hell?' He's pretty unique,"" Woods says. So what's next for Brand? A lot, actually: He'll star with Helen Mirren in ""Arthur"" and ""The Tempest,"" play the voice of the Easter Bunny in ""I Hop,"" and play a con-man/priest in ""Bad Father."" In addition, his second memoir called ""My Booky Wook 2: This Time it's Personal,"" is due out in early 2011 in the U.S., and he continues to do stand-up comedy. ""I can't wait to see Russell stretch and prove he's got true range outside of the provocateur he clearly can play with his eyes closed,"" Horowitz says. Woods says Brand has nowhere to go but up. ""He is the peacock of peacocks. There's no one strutting around like he is.""","Brand's role in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was written for him .

"New York (CNN) -- President Obama has given a lot of speeches. He's given hundreds since he became president. He's given six in the last two days on his trip to the Gulf. But last night's was the first speech he has given from the Oval Office. It will not be his last. But it was important, and he gave it well. It took him five paragraphs to say the serious words we have all known for weeks, but he needed to say: ""This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced."" He went on to say what every American and every victim of this disaster wanted to hear: ""We will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy."" The rest of the speech didn't matter nearly as much. There were other things he wanted to say, and some of them were important. But the reality is that those 44 words quoted above are action items: We will fight with everything; we will make BP pay; and we will help our citizens recover. Now the president has to make it happen. As our nation's leader, he made commitments and they must be kept. We all know the president can give a great speech. In fact, he's president because he first got noticed giving a speech. He gave many more inspiring campaign speeches and raised the expectations of millions of Americans that things would be different. Whether they are or not is up to each individual to judge. But why there was such a buildup to his giving his first Oval Office speech baffled me. The president sits at his own desk in the office he works in every day; he looks into the camera and reads the teleprompter. It's symbolic, but that's about it. My old boss Ronald Reagan gave most of his big speeches from the Oval Office. He felt that the office gave gravitas to his words. He had a unique ability to look into that camera and make most Americans feel he was talking to them -- a very special skill. Who can forget his speech from the Oval Office on the night of the Challenger disaster? The doubts people have expressed over the last several weeks about Obama were: Does he get it? And if he does, is he tough enough to do something about it? I think he gets it. I hope he's tough enough. I think the speech was a good speech. It was the public consumption speech. It was designed to make us feel better. The next speech he gives in the Oval Office is the one that counts. It's a private speech. When he meets Wednesday with the chairman and chief executive officer of BP, he needs to express the anger and disappointment of the nation and put a fear into this company that will move them to continued action and enough contrition that they won't quit until every last legitimate claim is paid. That's what we want to hear! The president closed his speech asking for prayers. ""We pray for the people of the Gulf. And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day."" I think what the American public wants is a president who will guide us through this storm. If we pray, our prayers are for him and those victims of this disaster. The time for speeches is over. No more words; just action! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins says President Obama's speech made all the key points .

"(CNN) -- The results of the Saville Inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland were unveiled Tuesday. Here are some questions and answers about the inquiry, which is one of the longest in British legal history. What is Bloody Sunday? On Sunday, January 30, 1972, a large crowd took part in a banned civil rights march in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry. (Even the name of the city is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry.) After a disturbance, British Army paratroopers fired shots into the crowd, killing a total of 14 people. ""Bloody Sunday,"" as it came to be known, was a major turning point in Northern Ireland's history and considered by many to be one of the greatest injustices of the Troubles. Why is there so much controversy surrounding Bloody Sunday? There was already simmering anger and distrust in Derry when the soldiers opened fire, and Bloody Sunday only served to increase the anti-British sentiment in the city. The soldiers said shots were fired before they shot at the crowd. An inquiry shortly after the shootings largely cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing and alleged some of the dead and wounded were gunmen or bombers. However, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said in 1998 there is no proof that the victims were handling any weapons or bombs. The shootings led to international condemnation and, according to analysts, hardened anti-British sentiments in Northern Ireland and led to many fresh recruits to the Irish Republican Army. The semi-autonomous Northern Irish government was suspended weeks later, which was followed by decades of rule from London. This happened in 1972, so why hasn't there been an inquiry before now? There was an inquiry that same year, and the report came out 11 weeks after Bloody Sunday. But because it happened so soon after the incident, the inquiry was not able to take all the evidence that was later available, including evidence from people who were still in hospitals. Lord Chief Justice John Widgery, who led the 1972 inquiry, also did not consider substantial numbers of eyewitness accounts provided to his inquiry, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said when he launched the current inquiry in 1998. New material including new eyewitness accounts, new interpretation of ballistic material, and new medical evidence, has also come to light since 1972, Blair said. Blair ordered the inquiry to boost the struggling Northern Ireland peace process following a clamor by the victims' relatives, but Protestant political leaders and senior officers in the Parachute Regiment -- whose soldiers fired the fatal shots -- condemned the inquiry. It was, however, instrumental in bringing about the landmark Good Friday agreement, signed later that year, that led to relative peace in the process after 30 years of violence in which almost 3,000 people died. When did the current inquiry begin? The current inquiry began in 1998 after Blair decided there was enough new evidence to merit a fresh investigation. The families of those killed had presented a new dossier on Bloody Sunday to the British government the year before, in 1997, and the Irish government had also sent a detailed analysis of the new evidence and of Widgery's findings in light of the new material. Who led the inquiry? Mark Saville, a member of the British Supreme Court, chaired the inquiry. The other members were Canadian judge William Hoyt and Australian judge John Toohey. Read Saville Inquiry report on Bloody Sunday . Why has it taken 12 years for the inquiry to finish? The inquiry investigated a massive amount of evidence and testimony. Inquiry members interviewed and received statements from around 2,500 people and heard testimony from 922 of them. The first witness testified in November 2000 and the last testified in January 2005. The inquiry looked at a total of 160 volumes of evidence, including 13 volumes of photographs, 121 audiotapes and 110 videotapes. The inquiry has been criticized for taking so long and also for costing so much -- a total of £190 million ($280.3 million) as of February 2010. Will anyone be prosecuted after the report comes out? The inquiry was not a trial; it only sought the truth about what happened on Bloody Sunday. Its task was not to decide in favor of one side or the other, according to the inquiry. Witnesses who testified may be open to prosecution later, although any evidence they gave to the inquiry -- whether oral or written -- may not be used against them if they are prosecuted, the inquiry says. What effect might the report have? Victims' relatives will be pleased the report cleared the dead of blame, declared the killings unlawful, and will hope it leads to prosecutions of soldiers. But the report is also likely to test relations between pro-British unionists and nationalists, who now share power in Northern Ireland. CNN's Melissa Gray and Peter Wilkinson in London, England, contributed to this report.","Longest-running inquiry in British history looked into 1972 Northern Ireland killings .

"(CNN) -- Gary Coleman's funeral, if there is one, will wait for several months while a Utah judge decides who will permanently control of the former child actor's estate, a lawyer said Wednesday. Coleman will be cremated and his ashes will be put away until a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray is resolved, said Robert Jeffs, an attorney appointed temporary special administrator. Coleman divorced Price in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered a fall at home last month and died two days later of a brain hemorrhage at the Provo, Utah, hospital. Price, 24, claimed in a petition that she was still Coleman's common-law wife. She filed a handwritten document from 2007 that, if validated by the court, would give her Coleman's estate. A will signed by Coleman in 2005 named Gray as executor and awarded all of his estate to the Portland, Oregon, woman. It is expected to take Utah District Judge James Taylor several months to hold a trial to decide which document is Coleman's last legal will. Jeffs, who has control until then, said he would lock the actor's ashes in a vault. No one is questioning that Coleman wanted his remains cremated. He called for it in the 2005 will, in which he also asked ""that there be no funeral service, wake, or other ceremony memorializing my passing."" An earlier will, dated in 1999, offered specific instructions on who could not attend any funeral or memorial service. ""I direct my personal representative to cause my personal remains to be cremated and to plan a wake for me conducted by those who have had no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for Gary Coleman,"" the 1999 will said. He also said he wanted no reporters at the service. Coleman's remains are at a Utah mortuary, awaiting direction about what happens to the body. Jeffs was instructed by the judge to wait until after Wednesday to order the cremation, to allow time for Gray to view his body. Coleman was best known as the wisecracking youngster Arnold on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- And then they came for the children. Just when you thought Arizona lawmakers couldn't stoop any lower, these cowardly and shameful politicians grab a shovel and put in a basement. This fall, the Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants -- the ""anchor babies"" that some Republicans have been trying to marginalize for years. The lawmakers are cowards because, first, they go after illegal immigrants who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. And now they're going after children who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. Whom are they not going after? Employers of illegal immigrants. You know why? Because they vote, lobby and contribute to political campaigns. By the way, the term ""anchor babies,"" which refers to the tots that supposedly increase the chances that mommy and daddy can stay in the United States even if mommy and daddy are in the country illegally, isn't just offensive and crude. It's also misleading. The fact that Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was famously holed up in a Chicago, Illinois, church, had a U.S.-born son didn't stop federal officials from deporting her in 2007. Some anchor. The real anchor is a job, the kind eagerly provided by U.S. employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants. In fact, right-wingers acknowledge as much when they argue that if we dry up the jobs, illegal immigrants will self-deport. What about their kids, some of which were born in the United States? Why not stay for them? Simple: Employment takes precedence. Thus, according to conservatives' own arguments, there aren't anchor babies -- only anchor jobs. Also, you can bet that some of the same people who oppose citizenship for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants also oppose the idea of granting a pathway to earned legalization -- what they call ""amnesty"" -- to illegal immigrants. Why? Because, they say, you can't willy-nilly convert those who are illegal to legal. Then how can those folks be so cavalier about making that conversion in the opposite direction by changing legal to illegal? Lastly, one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given U.S. citizenship. It's just too valuable, they say. Agreed. But if it's so valuable, then why are some on the right so quick to strip it away from the children of illegal immigrants? Don't U.S. citizens deserve more respect than that? Apparently not. In the late 1990s, the member of Congress leading the crusade against ""birthright citizenship"" was Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-California. The San Diego-area congressman proposed a bill to limit the privilege to the children of U.S. citizens. The legislation didn't go anywhere. It couldn't even get a hearing from some of Bilbray's fellow Republicans, who cringed at the idea of visiting the sins of the parents onto the children. The same was true for another failed attempt by Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, who, in 2005, proposed a bill that explicitly denied citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The bill didn't go anywhere either, in part because not enough Republicans would even agree to give it a hearing. That same year, I discussed the idea with Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who was then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called ""The Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism, and Immigration Control Act of 2005."" Among other things, the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony. Yet even Sensenbrenner, not exactly a softhearted liberal, wouldn't touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. When fellow Republicans tried to insert such language into his bill, he was careful to keep it out. There was a time when Republicans knew better than to handle radioactive material. My, how times have changed. And now all the opponents of birthright citizenship have to do is change the Constitution. The 14th Amendment makes clear that anyone born in the United States, with the possible exception of the children of foreign diplomats, is a U.S. citizen. ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Grasping at straws, restrictionists and nativists claim that illegal immigrants aren't ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States. So what? My concern isn't that critics don't know how to read the law. It's that they don't know how to read -- period. Jurisdiction applies not to the parents, but to the children. As U.S. citizens, they're subject to U.S. laws, but they also enjoy the protection of the U.S. Constitution. The closed border / closed mind crowd may not like it, but that's the way it is. I'm not surprised that this escapes the state of Arizona. iReporter supports the bill . Given all that's happened in recent weeks in its jihad against not illegal immigrants but Hispanics in general, the Grand Canyon State seems to have more than its share of people who slept through high school civics, and they're being advised by lawyers who were obviously absent the day they taught ""law"" in law school. That's not a good look. The U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are legally entitled to U.S. citizenship. What part of ""legal"" don't the critics understand? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Arizona bill would deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants .

"Washington (CNN) -- The commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan was escorted from a congressional hearing room after fainting during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday, his spokesman said. Gen. David Petraeus ""is feeling much better,"" spokesman Col. Erik Gunhus said. ""It appeared that he fainted."" A doctor checked Petraeus out and he returned to the hearing room to continue, but committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin ""overruled him,"" Gunhus said. ""Looks like we will continue tomorrow. He will be OK."" Petraeus returned amid applause to the hearing room. On his way out of the building, Petraeus told CNN's Dana Bash, ""I'm doing OK. I just got a little dehydrated. I ate a couple of bananas and drank some water. I didn't eat breakfast this morning."" Petraeus is the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the conduct of the U.S. wars in the Middle East and central Asia. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Petraeus was examined by a doctor in an outer room. ""They gave him some fruit and juice to get his blood sugar up and did all the tests you would do in the aftermath of an unusual episode like that,"" Morrell said. ""He took some time, is feeling better and wanted to go back out to complete the hearing."" President Barack Obama called Petraeus from Air Force One while the president was en route back from Pensacola, Florida, a White House spokesman said. Obama got the impression, from his talk with Petraeus, that he is ""doing great,"" deputy White House press secretary Bill Burton told reporters. ""Sounds like he was just a little dehydrated,"" Burton said. A Pentagon official added that Petraeus ""goes nonstop and has kept his schedule like this for nine years. I don't know if it was the schedule and pace at which he drives himself contributed to this. He indicated he didn't have breakfast or anything to eat or drink. He is back at the Pentagon working. He did not go for further medical tests."" Gunhus said, ""We have just returned from a weeklong overseas trip to Jordan and London and I think he was just dehydrated. He will be OK. We are back at the Pentagon working and executing his afternoon schedule."" Before Petraeus was escorted out, key senators questioned the progress and planning for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. Opening the hearing, Levin, D-Michigan, questioned the ratio of U.S. and NATO troops to Afghan troops, urging a faster ramping up of Afghan security forces. ""Progress towards the goal of Afghans taking the lead in operations has been unsatisfactory. Today operations in Afghanistan are excessively dependent on coalition forces,"" Levin said. Levin said in the coming campaign in Kandahar, there is a plan to have one Afghan service member for every two international troops. He called instead for a one-to-one ratio, with Afghan forces in the lead. His Republican counterpart, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in his opening remarks that the key trends were going in a ""bad direction, perhaps even signaling a mounting crisis."" ""Hoping for success on the arbitrary timeline set by the administration is simply unrealistic,"" McCain said, calling for the president to say the U.S. will stay in Afghanistan until there is success. Moments before Petraeus' fainting spell, McCain asked him about the president's target to begin withdrawal of the additional troops by July of next year. ""July 2011 is not the date where we race for the exits. It is the date where, having done an assessment, we begin a process of transition of tasks to Afghan security forces based on conditions and begin a process of, quote, a responsible drawdown of our forces,"" Petraeus explained. McCain expressed doubts about the timetable, as he has before. The Arizona senator worried that people in the region will assume America is leaving and that will strengthen the hand of the Taliban. ""You believe that we can begin a drawdown in July of 2011, under the projected plans that we have?"" McCain asked. ""That is the policy and I support it,"" Petraeus said. ""I understand you support the policy,"" McCain responded. ""Will conditions on the ground indicate that we will begin a withdrawal, in the words of the vice president: 'July of 2011, you're going to see a whole lot of people moving out, bet on it'?"" McCain moved on to another topic before Petraeus could answer the question. A few moments later, the hearing was recessed until Wednesday morning. Prepared remarks from Petraeus said progress is being made even as the security violence has gotten more intense. The surge of U.S. troops into Afghanistan is ahead of schedule, but the situation on the ground will get more difficult before it gets better, he warned in the prepared remarks. ""I noted several months ago ... the going was likely to get harder before it got easier. That has already been the case, as we've seen recently."" All 30,000 additional U.S. troops ordered by Obama last year will be in place in Afghanistan by the end of August, according to Petraeus. Troops had originally been scheduled to be in place by September. In the prepared remarks, he told the congressional panel Tuesday that increasing the size and capability of the struggling Afghan National Army and police forces are back on track, but there is more work to be done. Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy also argued that progress has been made. ""We are regaining the initiative and the insurgency is beginning to lose momentum,"" she said in her opening statement, but noted the outcome is ""far from determined.""","NEW: Obama calls Petraeus from Air Force One .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama used his first Oval Office address to the nation Tuesday to say 90 percent of the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico will be captured within weeks, and to call for a new clean energy policy to end U.S. dependence on fossil fuels. The 18-minute speech, televised nationally, described what happened in the April 20 explosion and fire on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig that led to what Obama called ""the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced."" He compared the millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean to an epidemic ""we will be fighting for months and even years."" Obama meets Wednesday with the chairman of oil giant BP, which owns the broken well at the bottom of the Gulf, and the president made clear he expects BP to pay all clean-up costs and damages from the massive leak. He said he will tell BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg to ""set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company's recklessness."" ""This fund will not be controlled by BP,"" Obama said. ""In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent, third party."" In response to Obama's speech, a BP spokesperson said the company shared the president's goals of ""shutting off the well as quickly as possible, cleaning up the oil and mitigating the impact on the people and environment of the Gulf Coast,"" and looked forward to Wednesday's meeting ""for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals."" Earlier, senior administration officials told reporters that negotiations on the BP fund were continuing, with one major unresolved issue being whether workers who lose their jobs due to the government's six-month moratorium on offshore drilling will be eligible to file damage claims. Republican critics have complained the moratorium is eliminating badly needed jobs as the nation recovers from economic recession, but Obama said the government must ensure the safety of such deep-water operations before allowing them to continue. Obama said he knows the moratorium ""creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs."" ""But for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deep-water drilling to continue,"" he said. Obama also called the Gulf oil disaster ""the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now."" The United States must end its dependence on fossil fuels, he said, calling for Congress to rise above partisan politics to take on the challenge of passing energy reform legislation that will lead the way to development of a clean energy economy. In an attempt to counter complaints of a sluggish government response to the oil disaster, Obama noted cited resources have poured into the region including nearly 30,000 people working in four states to contain and clean up the oil, along with ""thousands of ships and other vessels."" He said he had authorized deployment of more than 17,000 National Guard members along the coast to be used as needed by state governors. Republican responses, some distributed to reporters before the speech began, criticized Obama for using the oil disaster to push his energy reform policies, which GOP critics say will increase energy prices and eliminate jobs. ""Every day seems to bring more bad news about the size and scope of this crisis, and reversing that trend should be the president's priority,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""The White House may view this oil spill as an opportunity to push its agenda in Washington, but Americans are more concerned about what it plans to do to solve the crisis at hand,"" McConnell said. He complained the energy reform legislation supported by Obama also is endorsed by BP and will ""raise energy prices for every American family and business"" but ""won't end our dependence on foreign oil or protect the coastline and marshes of the Gulf coast."" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the administration's focus should be on stopping the leak, not pushing Obama's policies. ""I am concerned the administration is attempting to capitalize on public outrage over the spill in order to push through a cap-and-trade bill that will significantly raise energy prices for all Americans and add more burdens on businesses,"" Hutchison said in a statement. ""Right now, the president's number one priority needs to be keeping the jobs in the energy sector from going overseas and restoring the Gulf of Mexico."" Environmentalists supported Obama's call for Congress to pass energy reform legislation, with former Vice President Al Gore, now chairman of the Alliance for Climate Protection, saying that ""in the midst of the greatest environmental disaster in our country's history, there is no excuse to do otherwise."" Ultimately, Gore said in statement, ""the only way to prevent this type of tragedy from happening again is to fundamentally change how we power our economy."" Earlier Tuesday, Obama named Michael Bromwich to direct the federal government's efforts to regulate offshore oil drilling. Bromwich, who was a Justice Department inspector general in the Clinton administration, will oversee the reorganized agencies that formerly comprised the Minerals Management Service in the Department of Interior. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told ABC News on Tuesday morning that Obama's goal is to ""restore the Gulf, not just the way it was the day the rig exploded, but years ago."" Presidents have tackled a variety of topics in Oval Office speeches -- from the Challenger disaster in 1986 to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Energy was last a topic in 1979, when Jimmy Carter spoke about America's inability to overcome the energy crisis. While Obama has dealt with major issues including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a major economic downturn since taking office in January 2009, he had never spoken to the public from the Oval Office until now.
