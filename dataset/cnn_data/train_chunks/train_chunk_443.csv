"(CNN)The Mormon church has excommunicated a popular podcaster, saying his public dissents from the religion's core beliefs have led others away from the church. John Dehlin, founder of  the podcast ""Mormon Stories,"" describes himself as an ""unorthodox"" Mormon whose church roots reach back five generations. Under Tuesday's penalty, however, Dehlin may not participate in church sacraments for at least one year. He has the right to appeal the decision. Dehlin is the second Mormon to be excommunicated in the past year, following Kate Kelly, who was kicked out last June for pushing the church to admit women to its all-male priesthood. Tuesday's excommunication was announced in a letter to Dehlin from Brian King, the stake president, or local church leader, in North Logan, Utah. King said that Dehlin was not excommunicated for criticizing the church, which he has openly admitted to, but for denying core Mormon doctrines. The church has concluded that Dehlin's views on the following amount to apostasy: . -- Questioning the nature of God and divinity of Christ; . -- Calling the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham, two central texts, fraudulent; . -- Teaching that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon church's official name, is not the ""true church with power and authority from God."" ""You have spread these teachings widely via the Internet to hundreds of people in the past and have shared with me, in previous correspondence, that you will continue to do so,"" King wrote to Dehlin in a letter dated February 9. Dehlin has said that he suspects his support for female ordination and same-sex marriage, both of which Mormon leaders oppose, was behind the effort to excommunicate him. In a statement on Tuesday, Dehlin said: ""My wife, Margi, and I are proud to stand in support of both free expression and gender/marriage equality within Mormonism. While we are saddened that the LDS Church has chosen to excommunicate me for publicly supporting these values, we support the church's right to make this decision."" King and Mormon church spokesmen say that's not true. ""Church disciplinary trials are usually kept private, but when the member has chosen to air their grievances in public, the Church reserves the right to correct the public record,"" Mormon leaders said in a statement. ""Church discipline is not designed to be the end of the process,"" church spokesmen said, ""but the beginning of the road back to full fellowship."" Dehlin, who has run the Mormon Stories podcast and a related website for about a decade, told NPR that he stopped attending church last year.","John Dehlin calls himself an ""unorthodox Mormon""

"(CNN)Almost every day for the past month, a crowd of curious onlookers has gathered in northern Amsterdam to gawp at three mysterious structures. Measuring 2.5 meters tall high and 1.7 meters wide, the large plastic blocks look like little more than oversized liquorice candy or a confusing attempt at surrealist art. Appearances can be deceiving. According to DUS Architects, the Dutch company behind the project, these innocuous black objects are stage one of what will eventually be the world's first 3D printed house. It is made using a ""KamerMaker"" machine, a giant, custom-made version of a desktop 3D printer that produces a material 10 times thicker than normal. The finished structure will take the shape of a 13-room canal house made from scores of separate but interlocking components (like the three currently on show). ""These rooms will be structural entities on their own. We will then place them on top of each other to make a house,"" explained DUS Architects co-founder and director, Martine de Wit. ""Originally, we had the small printers in our office and we were printing scale models with them. Then we thought why not print it (the full house) right away,"" she added. How does it work? The interior and exterior walls of the house are printed at the same time with spaces left in between for electric wiring and pipes. These spaces are then filled in with concrete for insulation and reinforcement. As it stands, the primary material being used is a bio-plastic made from 80% plant oil but other substances are being tested for their suitability. Between six and ten blocks are required to make one room and the entire process of printing and assembling the house is estimated to take three years. According to de Wit, the Amsterdam project is an experiment to test out the feasibility, challenges and cost implications of fashioning a house in this way. ""If you print in plastic you can recycle the materials,"" de Wit explained. ""We also see the possibility to design something, send it digitally and then print it exactly in the place that you need it rather than transporting everything to the location."" On top of this, houses can be custom designed to suit individual owners tastes, moved piece by piece to a new location if required before being put together again and only the precise amount of material required would need to be used, reducing waste in the process. De Wit even sees the possibility of building furniture, arts and crafts into the blocks that make up a 3D printed home. The canal house will feature a printed block containing a staircase. But while the potential benefits of building a house in this manner may be appealing, there remain many challenges before the technology is proven effective from a structural, living and economic sense. A note of caution . De Wit is clear that the final costs of the project are still unknown and admits that 3D printing is unlikely to replace existing house building techniques any time soon. Others, however, doubt whether the concept has any long term value at all. According to Dr Phil Reeves, managing director of UK-based 3D printing consultancy and research firm, Econolyst, printing a house takes longer and runs counter to existing building techniques which are already relatively efficient. ""A lot of housing projects are using very modular systems of building where things are built in a factory off site, bought and then assembled very quickly,"" Reeves said. ""This is counter to that. It's about much longer times on the building site."" Reeves also points out the difficulty of altering wiring between walls or correcting faults as they arise after they have been insulated with concrete. Yet despite these potential drawbacks, de Wit and her colleagues remain hopeful the idea can provide benefits to the architecture and construction industries if the initial Amsterdam project is successful. ""I don't think we'll print all homes through 3D printing in future but I think it can be an additional, valuable tool to what we already use,"" de Wit said.

"New York (CNN)A New York City police officer has been indicted in the death of Akai Gurley, an unarmed man shot and killed in a Brooklyn housing project in November, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation has told CNN. The charges against Officer Peter Liang were not revealed Tuesday. Gurley, 28, was ""a total innocent who just happened"" to run into Liang in a ""pitch black"" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an ""accidental discharge."" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. ""This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,"" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. ""The fact the he was assigned to patrol one most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident."" Liang's attorney declined comment. Scott Rynecki, an attorney for Kimberly Ballinger, Gurley's domestic partner and mother of their child, said, ""She is at this point feeling that this is the first step in the fight for justice for this wrongful and reckless shooting."" In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""It has been reported that a Brooklyn grand jury has acted in this case. No matter the specific charges, this case is an unspeakable tragedy for the Gurley family. We urge everyone to respect the judicial process as it unfolds."" Liang and his partner were part of a ""violence reduction overtime detail"" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer discharged the weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon ""for safety reasons,"" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said.  Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers ""based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm."" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. ""This is a tragic situation,"" de Blasio told reporters after the shooting. ""It does appear to have been a very tragic accident."" The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office had no comment on the indictment, but District Attorney Ken Thompson, in a statement days after the incident, called the shooting ""deeply troubling."" Gurley's shooting occurred at a time of strained police/community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. A few weeks after Garner's death, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Darren Wilson, a decision that led to national  demonstrations.","Charges against Officer Peter Liang are not revealed .

"Two prominent newspapers this week used their editorial pages to call for mercy for intelligence leaker Edward Snowden, with one arguing ""he deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight."" The New York Times and The Guardian make the case for some sort of plea deal or clemency that would allow Snowden to return to the United States from Russia, where he was granted asylum. Mercy or dropped charges have occurred in past cases of other high-profile whistle-blowers, such as Daniel Ellsberg, the military analyst behind the leak of the Pentagon Papers. But in recent years, the United States has aggressively pursued those who leak government secrets. Here's a look at how the cases of five prominent leakers -- including Snowden -- have played out: . Daniel Ellsberg . Ellsberg was the military analyst who leaked the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers in 1971. The top-secret documents revealed that senior U.S. leaders, including three Presidents, knew the Vietnam War was an unwinnable, tragic quagmire. Further, they showed the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the war. Ellsberg surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy. During his trial, the court learned that President Richard Nixon's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit Ellsberg, illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist's office. All charges against him were dropped. Since then, he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer. Chelsea Manning . U.S. Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, who formerly went by the name Bradley, was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to WikiLeaks, the online anti-secrecy group. A military judge sentenced Manning to 35 years -- far less than the effective life sentence that was permitted under law -- minus credit for about 3 1/2 years time served. The judge also reduced Manning's rank, ordered that pay and benefits be forfeited, and imposed a dishonorable discharge. Manning has applied for a pardon from President Barack Obama. The Obama administration has said it will handle that request no differently than others. Manning's defenders, including Ellsberg, said he was a hero. Julian Assange . Assange is the founder of WikiLeaks, which published hundreds of thousands of secret State Department cables and other information taken by Manning that gave the group global recognition. Assange's case remains unresolved. For more than a year, Assange has been holed up inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website. Ecuador's government granted him asylum, but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises. Mark Felt . In 2005, retired deputy FBI director Felt revealed himself to be the whistle-blower ""Deep Throat"" in the Watergate scandal. He anonymously assisted Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward with many of their stories about the Nixon administration's cover-up after the June 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to Nixon's resignation in 1974. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage. Felt was convicted on unrelated conspiracy charges in 1980 and fined. He was pardoned by President Ronald Reagan before slipping into obscurity for the next quarter century. He died in 2008 at age 95. Edward Snowden . It's too early to tell Snowden's ultimate fate. A contentious debate surrounds his case. On one side, many see Snowden as a traitor and criminal for unlawfully taking and disseminating National Security Agency files relating to its mass collection of electronic information, including e-mail and phone data. Others see bravery in Snowden's actions for bringing a secretive program to light and initiating a national debate about security and privacy. ""Considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed, and the abuses he has exposed, Mr. Snowden deserves better than a life of permanent exile, fear and flight,"" the Times editorial said. ""He may have committed a crime to do so, but he has done his country a great service."" Still, U.S. officials have thus far shown no indication they're considering clemency. Last month, Attorney General Eric Holder said the conversation about balance between security and privacy is important, ""but I would not say what he did is worthy of clemency."" ""It's not something that I would support,"" Holder said. ""I think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to love.""

"(CNN)A house is just a house, right? Even the increasingly popular tiny houses look like standard houses, reduced in size.  But some houses are so far outside of the box, they're worth a trip to see. Here are eight of the most unusual houses around the United States: . Pickle Barrel House Museum in Grand Marais, Michigan . Have you ever found yourself in a pickle?  Cartoonist William Donahey came pretty close when he took up residence in a house shaped like a pickle barrel. Built in 1926 as a summer home for Donahey, Grand Marais, Michigan's Pickle Barrel House now holds a seasonal museum open from June to September.  Donahey allowed Monarch Food Company to use his popular ""Teenie Weenie"" cartoon characters on their pickle jar labels, and out of gratitude Monarch's parent company commissioned the house for Donahey's family to use, building him a much larger version of the barrels their pickles were sold in. Purchased in 2003 and restored by the Michigan Historical Society, the museum is on the National Register of Historic Places.  Visitors can also take a stroll through the Historic Iris Preservation Society's Display Garden found on the property, with free admission to the museum and garden. 10 spectacular U.S. waterfalls . Gold Pyramid House in Wadsworth, Illinois . Some people have a guard dog.  This house has a pharaoh standing watch. With the enormous statue of Ramses II in front of it, the 6-story, 17,000 square foot Gold Pyramid House in Wadsworth, Illinois, transports visitors back to ancient Egypt. In the 1970s ""pyramid power"" was a popular trend, with some people believing in the supernatural powers of the pyramids.  Jim and Linda Onan were two such people, and at the time, their house was full of pyramids.  Linda used to joke to her husband that he should build their next house in a pyramid shape so she could stop looking at all of the little ones inside of it, and in 1977 he did, painting it gold and surrounding it by a moat. Visitors can tour the pyramid and public areas of the home, which are decorated in an ancient Egyptian style to match the exterior of the house, visit a replica of King Tut's tomb and hear a presentation about the history of the gilded pyramid. Admission for adults is $15, children 17 and under are $10. Shoe House in Hellam, Pennsylvania . There was an old lady who lived in a shoe. But in this case, it was a shoe salesman, who built the eye-catching Shoe House in Hellam, Pennsylvania. Standing 25 feet tall and 48 feet long, the giant shoe was created as a structural advertisement almost 70 years ago. Creator and shoe salesman Mahlon N. Haines originally used it as a guest house. With five different levels inside, the house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. The house is open for tours from June through October, but private tours are available in the winter and spring. Tour prices are $4.50 for adults and $3 for children ages 4 to 7. Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California . Winchester rifle heir Sarah Winchester believed that spirits haunted her, and it took her 35 years to build an elaborate Victorian mansion that she believed would confuse those ghostly apparitions. Completed in 1919, the seven-story, 160-room Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, has secret passageways, upside down columns and other oddities that the superstitious Winchester believed would bedevil those tormenting spirits. The mystery house hosts guided tours for brave visitors who are fond of the supernatural.   There are three different tours available, with prices starting at $27 for adults and $24 for children. Mary's Gone Wild Glass House in New Brunswick, North Carolina . People find a variety of ways to recycle old bottles, but covering an entire house in them might be a first. Visitors to New Brunswick, North Carolina's coast will stumble upon Mary's Gone Wild glass bottle house and folk garden, located only 5 miles from the ocean. Growing up, Mary Paulsen was known as the neighborhood doll repair woman, collecting discarded dolls and fixing them up.  As an adult, she turned her yard into a village for her 6,000 dolls, using whatever items she could find.  People started leaving their unwanted good in Mary's yard for her to make into art and she began work on her bottle house gallery in 2008, covering the walls with 8,000 different types of bottles, from nail polish to wine. The glass bottle house is open for tours year round.  Visitors can also stop in her gallery to purchase art that benefits the hungry, or make a donation, as admission to the house is free. One Log House in Garberville, California . This isn't what comes to mind when most people think of a log cabin. Living in Humboldt County, California, Art Schmock was used to seeing giant redwoods towering above him, but his relatives living in the Midwest and East Coast refused to believe that trees actually grew to be so large. Realizing that most people had never seen giant redwoods, the logger created the One Log House and put it on wheels so that he could tour the country.  Schmock and a friend spent eight months hollowing out the 7-foot-tall, 32-foot-long section of redwood. Holding a living room, kitchen and bedroom, the log house was similar to other mobile homes, except that its tremendous size and weight made mobility challenging, requiring special permits to drive on each state highway.  Although the house traveled on occasion, it spent most of its time ""resting"" in small towns along the Northern California coast. Now, One Log House Espresso and Gifts sits on Highway 101, south of Garberville, where it's been for the last 15 years.  The small cafe sells food, beverages and redwood gifts and has some relics of the old-time logging days.  Admission is $1 for visitors over 5 years old. Beer Can House in Houston, Texas . It all started with a dislike of yard work. Tired of mowing the lawn and doing landscaping work at his Houston home, John Milkovisch inlaid thousands of marbles, rocks and metal pieces into the concrete and redwood of his yard in 1968. When he finished with both the front and back yards, he began work on crafting aluminum siding for the house out of beer cans, which eventually became known as the Beer Can House.  After he finished the practical aspect, he moved on to the decorative, making sculptures and garlands for the house, also out of beer cans. Ripley's Believe It or Not estimated that 50,000 beer cans went into making John Milkovisch's tribute to recycling. In 2001, years after Milkovisch passed away, the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art acquired and restored the house, opening it to the public in 2008.  The house is open for visitors between Memorial Day and Labor Day, costing $5 for adults and free for children 12 and younger. House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wisconsin . Are you afraid of heights?  Then you may want to avoid the Infinity Room at Spring Green, Wisconsin's House on the Rock. The long, thin room stretches 218 feet long and 156 feet above the valley floor, with over 3,000 windows for walls, providing amazing panoramic views. Considered an architectural wonder, the house was built in 1945 by Alex Jordan as a luxurious retreat. Perched on a rock, as its name implies, the house has an amazing view of the surrounding nature. Open to the public since 1960, the house is divided into three sections that can all be toured.  The admission for all three sections is $28.50 for adults and $15.50 for children.  But, each section can also be visited separately for $12.50. Staff recommends that visitors spend at least three hours in the house to experience all that it has to offer, such as a carousel it touts as the world's largest, complete with 269 handcrafted animals.","Visitors to Michigan's Pickle Barrel House will find a museum and iris garden .

"(CNN)Some music lovers didn't even know Beck had a new album out when he won the Grammy for album of the year for ""Morning Phase"" on Sunday. Now it seems people can't stop talking about him. After rapper Kanye West looked to be about to crash the stage during Beck's acceptance speech and then said the musician ""needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyonce,"" there was a rush to defend Beck. West took umbrage with Beck's surprise win over his friend Beyonce's self-titled album. But in an open letter to West posted on her Facebook page, Garbage frontwoman Shirley Manson said it's the rapper who needs to learn some respect. ""You disrespect your own remarkable talents and more importantly you disrespect the talent, hard work and tenacity of all artists when you go so rudely and savagely after such an accomplished and humble artist like Beck,"" Manson wrote. ""You make yourself look small and petty and spoilt."" Even a dear friend of West's has offered support for Beck. The rapper's wife, Kim Kardashian, Instagrammed a photo of herself with singer John Legend and his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, in the Grammy audience. The photo shows the trio making faces and is captioned  ""This is the Beck won that award face?!?!?!"" On Monday, Legend -- who is a longtime friend and collaborator of West's -- tweeted congratulations to Beck, calling him ""a great artist"" and explaining that the selfie was in fact taken before the artist's win. According to Billboard, radio is rallying around Beck. ""It's wonderful he is getting the accolades and the credit,"" KROQ music director Lisa Worden told Billboard. ""Morning Phase is beautiful, and at this point for radio listeners, it isn't top-of-mind so the fact that he did win two huge awards means people will go back, listen to the album and buy it."" The attention has brought a 388% increase in streams of his music, Spotify reported, including a 524% increase in streams of ""Morning Phase."" And what does Beck think about all of the uproar? It seems he didn't mind West almost crashing his win, telling Us Weekly that he thinks the rapper is a ""genius"" and  ""I was just so excited he was coming up. He deserves to be on stage as much as anybody. ""I thought she was going to win,"" Beck said of his competition for the award. ""Come on, she's Beyonce!""

"(CNN)The United Arab Emirates on Tuesday resumed its participation in airstrikes against ISIS, the country said -- its first publicly known foray against the terror group since it reportedly suspended attacks over concerns about pilot safety. UAE F-16s stationed in Jordan took part in morning attacks and returned safely to base, the UAE military said without saying where the strikes happened. A U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, where the Sunni Muslim extremist group has captured territory for what it calls its Islamic caliphate. The UAE halted its participation in the strikes in December because leaders were worried there were insufficient plans to save personnel who may be captured, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. The safety issue was highlighted by the case of Jordanian military pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, whom ISIS captured in December after his jet crashed in Syria. Last week, ISIS released a video showing its fighters burning al-Kasasbeh to death. A representative of the UAE government told CNN that no comment would be offered about the airstrike suspension. ISIS declared it had established a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria last year. Since then, it has gone on a murderous rampage that has included beheadings of foreigners. There are about 20,000 fighters in Syria who belong to terror groups such as ISIS, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center will tell a House committee on Wednesday, according to remarks obtained by CNN. ""The United States and our allies are increasingly concerned with the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have traveled to Syria from over 90 different countries,"" Nick Rasmussen plans to tell the Homeland Security Committee. That is 1,000 higher than the number of foreign fighters in an estimate given by intelligence officials in January. The numbers of Westerners -- 3,400 -- and Americans -- 150 -- who have gone to Syria are similar to numbers given by officials in recent months. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians have fled areas ISIS has seized. The United States, along with European and Arab nations, began airstrikes against the terror group last summer. Kurdish fighters have captured three important bridgeheads on the Tigris River near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, developments that further restricts ISIS' movement outside Iraq's second-largest municipality, U.S. military and Kurdish officials said Tuesday. ISIS took control of Mosul in June. But Kurdish ground forces, as well as airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition, recently have tried to cut off Mosul's lines of supply to ISIS in Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault by the Iraqi military later this year to expel the terror group from the city. The three captured bridgeheads are on the west bank of the Tigris north of Mosul, U.S. Central Command and Kurdish officials said. Besides hindering ISIS' movement outside the city, the Kurds' gains would protect key points through which an operation to liberate Mosul could take place. Mosul is a predominantly Arab city, though the Kurds have an autonomous region to the north and east. Few expect the Kurds to be involved in clearing Mosul of ISIS -- that would be a job for Iraqi government security forces. But with Mosul so close to their territory, the Kurds do have an interest in choking off ISIS and preventing them from advancing. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq . Iraqi ground forces could begin a move to retake the city as soon as April, a U.S. Central Command official told CNN last week. Tuesday's developments come three days after heavy coalition airstrikes around Mosul -- part of what Kurdish fighters said was the heaviest day of bombardment they had witnessed there. A CNN crew, watching from Kurdish positions on Mount Zartak to the east of Mosul on Saturday, heard more than a dozen detonations in the direction of the city. CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Phil Black and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Official will tell congressional hearing that Syrian foreign fighters have grown to 20,000 .

"Beverly Hills, California (CNN)It looks decrepit and disheveled. But if a witch were rich, she might feel right at home in this Beverly Hills house. Just a few blocks from Rodeo Drive sits the Spadena House, or Witch's House as it is universally called, inducing double takes from most who pass by. ""Most people think it's dilapidated and vacant,"" says Michael J. Libow, owner of the storybook home. ""I'm an odd person to begin with, and the home is so odd for its neighborhood."" If it weren't so impressive, the Witch's House might be an eyesore: The shutters look like they're falling off, the roof is curling and the yard is thorny. It resembles the rickety gingerbread house occupied by the witch in ""Hansel and Gretel."" ""The whole concept is that the house should feel as if it emanated from the ground,"" says Libow, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent who bought the home nearly two decades ago and has been restoring its, well, decay ever since. Everything is carefully designed to create ""a home that looks as if it's 300 years old that really isn't."" Take the rotting cedar shingles:  Libow had them dyed to look like they'd been on the home for centuries. The wavy look of the roof makes it appear as if ""the home could take off at any moment,"" he says -- witchcraft, you might say, achieved by stacking plywood underneath the shingles. Libow actually lives in the home, making it off limits to the public. But tour guides shuttle eager visitors past the home daily. ""It is, I'm told, the most requested noncelebrity house to visit in Los Angeles,"" says Libow. And while overzealous tour guides tout its appearance in everything from ""The Witches of Eastwick"" to ""Hocus Pocus,"" Libow says the only modern-day film the home has appeared in was 1995's ""Clueless."" ""It was strictly a background shot (with) Alicia Silverstone walking by the house,"" he says. ""But everybody respects the home for being in that movie."" The Witch's House is believed to have first appeared on screen in the 1921 silent film ""The Face of the World,"" says Kimberly Reiss of Beverly Hills Heritage, an organization dedicated to promoting the history of the city. The building was constructed a year earlier in 1920 on the Willat Studios lot in Culver City, California, and was used as both a studio office and dressing room, Reiss says. After the studio shut down, a producer moved it to Walden Drive in Beverly Hills in 1924 where it began its second act as a private residence. ""The thing that makes this property important is it set the bar for storybook architecture in Los Angeles during the '20s and '30s,"" she says. By the time the home came back on the market in the late 1990s, Libow, a Realtor, called it a ""sixties nightmare"" and it was only getting interest from buyers who wanted to tear it down, something the seller forbid. The more Libow showed the Witch's House, the more it cast a spell on him. ""I think it just hit me one day, and I thought, 'You know what? Why not?'"" he said. ""Jump in; take a chance. I'm big on taking risks."" Libow bought the home and over the next decade transformed it into what it is today: an upscale incarnation of a storybook home. He's even furnished the home with pieces to match the fairy tale theme, including a dining room table with a tree-trunk base. Today, the home isn't just a tour stop or a must-visit for trick-or-treaters on Halloween. In 2013 the Witch's House became an official Beverly Hills landmark, something Libow worked hard to achieve. ""It gives me great joy to be able to bring joy to people who stop by to look at it,"" Libow says, though he concedes there's always a few scared by the Witch's House, particularly children. They might have good reason:  Libow gleefully notes his oven is ""just about perfect child-size. Something every witch should have.""","Spadena House in Beverly Hills is universally called the Witch's House .

"Washington (CNN)Bernie Sanders might not be a member of the Democratic Party, but the independent senator from Vermont is openly considering a run at the party's presidential nomination -- and that might not be a problem after all. According to a Democratic National Committee aide, Sanders would not have a problem getting on Democratic primary and caucus ballots because the current party rules do not call for presidential candidates to be registered members of the party. The DNC defines a presidential candidate as someone who ""has accrued delegates in the nominating process and plans to seek the nomination, has established substantial support for his or her nomination as the Democratic candidate for the Office of the President of the United States, is a bona fide Democrat whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings and/or public statements affirmatively demonstrates that he or she is faithful to the interests, welfare and success of the Democratic Party of the United States, and will participate in the Convention in good faith."" Sanders, according to the DNC aide who asked to be anonymous because he is not yet a candidate, appears to comply with those rules. ""There is no registration requirement,"" said the aide. ""You have to be a good faith Democrats, but you don't have to submit some sort of proof of registration. There is no long form birth certificate required showing you were born a Democrat."" States do have the ability to write their own rules for who qualifies as a candidate in their respective primary or caucus, but the aide said no one at the DNC can recall a state that has ever included being a registered Democrat as a requirement for their presidential candidates. That is the case for Iowa in 2016, too. ""The Iowa Democratic Party has always welcomed potential candidates for our party's Presidential nomination with open arms,"" said Christina Freundlich, spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party. ""In terms of who is eligible to participate as a candidate, we take our cues from the DNC's rules."" Tad Devine, a Democratic political consultant working with senator, points out that because Sanders has come up politically in Vermont -- a state with no party registration -- there is actually no way for him to register officially as a Democrat. ""The mechanism doesn't exist,"" said Devine. The political consultant, however, said that in order to get on the ballot in some states, Sanders would have to ""pledge some allegiance to the Democratic Party."" ""He won't have to sign on to every plank of the Democratic platform in order to get in, but he will have to acknowledge that he is running as a Democrat,"" Devine said. ""I think Bernie will have to do that."" Sanders has caucused with the Democratic Party ever since he came to Washington as a congressman in 1991. He unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1971 as a member of Liberty Union party and, in 1981, when he successfully ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he did so as an independent. At times, the senator identifies as a democratic (small D) socialist. But now that he is considering a run for the Democratic nomination, his calculation is changing. ""I am getting balder and balder trying to figure these things out,"" he said at an event in Washington, D.C. on Monday where he acknowledged -- as he has before -- that he would not run outside the Democratic party establishment. Whether he would change his party affiliation is another story. ""That is a decision I would have to make,"" he has said. Devine, the political consultant working with Sanders, put it bluntly: ""Would something stop Bernie from running as a Democrat? The bottom line answer to that is no.""","A Democratic National Committee aide says the fact Bernie Sanders isn't a registered Democrat might not be a presidential problem for him .
The party defines ""bona fide Democrats"" as someone ""whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings"" comport with the party .

"(CNN)The first day of same-sex marriage turned out to be a mixed bag for Alabama. While many couples converged on courthouses in population centers like Montgomery, Birmingham and Huntsville to exchange vows, other would-be newlyweds -- the majority of them in rural counties -- were turned away. ""It was so joyous to be able to see these couples who had been together for 20, 30 years to marry and to have their relationship respected,"" said Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama. At the same time, she said, it was ""painful to couples who want to get married and who were denied."" It's unclear exactly how many counties issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples after federal courts ruled they could go forward on Monday. Several counties, including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison (which have the state's highest populations of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute) told CNN they were issuing licenses, while others said they were following a Sunday order from state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore telling probate judges not to issue the licenses because the federal courts lacked jurisdiction. Tuscaloosa County chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the county would follow Moore's guidance and, ""We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses."" Likewise, Lee County Judge Bill English said he, too, was ""complying with an order from the chief justice late last night."" As of late Tuesday, at least 44 counties were not issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 21 were, said Human Rights Campaign spokesman Ianthe Metzger. His group was still trying to get confirmation on two counties. The ACLU's Alabama office, which set up a hot line, received complaints from about 50 couples, Watson said. It was widely reported that some counties weren't issuing any licenses. Marshall and Shelby counties' probate offices told CNN they were in that group. Watson's organization is now working to obtain a federal court order to explain ""to probate judges that they're required to follow the U.S. Constitution"" rather than Moore's order, she said. A hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Alabama's Southern District in Mobile, which, incidentally, is one of the counties that reportedly did not issue the licenses. A call to the Mobile County Probate Court was not returned. Mobile County has the state's fourth-highest population of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute, and the ACLU of Alabama is involved in a lawsuit filed by four same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in the county, Watson said. Though Watson believes the federal courts were unequivocal in allowing same-sex marriages to go forward in the state, Moore -- who issued his order in response to a U.S. District Court ruling, prior to a similar ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday -- couldn't agree less. In fact, had the Supreme Court ruled on the issue before he sent his order to probate judges, he said he still would have gone through with it. ""The Supreme Court order doesn't affect what I said,"" he said. Because the original lawsuit -- filed by a woman who, despite being legally married in California, was prohibited from adopting her partner's 9-year-old -- targets only Attorney General Luther Strange, the high court's ruling applied only to Strange, Moore said. And since probate courts fall under Moore's authority as the administrative head of the judicial branch, he said, judges were free to disregard the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which declined to extend a stay on Alabama's prohibition of same-sex marriages beyond Monday. A federal district court and appeals court had also declined Strange's request to extend the stay. Moore denied Jefferson County Probate Judge Alan King's assertion that Moore's Sunday order was akin to then-Gov. George Wallace's 1963 stand in the schoolhouse door to block integration at the University of Alabama. In Alabama, he noted, Amendment 774, or the Sanctity of Marriage Act, makes it unconstitutional to perform same-sex marriages or civil unions. It passed with 81% approval in 2006. (A 2012 poll says that approval for same-sex marriage in the state is 32%, among the lowest in the country.) ""I'm not standing in any door. I did not bring this on. This was forced upon our state. This is simply federal tyranny,"" he said. ""This is not about race. This is about entering into the institution of marriage."" The chief justice, who once lost his post in 2003 for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from a state building in Montgomery, said his decision was not based on his religion. Unlike sexuality, he said, race cannot be used to deny someone's rights. Race is biologically predetermined, where in the case of sexuality, ""people can choose different lifestyles and no doubt they have since Sodom and Gomorrah,"" he said, referring to the cities destroyed in the Bible's Book of Genesis. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to address the larger issue -- specifically, whether same-sex marriage in four states deserves the protection of the U.S. Constitution -- later this year. While Moore doesn't believe the high court has the jurisdiction to redefine the definitions of family and marriage, he concedes that if the justices rule same-sex marriage is constitutionally protected, Alabama judges would have to honor the unions under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. However, ""I will not concur that that is a proper ruling under the Constitution of the United States,"" he said, explaining his personal beliefs. Watson and other observers believe the Monday decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a sign of what's to come when the high court rules on the larger issue. ""I think that tells us something about what we might expect,"" she said. Moore doesn't see any writing on the wall. ""I don't think the ruling is a harbinger,"" he said. ""Justices (Elena) Kagan and (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg both have performed same-sex marriages. They should both be recused from this case. When you have a predisposition ... you have no right to sit on the case. They're flouting the ethical rules that apply to most judges in this country."" CNN's Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report.","It's unclear how many counties declined to give licenses to same-sex couples .

"(CNN)In a world where the niche-hip is elevated to cultural elite on a weekly basis, it was probably inevitable: the humble taco truck has gone Hollywood. With the 2014 release of his critically acclaimed film, ""Chef,"" writer, director, actor Jon Favreau (""Iron Man,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" ""Swingers"") tracks the journey of a fictional food truck and its quick-tempered chef on its rise from Miami obscurity peddling Cubano sandwiches to a place in the Los Angeles culinary pantheon. If you think this is a quaint little movie about a minor trend, consider the group that showed up at its table. A-listers who appear in the movie include Dustin Hoffman, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. (As a softie supportive ex playing against hot-headed-temptress type, Vergara might be the most satisfying surprise ingredient in the film.) Favreau, who wrote, directed and stars in the film as chef Carl Casper, drew inspiration from real life. ""The food truck scene has definitely become emblematic of Los Angeles,"" Favreau tells CNN. ""It mixes up Mexican, Korean, Jewish, health food ... every kind of culture here. It's a reflection of and a recombination of the foods and culture that make up the tapestry of L.A. ""I eat at as many food trucks as I can."" Roy Choi a must get . As soon as he finished his script for the film, Favreau says he sought out the consultation services of chef Roy Choi, the unrivaled boss of L.A.'s still-booming food truck scene. In 2008, Choi created the now ubiquitous Korean barbecue taco and launched it from a truck he dubbed Kogi. Today, Kogi operates four trucks that roam the city. Imitators of Choi's famed Korean barbecue tacos (two crisp corn tortillas, caramelized Korean barbecue short rib meat, salsa roja, cilantro-onion-lime relish, Napa Romaine slaw, chili-soy vinaigrette) can now be found from New York to Hong Kong to Amsterdam. Rather than being annoyed by the doppelgangers, Choi says he's honored. ""A lot of them (Korean-taco vendors) are putting their own spin on it,"" he says. ""They don't call themselves Kogi, so it's a form of love."" ""DJs all have the same music, the same beats to choose from, it's which ones you choose and how you mix them up that makes you an original,"" adds Favreau. ""Food trucks are our bootleg tapes."" Humble sizzle . L.A.'s food trucks are an extension of Southern California's long-established ""taco trucks."" These are typically plain white trucks that sell cheap and freshly made tacos, quesadillas and other Mexican ""fast food."" Modern ""food trucks"" -- sometimes owner-operated (as in ""Chef""), sometimes run by larger business entities -- have taken the mobile food concept and expanded the menu options considerably. You can now buy everything from acai bowls to greasy burgers to Maine lobster from food trucks. The shared lineage means the terms ""taco truck"" and ""food truck"" are sometimes used interchangeably -- but shouldn't be mistaken for the similar-in-appearance white ""catering trucks"" (known colloquially as ""roach coaches"") that pull up to construction sites, warehouses and office buildings selling pre-packaged sandwiches, bags of chips, candy and beverages to workers. Apps track trucks . Food trucks travel the city and park at different places and times each day or week. Of several apps that have been launched to help track their movements, Roaming Hunger is among the most popular. Many trucks operate their own websites to let fans know where they'll be on any given day and time. Kogi, whose four trucks cover all of Los Angeles County, updates its site daily and covers various social media bases. From the start, social media has been instrumental in the rise of food trucks. Kogi was established in 2008, shortly after Twitter began to gain mass popularity. Choi used Twitter to help build interest in his fledgling operation. One of the most famous results was the day he parked his truck at midnight on the campus of UCLA during finals week. When he arrived he found almost a thousand students lined up for his tacos. ""Twitter, that's why Kogi blew up,"" he says. In ""Chef,"" Favreau imitates the model, with the lead character's El Jefe food truck getting a huge boost from Twitter popularity. Four-star parking lot . At L.A.'s The Brig parking lot (1515 Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Venice Beach), a food truck rally is held the first Friday night of each month, usually starting from 6 p.m. More than a dozen trucks descend on the parking lot, selling everything from grilled cheese sandwiches to Spam musubi to cupcakes. The parking lot, which Favreau calls ""ground zero of the L.A. food truck movement,"" is where Choi first parked his Kogi truck in Los Angeles. Show up for a First Friday event at The Brig and you'll see exactly how Hollywood food trucks have gone since then. Through the crowd of eaters, a squad of valet parkers rushes out to park your car -- while you visit a parking lot. Only in L.A.? Possibly. But it's a critical darling that just may be coming soon to a parking lot near you. Have you got a favorite food truck in Los Angeles or another city?

"(CNN)The fighting in Ukraine may be escalating, but hopes of a decisive breakthrough in talks and a clear and coordinated Western response -- hopes raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to Washington on Monday -- have been dashed, at least for now. Intensifying clashes in eastern Ukraine following a new Russian-backed separatist offensive on January 13 have fueled debate over how the United States and others should respond to the uptick in violence, including growing talk of the U.S. sending weapons. Just last week, a report by prominent former diplomats and highly respected members of the U.S. national security establishment argued for a drastic increase in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including the provision of lethal weapons. But while Western concern is understandable, Merkel is right that the U.S. sending weapons is not the best way forward. Last week's report, by eight former top U.S. officials, urged the administration to dispatch about $1 billion worth of defensive military equipment to Ukraine, per year.  It argued that Russia was sensitive to casualties, and that raising the costs for Moscow militarily would alter its course in the conflict. Yet such an approach seems built on wishful thinking. Russia would counter any American weapons sent with its own, and respond asymmetrically, escalating the conflict. As a result, the policy would be laid bare for what it is -- an unnecessary risk for Ukraine, one that would leave little scope for achieving peace. True, with support, coordination, and heavy armaments from Russia, the separatists have managed to push Ukrainian forces north of the previous line of control, leaving Ukraine's military in a precarious position. And while the separatists have also taken losses, they appear to have an endless supply of tanks and mechanized equipment from Moscow. But a joint press conference Monday between Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama made clear that the way forward will involve another attempt at reaching a ceasefire agreement, backed with the already enacted sanctions and economic pressure on Russia. And while the President kept the option of sending lethal aid on the table, Merkel appeared adamant that this kind of policy is unlikely ever to be realized. Such an approach appears to reflect an understanding among European leaders that the opportunity cost of continuing this conflict could be that Ukraine misses its chance to become a developed member of the European community. As a result, they are unwilling to give war a chance, and Merkel's statements simply reflect a belief that all bets are being placed on sanctions rather than a military solution as the much-needed Western political and economic nation building effort continues in Ukraine. Monday's meeting followed on the heels of Merkel's trip to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Perhaps wisely, both sides appeared to try to keep expectations low, and they were openly pessimistic about the prospect for peace as Russia presses for political recognition for the separatist enclaves, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and a redrawing of the border based on separatist gains. Kiev for its part has argued that autonomy should only be granted after legitimate elections are carried out in these regions, and the government refuses to recognize any territory recently lost to separatists. Further undermining the prospects of a deal is the lack of confidence in Kiev that Moscow would follow through with any deal it signs, although the economic damage wrought by sanctions may be creating a genuine desire to end the conflict for Russia's leaders. Russia's end game--federalization of Ukraine, autonomy for the separatists, and a permanent hook over the strategic choices the country makes--simply cannot be agreed to. The question is whether Putin will settle for something more reasonable, and sensible. Will the sanctions currently in place be enough to pressure Russia's ruler into rethinking his policy in Ukraine? Some have speculated that statements last week, suggesting the White House was seriously entertaining the idea of providing weapons, were actually part of a deliberate attempt to ratchet up pressure on Moscow, even though sanctions are clearly the preferred policy. Certainly, Obama's remarks Monday made clear that the United States is somewhat cautious over the risks of sending weapons, and he appeared to note the chain of custody risks, along with the danger of encouraging Ukrainian leaders to take offensive action by sending arms. Obama also seems wary that whatever arms the U.S. sends would be dwarfed by Russia's considerable conventional superiority. As a result, while the debate on weapons for Ukraine is not over, it appears settled for now.  Moving forward, the West should consider what could be dubbed a nonlethal-plus option -- significantly increasing nonlethal aid and doubling down on efforts at economic support for Ukraine. In the meantime, fighting is likely to escalate in advance of any peace talks that might occur this week as both sides grapple for favorable conditions on the ground. With that in mind, it is hard to imagine that Russian forces won't intervene further to tilt the balance on the ground against Ukraine. Whether or not Moscow's peace overtures are genuine -- and Putin seeks an eventual end to sanctions -- will become clear in the coming weeks. But either way, Ukraine will have to find a way forward without lethal support from the West. This will, of course, come as a disappointment to Ukrainian leaders. But it is hard to see how adding fuel to an already raging fire would have made an end to this conflict more likely. For now, sober minds have prevailed, and the United States has avoided a dangerous rift with Germany over a policy unlikely to yield any positive results for Ukraine.","Fighting has flared again in eastern Ukraine .

"Casey Kasem, who entertained radio listeners for almost four decades as the host of countdown shows such as ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" died early Sunday, according to a Facebook post from his daughter Kerri Kasem. The news was confirmed by Casey's Kasem's agent, Don Pitts. Casey Kasem was 82 and had been hospitalized in Washington state for two weeks. ""Early this Father's Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,"" Kasem's children -- Kerri, Mike and Julie -- wrote in a statement released by Kasem's representative, Danny Deraney. ""Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken ... The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad."" Kasem's longtime friend, Gonzalo Venecia, and his younger brother, Mouner Kasem, were also with him when he died at St. Anthony's Hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington, at 3:25 a.m. Sunday, a family member said. Casey Kasem had been suffering  from Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's. He had recently been the subject of a bitter court battle involving three of his children by a previous marriage and his wife, Jean. His oldest children, who challenged their stepmother for control of Kasem's medical decisions in his last months, are not fighting his wife for possession of his remains, a family member told CNN Sunday. Daughter Julie Kasem will host a memorial celebration at her Northridge, California, home on Saturday, June 21, the family member said.  No other funeral arrangements were yet known. No autopsy is expected since Kasem died under a doctor's care in a hospital.  The immediate cause of death was from sepsis caused by an ulcerated bedsore, the family member said. Casey Kasem's family feud . In May, a California judge awarded Kerri Kasem temporary power of attorney after Jean Kasem took her husband out of a nursing home and moved him to Washington amid family feuding. A Washington judge later allowed Kerri to visit her father in that state. Casey Kasem was hospitalized after an argument between Jean and Kerri in which his wife threw meat at her stepdaughter. Last week, a Los Angeles County judge gave daughter Kerri Kasem the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine. Kasem was already a popular disc jockey in Los Angeles when he became the host of ""American Top 40"" in 1970. The syndicated show, which counted down the 40 most popular songs in the United States based on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 music chart, began on just seven radio stations but quickly became a mainstay of thousands, all around the world. ""When we first went on the air, I thought we would be around for at least 20 years. I knew the formula worked. I knew people tuned in to find out what the No. 1 record was,"" he told Variety in 1989. Kasem's first No. 1, concluding the ""AT40"" premiere show of July 4, 1970, was Three Dog Night's ""Mama Told Me (Not to Come)."" His last on successor show ""American Top 20,"" almost exactly 39 years later, was ""Second Chance"" by Shinedown. But the show wasn't just about finding out who was No. 1. Its features, included biographical details on performs, flashbacks, album cuts and Kasem's ""long-distance dedication"" for listeners who wrote to dedicate songs to friends and loved ones far away. Kasem, whose baritone was always friendly and upbeat, delivered these in his most sympathetic voice, warm enough to melt butter. ""Dear Casey,"" he began, and would read an emotional letter from a listener who wanted to connect with an old flame, express regret to a new love or send wishes to a far-flung family member. The first one, for example, was from a male listener who wanted to dedicate Neil Diamond's ""Desiree"" to a sweetheart named Desiree who was moving to Germany. The show, originally three hours, expanded to four in the late '70s. Tributes: 'Keep reaching for the stars' In many ways, even as Top 40 radio moved from the AM to the FM dial and took on the name ""Contemporary Hit Radio,"" ""American Top 40"" remained a throwback to the way the format was in the 1960s, with frequent number jingles (""Number 29!"") and a fast-moving mix, though Kasem, in temperament, practically defined the laid-back hosts of the Me Decade. (The exception to the laid-back rule was a much-copied outtake, now readily available on the Internet, of Kasem exploding in anger over a long-distance dedication that succeeded an up-tempo record.) The show inspired several imitators, including a television version, ""America's Top 10,"" hosted by Kasem himself. Kasem left ""American Top 40"" in 1988 over a contract dispute with ABC Radio Networks and signed with competitor Westwood One, for whom he started a show called ""Casey's Top 40"" in 1989. The new show used a different publication's chart, but it was the same old Casey: smooth, cheerful, full of information. ""The magic of Casey is that he is the ultimate professional in whatever he does. ... He enlightens, he explores, he suggests, he provokes and he informs,"" fellow DJ Gary Owens told Billboard in 1997. Kasem acquired the name ""American Top 40"" and in 1998 resumed hosting the program with a new syndicator. (The ABC show, with Shadoe Stevens replacing Kasem, had been canceled in 1995.) He handed off to Ryan Seacrest in 2004, though he continued with two other shows, ""American Top 20"" and ""American Top 10,"" until signing off in 2009 -- as always with his trademark line, ""Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."" Kemal Amin Kasem was born in Detroit in 1932. He first tried radio while in high school but found he had a talent for it while serving in Korea with the Army. He was a DJ on the Armed Forces Radio Network. Kasem's global reach: Long-distance dedications . After stops in several cities, including Flint, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; and San Francisco, he joined KRLA in Los Angeles in 1963, partly in hopes of an acting career. He did earn roles in a number of low-budget movies -- the most famous of which was probably ""The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant"" (1971) -- but his voice was always his ticket to fame, whether appearing on a Dick Clark-produced TV show, ""Shebang,"" or voicing the character of Shaggy on the cartoon ""Scooby-Doo,"" which premiered in 1969. (He also was the voice of Robin on ""Super Friends."") That voice became ubiquitous. He was NBC's promotional announcer in the late '70s and early '80s, and heard on dozens of commercials. But ""American Top 40"" remains his legacy. ""Kasem started the show in 1970, a curious time to start a show about Top 40 mainstream pop, because the format had just been pronounced dead and progressive album-oriented radio was on the rise,"" wrote Susan Orlean in a 1990 New York Times Magazine profile. ""He infused the show with corny reverence for conventional American values exactly when cynicism had become the more fashionable posture."" Kasem attributed his success to that everyday voice. ""It's not a clear-toned announcer's voice,"" he told the Times. ""It's more like the voice of the guy next door.'' Kasem is survived by his second wife, Jean, whom he married in 1985; and four children. All-time great DJs .

"(CNN)A friend of Bobbi Kristina Brown said police have questioned Brown's boyfriend about bruises on the young woman's chest after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub January 31. Brown, the only daughter of the late Whitney Houston, remains in a medically induced coma in a neuro intensive care unit at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. Monday night, friend Daphne Barak said that Nick Gordon, Brown's boyfriend, told her that the bruises were a result of him performing CPR on her. Gordon could not be reached for comment. The investigation is focusing on everyone who was in the house the night before the incident and on people who had contact with Gordon, according to a source with knowledge of the probe. Police are exploring all avenues to find out how and why Brown ended up face down in her bathtub with unexplained injuries to her body, the source said. ""Immediately, from the beginning, they asked him about injuries to the chest,"" Barak told HLN's Nancy Grace, adding that Brown is ""very tiny."" Her father's attorney released a statement criticizing the media for ""false reports."" ""The desire to be 'first' has clouded the judgment of many reporters as they forgo accuracy. This is a criminal investigation and the integrity of that process requires silence,"" Christopher Brown said. Police didn't call the case a criminal matter until Tuesday night. ""I can confirm that we have a criminal investigation ongoing,"" Roswell Police Chief Rusty Grant said in an email sent to CNN. Barak has been in close contact with the couple for more than a year, she said, adding that she believes Gordon and Brown were very much in love. ""These two young people -- he was everything for her, she was everything for him. ... They really were everything to each other,"" Barak said. Last week, a source close to the Brown family told CNN that Brown has injuries that need to be explained, but there have been no details disclosed publicly about the nature of those alleged injuries. ""I'm praying for her,"" Barak said. Houston died three years ago Wednesday. She was found dead in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on  February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party.

"(CNN)Entering The Unseen Emporium at London's Somerset House is like walking into an alchemist's workshop. The room smells strongly of burning sage, and there are old books stacked high on wooden shelves. An antique distillation kit sits in the disused fireplace with tiny glass bottles of oil, and long swaths of black cowhide hang from the walls. But most striking is the chameleonic couture on display. A bejeweled headdress, created with Swarovski's gemstones division, changes color based on the heat generated by the wearer's neural activity, thanks to hyper-conductive stones and heat-sensitive ink. The three sculptural leather jackets are infused with dye formulas that change color in response to different stimuli: friction, the temperature and humidity of the room, and intense heat. In its own room is a fragile ceramic dress called Eighthsense, covered with hand-painted pixels that reflect brain activity detected by an accompanying EEG headset. This was the public's formal introduction to The Unseen, a trio of London fashion designers using chemistry, digital technology and exquisite tailoring to create fashion magic. Last October, The Unseen's designers -- founder Lauren Bowker, Christa Leask and Jess Smith -- moved base from a cluttered studio in the vaults under Somerset House to a room in the building's new wing. When you enter, the one-off color-changing showpieces that have made them the darlings of the smart materials world immediately draw your attention, but there are other items on display too: color-changing trinkets -- candles, Moleskine notebooks and the like -- from their new product line. They may be known for their fashion output, but the designers are eager to expand beyond the label. ""For me, it's more of an exploration house,"" says Bowker. ""It's like a materials house at Liberty with science and a side of magic. On acid."" In that case, Bowker, who masterminds The Unseen's formulas and materials, could be considered the chief magician. Before launching The Unseen in February, she worked as a textiles consultant in a number of fields, from fashion to aviation. In 2013, tired of altering her ideas to meet corporate ends, she decided to venture out on her own with the help of a Â£25,000 ($38,000) grant from Innovate UK (then known as the Technology Strategy Board), and her best friends Smith and Leask, who are responsible for designing and executing the sculptural pieces. (The trio often describe themselves as ""the three witches with one eye"" because of their shared creative vision, and each has a flesh-tone tattoo of an eye on their inner finger to drive the point home.) Bowker, who has studied both fashion and chemistry, first started developing responsive color-change compounds while earning her Masters in textiles at the Royal College of Art, inspired by the debilitating spinal condition that has her in and out of hospital. ""I really want to create a product range for myself that means that I can monitor my spine and condition,"" she says. ""I don't listen to myself when I'm getting ill, and it gets to the point where I'm on crutches before I'll listen to the fact that I have to look after myself."" Early in her career she worked with the UK's National Health Service to develop a series of responsive bandages, but when it became clear that it would take at least 20 years to produce a working sample under their funding model, the project was shelved. She returned to her fashion roots to overcome this problem. ""I just thought there's got to be a quicker or more profitable way to do this, rather than doing this in pure research,"" she says. ""(The purpose of The Unseen) wasn't to be in all the press and everywhere. It was a strategic plan so we can create products that help people in their daily lives."" While they haven't developed chemistry-infused garments to help people just yet, The Unseen's current output has attracted attention across industries. They recently hosted representatives from luxury car companies interested in using their color change technology, and the team is gearing up to announce a very hush-hush capsule collection for a high-end heritage retailer. Recently, they've been in talks about exhibiting at The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the newly reopened Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City, and they will  be showcasing their work at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas this March. There are also ongoing discussions with the neurology team at King's College London about a collaboration that would give The Unseen unprecedented access to state-of-the-art ink technologies. But their next collection, which will likely be released next fall, is still somewhat of a mystery, even to them. Only one thing is certain: it won't involve color change. ""I don't want us to be a gimmick and then next year nobody's talking about us. I'm adamant that we will be around in 50 years,"" Bowker says. ""I really want The Unseen to become an iconic brand known for pushing innovation and pushing materials in a magical way.""","London design house The Unseen creates fashions that instantly change color based on heat, brain activity and friction .

"(CNN)In David Axelrod's new book ""Believer: My Forty Years In Politics"", the top adviser to President Obama recounts a scene before the 2012 reelection campaign when the president composed his ""Bulworth"" list of  ""issues on which he felt he had been insufficiently forthright."" These are things ""I'll want to work on in my second term,"" the president told  his top staffers, as one of them referenced the Warren Beatty movie Bulworth, in which a candidate goes on a reckless spree of truth-telling. ""Some of them may make you guys nervous. But Axe keeps saying I should be 'authentic.' So maybe I should go out there and just let it rip."" Axelrod book: Obama lied on same-sex marriage . In addition to revealing his actual position in favor of legal same-sex marriages, and working on immigration reform and to combat climate change, the president singled out the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Axelrod wrote. Specifically, he wanted to be tougher on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""From almost his first day in office, (President Obama) had pushed the Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution, but his efforts, like those of presidents before him, had been run aground by the intractable politics of the Middle East. He was frustrated with both sides, but felt he had pulled his punches with Netanyahu to avoid antagonizing elements of the American Jewish community."" The Obama-Netanyahu tensions have exploded into public view in recent weeks, in this second Obama term, with the Israeli Prime Minister coming to speak to Congress to press legislators to pass a bill to impose more sanctions on Iran, contrary to the president's desires. The president has said he wants to give diplomats time to come to a peaceful resolution to convince Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program. There have been harsh and accusatory back and forth quotes on the record and on background between the Obama and Netanyahu camps. Elsewhere in the book, Axelrod, who is Jewish, wrote that the president is a strong supporter of the Jewish state. Of the president's trip to Israel as a presidential candidate in 2008, Axelrod wrote that the ""visit would help quell the concerns of some American Jews, who feared that a black man with an Islamic-sounding name and a Farrakhan-hugging minister would not feel a sufficient bond with Israel."" Despite the presence of Axelrod and other Jews among the ranks of Obama senior advisers, ""the questions persisted. 'I know what he says about Israel,' I was asked more than once by anxious Jews back home, 'but does he feel it in his kishkes?' Though the questions would persist into his presidency, on this trip, Barack more than passed the kishkes test."" More recent results of the kishkes test were unclear as of press time.

"(CNN) -- Formula One driver Robert Kubica has undergone a seven-hour operation in an Italian hospital after crashing while competing in a rally. The 26-year-old Pole lost control of his Skoda Fabia car at the beginning of the Ronde de Andorra rally near the town of Testico, causing the vehicle to leave the road at high speed. Kubica, who drives for the Lotus Renault team, was airlifted to the Santa Corona hospital in nearby Pietra Ligure where he underwent emergency surgery. ""Surgeons are trying to restore the functionality of his right hand,"" Kubica's manager Daniel Morelli told reporters outside the hospital. ""They have restarted the circulation of blood and repaired the bone structure. Now they have to think about the muscle functionality but Robert has a very strong character, he'll be OK."" Kubica's co-driver, Jakub Gerber, was unhurt in the incident, which occurred as he lost control of his car on a bend. The impact saw the guard rail break the drivers' side door and cause the injuries to Kubica. Italian media reported Sunday night that surgeon Igor Rossello was pleased with the outcome of the emergency surgery on the F1 star. But he will spend the night in an induced coma and it will be some days before it is known if he will gain the full use of his hand. Kubica, who has one grand prix victory to his name and finished eighth in last season's Formula One driver's standings, is no stranger to serious accidents during his motorsport career. He had to undergo surgery to his left arm after an accident while driving in the Formula Three discipline in 2003 and also suffered a spectacular crash in the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix. The first race of the 2011 Formula One season takes place in Bahrain on March 13 and it appears likely that reserve driver Bruno Senna will be called in to take Kubica's place.","NEW: F1 star Robert Kubica has seven-hour operation for serious hand and leg injuries .

"(CNN)Nigeria has just postponed their national elections by six weeks, now to be held on the 28th March. But this is no simple logistical delay -- the electoral commission announced they were ready for the vote. Instead, the Nigerian military said they cannot provide security across the country on voting day, and so forced the electoral commission to postpone the vote. The decision is extremely controversial as these elections are set to be the closest since Nigeria returned to democracy in in 1999, after decades of coups and military rule. The military say they need to concentrate on a new offensive against the Islamic militant group, Boko Haram, in north-east Nigeria. But it is likely no coincidence that the offensive comes after incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan also pushed for a postponement of the elections. Nigeria's opposition party have called the postponement a ""setback for democracy,"" as they now fear the military's decision to force the postponement threatens not only their momentum, but the election itself. But this is a problem not just for Nigeria. U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, has released an unusually strong statement saying the U.S. is ""deeply disappointed."" He goes on: ""Political interference with the Independent National Electoral Commission is unacceptable, and it is critical that the government not use security concerns as a pretext for impeding the democratic process."" U.S.-Nigeria relations are at a nadir, and at risk is America's relationship with one of its most important allies in a region threatened by one of the world's most violent terrorist groups, Boko Haram. The intervention by the military is a serious blow not just to this election but also Nigeria's young democratic process. And it couldn't happen at a more dangerous time. Despite being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, Nigeria's oil dependent economy has been rocked by falling oil prices, with the worst performing stock market in Africa, record lows for the Naira currency, and depleted foreign exchange savings. But perhaps the biggest danger is Boko Haram, which has made dramatic territorial gains over the past few months in the North East, and despite the latest offensive to counter the threat, they continue to attack major strategic towns. The postponement brings new uncertainty and new dangers. In 2011, over 1,000 people were killed in post-election violence after Goodluck's victory, as a Christian southerner, which was seen as illegitimate in the mostly northern, Islamic region of the country. This time, people's hopes, tempers and disillusionment are, if anything, even higher. Nigeria has an immense ability to absorb crises and the military's direct threat to the electoral process has passed, not without comment, but without incident. But there are now six weeks to the election. The fear is that this is simply the quiet before the perfect storm. Voters take to Twitter as elections are delayed . by Thomas Page, for CNN . Upon hearing the news of the postponement, people in Africa's most populous country took to social media to voice their opinions. The decision was decried by many as a flawed and weak excuse, and with the date of March 28 tied to the caveat of an improvement in the security situation, some voiced concerns about the possibility of future delays. Some believed President Johnathan was behind the delay, saying that he will now use the time to whip up extra support. Whereas others thought the move was designed to extenuate the opposition's funding. Some believed the delay was a call to arms for all Nigerians to be active players in the democratic process. Others had nothing but tears. Whilst many fear the worst. Read more about the Nigerian election here . Read more from African Voices .","Elections in Nigeria have been delayed for six weeks .

"(CNN)The call to police was for cardiac arrest. But the strangulation and trauma wounds on the 18-year-old woman suggested something far more violent happened. Karlie Hall was found in her dorm room Sunday morning at Millersville University, about an hour west of Philadelphia, the Lancaster County District Attorney's Office said. Her boyfriend, 19-year-old Gregorio Orrostieta, called 911 around 5:20 a.m., prosecutor Craig Stedman said. ""We didn't know we had a crime at first,"" Stedman told CNN. But the prosecutor said Orrostieta later told authorities the couple had a fight. An autopsy Monday revealed Hall suffered trauma and strangulation wounds. Orrostieta has been charged with criminal homicide. He is being held without bail. Stedman said the couple started dating 11 months ago, when she was in high school. Orrostieta is not a student at Millersville University. About three hours before Orrostieta called 911, a residential assistant heard a struggle and knocked on Hall's dorm room door, Stedman said. But no one answered the door, and the residential assistant went back to bed. ""Our university community has suffered an unfathomable loss,"" Millersville University President John Anderson wrote.

"(CNN)The Anti-Defamation League has condemned a product sold in Urban Outfitters stores that it says resembles uniforms prisoners were forced to wear during the Holocaust. The gray and white striped tapestry features pink triangles. During the Holocaust, gay people were made to wear a pink triangle for identification purposes. A letter from the ADL to Urban Outfitters President and CEO Richard A. Hayne objected to the ""insensitive design and the company's periodic use of products within the realm of Holocaust imagery."" A request for comment from Urban Outfitters was not immediately answered Tuesday. ""Whether intentional or not, this gray and white stripped pattern and pink triangle combination is deeply offensive and should not be mainstreamed into popular culture,"" said ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman in the letter. The ADL took the retailer to task in 2012 for selling a T-shirt with a star on its pocket, claiming the design looked like the Star of David symbol that Jewish people were made to wear during the Holocaust. The product ""represents a new low,"" the ADL said at the time. Urban Outfitters has been criticized and even sued for selling other products, including designs labeled ""Navajo."" The retailer stopped selling a ""vintage"" Kent State sweatshirt that had what appeared to be simulated blood splatter on it last year after objections flooded in.

"(CNN)Late last month, the U.S. Senate voted to approve the siting of the Keystone pipeline by a vote of 62-36. This vote will ultimately have little impact on the project's future as President Barack Obama has promised to veto the legislation. Nevertheless, the process by which the Senate considered this highly partisan issue was truly remarkable. Over three weeks, the Senate debated and voted on 41 amendments -- nearly three times as many amendments as were considered during all of 2014. Moreover, the process was cordial, occasionally intense and at times even suspenseful. While covering a wide variety of topics, the amendments were all substantive and reasonably related to the topic of the proposed legislation. Votes were taken on delaying the effective date of the pipeline; requiring campaign finance disclosures for those benefiting from tar sands development; and removing the lesser prairie chicken from the threatened species list. Several amendments were adopted including bipartisan legislation to accelerate energy efficiency and a widely supported resolution acknowledging that climate change is real and not a hoax. Given the authentic opportunity to debate, Democrats responded in kind, agreeing to a fixed number of amendments and a endorsing a process for final consideration of the legislation. This blast of engagement is not a testament to the exceptional or unique significance of the Keystone debate. It is also not a coincidence. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has committed to restoring the Senate's deliberative process even if it means spending more time in Washington and subjecting his caucus to the occasional ""tough vote."" The Senate's ability to conduct this productive process while considering a hotly contested and highly partisan issue is an early sign that both Republicans and Democrats are up to the challenge. The more open debate created an obligation and opportunity for Energy Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, to work closely with the committee's ranking member, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington. Energy policy is often a topic that can generate bipartisan support, and this early legislative activity is promising, even if the debate was partisan and at times even harsh. More fundamentally, that the full Senate spent long hours together in the chamber is a breakthrough. The process may be laborious, but it's the essence of our democracy. To appreciate the ramifications of a return to active deliberation, it is necessary to understand the dynamics at the heart of congressional gridlock. The usual diagnosis of our government's recent dysfunction is that toxic polarization and anger are preventing deliberation. But the reverse is equally true: the absence of deliberation has also caused exasperation, enmity and toxic polarization. In the six years that former Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska served in the Senate, he did not have a single amendment considered on the Senate floor -- not one. Imagine a pilot who is never allowed to fly a plane or a surgeon barred from the operating room and you'll get a sense of the exasperation felt by those serving in a dysfunctional democracy. Centrist Democrat Joe Manchin lamented last year that his worst day as governor of West Virginia was better than his best day as a U.S. senator. And yet another senator grudgingly described his job to me as that of a ""glorified telemarketer who occasionally gets to vote to confirm an assistant secretary of education."" This boiling resentment must be channeled somewhere, and much of it follows the path of least resistance -- feeding the foul mood and partisan rancor that undermines collaboration. Even when the vast majority of amendments are defeated, the very act of being heard serves as a safety valve, releasing some of the steam and reducing the likelihood that issues blow up. Moreover, the ability to debate amendments provides an incentive for building coalitions. Why take on the political risk of pushing an idea that is at odds with leadership or orthodoxy if you'll never even be heard? An additional reason McConnell may be opening up the process is that the political strategy of avoiding tough votes was, thankfully, a big flop in the 2014 elections. All of the seven purple state Democrats that Sen. Harry Reid sought to protect lost their seats. In each contest, these Democrats were aggressively challenged for voting in lockstep with the President's agenda. Given the opportunity to take some ""tough votes,"" they might have been able to demonstrate independence and courage. Looking to the future, the real question is whether McConnell can sustain his promise in light of the time commitment and occasional ""gotcha"" amendments that go along with open debate. There have been few opportunities of late to extol American democracy. Let's hope our leaders seize and build upon this opportunity to restore the wisdom and character of the U.S. Senate.","Jason Grumet: Keystone legislation is likely to be vetoed, but process was encouraging .

"Washington (CNN)It all started eight years ago Tuesday, near the spot where Abraham Lincoln once warned that America's divides could tear it apart. In Springfield, Illinois, Barack Obama flashed a smile, bounded on stage in a long dark coat, and vowed, like his political hero, to ""transform a nation"" and unleash a wave of hope and change. He looked as fresh as the frigid air in which thousands had gathered, wrapped up in scarves and winter coats, to witness the launch of a campaign that, improbably, would end in the White House. Eight years later, the end of Obama's grueling, crisis-addled administration is in sight and his supporters have learned by experience how much harder it is to be President than to run for the office. Dreams of a new bipartisan era have given way to constant confrontations with a Congress that is now completely controlled by Republicans, many of whom are on a mission to dismantle much of Obama's agenda. The situation isn't much better on the global front, where Obama continues to grapple with all-too-familiar foreign policy challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan along with new threats from Russia. From Tuesday, Obama's time left in the White House will be shorter than the time it took him to win the presidency, and his 2007 speech has become a cautionary tale of the gulf between powerful campaign rhetoric and reality. It also remains a guidepost to the political philosophy that has underpinned the Obama administration and a reference point for both backers and critics as they write history's first draft on his presidency. On that Saturday morning in 2007, from behind a podium bearing his new campaign logo, a rising sun symbolizing new hope, Obama -- with not a gray hair in his head -- rattled off a list of how he would change the nation. He pledged to deliver universal health care within four years, help families struggling from ""paycheck to paycheck,"" seek to end poverty in America, close out a ""war with no end"" and make future generations proud by defusing the threat from global warming. In hindsight, his sights were trained too high. While even his critics would admit Obama wrought significant political change, he has often fallen short of his rarefied goals, running up against a system of governance set up by America's founders to resist sharp change of political direction. Indeed, millions more people do have health insurance thanks to Obamacare. Universal coverage, however, remains a dream. Many Americans still live paycheck to paycheck. The economic crisis, yet to erupt when Obama gave his speech, meanwhile required the President to spend much of the political capital he won with his 2008 triumph on a financial overhaul that's now under attack by congressional Republicans. Tackling poverty is now the rallying call in yet another presidential campaign. Eyeing 2016, Republicans are suddenly joining the crusade. Congress, meanwhile, refused the tough economic pill that putting a cap on carbon emissions would entail. America's alliances may be in better shape than in the go-it-alone days of George W. Bush's first term. But trans-Atlantic tensions are obvious over issues like Ukraine. For sure, Obama honored his vow to get troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. But the battle against Islamic extremism grinds on over a widened battlefield. And ironically, Obama became the President who ordered Americans back to Iraq, to confront a new enemy, ISIS. Declaring wars over is one thing, truly ending them is another. In Springfield, Obama warned the United States must leave Iraq because ""it's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war."" That mantra has guided his foreign policy in office -- and explains his reluctance to throw U.S. forces into the cauldron of Syria. Such chaos has not been kind to Obama's 2007 vow that it was time to ""usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth."" For example, he spent Monday wrestling with global crises including a challenge from Russia, which increasingly operates in Cold War-era terms, and Iran, which is driving a hard bargain in nuclear talks. Implicit in Obama's appeal eight years ago was his assurance that Washington politics did not have to be so bitter or so divided. With the certainty of a yet untested politician, he cited the example of Lincoln's ""House Divided"" speech and subsequent presidency to argue political change was possible. ""The life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible,"" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words. He tells us that there is power in conviction, that beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people."" Eight years on, that sentiment, and Obama's promise that few obstacles can ""withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change"" bears re-examination. It was not the ""power of words"" that enacted health care reform, but now-defunct Democratic majorities in Congress. Change in the Obama era has sometimes been incremental. It's now enacted only by wielding executive powers, which Republicans say are an abuse of the President's authority. The ""power of words"" -- put to the test by Obama's Cairo address to the Muslim world in 2009 -- also failed to shift geopolitical logic overseas, as turmoil shatters the Middle East, and U.S. foes sense weakness. Back home, Washington is more divided and poisoned politically than ever. Republicans may have rejected compromise, but Obama's critics say his own partisan reflex is also to blame. He could not, for instance, resist reminding the GOP during his State of the Union address in January that he beat them twice. And his negative re-election campaign to beat Mitt Romney in 2012 ran counter to his own rejection of ""petty and trivial"" politics in 2007. But the President, his hair now speckled with white, insists he was not naive. In the State of the Union, as much an argument to future historians as a policy wish list, Obama offered his own rebuttal to his critics. He reprised the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, which paved the way for his 2007 announcement, in which he declared there ""wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United States of America."" ""Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency has not delivered on this vision,"" he said. ""But I still think the cynics are wrong.""","Obama launched presidential campaign eight years ago Tuesday .

"(CNN)Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says his regime is apprised of U.S.-led coalition efforts against ISIS in his country -- not by the Americans, but through third parties such as Iraq. ""Sometimes, they convey a message, a general message, but there's nothing tactical,"" he told the BBC. ""There is no dialogue. There's, let's say, information, but not dialogue."" Several Western countries have clamored for al-Assad to step down since 2011, when peaceful protests against his regime led to a violent government crackdown and, subsequently, a full-on civil war. But now, U.S. allies and the Syrian regime have a common enemy: ISIS, which is trying to solidify an Islamic state across swaths of Iraq and Syria. In the broad BBC interview, al-Assad said Syria won't join the international coalition trying to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS. ""No, definitely we cannot and we don't have the will and we don't want, for one simple reason: because we cannot be in an alliance with countries which support terrorism,"" he said. For years, al-Assad's government has used the term ""terrorists"" to describe radical militants as well as members of the Syrian opposition. Even though U.S.-led warplanes have been striking ISIS targets in Syria -- using the country's airspace along with the regime -- al-Assad said he doesn't speak with U.S. officials. ""No, because they don't talk to anyone unless it's a puppet, and they easily trample over international law, which is about our sovereignty now,"" he said in the interview. ""So they don't talk to us, we don't talk to them."" Al-Assad said the messages about U.S.-led coalition efforts have been coming ""through third-party, more than one-party, Iraq and other countries."" ""We knew about the campaign before it started,"" he said. ""But we didn't know details."" In the interview, al-Assad flatly denied that his military is using barrel bombs in rebel-controlled areas, even though opposition activists report near-daily barrel bombs raining from regime helicopters. Barrel bombs are filled with explosives and other objects, such as nails, to produce maximum carnage. Human rights activists say these bombs are particularly abhorrent because they kill and maim indiscriminately, often civilians. ""I know about the army. They use bullets, missiles and bombs. I haven't heard of the army using barrels or maybe cooking pots,"" al-Assad told the BBC. ""There's no indiscriminate weapons. When you shoot, you aim. And when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians -- again if you're talking about casualties, that's war. You cannot have war without casualties."" The United Nations has said about 200,000 people have been killed in the civil war. On Tuesday, the opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported more barrel bombs falling on the provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Daraa  -- the birthplace of the uprising. On top of the staggering death toll, the civil war has also left 12.2 million Syrians in need of humanitarian aid, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Kyung-wha Kang said last month. Many have been choked off from food and medical care as the military besieged rebel-held cities. But in his BBC interview, al-Assad defended the blockades. ""In most of the areas where the rebels take over, the civilians fled and come to our areas,"" he said. ""So most of the areas that we encircle and attack are only filled with militants.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Michael Gates Gill was a high-flying, six-figure-earning advertising executive years ago before he was abruptly fired. He had created huge campaigns for companies like Christian Dior and Ford and lived an even bigger life, with luxury automobiles, lavish vacations and fabulous clothes. Michael Gates Gill's book about how working at Starbucks changed his life became a bestseller. These days, however, he's traded his $3,000 Brooks Brothers suits for khakis and a green apron; the big bucks for a $10 an hour job as a barista at Starbucks. But Gill says he couldn't be happier. ""Losing my job turned out to be a gift in disguise."" After 26 years at J. Walter Thompson, a leading advertising agency, the then 63-year-old Gill was invited to an early breakfast and was told that he was getting the boot. He made too much money. Someone younger would work for less, he was told. ""Never go out to breakfast,"" he warns before bursting into laughter. ""It's like the Mafia. You will never return.""  Watch the happy barista » . He can joke about it now, but Gill says he was devastated by his firing. ""I remember walking outside and bursting into tears,"" he says over a steaming cup of coffee at his current place of employment, a Starbucks in Bronxville, New York. ""I was stunned. I knew that that part of my life was over."" That was just the start of a terrible reversal of fortune. In a few short years, Gill, the Yale-educated son of the famed New Yorker writer Brendan Gill, closed the consulting business he started after he was laid off, got divorced and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He had hit both the rock and the bottom and was continuing to fall. A trip to Starbucks would irrevocably change his life, he says. Unbeknownst to him, the coffee shop was holding a hiring fair the morning he walked in for his daily dose of caffeine. A manager approached him and asked if he would like to apply for a job. Without thinking, he said yes. That was five years ago. These days, when the divorced father of five is not whipping up a caramel macchiato or perfecting his latte foam, he's sweeping floors and scrubbing toilets. ""I still have trouble with some of the drinks,"" he admits, ""but I'm a good cleaner.... I can make a toilet shine like a Ferrari."" If life continues on an upswing for Gill, he may one day be able to purchase a Ferrari. His memoir, ""How Starbucks Saved My Life,"" became a New York Times bestseller. The actor Tom Hanks has plans to produce and star in the film version. Gus Van Sant has agreed to direct. ""When I lost my job I thought my life was over,"" he says. ""I didn't realize it was just the beginning."" He smiles contentedly and declares, ""I may have a part-time job, but I have a full-time life."" He is also sharing everything he has learned, hitting the lecture tour with his ""uplifting tale of personal transformation."" Home for Gill is now a modest apartment in the attic of an old house about five minutes away from the 25-room mansion where he was raised.","Fired ad exec credits Starbucks with saving his life by giving him a job .

"Sid Caesar, whose clever, anarchic comedy on such programs as ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""Caesar's Hour"" helped define the 1950s ""Golden Age of Television,"" has died. He was 91. A friend of the family, actor Rudy De Luca, did not know the exact cause of death, but said Caesar had respiratory problems and other health problems for several years. Caesar became famous for ""Your Show of Shows,"" which went on the air in 1950. It lasted four years and was followed by ""Caesar's Hour,"" which combined sketches, musical revues and situation comedy. Both shows featured writers who became famous in their own right, including Neil Simon, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Mel Tolkin, Lucille Kallen and Larry Gelbart. Woody Allen also contributed to Caesar's comedy as a writer for one of his specials. Brooks visited Caesar last night to say goodbye, De Luca told CNN. ""Sid Caesar was a giant-maybe the best comedian who ever practiced the trade & I was privileged to be one of his writers & one of his friends,"" Brooks tweeted Wednesday. Share your memories of Caesar . Caesar also appeared in a number of films, including ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963), ""Airport 1975"" (1974) and ""Grease"" (1978). He received a Tony nomination for his performance in the 1962 show ""Little Me,"" with a book by Simon. Caesar, born Isaac Sidney Caesar in 1922, was part of a pioneering group of personalities who helped establish television in its early days. However, while comedians such as Jack Benny and Fred Allen more or less transferred their radio shows to the new medium and Milton Berle's ""Texaco Star Theater"" was essentially vaudeville on the small screen, Caesar's ""Show of Shows"" presented movie parodies, wordless pantomimes and brisk routines between the host and co-star Imogene Coca. ""Sid Caesar was a giant. If it weren't for Sid Caesar there might not be television as we know it. He and his co-stars and writers revolutionized television comedy, and really comedy in general,"" said biographer Eddy Friedfeld, a close friend of Caesar. It was comedy pitched at a high (or, just as often, low) level -- and it was done live, every Saturday night at 9. The versatile Caesar was game for whatever the writers came up with. ""Caesar could take on many roles,"" wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in the reference ""The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" calling him a ""comic genius."" ""He was the double-talking foreigner (he was a master of dialects), the henpecked husband or the greasy-haired cad."" The words and comedy of Sid Caesar . Among the regular routines were a skit with Coca, ""The Hickenloopers,"" and Caesar as a gibberish-singing opera singer. Reiner and Howard Morris -- later Ernest T. Bass on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" -- were frequent supporting players. ""We've lost the greatest, monologist, pantomimic, sketch comedian TV has ever known! Word GENIUS is oft misused but not so here. HAIL CAESAR,"" tweeted Reiner. The high-pressure hijinks of the writers' room inspired a number of other works, including ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" created by Reiner; the 1982 film ""My Favorite Year,"" produced by Brooks; and the 1993 play ""Laughter on the 23rd Floor,"" by Simon. ""When we came in, we didn't have the slightest idea of what we were going to do. We christened the beginning of the week 'Bloody Monday' because we walked into the room with no material. We had three days to pitch lines and ideas and create six complete sketches,"" Caesar recalled in a 2011 interview. The high pressure also led to a drinking and drug problem for Caesar. It took him years to kick the habit, until finally he went blank one day while performing on stage in 1977. He checked into a hospital soon after and got clean. ""I couldn't stand me,"" he said in 2011. ""That's why I drank and took pills. I couldn't stand to be around me."" ""Your Show of Shows"" lasted just four years, but its impact was such that a best-of selection was turned into a 1973 movie, ""Ten From Your Show of Shows."" Caesar followed ""Your Show of Shows"" with ""Caesar's Hour,"" which included Reiner and Morris but not Coca. Among the show's recurring sketches was one in which the trio played ""The Three Haircuts,"" a rock 'n' roll group. Other regulars on ""Caesar's Hour"" included Nanette Fabray and Bea Arthur. ""Caesar's Hour"" left the air in 1957. In the following decades, Caesar appeared in a handful of films, most notably the comic extravaganza ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" in which he played dentist Melville Crump. He did a number of his own stunt gags and hurt his back in the process. He appeared in films by his former writer Brooks, including 1976's ""Silent Movie"" and 1981's ""History of the World Part I,"" and popped up in films such as ""Grease"" and ""Grease 2"" (as Coach Calhoun) and ""Cannonball Run II."" He hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1983 and was named an honorary member of the ""Not Ready for Prime Time Players"" at the conclusion of the show -- the only non-""SNL"" cast member to earn the tribute. Among his honors were two Emmys, a lifetime achievement award from the Television Critics Association and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was married to Florence Levy for 67 years until her death in 2010. The couple had three children. Asked by the Archive of American Television how he'd like to be remembered, he responded with six words. ""I brought laughter to the world,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The opening day of the World Cup brought joy and sadness to the host nation as Brazil won its first game, rallying to defeat Croatia 3-1. But it was a day marred by a small, but contentious, protest over the billions spent on the sports spectacle. Here are five things that happened Thursday as the first ball was kicked in Sao Paulo. Protest problems . The most expensive World Cup is underway. Brazilian officials shelled out $11 billion on the tournament, three times what organizers in South Africa spent for the 2010 Cup. Not surprisingly, there are Brazilians who believe the money could have been better spent. With reporters descending on Sao Paulo for the opening match, protesters tried to make their way toward Arena Corinthians stadium and were met by tear-gas firing riot police. The cops' goal: To keep the demonstrators from reaching the main avenue, leading to the stadium. It wasn't a big protest, but it was met with a big response. At least one person appeared to be arrested. Several people were injured, including a CNN producer and reporter. Mind control . The best kick of the day went perhaps two yards. A paraplegic, identified by the BBC as 29-year-old Juliano Pinto, wore an exoskeleton and a blue cap fitted with electrodes. The electrodes helped him use his brain to control the exoskeleton to take a few steps and take the ceremonial first kick before the opening match . It went about 6 feet before a ball boy scooped it up and took it to the center of the match officials. ""We did it!!!"" Dr. Miguel Nicolelis tweeted. Nicolelis, a Brazilian-born neuroscience professor at Duke University, and a group of scores of scientists developed the exoskeleton after they decoded the alphabet of neurons in the brain and figured out how to transmitted the mind's language to devices outside the brain. Bad start . That penalty that everyone is talking about, the one that should never have been given, well, it should probably have been stopped. It was a double punch in the gut for Croatian fans. First, referee Yuichi Nishimura awarded Brazil an undeserved penalty kick. It seemed obvious to almost everyone watching the match that Brazilian striker Fred went down in the penalty area on his own, but Nishimura must have thought there was contact from a Croatian defender. Then when Neymar's hit his spot kick, goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa guessed correctly and got a hand on the ball -- but he couldn't stop it from going in the goal. Croatia's coach didn't worry about any fines from FIFA after the match for critical remarks against the referee. ""It's ridiculous. If we continue in this way, we will have a circus,"" said Niko Kova, according to Yahoo Sports. ""If that's how we start the World Cup, then we may as well give up and go home now."" Maybe it's time for a manager's challenge and instant replay? When doves die . You release three doves in an open-air stadium with 60,000 screaming people and helicopters circling overhead, what could go wrong? Well, it appears from media reports that at least one -- possibly two -- didn't live to see themselves home. One dove took a header into the stands almost immediately after liftoff, wrote the New York Times. Other media reported a second crashed. But there was good news. ""Exciting dove update,"" tweeted Hadley Freeman of the Guardian newspaper, ""The one remaining dove has flown into the press box!"" It wasn't the first misstep of the day. During the opening ceremony, the motorized stage riser hiccupped as rapper Pitbull and singer Jennifer Lopez ascended from inside the setup. At one point, it even appeared it might sink back under the stage. But it stopped and Pitbull stepped up a few feet and, once out, helped JLo out from the hole. Traffic trouble . The United States, which plays it first match of the tournament on Monday, wanted to have a private scrimmage against Belgium on Thursday. But with a transit strike making bad traffic worse, Belgium coach Marc Wilmots and U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann agreed to call off the match, Sports Illustrated reported. Perhaps they should have rescheduled and traveled during the Brazil-Croatia match; the roads of Sao Paulo were practically empty then. Except for the protesters and riot police ...","Some protesters think Brazil is not rich enough to spend so much money for a sporting event .

"(CNN)Six feet of snow in the last month and counting. Bostonians have had it up to their eyeballs with the winter of 2015. ""I can't believe this is my neighborhood. It's wild,"" Amy McHugh of Weymouth, Massachusetts, told CNN affiliate WCVB-TV.  ""I keep telling the kids, 'You're going to be telling your kids about this.' It's unimaginable."" Not only unimaginable, but record-setting. ""It's only been 14 days, and we've gotten 70 to 80 inches of snow around the commonwealth,"" Gov. Charlie Baker said. ""This is pretty much unprecedented. ""If I've learned one thing over the course of the past two weeks, it's (that) Mother Nature makes the rules,"" Baker said. By Monday evening, the system had dumped an additional 22-plus inches on Boston, pushing it into the city's Top 5 for February snowstorms. The 30-day total is even more impressive. At a fraction under 72 inches, it set a record. In an average year, the city gets 47 inches of snow. Cesar Moya, 60, died after a plowing truck struck him Monday afternoon in Medford, Massachusetts, the office of Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said. Moya was struck in a parking lot while leaving work after completing a shift at a market. He died from his injuries at a hospital. ""The circumstances surrounding what occurred are still being examined,"" the district attorney's office said in a statement. ""However, due to the unprecedented weather we are all experiencing, it bears saying that we all need to be mindful of public safety issues as we navigate sidewalks, parking lots, and roads."" Even more snow could fall before the weekend. The National Weather Service is keeping close watch on a new storm that could bring between 3 and 6 additional inches of snow to the Boston area Thursday and Friday. ""I'd welcome a 6-inch storm at this point,"" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh quipped. It's enough to drive some folks a bit stir crazy. One Boston resident used the hashtag #getmeoutofhere to describe his feelings. Tuesday's priority, according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, was to assist cities with digging out. The state agency will help cities move snow to snow farms or, in some cases, into rivers, spokesman Peter Judge told CNN. ""Everyone's been working full-bore for that last three weeks,"" Judge said, referring to the trucks removing as much snow as possible. Eastern Massachusetts is running out of places to put all the white stuff. There's so much snow that cities have been given permission to dump it in Boston Harbor, which is usually a no-no. The city is melting 430 tons of snow per hour, Walsh said. Schools in parts of the Northeast, including Boston, were closed again Tuesday. Walsh said students haven't had a full week of classes in three weeks. They'll run out of snow days soon if the weather doesn't let up. Schools in the Pentucket Regional School District, north of Boston, will remain closed the rest of the week. The superintendent cited the ""frequency and intensity of recent storms, another potentially major storm brewing for Thursday and Friday, and the already high levels of snow on the roofs of schools"" as factors. Boston remains under a snow emergency and parking ban. Cars left on city streets were being ticketed and towed to make room for snowplows. The string of storms is taking a toll on city coffers. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, known as the T, has suspended all rail services through the end of Tuesday. Limited bus service will be running. However, air travel across the Northeast should improve. Boston has already exceeded its $18.5 million snow removal budget, and spent about $30 million -- most of it in the last 17 days, Walsh said. More than 2,880 flights into and out of the United States were canceled Sunday and Monday, mostly because of the storm. By Tuesday afternoon, nearly 250 flights had been scrubbed, according to FlightAware.com. Boston's Logan International Airport remained open during the storm, but most flights were canceled Monday. The weather forced a couple of big Massachusetts trials to be delayed. The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been pushed back to Wednesday, and the same goes for jury selection in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Folks in the Northeast are known for being tough, but three snowstorms in three weeks is wearing a bit thin. ""It's kind of depressing sometimes,"" Jesus Cora of Nashua, New Hampshire, told CNN affiliate WMUR-TV. ""It's really depressing, you know?"" Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan said, expressing the same sentiment. ""I'm tired of it,"" said Barkan, who has missed three days of class because of the storms. ""I usually like snow, but this is just a little much."" CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Thursday storm could bring another 3 to 6 inches of snow .

"(CNN)Any traveler who returns with mementos from their adventures might struggle deciding what exactly to do with them. Perhaps that's why astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon, left some of his personal artifacts from his journey to the moon in a closet. Armstrong's widow, Carol, found the items, and she snapped a picture of them that she shared with curators at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, a release from the museum said. Armstrong, who uttered those now famous words, ""One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" died in 2012 after complications associated with heart surgery. In the wake of his death, Carol Armstrong donated many of the Apollo 11 artifacts to the museum's National Collection.  She also shared some of her husband's correspondence and paper files to his alma mater, Purdue University in Indiana. Not until recently did Carol Armstrong email the museum with the news she'd found, ""a white cloth bag filled with assorted small items that looked like they may have come from a spacecraft."" With the email, she included a picture of the items, spread out on her carpet. Most of the artifacts Carol Armstrong had made available to the museum prior to her closet find, weren't any actual flown artifacts, but were still exciting, Allan Needell the Apollo curator at the National Air and Space Museum told CNN. Carol Armstrong's locating the bag and turning to the museum ""to help determine the significance of the items it was an immense honor and challenge,"" Needell said. The physical challenge of conserving and protecting the items, which Carol Armstrong shipped to the National Air and Space Museum, along with the intellectual challenge of determining what they were led Needell to enlist a team of experts from the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal (ALSJ). For a year, the team worked to document and understand the ""function and significance of each of the items in the bag,"" confirming recently that a few definitely came from Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 mission. The first they were able to verify was the white cloth bag in which the items were found. The temporary stowage bag was often called the ""McDivitt purse,"" named after Apollo 9 Commander James McDivitt, who suggested astronauts might need a place to temporarily stow items. Evidence that the bag and its contents were a part of the moonwalk mission were confirmed through Armstrong's own words. He's recorded as having said, ""You know that that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back -- LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself. We'll have to figure something out for it."" But transcripts from the ALSJ provide evidence Armstrong alerted mission control to the bag of ""odds and ends"" on board before their return. This was imperative as the return trajectory calculations would have needed to accommodate the additional weight (about 10lbs) in order to allow the team's safe re-entry to Earth, explained the curator in a blog post on the museum's website. Inside the bag was the camera that recorded Armstrong's landing on the moon, as well as his famous remarks upon his landing. The 16mm data acquisition camera was mounted in the window of the lunar module Eagle and recorded historic images: Armstrong just before he stepped onto the moon. Armstrong planting the American flag with Buzz Aldrin. Also a part of the haul was a waist tether used by Armstrong to help support his feet during a rest period on the moon.  Astronauts used these tethers as security in case they were forced to do a spacewalk during orbit, the museum release said. These items are now on display as a part of the Air and Space museum's temporary exhibition, ""Outside the Spacecraft: 50 Years of Extra-Vehicular Activity."" Needell said the Armstrong artifacts ""tell a number of stories"" - the technical story that has been so carefully documented and the human story of those who were involved. ""It was a most satisfying discovery process,"" he said. A team of experts is still cataloging some of the items found inside to determine whether any others were a part of the Apollo 11 mission.

"(CNN)For most of her life, Kimberly Jensen has spent Valentine's Day alone. But on Saturday she will be cuddling up to a complete stranger. The 47-year-old, who is perpetually single, is one of more than 100 people attending Cuddle Con, which bills itself as the world's first ever cuddle convention in Portland, Oregon. ""I hated Valentine's Day, and now I am looking forward to it. I am hoping to cuddle non-stop,"" Jensen said. The 12-hour convention, which is strictly platonic and nonsexual, was created by professional cuddler Samantha Hess. She is also the founder of Cuddle Me Up, a business that provides platonic touch for clients through cuddling sessions. Hess' idea to start a cuddling business materialized back in January 2013. She came across a photo on Facebook of a man offering free hugs, and a newly divorced Hess thought to herself that she would definitely pay someone for a hug right at that moment. ""Just because I don't have someone in my life doesn't mean I don't deserve affection and touch,"" she said. The thought of cuddling a stranger on Valentine's Day might seem creepy, but Hess said the problem lies with people's perception. ""In our culture, cuddling is connected with romantic relationships. Platonic touch is such a taboo thing,"" she said. ""There are a lot of moms who give a lot of touch, but they never really take. So they come into (my business) and get touch from me."" Amy Muise, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, co-authored a study on the effects of cuddling in a relationship after sex. She said there is research to suggest that cuddling, which is commonly associated with romantic relationships, can also be found in platonic relationships as well. ""It wasn't always a sexual thing,"" Muise said. Touch is a way for people to feel closer to one another, she said. ""People have a need to belong and connect to others and affection is one way we may do this."" One reason platonic touch in a professional setting can be appealing to some is because it can be less intimidating than a romantic encounter, Muise said. ""There are fewer risks of rejection."" The idea of being hugged and not judged pulled Jensen in. She was experiencing feelings of unworthiness and loneliness when she entered Hess' Portland storefront more than a year ago. The math tutor drove an hour from her home in Salem to find out what platonic cuddling meant. After her first session with Hess, Jensen felt like she was on a runner's high. ""After I see her, I am pretty high for a couple of days. I am seriously addicted to it,"" Jensen said. ""I think about if I have a ding in my car and I have a $500 deductible, that $500 could give me 500 minutes of cuddling."" The hour-long cuddle sessions she has with Hess once a week have boosted Jensen's confidence. She's more open about wanting affection now. She routinely requests hugs from her family and friends and even cuddles with her sister. Jensen thinks the Cuddle Con is the perfect way to introduce the benefits of touch not only to those who are single, but to people in relationships. ""There are couples out there where one person is more affectionate than the other. Maybe if they can bring their partner to the convention to show them cuddling is normal,"" Jensen said. Hess sees 2015 as the year of the cuddle and hopes people will start to see the positives of platonic touch. ""I think we all struggle with the concept of being good enough,"" Hess said. ""People think 'I have to lose 50 pounds so I can start dating.' No you don't, you are good enough right now.""","Cuddle Con happens on Valentine's Day .

"Lille, France (CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn denied knowing that prostitutes were involved in sex parties he joined, as he took the stand Tuesday for the first time in his high-profile trial on pimping charges. The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in the northern French city of Lille a week ago. Strauss-Kahn, who's 65, is charged with aggravated pimping on the grounds that he organized or encouraged group sex parties in both Europe and the United States. He has denied aiding and supporting the prostitution of seven women. Asked by the judge Tuesday if his position had changed, Strauss-Kahn said he knew nothing of the ""prostitutional nature"" of the parties in which he took part. He also faced questions over claims by one of the sex workers that he had brutal sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid. Other defendants insist Strauss-Kahn wasn't told. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. The trial is being closely watched both in his homeland, where Strauss-Kahn is commonly known as DSK, and around the world. There were dramatic scenes as Strauss-Kahn's car arrived at court Tuesday, when topless protesters with anti-DSK slogans painted on their bodies clambered onto his car. The activists, from the feminist group Femen, were then bundled away by police. Prosecutors say the operations of the prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille, stretched all the way to New York and Washington. Sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies. Strauss-Kahn, who was married to French TV journalist Anne Sinclair until their divorce in 2013, has never denied that he took part in the parties. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved. If the court finds Strauss-Kahn guilty of the charges, the former IMF director could be sentenced up to 10 years in prison and fined 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million.) A former sex worker who's one of the plaintiffs in the case, named only as Mounia R., described an encounter with Strauss-Kahn at the Murano Hotel in Paris when she took the stand Tuesday. She told the court she had indicated that she didn't like the sexual practices in which they were engaging and that Strauss-Kahn registered this. He remained smiling when she cried, she said. However, she said, she consented to the brutal sexual act because she needed the money. The woman also said that her presence at the hotel was ""essentially for DSK,"" adding, ""I was told we were there for him."" The former sex worker contended that none of the participants in the parties could have been unaware that the women involved were prostitutes. Questioned by the judge, Strauss-Kahn denied having seen Mounia R. crying while they were having sex, and he said he would have been petrified if he had noticed. He also said he'd been given no sense of refusal by her. Referring to other testimonies in the case, he said other women had refused to have sex with him at the parties and that he'd accepted their decision. ""When others said no, it was no,"" he said. Asked why fellow defendant Fabrice Paszkowski, a friend and businessman, would not have told him the women were being paid for sex, Strauss-Kahn said Paszkowski knew he did not like prostitution. His friend wanted to please him by telling him the women were just ""libertines,"" Strauss-Kahn said, and didn't realize the risk this represented for him. As to Mounia R.'s claim that he must have been aware she was a sex worker, Strauss-Kahn said that she had provided no concrete evidence to demonstrate that he knew. Another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, denied having told Mounia R. that she was essentially there for Strauss-Kahn, also a friend of his. Prosecutors say Roquet and Paszkowski picked up the bills for the sex parties for their influential friend. Another defendant, Beatrice Legrain, an occasional sex worker who's also accused of being a pimp, also testified Tuesday. Paszkowski said she was introduced to Strauss-Kahn as a restaurant owner and the prostitute she accompanied to a party as a restaurant employee. Paszkowski reiterated that the former IMF director was not supposed to know the status of the women. The judge asked Paszkowski and Jean-Christophe Lagarde, a former senior policeman also accused in the case, if they were expecting professional benefits from their friendship with Strauss-Kahn, whom many people once saw as a future president of France. They denied that was the case. Paszkowski and other defendants have previously been adamant that Strauss-Kahn was unaware the women were prostitutes and that he never paid them. The prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing lack of evidence. However, the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations. Altogether, there are 13 defendants in the case besides Strauss-Kahn, said Patricia Corbellego from Action Teams Against Pimping, one of the plaintiffs in the case. A biographer of Strauss-Kahn, Michel Taubman, told CNN that he believes the former IMF chief's story in what is known in France as the ""Carlton affair."" ""If he knew that the girls were prostitutes, I think he would not have made them come to Washington and he would not have had a picture of one of them in his office,"" said Taubman. In the years since his New York arrest, Strauss Kahn has spent much of his time trying to clear his name. He has tried to revive his reputation and start a new career by creating an economic consultancy, taking on both private and governmental clients. He needs these clients, according to Taubman, in order to pay his legal bills. Taubman says he does not believe Strauss Kahn can or will ever be directly involved in politics or policy making again. ""He is a father, a grandfather, he has suffered a lot, his family has suffered a lot. And I don't think he will have the energy or the will to come back in politics, you know,"" the biographer said. Strauss-Kahn said almost as much himself in an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, long before the trial opened in Lille. ""So I made this mistake to believe that you could have a public life doing what you had to do in the public life. ... And that you can have a private life,"" he said. ""And my mistake was certainly to believe that you can have these two things together without any connection between. It was wrong. It was wrong in the way you say because people are not expecting this kind of heterodox behavior from somebody having public responsibility."" The May 2011 sex scandal not only ended Strauss-Kahn's tenure as IMF director -- a role that gave him huge influence on the economies of countries around the world -- but dashed his presidential hopes. He was the leading prospective Socialist candidate in the French presidential elections of 2012, an election his party won. Strauss-Kahn could well have taken the presidency, which instead was claimed by Francois Hollande. The scandal erupted when Strauss-Kahn was arrested at New York's Kennedy Airport on charges he had sexually assaulted a maid, Nafissatou Diallo, at a hotel where he had stayed. He resigned in disgrace from the IMF, and months of legal battles followed. In the end, he was cleared of the charge and allowed to return to France, only to find that his name had come up in connection with the alleged Lille prostitution ring. 'I don't think I have any kind of problem with women,' Strauss-Kahn says . CNN's Jim Bittermann reported from Paris and Sandrine Amiel from Lille, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","A former sex worker describes an encounter with Dominique Strauss-Kahn at a Paris hotel .

"(CNN)Elon Musk has built a $12 billion company in an endeavor to pave the way to Mars for humanity. He insists that Mars is a ""long-term insurance policy"" for ""the light of consciousness"" in the face of climate change, extinction events, and our recklessness with technology. On the other hand, astronaut Chris Hadfield is skeptical: ""Humanity is not going extinct,"" he told me. He added: ""There's no great compelling reason to go, apart from curiosity, and that's not going to be enough to sustain the immense cost necessary with the technology that exists right now."" But I question our future, stuck here on Earth. Our environment is a highly balanced system and we are the destabilizing element.

Igniting the imagination of that generation helped propel the US into the dominant position it's held since the 1960s. What could a Mars program do? Wouldn't the Moon, so much nearer than Mars, be a better first step? Actually, no -- it's just too different. It's better to test hardware and train people in analogs on Earth, such as the geologically similar high-altitude desert in Utah or the cold and dry Canadian Arctic desert. Why the European Space Agency has declared the Moon a stepping-stone to Mars is beyond me, as doing so increases the cost of a Mars program hugely. It takes about 50% more energy to put something on the surface of the Moon than it does on Mars. The Martian atmosphere can be used to slow down approaching spacecraft, instead of the need for extra fuel to slow the descent. It would also mean developing two different sets of landing techniques and hardware. There are reasons to go to the Moon, just not if your ultimate destination is Mars. Even colonizing the Moon is questionable: it simply hasn't the resources to sustain an advanced colony. Mars has fertile soil, an abundance of water (as ice), a carbon-dioxide rich atmosphere and a 24-and-a-half hour day. The Moon's soil is not fertile, water is as rare, it has no effective atmosphere, and a 708-hour day. It's feasible to introduce biological life to Mars, but not the Moon. With only a relatively small push, Mars could be returned to its former warm, wet, hospitable state. Raising the temperature at the south pole by a few degrees would see frozen CO2 in the soil begin to gasify. As a greenhouse gas, it would further raise the temperature, gasifying more CO2 in a self-sustained global-warming process. Eventually, water frozen into the soil would liquefy, covering half of the planet. After about a century, Mars would settle down with an atmosphere about as dense as the lowland Himalayas and a climate suitable for T-shirts. Hadfield warns that ""we need to invent a lot of things"" before going to Mars, and that ""there's no great advantage to being the early explorers who die"". Few would disagree with that, but what are the challenges a crewed mission to Mars faces? Radiation: An astronaut would receive a lifetime allowable dose of radiation in a single 30-month round-trip, including 18 months on the surface. But this is only equivalent to increasing the lifetime cancer risk from about 20% to 23%. As the majority of this is received in transit between planets, with proper radiological protection on the ship, it would actually be (radiologically speaking) healthier for an astronaut to live on Mars with a radiation dose of 0.10 sieverts per year than to smoke on Earth at 0.16 sieverts per year. There is no single practical solution to the radiation problem. One strategy I helped develop was to optimise the internal layout of the equipment and structures in the Mars habitat module to minimise exposure -- placing existing bulk in all the right places. This reduced exposure by about 20%, without adding any mass. Even taking empty sandbags, packing them with Martian soil and putting them on the roof would be a simple and effective measure on Mars. Radiation is an issue to tackle, but it's not a deal-breaker. Power: ""We need a compact energy source,"" says Hadfield. ""We cannot be relying on the tiny bit of solar power that happens to arrive at that location."" While the solar energy reaching the surface of Mars is about half that on Earth, this isn't a show-stopper. A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that to power the equivalent of an average U.S. household on Mars, even through dust storms, one would need an array of solar panels totalling six metres square -- very achievable. Reduced gravity: The effects of microgravity on astronauts' health have been studied for decades, and a range of techniques have been developed to mitigate the wasting effects on muscle and bone. With Martian gravity around a third of that on Earth, it would take astronauts a couple of days to acclimatize, and perhaps a few months to fully adapt. NASA and ESA have been developing an under-suit that compresses the body to overcome the negative effects of a reduction in pressure and gravity. However, biological adaption could be made easier if microgravity were avoided altogether. The spacecraft could be spun in-transit to generate an artificial gravity that slowly decayed, simulating a transition from Earth to Mars gravity (and vice versa) over the six-month journey. Ultimately, until humans are actually living on other planets it's unlikely we'll solve or even recognise all the subtle long-term health problems associated with reduced gravity. And who's to say what the advances in bio-engineering and technology will make the human body capable of when that time comes? Life on Mars: If there's life on Mars, even if it's microbial, should we be allowed to spread to the planet, potentially risking its extinction? I find this question strange -- as Chris McKay put it: ""We commit microbial genocide every time we wash our hands"". We engineer and farm the complex life around us as systematically and as cheaply as possible. Billions of people eat the carcasses of organisms that were thinking and breathing only days before. Why, all of a sudden, should Martian microbes be given such sanctity? It should certainly be studied, but it shouldn't prevent our spreading. Back contamination: Conversely, the question of whether some Martian plague might accidentally be introduced to Earth should be taken seriously -- but not blown out of proportion. There's only a remote chance that Martian life might be hazardous. The things that kill us do so because they've evolved in lock-step with us in a continual evolutionary arms race. Any Martian life will have evolved independently and is unlikely to be capable even of interacting with Earth life on a molecular level. As Robert Zubrin put it: ""Trees don't get colds and humans don't get Dutch Elm Disease."" Psychology: Depending on relative orbits, sending a message between Earth and Mars can take between three and 22 minutes. This loss of real-time communication will leave astronauts feeling cut-off and alone. Hadfield says that it's vital to keep up crew morale and motivation: ""Once you get any distance away on any sort of voyage, the epic-ness disappears, the reality becomes the foreground, and the applause is long gone."" Cost: A crewed Mars program would cost the equivalent of a few weeks of the U.S. defense budget. The US plans on spending about 10 times more on nuclear weapons than on space exploration over the coming decade. The UK government spends about as much on gastric band surgery through the NHS as it does on its space activities. So while a Mars program certainly has challenges to overcome, the technological gap between us and Mars is far smaller than it was for the Moon program in the 1960s. And the prospects the Red Planet holds for humanity are far greater. Copyright 2015 The Conversation.

"(CNN)Malaysia's top court on Tuesday upheld the conviction of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on the charge of sodomizing a former political aide, prompting criticism from human rights activists. The decision appeared likely to be the final chapter in a lengthy and politically contentious legal battle, taking Anwar out of contention for elections for the foreseeable future. Anwar, 67, was acquitted of the sodomy charge in January 2012. But after the government appealed, a higher court overturned the decision in March 2014, sentencing him to five years in prison. The Federal Court, the country's highest, on Tuesday rejected Anwar's appeal of the conviction and upheld the sentence, according to Bernama, the national news agency. The head of an alliance of opposition parties, Anwar has repeatedly said he is innocent, calling the case against him an effort concocted by the Malaysian government to end his political career. The government denies that accusation. After the court decision Tuesday, Anwar said he ""will not be silenced,"" vowing to continue to ""fight for freedom and justice."" ""I will never surrender,"" Anwar told CNN by phone, although he conceded that his task will be made a lot harder by the confines of a prison cell. Human rights groups have criticized the case against Anwar, calling it politically motivated. ""Grim day for human rights and democracy in Malaysia,"" tweeted Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. Anwar's trial ""was blatantly political from day one,"" Robertson wrote after the verdict was announced. The Malaysian government said Tuesday that the Federal Court judges ""will have reached their verdict only after considering all the evidence in a balanced and objective manner."" Sodomy, even if consensual, is an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Malaysia. ""Malaysia has an independent judiciary, and there have been many rulings against senior government figures,"" the government statement said. Anwar was the heir apparent to former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad until 1998, when he was sacked and charged with corruption and sodomy. He spent six years in prison after being convicted of corruption charges in 1999 and of sodomy charges involving his wife's former driver in 2000. Malaysia's highest court overturned the sodomy conviction and ordered him released from prison in 2004. However, the corruption verdict was never lifted, barring him from running for political posts until 2008. Investigators arrested Anwar again in July 2008 over allegations that he sodomized his former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan. The arrest came four months after a loose coalition of opposition parties that Anwar led won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. It was only the second time in the country's history that the governing coalition had failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. The governing coalition, which has been in power for more than half a century, fell short of that mark again in elections in 2013 but retained its grip on power.

"(CNN)""What's going on with the tourists lately?"" That's likely the question going through the minds of officials at Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park, which has experienced a string of nudity-related incidents this year. Last Friday, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. ""It's an offense to the culture of others, regardless of religion,""  Kerya Chau Sun, APSARA (Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap) National Authority spokesperson, told CNN. ""As a Cambodian, it's hurtful to my belief, and especially to the poor Cambodians saving up money to be able to come across the country to pray at Angkor. ""Angkor is a sacred site for all Cambodians and practicing Buddhists, worldwide."" The duo were charged with trafficking pornography and exposing sexual body parts. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. A series of nude incidents . The sisters' criminal faux pas took place on the heels two other incidents involving tourists who couldn't keep their clothes on. Three French tourists were deported earlier this month for allegedly posing for nude pictures in another temple at the World Heritage Site. Meanwhile, last month a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. APSARA officials are still investigating the incident. The government body is now looking into ways to deter tourists from taking off their clothes. Some proposals include adding more guards in distant sites and pressing charges against tourists who are caught engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. ""We are studying to impose dissuasive fines and prison sentences,"" says Chau Sun. ""We may also request assistance from embassies to inform their citizens who visit Angkor on the sanctity of the site."" Nudity in sacred spots isn't just a Cambodian problem. Early last year, Peru officials deployed similar measures after a chain of ""naked tourism"" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site. Expert: ""Respect the community"" ""I think tourists frequently forget that the Angkor Archeological Park is not an amusement park, but a place with living communities and many sacred places that are still actively maintained and worshiped,"" says Alison Carter, an archaeologist who has been working in Cambodia for about 10 years and with the Greater Angkor Project since 2011. ""Tourists should dress modestly in accordance with Cambodian customs and treat the sites respectfully. ""Climbing on ruins, touching carvings and taking nude photographs is disrespectful to the Cambodians who live, work and worship at these sites and find them to be of great importance to their culture and heritage."" CNN's Laura Ma and Karla Cripps also contributed to the story.","Two U.S. tourists deported from Cambodia after allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park .

"(CNN)After they found body parts inside a suitcase on a San Francisco sidewalk, police called him a suspect and accused him of murder. Now, the man who had been a focal point of the investigation into the grisly find is dead. Mark Andrus, 54, died Saturday after admitting himself to a hospital the same day, San Francisco Police said. ""The case is under investigation with the cause and manner of death pending,"" the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Monday . Andrus was arrested last month but never charged. He was released from custody after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to prove a case against him. ""We are very disturbed by the facts of this case and are working with the San Francisco Police Department to secure the evidence necessary to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law,"" the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said last week. ""At this stage of the case, the medical examiner has yet to determine a cause of death or issue a positive identification of the victim. Additionally, there are other key facts that are still unknown. Given the current state of the evidence, there is insufficient evidence to charge this suspect with murder."" The dismembered body was discovered on January 28 when police were called to the South of Market district in San Francisco. Other body parts were found in a trash can less than a block from the main crime scene. ""Andrus was our primary person of interest who was subsequently arrested and booked for the crime,"" San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Officer Grace Gatpandan said Monday. ""I do not have information on other suspects at this time, however this is still an open and active investigation and any information given will (be) looked at by homicide investigators.""

"(CNN)The crusade to find a home for a sacred electric guitar is reverberating like a thundering encore through the music business as innovator Les Paul's Black Beauty from the '50s is going up for auction. The Gibson-made instrument, called the Holy Grail of Guitars by some, is being sold by Tom Doyle, the late Paul's longtime friend, engineer, co-inventor and guitar tech. ""This happens to be the first prototype of what we call the Black Beauty. It was sent to Les in 1953, 1954,"" Doyle told CNN, holding the instrument with shiny pearly inlays on the guitar neck glinting back overhead lights.  ""This is the beginning of the proper Les Paul guitar. "" Doyle explains virtuoso Paul would hold notes on the guitar, sustaining a beautiful ringing that seemed to model in part a melodic Bell Telephone tone of the early 1950s. ""And that's what the kids loved,"" Doyle said and ran off some Les Paul guitar converts.  ""Neil Young was one of course.  Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Slash, Jeff Beck, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. ""So many people love that bell-like sound, the sustain, that thickness of notes.  They could turn this into a jazz guitar, a country guitar, a heavy rock guitar as well."" Doyle, sitting on a wooden stool at the massive National Association of Music Merchants Convention in Anaheim, California, began picking away on the black guitar, a fluid sound that lured buzzing attendees to stop and listen. Salesmen in $2,000 suits stood next to male rockers in $10 black T-shirts and eyeliner and mouthed over the music ""that's so bleepin' cool."" ""Les brought this to me many times to be reworked,"" Doyle said. ""And the last time he brought it to me he said, 'My God you should have this guitar.' "" Paul, who is credited with many recording innovations, died in 2009. Doyle is 72, retiring and said because of its historical significance, he would like to see the guitar end up in a museum, such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland or Experience Music Project in Seattle. Guernsey's will sell Black Beauty and other instruments on February 19 at the Arader Galleries on Madison Avenue in New York City, also accepting bids on line and by telephone. Doyle explains the guitar became showcased in the 1950s on 170 television shows, ""Listerine Presents: Les Paul and Mary Ford."" Black and white video clips show singer Mary Ford and her husband doing classic songs such as ""Alabamy"" or their signature ""Vaya Con Dios."" ""The guitar was great for television, very very showy,"" Doyle said. ""And you could see Les' hands fly all over this neck because of the black background."" In music business lore, a great guitar tech is like a superstar mechanic for a race car driver. Doyle and other guitar techs are often handed the beat up, broken, out-of-tune instruments and begged to get the old classic and running again by celebrity musicians. ""When it came to difficulties where this guitar wasn't coming back to well, he (Les Paul) would say 'Bring it back Tom, do what you got to do to make it play,' "" Doyle laughed. ""When I was doing this work for him it was a great honor. Here is my idol asking me to do work on his guitars.""","The Black Beauty is being sold by Tom Doyle, the late Paul's longtime friend and engineer .

"(CNN)It's true that Bali's beaches, rice paddies, volcanoes and temples lure the crowds. Those seeking serenity, however, shouldn't be put off -- the island offers a smattering of under-the-radar destinations where life ambles along at a more sedate pace. Here are a few places where travelers can escape the hustle but still find plenty to fill an itinerary. Balian . West Bali's Balian beach has long been popular with intrepid surfers, with the beach offering multiple breaks. While they're mostly suited to experienced surfers, beginners can probably have some fun in the wash. The black-sand beach has a rugged, somewhat desolate feel thanks to the thundering surf. While it's not really swimmer-friendly, it's great for long contemplative walks and rummaging for flotsam and jetsam. There are yoga retreats at the low-key resorts along the beach, and rental motorbikes for exploring the side road around Balian, where rice paddies tumble down to meet the sea. At nearby Soka, a temple plays host to a massive cave full of bats that emerge at sunset. Accommodation at Balian is mostly targeted toward surfers but some family-friendly as well as upper-end places are available. Expect a mix of surfer fare and local food at the guesthouses. Sidemen . Sidemen is a small village located in a yawning valley about an hour's drive inland from the mid-east coast. Here you'll enjoy paddy views from your guesthouse or along a rejuvenating ramble through terraces with occasional red hibiscus or pink frangipani trees that make for pretty photo opportunities. Sidemen is a great spot to rent a pushbike or join a small group tour to coast downhill via a route with fantastic views. Overnight visitors can wake up early to climb the summit of Gunung Agung, the island's tallest and most revered volcano, in time for sunrise -- this is a challenging hike. Accommodation at Sidemen is generally a great value and ranges from basic through to mid-range, with a few places offering pools. Amed . Truth be told, Amed has long been on the map for tourists seeking to elude Bali's crazy south, but the series of looping bays along the coast of east Bali retains a charming washed-out feel -- like a spot that enjoyed a long-passed heyday and now has a rather slightly sleepy European feel. The appeal here is solid off-the-beach snorkeling and diving in several of the bays, including the Japanese wreck at Banyuning. You can base yourself at Amed to snorkel the liberty wreck at Tulamben, too. Otherwise, it's a great place to just relax and watch the jukungs (traditional outrigger canoes) fan out with their colorful triangular sails onto the waters before dawn, returning in the early morning. Or, hire a boatman to take you out to see the sunrise over Lombok's highest peak, Gunung Rinjani. Munduk . Bali isn't all beaches, cocktails and tropical weather. After driving through the winding scenic roads in north Bali, through forest-clad mountains, you'll reach the little out-of-the-way village of Munduk, where the air is so crisp you can forget about air-conditioning. Offering mostly guesthouses and home stays, this isn't a place for luxury, but anywhere you pick should have fantastic views of forest, farmland and paddies studded with coconut palms to remind you that, yes, you're still on a tropical island. Maps available at hotels highlight an array of low-key walks, including several impressive waterfalls that are easy to reach on foot. Munduk is mostly appealing for what isn't here: no crowds, no tourist shops and no hassles. Nusa Penida . Bali doesn't just include the main island itself. A cluster of three islands lie about 20 kilometers to the east, easily reachable by public boat or speedboat: Nusa Lembongan, which is popular with expatriates, tiny Nusa Ceningan and the largest of them all, stunning Nusa Penida. The island is geographically similar to Bali's Bukit Peninsula and, thanks to its relative remoteness, was a prison during the early 18th century. While the diving here is excellent -- manta rays and mola molas when conditions are right -- you'll also be  rewarded by renting a motorbike to go exploring on the relatively barren island, where you can skirt spectacular cliffs soaring hundreds of meters high. Best to get here soon: a luxury Chedi hotel is slated to open at Crystal Bay in 2015. West Bali National Park . Northwest Bali is home to a national park with excellent snorkeling and diving at Menjangan Island, and is the last refuge of the endangered Bali starling. In fact, Menjangan is arguably Bali's best snorkeling and diving location: you can float over coral gardens of brilliant blues, greens and pinks and spot a vast array of marine life on an organized trip or rent a boat from the pier yourself -- you may see dolphins along the way, with Java's volcanoes in the distance providing an impressive backdrop. Travelers can base themselves at Pemuteran, located outside the park, though those on a larger budget can try the Menjangan Resort within the park. Hotels can arrange hikes, where chances are good you'll see Java Rusa and Indian muntjac (barking) deer.

"(CNN)David Bowie's single ""Changes"" is coming out as a 7-inch picture disc, the latest limited-edition vinyl from the chameleon-like singer. According to Bowie's website, the track will be released alongside a 7-inch vinyl version of ""Kingdom Come,"" originally performed by Television front man Tom Verlaine and covered by Bowie for his 1980 album ""Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)."" Though the song never reached the Top 40, it has always been a fan favorite and one of his better-known tracks. ""Collectors of the 40th anniversary series of picture discs (which celebrate the original RCA releases of Bowie's singles), have long bemoaned the absence of Changes from the series on account of it being the first Bowie single on RCA,"" Bowie's website said in announcing the news. ""Changes"" was first released on the 1971 album ""Hunky Dory,"" which predated Bowie's famous ""Ziggy Stardust"" persona and a string of Top 10 hits in the 1970s and 1980s. The tracks will be released April 18 in honor of Record Store Day, a celebration of independent record stores begun in 2007. Bowie's last studio album, ""The Next Day,"" was released in 2013. The releases are part of the continuing renaissance for vinyl recordings, which have come back from near-obsolescence to claim  record shares of music sales. In 2014, vinyl LP sales increased 52% and accounted for 6% of all physical album sales, according to the Nielsen Music Report.","David Bowie's 1971 hit ""Changes"" will be released as a limited edition picture disc .

"(CNN)Heidi Snow and Michel Breistroff were planning a future together. Breistroff, a Harvard graduate, was a professional hockey player with a promising career. Snow worked for a hedge fund in New York City. On July 17, 1996, their lives changed forever. Breistroff boarded TWA Flight 800 bound for his native France on his way to Germany to play professional hockey. ""He called me, and he told me he was getting on the plane. And he asked me to marry him on the phone before he got on the plane,"" Snow told CNN the next day. Twelve minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport, the plane exploded in midair off the coast of Long Island. Two hundred thirty passengers were on board. No one survived. ""After we said our final 'I love yous' ... about two hours later, my mom called,"" Snow recalled recently. ""She said, 'Please tell me that Michel didn't go to Paris tonight.'"" Snow immediately turned on the TV. ""I just remember fire and really dark water. And at that point, my life stood still,"" she said. ""He was strong, he was young, and he definitely swam to shore. And I held on to that hope. And then the next morning it became a recovery mission."" About five weeks later, Snow's greatest fear was confirmed when Breistroff's remains were recovered from the bottom of the ocean. ""One of the hardest things for me was just going home,"" she said. ""Everybody is resuming life as normal but I had a huge hole in my heart, and I had a future planned with somebody and that was gone."" Snow looked for a support group in New York City but couldn't find one. She spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and he suggested she attend a meeting with families from Pan Am Flight 103, which had exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, eight years earlier. ""When I walked in the room, it was the first time I didn't have to apologize for my tears. They didn't have to say a word. They got it,"" she said. Snow met a woman who lost her fiancé on the Pan Am flight. ""She would meet with me and talk with me,"" Snow said. ""She is really how I got through it."" From there, Snow began pairing up mothers to mothers, siblings to siblings, spouses to spouses -- Pan Am families with TWA families. A few months later, ACCESS was born. ACCESS, short for AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, is a nonprofit bereavement support program for people who have lost loved ones in aviation disasters. ""We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters,"" Snow said. ""This gives people an opportunity to share what they went through with somebody else and also provide hope for them."" Most of the trained grief mentors have called in for help in the past, Snow said. Rachel Courtney is one of them. Courtney lost her father, James Courtney, along with his legal assistant in a private plane crash in 1998. ""For a period of three weeks, we were searching for him in the woods,"" Courtney said. ""The first night I was home, we were all in a small airport...I thought he's probably cold and in the woods and that nobody's helping him. And I was completely panicked."" A year later, Courtney was still grappling with the loss. ""I realized that the world was moving on but in a lot of respects, I wasn't,"" she said. ""Heidi ended up pairing me up with another woman who was a mentor, who had lost her father in an aircraft disaster."" Courtney's experience inspired her to help others. ""To me, it was 'I got through this,'"" she said. ""I wanted to be there to help other people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel."" When planes go down, like AirAsia Flight 8501, which left 162 people dead in December, Snow and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help. ""Every time we have the opportunity to speak about ACCESS on the news...We get calls for help from people who have lost loved ones who didn't know we were there,"" she said. Snow appeared on several CNN shows after the AirAsia crash. ""Every time these incidents occur we are walking with them, we remember, we are grieving with them,"" Snow told Michaela Pereira on CNN's ""New Day."" In addition to providing one-on-one support, the organization shares information with airlines and organizations to help them offer more effective emotional support after these types of losses. Snow also wrote the book ""Surviving Sudden Loss: Stories from those who have lived it"" as another tool families could use to deal with their grief. ""This is a lifelong journey. ... I feel so blessed that I've been given the opportunity to be with these incredible people who come forward and volunteer their time,"" Snow said. ""They really look at life differently because they start to realize how precious it is and how life can change in an instant.""","Heidi Snow lost her fiance when TWA Flight 800 exploded in 1996 .

"(CNN)The number of confirmed cases of measles in Illinois has risen to 10, state officials said Tuesday. All 10 cases are in Cook County, said spokesperson Melaney Arnold with the Illinois Department of Public Health. Nine stem from a KinderCare Learning Center location in Palatine, a Chicago suburb. One case  in Chicago is not related to that day care facility. Measles is a serious and highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads when a person breathes, coughs or sneezes and droplets travel through the air. The disease is especially dangerous for infants, who cannot receive vaccines until they are at least 6 months old. Young children are particularly vulnerable in cases in which they have received only one dose of measles vaccine. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, tiny white spots on the inner lining of the cheek and a rash with tiny red spots that starts at the head and spreads. Though there's no cure for measles, it can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective, according to medical professionals. Georgia confirmed Monday its first confirmed case of measles since 2012. An infected infant arrived in Atlanta from outside of the United States. Health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine where that patient might have contracted the disease. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but a recent outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in California. As of February 6, there are 121 cases of measles in 17 states and Washington, D.C., the CDC said. There are 88 cases in California, and 103 cases nationwide are linked to the Disneyland outbreak. The state with the second-highest number of measles cases is Arizona, which has seven, the CDC reports. Illinois has three, and Washington has four. The other places reporting one or more cases are Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Utah.

Obviously it's taken a while, but Ken Levin along with Neal Moritz and his team refused to give up, long after the point when I myself grew skeptical, and their unrelenting enthusiasm for the project has gotten us where we need to be. I'm particularly impressed that Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Sam Catlin understand 'Preacher' fully — meaning they get it for what it is, not some vague approximation. All in all, it looks like 'Preacher' can now be brought to TV in a way that I'd previously not have thought possible, and I very much appreciate that Steve and I have been included in the conversation in the way that we have.""

"(CNN)Sushi seems like a simple enough thing, but what's the best way to eat it? With your fingers? Chopsticks? Dipped into soy sauce? Daubed with wasabi? One mouthful or two? The only certainty, it seems, is that its proper consumption demands both etiquette and practicality. To put the matter to rest, we inquired at the top: Sushi Sawada, located on Tokyo's most prestigious intersection of Ginza 4-chome. With two Michelin stars and only seven seats, Sawada is a shrine to sushi -- and to straight-talking master Koji Sawada's constant quest for perfection. We asked Sawada for tips on the proper technique for eating sushi in Japan. How to eat sushi: Hands-on . Sawada's technique for the perfect sushi experience requires using the hands to pick up the sushi and turn it upside down. There's a simple reason for inverting your sushi: the molded rice base will disintegrate if it's dipped directly into soy sauce. The rice will also soak up too much sauce, ruining the flavor balance. Although if you're lucky enough to score a seat at Sawada, you won't be concerned with the dipping step. Like many top sushi masters, Sawada seasons each piece with his own soy sauce blend or a sprinkle of sea salt before serving, so there's no need to dip. ""But the rest is the same,"" says Sawada. ""The fish should touch the tongue first."" Most mainstream sushi-ya (sushi restaurants) expect customers to dip, and you'll find soy sauce dishes on the counter. Soy sauce is called ""murasaki,"" meaning ""purple,"" in sushi-speak. How to eat sushi: Oshibori, gari, wasabi . Every sushi-ya will give you a damp oshibori (hand towel) to wipe your fingers with before eating and between bites. Use your chopsticks to pick up some gari (sweet pickled ginger) to refresh the palate. Grated wasabi, the pungent Japanese horseradish, is usually smeared on the block of rice, known as ""shari,"" as the sushi is pressed. A typical old school sushi master will frown if you ask for more (his creation is perfect). Wasabi may be mixed with soy sauce to dip sashimi (raw fish without sushi rice), but never, in polite circles, for sushi. However, modern establishments will accommodate requests for extra wasabi. At Sawada, possibly Tokyo's most expensive sushi-ya, the customer is king, so it's OK to ask, though it's good to be aware that some say excessive wasabi use exposes the novice. How to eat sushi: Chopsticks . Sawada would rather not see his sushi eaten with chopsticks, although he provides them, and a quick scan of average sushi places shows chopsticks rank above fingers as the preferred utensil for most Japanese. Tokyo culinary instructor Yumi Sone prefers them for their elegance. She finds eating with the hands a little affected when practiced by anyone but a true aficionado. ""But chopsticks can be tricky when dipping sushi upside down,"" she says. Sawada agrees. ""Dipping fish-side first after picking up the sushi is not easy with chopsticks,"" he says. ""Many Japanese, even famous celebrities, hold their chopsticks like this ..."" He bunches his hand into a kind of fist around the chopsticks, and scissors them awkwardly. It might get the job done, but it ain't pretty. Sawada believes only the hands-on experience delivers the true sensuality of sushi. ""Like eating curry in India,"" he says. ""It just tastes better with the hands."" A final reason to skip chopsticks is that the rice block in the best sushi is often molded quite loosely. Sawada describes his method as packing ""a lot of air between the grains."" It's what helps create that melt-in-the-mouth feel. Chopsticks can squash the rice grains together, or lose their grip. How to eat sushi: Ordering . Many of the best sushi-ya have no menus; the meal is closer to a degustation parade of what's best on the day. It's not polite to leave a freshly presented piece of sushi for too long in front of you, as temperature, texture and moisture all change. In this respect the sushi-ya makes more demands of the customer than a typical restaurant -- the diner has a role to play. Feel free to ask for a repeat of anything you especially liked. A common faux pas is when a customer fails to inform the master in advance of dislikes or allergies. That's why when it comes to customers who aren't fluent in Japanese, restaurants like Sawada may ask to speak to your concierge or a Japanese speaker before taking a reservation. When ordering at a mid-range sushi-ya, your best bet, if you don't speak Japanese, may be to ask for a course within a set budget -- if the restaurant doesn't offer one, write down on a piece of paper what you're prepared to spend per person and simply ask for ""o-makase"" -- a way of asking the chef to look after you. Drinks aren't usually included in this figure -- the phrase for this is ""nomimono betsu desu"" (drinks separate). Chain sushi restaurants make things easier -- most offer photographic menus and you can simply serve yourself from the conveyor belt. Better still, take a stool at the counter and this tip from cookery teacher Sone: ""Never take a plate that's going around,"" she says. ""I always order freshly made, direct from the chefs. Also this way, I can ask for a smaller amount of shari."" This is a common practice among Japanese women who want to keep pace with their more voracious companions -- the number of pieces they eat is the same, but the volume is less. Follow the fish name with raised fingers for the number of pieces you're ordering. There's no specific order in which to eat different kinds of sushi. How to eat sushi: Agari tea . Sushi restaurants in Japan serve green or brown roasted tea at the end of a meal (and throughout, if you prefer it to sake or beer), before the check arrives. The tea is called ""agari."" The check is often called a shock. At many high-grade and traditional establishments, the bill is only a number written on a slip of paper. Though the new generation of sushi chefs makes a point of being customer-friendly, a top class sushi-ya can still be daunting, even for natives. In fact, very few typical Japanese get to enjoy sushi at the highest level, so if you happen to take a Japanese friend along with you, don't be surprised to find them almost as in awe of the experience as you.

"(CNN)First, they came for the giant sodas. Then, the salt. Now ... the cheese dust? In the March issue of Cooking Light magazine, first lady Michelle Obama says she's banished processed foods from her family's table in an effort that began nearly a decade ago. That's when, acting on the behest of the family's personal chef, she exiled the venerable boxed macaroni and cheese to the Obama scrap heap of history. ""He said, 'there's nothing wrong with mac and cheese, but it's got to be real food,' "" Cooking Light quoted Obama as saying in an article celebrating the fifth anniversary of her Let's Move fitness initiative. ""So my oldest daughter (Malia), who was probably 8 at the time, he took a block of cheese, and he said, 'if you can cut this cheese up into the powder that is the cheese of the boxed macaroni and cheese, then we'll use it.' "" ""She sat there for 30 minutes trying to pulverize a block of cheese into dust,"" Obama said. Suffice to say, it didn't work. ""And from then on, we stopped eating macaroni and cheese out of a box, because cheese dust is not food, as was the moral of that story,"" she said. The family went on to eliminate all traces of processed foods from their diet: ""all those packaged lunches, all of the canned juices,"" she said. ""We started using fresh-squeezed juice and added more water into their diet,"" she told the magazine. ""So when the kids were thirsty, we would even mix water in juice just to dilute it so it would get them out of that habit of wanting that sugary taste. And the kids adapted to the changes very quickly. "" Since becoming first lady, Obama has been a vocal proponent of fitness and healthy eating. In addition to the Let's Move campaign, she oversaw the creation of a vegetable garden at the White House and championed 2010 legislation that increased subsidies for school meals and gave the federal government more authority to set standards for fold sold in school vending machines. While well-received by many health and fitness advocates, the first lady's statements at times have drawn groans or worse, and the Cooking light article is no different. #ThanksMichelleObama: Students criticize school lunches . The conservative news site Breitbart.com labeled the processed food ban ""Michelle Obama's Personal Fight Against Boxed Macaroni And Cheese."" For some, it was a chance to poke fun. ""I'm counting down the seconds til Fox News declares cheese powder Freedom Dust,"" Twitter user @Amy_said wrote. For others, it's about darn time. Heathy food advocacy organization Slow Food USA offered a concise review of Obama's comments: ""We concur."" Of course, all of the Obamas' efforts to get their daughters to eat more healthfully could soon go up in a cloud of college dining hall fast-food glory. Malia, whose failed cheese dust experiment helped set the family on their processed-food-free journey, is about to go off to college, her dad noted recently. ""I joke with Malia and Sasha, because Malia is now at the age where she's starting to look at colleges, and I said, 'These days, I hear everybody is looking for fancy gyms and gourmet food and really spiffy dorms,' "" he said last week.","Michelle Obama tells Cooking Light magazine she's banished processed foods .

"Miami (CNN) -- Tilikum, the killer whale that killed SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau last year, has returned to the stage at the Orlando theme park. Tilikum made his first appearance in front of an audience in the morning killer whale show called ""Believe"" on Wednesday. Brancheau was killed in February 2010 when the orca grabbed her ponytail and pulled her under the water, authorities said. The incident took place in front of visitors watching the show. Brancheau died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's Office said at the time of the accident. Anthony Frogameni, Brancheau's nephew, said the trainer's family did not want to comment on Tilikum's return. ""From the start we've decided, it's a large family, we all have our different opinions, but we're just not going to talk about that aspect of it. We're only going to focus on Dawn,"" Frogameni said. The family started the Dawn Brancheau Foundation to help children in the Orlando area who are in need. ""She was all about spending her time helping other people, especially children,"" Frogameni added. ""We figured a great way to honor her is to focus on that."" SeaWorld told CNN that a request for information on Tilikum's return must submitted in writing. At this writing, answers to the questions asked of SeaWorld have not been received. In August, SeaWorld was fined $75,000 by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one referring to the death of Brancheau. The agency's investigation ""revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando,"" OSHA said. On this day when Tilikum is the star of the show, Frogameni said, ""We want people to remember Dawn's life, not that tragic accident.""

"(CNN)""This is where it all started,"" says Rizal Tandjung, gazing out over a sandy shoreline lapped by dying breakers. Almost 40 years old, Tandjung is one of Bali's surfing pioneers. Picking up his first board at the age of eight, he's now a professional surfer, owner of multiple surf shops and president of a clothing company, Hurley Indonesia/Bali. We're standing on Kuta Beach, a five kilometer stretch of white sand that's one of the most popular tourist areas on the Indonesian island of Bali. Once a small fisherman's village, today's Kuta is anything but quiet. Large commercial airplanes cruising into Ngurah Rai International Airport fly over the heads of surfers. Beach loungers are scattered down the shore as far as the eye can see, fighting for space with the multiple surf schools catering to tourists with ""Endless Summer"" dreams. Tandjung walks us over to a little hut on the beach where we meet Made Switra, a surf shop owner, painter and leisure surfer who also grew up in Kuta. ""He's the one, the first generation, the first kid from the fisherman village to surf,"" says Tandjung. Switra, tanned from all those hours in the water, sits with one leg propped up as he fiddles with his fishing pole. ""I started surfing from a fisherman boat. They had wood from a chair, so I started kind of boogie boarding with that and then found a few boards left from Westerners,"" Switra says. Bali a late arrival to global surf scene . Switra and Tandjung are part of the breakthrough generation of Indonesian surfers. Despite Bali being an obvious surf paradise, with its consistent waves and welcoming warm water, it wasn't until the late 1960s and 70s that it made its way onto the global surfing map. Hawaii, Australia and California were the three big players. But with the 1971 documentary ""Morning of the Earth,"" Bali finally got its recognition, as scenes of Uluwatu's barreling waves caused surfers around the world to grip their wax in excitement. With that recognition, Indonesian surfers eventually moved into the sport -- but not before overcoming some cultural taboos. ""Indonesians believe that the ocean is very, very dangerous and the sea god is going to take you away,"" explains Tandjung. Many kids of his generation grew up not knowing how to swim, he says. Even today, some fisherman still can't. Tandjung and Switra were viewed as rebels when they began surfing, ignoring their family's objections and defying any fear, he says. Today, that societal unease is slipping away and fishermen see surfing as a business opportunity. Using their boats to take surfers out to further breaks inaccessible from the shore -- such as a popular set of reef waves near Kuta's airport runway -- has led families to accept that surfing can pay the bills. Jason Childs, a surf photographer based in Bali, has seen the evolution of surfing culture here. ""Life's too good and they know it,"" he says. ""They surf with the best surfers on the best waves on a daily basis."" Though Indonesian surfers have been gracing the pages of international surf magazines for about a decade, Childs believes it takes a certain fire in their bellies to get out of their comfort zone and to the next level. Childs can't recall the first time he photographed Tandjung, but believes it must have been when he was about 16 years old. He points out that Tandjung is not Balinese but Chinese Indonesian, so it's been even harder for him to be accepted into the local surf scene here. ""It's made him have to work harder."" And it's paid off, with Tandjung paving the way for future surfers. Will a Balinese surfer ever top the podium? Nowadays, hardcore surfers head for Padang Padang in Bali's southern Uluwatu area. Filled with high-speed waves, it has some of the best -- and most dangerous-- surf in Bali. Just to the left of the rock enclosed beach are those world-famous barrels. Tandjung has taken us here for a practice session leading up to the big annual Rip Curl tournament, which he's been chasing every year since its inception in 2004. In tow is Tandjung's son, Varun, a name which means ""god of the sea."" Varun and his friends beg to go out and try the big barrels. The boy finally gets his wish and paddles out side by side with Tandjung, even getting to catch a few waves in between world-renowned pros like Bethany Hamilton. Childs figures this new generation of Balinese surfers -- boys and girls -- is the best yet to come out of Bali, but it still could be another 20 to 30 years before a Balinese tops the surfing world. But they'll find their way there with style and grace, he says. ""It's not very often you see an ugly Balinese surfer,"" says Childs. ""If you could build a surfer, the Balinese are close to perfect. They can jump to their feet effortlessly. They're beautiful to watch.""

"(CNN)Two men have been charged with plotting attacks in Australia following a major counter-terrorism operation in Sydney. The men, named in court documents as Omar Al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad, were advanced in their preparations for an act of terrorism in Australia as revenge for ""incidents overseas,"" New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said in a statement Wednesday. They were apprehended on Tuesday afternoon after a raid at a house in Fairfield, a suburb in western Sydney, before being charged with ""acts done in preparation for, or planning terrorist acts,"" the statement said. ""As a result of the police activities yesterday a number of items were seized and will be included as part of our evidence in court, and include a video recording, a flag, a machete and a hunting knife,"" Burn added. Al-Kutobi and Kiad did not apply for bail when they appeared via video link at a court hearing in Sydney on Thursday, NSW Department of Justice spokesperson Georgie Loudon told CNN. Their case has been adjourned to March 16. Police officers from the Joint Counter Terrorism Team Sydney and members of the Tactical Operations Unit took part in Operation Castrum, which also included a search of the Fairfield address, a motor vehicle and their place of work, the NSW Police statement added. ""Our message is we are watching, we are capable and we will act. That is what the community expects and that's what we will deliver,"" Burn said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told the country's parliament that the two men made a video saying they would carry out their attack by ""stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks,"" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported. ""Kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him, one of those arrested said this: 'I swear to almighty Allah we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia,' Abbott said. ""He went on to say, 'I swear to almighty Allah, blonde people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only owe you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.' The prime minister added: ""I don't think it would be possible to witness uglier fanaticism than this -- more monstrous fanaticism and extremism than this -- and I regret to say it is now present in our country."" In December last year, Australian authorities stormed the Sydney cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in the center of the city. Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died. Two other men will appear in court in Sydney later this month after they were charged with terror offenses late last month, with one accused of possessing documents designed to facilitate a terror attack on Australian soil. The arrests were made as part of Operation Appleby, an ongoing investigation into Islamist extremists, which led to sweeping pre-dawn counter-terror raids in Sydney in September. Footage of one of the two men, identified as Sulayman Khalid, 20, appeared in Australian media after his arrest, showing him dressed in a jacket bearing the ISIS flag, storming off the set of an Australian current affairs show in August in which guests had been discussing local support for Islamic extremism.

"The 2012 London Olympics end Sunday with a music-filled closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, but there are still plenty of medals to be won. Fifteen events in 10 sports will take place across the capital on what is the last day of the competition. Here are five things to watch for Sunday. 1) The closing ceremony: Goodbye London, Hello Rio . London Games organizers say musical performances will be the focus of the closing ceremony, titled ""A Symphony of British Music."" Among the British acts rumored to be taking part are the Spice Girls and the Pet Shop Boys, singer Jessie J. and rapper Tinie Tempah. George Michael says he will be performing, too, tweeting over the past week that he is ""a bit nervous"" and has been ""rehearsing like crazy"" for the ceremony. And like the spectacular opening ceremony just more than two weeks ago, which was directed by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle and characterized by a quirky exuberance, the closing will feature thousands of local volunteers and schoolchildren. At the end will be the traditional Olympic flag handover to the next summer Olympic hosts, Rio de Janeiro. Artistic Director Cao Hamburguer said we'll see ""eight minutes of Brazil"" with music, dancing and performances by musicians Seu Jorge, Marisa Monte, and BNegao. The whole show, attended by many of the 10,500 athletes who competed at the Games, will likely be watched on television worldwide by about  750 million people, the London organizing committee says. It begins at 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET). 2) Men's basketball: Team USA goes for the gold . In a rematch of its gold medal match in Beijing four years ago, the USA men's basketball team will play Spain, the current world No. 2, in the Sunday afternoon final. The game will pit several NBA players against each other. Spain's Pau Gasol is playing against his Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant of the USA, while Spain's Serge Ibaka will play against his Oklahoma City Thunder teammates, Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook of the USA. The U.S. men's basketball team has won gold at four of the past five Olympic Games, with the exception being the 2004 Athens Games. 3) The men's marathon: A scenic tour through London . The men's marathon begins at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) on The Mall near Buckingham Palace. Its scenic loop along the River Thames will take it past landmarks including the palace, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London. Ethiopia and Kenya, with three runners each, are the favorites to win the race this year. All six athletes have clocked personal bests of 2:05:04 or better, and one of them -- Kenya's Wilson Kipsang -- achieved his best time of 2:03:42 last year. The International Association of Athletics Federations says Kipsang may be the hottest marathoner in the world this year. A Kenyan win could pay tribute to Sammy Wanjiru, the 2008 Olympic gold medalist who died in a fall from his balcony last year. 4) Men's boxing: Five golds up for grabs . Five of the 10 gold medals in men's boxing were awarded Saturday, and the other five will be given out Sunday in men's fly, light, welter, light heavy, and super heavyweight. Kazakhstan and Great Britain each have two athletes vying for gold. Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko is seeking to defend his Olympic gold medal in the lightweight battle with South Korea's Han Soon-Chul. At 18, Cuba's Robeisy Ramirez Carrazana is the youngest of the boxers competing Sunday, battling Tugstsogt Nyambayar of Mongolia in the fly. The super heavyweight match pits 22-year-old Londoner Anthony Joshua, competing in his first Olympics, against defending Olympic champ Roberto Cammarelle of Italy, 10 years his senior. 5) Women's modern pentathlon: An all-day affair . The first event to start Sunday will also be the last to finish. The women get going at 8 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) in the modern pentathlon, starting with fencing and swimming at the Olympic Park. They move south of the river to Greenwich Park for riding and the combined event, in which the athletes begin at handicapped time intervals based on their results from the previous events. They must run to the shooting range, hit five targets in 70 seconds, then run 1,000 meters -- and do it three times over. The first athlete to cross the finish line at the end wins the gold. Modern pentathlon is the creation of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympics. ""The choice of the five diverse and unrelated sports that make up the modern pentathlon arose out of the romantic, tough adventures of a liaison officer whose horse was brought down in enemy territory,"" says Pentathlon GB, the national governing body. ""Having defended himself with his pistol and sword, he swims across a raging river and delivers the message on foot."" The sport originally took place over five days but changed to one day at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.","London hands over the Olympics to the next host, Rio de Janeiro .

"Fevered efforts by ISIS to capture the embattled Syrian city of Kobani have handed U.S. and allied forces a prime opportunity to deal the extremist group a bloody nose, the U.S. Central Command's top general told reporters Friday. By pouring what Gen. Lloyd Austin described as ""legions"" of fighters into the city, ISIS commanders have given allied warplanes numerous targets to attack. ""The more I attrit him there,"" Austin said of ISIS, using a common military term for grinding down an enemy's power, ""the less I'll have to fight him on some other part of the battlefield."" The U.S. military carried out seven airstrikes in northern Syria and coalition aircraft carried out two more near Baiji, north of Tikrit in Iraq, the U.S. Central Command (Centcom) said on Friday. Six of the airstrikes occurred near Kobani, hitting and destroying ISIS buildings, positions, and vehicles, Centcom said. The seventh strike in Syria successfully struck an ISIS-controlled oil installation near Shadadi, a city between the provinces of Deir Ezzor and al-Hasaka in northeastern Syria, according to Centcom. U.S. fighter jets also flew at least 14 missions against ISIS targets near Kobani on Wednesday and Thursday, striking buildings, command posts, sniper positions and a staging location, according to Centcom. CNN has learned that the U.S. military for the first time is getting intelligence from Syrian Kurds about ISIS positions in and around Kobani, according to an administration official who confirmed the details, but declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. This flow of intelligence for the last several days has led to increased and more precise airstrikes, according to the official. The strikes brought the number of missions flown against targets in the city to 129, by CNN's calculation, the most of any town in the three-week-old Syrian portion of the fight against ISIS. Austin said Friday that the increased number of airstrikes near Kobani aren't due to a change in attitudes, but rather the presence of so many ISIS targets as the group fights Syrian Kurdish fighters for control of the city. Despite apparent advances in recent days by Syrian Kurdish fighters defending Kobani, Austin warned that the city may yet fall. But he said recent successes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq are encouraging signs that the broad coalition effort to ultimately destroy the extremist group is beginning to bear fruit. ""The campaign is on the right track. We're doing the right things, and we're having the -- creating the right effects,"" he said. U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that it is not essential to keep Kobani from falling into ISIS hands. But retired U.S. Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN on Friday that with the eyes of the world on the fight, Kobani holds psychological and public relations value that ""far outweighs the military victory to whichever side that wins."" Intelligence sharing . The intelligence sharing between U.S. and Syrian Kurds in Kobani signifies an unprecedented level of U.S. military cooperation with operatives on the ground inside Syria. The intelligence operation is extremely sensitive and involves only a small number of Kurds, according to the administration official. Those involved are passing intelligence through their own contacts in Syria and Iraq, and then the information is handed over to U.S. military personnel in Irbil, Iraq, who are working on selecting targets for airstrikes, the administration official said. A number of recent airstrikes in and around Kobani have been highly precise. The Kurds are now able to pass information about the locations of ISIS fighters in the town, the administration official said. The Pentagon has declined to openly discuss the intelligence operation with the Syrian Kurds, and Austin did not address the issue at his briefing Friday.","U.S. Central Command: Seven more airstrikes hit ISIS targets in Syria .

"(CNN)The horror stories seem to stack up every winter: Students sliding and stomping through knee-deep snow on their walks to school, trapped inside school buses or nestling in for a surprise slumber party in the school gym. This week, schools across the Northeast shut down in preparation for a ""potentially historic"" blizzard. Some even tried to have some fun with it, including those at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island. They posted a snow day announcement that parodied the ""Frozen"" hit ""Let It Go."" Still, closing school is a tough call, said school superintendents from across the country. The decision often requires hours of preparation and discussion among administrators, local officials, road crews and meteorologists. Most school leaders said they take a better-safe-than-sorry approach, but it can be hard to do as the number of days off climbs. ""We lose a lot of sleep over it,"" said Gregory Hutchings, superintendent of Shaker Heights schools in Ohio. So why wouldn't schools call off classes when weather seems like it could be dangerous? Here are a few reasons. 1. Forecasts can be wrong. With every winter storm threat, superintendents wake in the wee hours to consider the latest weather maps or drive their local roads. One February day last year, Stratford, Connecticut, schools Superintendent Janet Robinson was on a forecasting conference call at 4:15 a.m. Within 30 minutes, and with the help of the schools' facilities manager, she decided to cancel classes for the sixth time that year. But the choice isn't always that easy. After all, weather forecasts aren't guarantees. ""There's no snow yet at 4 o'clock, it's forecast to come in, and you decide to cancel -- and then it doesn't come,"" Robinson said. ""We joke that no matter what we say, someone is going to disagree with it."" Of course, there are worse ways to be wrong, she said: Watching a snowstorm roll in once you've brought children to school, calling buses back while kids shiver at their bus stops or sending young drivers out on dangerously slick roads. 2. Parents hate snow days, too. When the windchill hit 35 degrees below zero last year, the decision was easy for Hutchings: School was canceled. To his surprise, ""I still received phone calls and e-mails from parents,"" he said. ""It's a no-win situation."" As a father of young children, he can commiserate. He understands parents' concerns about child care and time off from work. Parents really hate it when he spoils vacation by adding makeup days to the end of the school year, he said. But his decisions are based on what's safest for all students and staff members, he said. In January 2014, many schools around Atlanta remained open for a few hours before snow began to fall. When they released early, some students ended up stuck on icy, gridlocked roads or stranded at school overnight. Clayton County schools -- a district just outside Atlanta with about 52,000 students and 6,200 faculty and staff -- closed before the snow arrived and initially heard some negative responses from parents, said Vicki Gavalas, the district's director of communications. Within a few hours, the tone changed. The superintendent's office received more than 100 thank-you messages from parents and community members, she said, and a batch of handwritten letters from kindergartners who wrote, ""You made the right decision"" and ""Thank you for keeping my family safe."" ""The e-mails we got in support were so gratifying and affirming,"" Gavalas said. ""Sometimes, people are very quick to criticize and not as quick to praise."" 3. Closures can be costly. Wild weather almost always means extra costs for schools, from storm cleanup to snow removal to staff overtime. But school closures can hurt the budget in deeper ways, especially if the days off begin to pile up. ""We do have an obligation to the taxpayer that we are good stewards, financially,"" Gavalas said. Day-to-day school attendance won't typically affect a school's finances, said Dick Flanary, former deputy executive director for programs and services for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. But it can lead to cuts if test scores sink, if students or teachers' miss a chance to shine or if schools can't fulfill a grant obligation based on instructional time. ""There's a very competitive environment for grant money, foundation money, because of this economy,"" Flanary said. ""It could jeopardize a potential funding source."" 4. Students could go hungry. Or be left alone. Or get into trouble. Educators know that school might be the only place where some students eat a healthy meal or experience a safe, supervised, warm environment. ""You think about those kids, that this is the only wholesome meal those children get during the day,"" said Flanary, who was a middle school principal in Virginia for 12 years. ""When they miss that, what's the result?"" But if the roads aren't safe, the power is out or a natural disaster has damaged the building, educators say, school isn't a safe place to be, either. 5. Closing school means less time to learn. It's simple, educators said: If students are snowed out of school, they won't learn as much. Educators said it's especially tough on students gearing up for standardized tests or Advanced Placement exams and for new teachers who haven't mastered the art of the strong comeback. ""What concerns us most is the lack of continuity in the kids' education,"" said Robinson, the Connecticut superintendent. ""There's something about the energy of being in school every day that you miss."" A snow day here or there won't hurt student learning, said Joshua Goodman, an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He recently studied eight years of school closures in Massachusetts and found that snow days caused no harm. Most teachers there understood how to adjust their lesson plans and prioritize must-learn material, he said. What did affect academic achievement, he found, were lousy weather days when schools remained open. On those days, higher numbers of students missed class, perhaps because of parental discretion or transportation issues, and entire classes suffered as teachers moved some students on and caught other students up. But in Massachusetts, where snow days are no surprise, it was rare for schools to close for several days at a time, Goodman said. The results might be different in states that rarely encounter extreme weather or for schools that face a major, one-time disruption. ""The fact that snow days are not harmful is because schools and teachers know how to deal with them,"" Goodman said. Not all learning is lost when school is out, though. Educators across the country said they're urging students to check out Khan Academy and other online learning tools. Some said teachers now assign homework in advance so students can stay on task. Last year, some school districts experimented with virtual school days taught at home through school-provided laptops and tablets. Hutchings, the Shaker Heights, Ohio, superintendent, said some in his district assign ""blizzard bags"" of schoolwork for students to dip into whenever they're out of class, and it is considering online programs that would allow students to interact with teachers from home -- at least, between snowball fights and trips down the sledding hill. ""The first couple (snow days) are OK,"" Hutchings said. ""When you get into five, six, enough is enough. I have a plea with Mother Nature to ease up a little bit.""","School leaders say closing schools is a ""no-win"" situation .

"Film director Woody Allen released a statement Sunday denying adopted daughter Dylan Farrow's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when she was 7 years old. In an open letter posted online Saturday by The New York Times, Farrow recounted her allegation that Allen sexually assaulted her in the attic of her adopted mother Mia Farrow's house in 1992. The statement released by Allen representative Leslee Dart said: ""Mr. Allen has read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful. He will be responding very soon. In the meantime, it is essential that your coverage make the following facts clear: . ""At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts. The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia Farrow.  No charges were ever filed."" Dylan Farrow's open letter appeared on Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's blog. It was billed as the first time she's publicly written about the accusation. ""What's your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. ""He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me."" The letter was released the same day as the Writers Guild Awards, for which Allen had been nominated for best screenplay for ""Blue Jasmine"" but did not win. The movie also garnered three Academy Award nominations. In 1992, in the wake of an affair between Allen and Soon-Yi Previn -- Mia Farrow's adopted daughter with composer Andre Previn -- Farrow accused the filmmaker of molesting Dylan. About a week later, Allen filed for custody of his three children with Farrow --  Moses and Dylan, who were adopted, and Satchel, their biological son, who now goes by Ronan Farrow. ""A  team of investigators from Yale-New Haven Hospital that was retained by the Connecticut State Police subsequently concluded Dylan had not been abused,"" according to an account in the Times, which covered the custody proceedings. Acting Justice Elliott Wilk of New York's State Supreme Court ""said it was unlikely that Mr. Allen could be prosecuted for sexual abuse based on the evidence,"" the newspaper reported. ""But while a team of experts concluded that Dylan was not abused, the judge said he found the evidence inconclusive."" A former prosecutor who decided against pressing charges in the case declined to comment on the details in Dylan Farrow's letter Sunday. ""As a prosecutor I really can't comment on the substance of the statement of this now young woman. As a father of a child not too much older than this young woman, I can only say I hope she finds some peace and solace in the way she's expressing herself,"" former Connecticut State's Attorney Frank Maco said. ""I hope she had access to my written statement of decision. My statement is as valid today as it was 20 years ago."" In 1993, Maco -- who's since retired -- told reporters he believed there was probable cause to arrest Allen. But he said he decided not to press charges, with Mia Farrow's support, ""rather than exposing the child to possible harm."" At the time, Allen lashed out at authorities who handled the case and accused prosecutors of scheming to keep it open to influence his custody battle. Allegations raised again in recent months . Even as the decades passed, the scandal permanently damaged Allen's image -- that of a neurotic but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one-liners. He denied the accusations from Dylan and said his relationship with Farrow, which had been painted storybook colors by the press, was not actually all that strong. He did marry Soon-Yi Previn in 1997, and after the marriage came a slightly more public Woody Allen. The couple were the focus of a 1997 Barbara Kopple documentary, ""Wild Man Blues,"" which portrayed a generally happy pair. Allen was also the subject of a 2011 Robert Weide film, ""Woody Allen: A Documentary,"" which briskly addressed Farrow's allegations from Allen's point of view. However, the scandal has always been near the surface, and the open letter in The New York Times is one of a number of instances in recent months where the allegation has been raised. In a November Vanity Fair article, Allen was condemned by Mia Farrow's children, especially Dylan. After that article's publication, a representative for Allen told CNN, ""The article is so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment."" Last month, as Allen was honored with a lifetime achievement award during the Golden Globes, Ronan Farrow, now estranged from his father, took to Twitter and referenced the allegation: ""Missed the Woody Allen tribute -- did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?"" And now comes the open letter, where Dylan Farrow recounts not only the alleged abuse, but what she says happened to her in the aftermath. ""Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime. That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,"" she wrote. ""I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself."" Celebrities accused of 'turning a blind eye' She also admonished some of Hollywood's most celebrated, mostly women, by name for ""turning a blind eye"" and for continuing to work with Allen. CNN reached out to the stars that Dylan Farrow challenged by name in her letter but has not yet received responses. In a series of Twitter posts Sunday, actor Alec Baldwin -- who starred in ""Blue Jasmine"" -- fired back at people asking him to respond to the allegations. ""You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue,"" he wrote. In another post, he slammed someone who asked whether he owed Dylan Farrow an apology: ""What the f&@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family's personal struggle?"" No matter how celebrities respond, the letter is likely to fuel significant media coverage, said Dan Abrams, ABC News' chief legal affairs anchor. ""This letter is so detailed and so powerful that I think that wherever Woody Allen goes for the next period of months, he's going to be asked about this, he's going to be questioned about it, he's going to be challenged about it,"" Abrams told CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. ""But I think that as a news story, it's not going to fundamentally change, because we've known this was her position. It's the power of the details that she's presenting that I think change this.""","Woody Allen's representative calls letter ""untrue and disgraceful""

"(CNN)The Internet was abuzz last week when the cast of the all-female ""Ghostbusters"" reboot was announced. The crop of funny ladies charged with eliminating the undead are some of the top female comedians working today. The chatter and support has a lot to do with the fans these women have garnered. It also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major Hollywood films. So, is ""Ghostbusters"" progress? Yes. Is it a panacea? No. Let's talk about why. Putting women front and center in film is the exception, not the rule. Using ""Ghostbusters"" as an example of how far females have come is like celebrating Kathryn Bigelow's best director Academy Award -- and forgetting that she's the only woman ever to take home that honor. You can applaud Katniss, Elsa, and Anna, too. But, they're following the legions of guys who have protected and ruled the planet, palaces and corporate empires near and far. It's fair and important to celebrate these high-profile moments of progress. Doing so, however, may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in Hollywood movies. Our annual statistics on women's participation in the year's 100 top-grossing films reveal stagnation. In 2013, only 29% of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female. In another study, we examined popular films from 1990 to 1995. The percentage was 29%. For those of you who think the past was better, other research shows that women clocked in at 25% of characters in a sample of movies from the late 1940s. Interestingly, only 28% of movies in 2013 depicted a female lead or co-lead. Behind the camera it's even worse. Women rarely get to direct large budget features on the scale of ""Ghostbusters"" or ""The Hunger Games."" Across top-grossing films from 2002 to 2013, only 4.2% of all directors were female. In 2013 and 2014, there were only two female directors each year. Even more dismal figures concern black or African-American female directors. Only three black women were directors across 700 popular movies between 2007 and 2014. What drives the lack of diversity in films? Our studies with industry leaders (funded by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and Sundance Institute/Women in Film Los Angeles) reveal that both in front of and behind the camera, perceptions about market forces and money are to blame for the lack of females. Male leads, stories and properties are seen as more profitable, while female stories and casts are seen as a risk. For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress. Much like pesky poltergeists, these myths about profitability will have to be busted before change can occur. To do so, solutions need to be implemented that overcome implicit biases and circumvent stereotyping. Leveling the playing field when it comes to hiring is one step toward creating a more balanced behind-the-scenes environment. We have previously advocated for a modified version of the NFL's Rooney Rule: a league-wide commitment to interviewing diverse candidates for coaching positions. Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors. Another solution we're implementing at USC Annenberg is to look holistically at the entertainment industry from decision-making to the content we view. The USC Annenberg Comprehensive Analysis and Report on Diversity will ""grade"" companies based on the diversity within their ranks and the media they create. Media conglomerates can be held accountable for their decisions across film, television and digital productions. While not every story should or can be female-dominated or focus on underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups, examining a slate of content will reveal where and when stories about diverse groups and individuals are valued and told. Right now, lifting the veil on diversity in Hollywood reveals white men standing behind the curtain. In this environment, casting four women to take care of a metropolitan ghost problem does feel rather extraordinary. Sealing up cracks in the development, casting and hiring pipeline for women and underrepresented groups, however, should result in an onscreen reality that is more representative of the world we live in. Then, the only unreal thing about ""Ghostbusters"" will be the ghouls and goblins, not the women busting them.","A ""Ghostbusters"" reboot has been announced with all-female leads .

"Twitter is looking to revamp its user-protection policies after Zelda Williams, the daughter of comedian Robin Williams, was run off of the social site by abuse in the wake of her father's apparent suicide. ""We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter,"" Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said in a statement. ""We have suspended a number of accounts related to this issue for violating our rules and we are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one. ""This includes expanding our policies regarding self-harm and private information, and improving support for family members of deceased users."" Zelda Williams abandoned her Twitter and Instagram accounts Tuesday after saying at least two people were sending her Photoshopped images of her father's dead body and other disturbing messages -- some blaming her for father's death. ""I'm sorry. I should've risen above,"" she wrote in her final tweet. ""Deleting this from my devices for a good long time, maybe forever. Time will tell. Goodbye."" The episode proves that, with the anonymity of the Internet, some people will be horrible no matter the situation. Earlier, Williams, 25, had asked her followers to report the abusive accounts to Twitter, but said they appeared to be creating new accounts after being banned by the site. She later deleted her request, which called the abusive messages ""cruel and unnecessary."" On Instagram, she also addressed negativity targeting her in an announcement that she'd be taking a break from the photo-sharing app. ""I will be leaving this account for a bit while I heal and decide if I'll be deleting it or not,"" she wrote. ""In this difficult time, please try to be respectful."" Williams also touched on the personal attacks, albeit in a more light-hearted way, in a statement she posted on blogging site Tumblr. ""To those he touched who are sending kind words, know that one of his favorite things in the world was to make you all laugh,"" she wrote. ""As for those who are sending negativity, know that some small, giggling part of him is sending a flock of pigeons to your house to poop on your car. Right after you've had it washed. After all, he loved to laugh too."" Despite the attacks, the vast majority of social-media messages posted to Zelda Williams' accounts were positive and supportive of her decision to take some time away from the Web. ""You did nothing wrong @zeldawilliams,"" one Twitter follower wrote. ""Some people are just plain evil."" Robin Williams, 63, was found dead at his California home on Monday.

"(CNN)Officials from Russia, Ukraine and separatist groups engaged in low-level talks hours before a crucial meeting over the crisis in eastern Ukraine. In the early morning hours Wednesday, the parties gathered in Belarus with one question answered in part: Will separatist leaders whose pro-Russian forces are battling with Ukrainian soldiers for control of eastern Ukraine show up? Video showed Denis Pushilin of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Vladislav Deinego of the Luhansk People's Republic at the talks speaking with reporters. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also attended the preliminary meeting. If a peace deal is to be reached, leaders involved in the talks still have a long road before a lasting agreement is reached, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Minsk. Later in the day, the leaders of France and Germany hope to bring together Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, on Wednesday in the capital of Belarus. U.S. President Barack Obama called Putin on Tuesday and urged him to seize the opportunity for peace, the White House said. ""The President emphasized the importance of reaching and implementing a negotiated settlement underpinned by the commitments in the (prior)  Minsk agreement. However, if Russia continues its aggressive actions in Ukraine, including by sending troops, weapons and financing to support the separatists, the costs for Russia will rise,"" the White House said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that European diplomats were making ""one further effort"" at negotiating a deal to resolve the crisis. In an interview with Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ""really interested in a peaceful settlement of the crisis in Ukraine."" He said other Western proposals, such as imposing more sanctions against Russian interests, isolating Russia or the possible arming of Ukrainian forces, would only destabilize the situation. The European Union's Foreign Affairs Council agreed on additional sanctions Monday against Russian and separatist interests but said their implementation would be delayed for a week to ""give space for current diplomatic efforts."" Meanwhile, fighting continued in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with the strategically important town of Debaltseve under fire and deadly shelling reported in the town of Kramatorsk. What's next in conflict? A spokesman for the government's military operation against the separatists, Vladislav Seleznyov, told a media briefing that the militants were consistently shelling Debaltseve -- and that it's currently the most dangerous place in the country. ""The city infrastructure is increasingly devastated,"" he said. ""Ukrainian armed forces are holding their lines of defense and are not going to leave their positions."" Seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 23 injured overnight, he said. Eduard Basurin, deputy defense minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, said fighting for the town continued. A day earlier, Basurin said the separatist forces had Debaltseve ""entirely surrounded."" About 55 miles (89 kilometers) to the northwest, shelling in Kramatorsk killed 12 civilians and injured 35, including at least five children, the Kiev-backed Donetsk regional authority said. Kramatorsk, deep inside Ukrainian-held territory, is the location of the main base for the government's military operation against the separatists, which it calls the anti-terrorist operation, or ATO. Thirty-two Ukrainian military personnel were injured in shelling on the base's airfield, according to Donetsk regional health care authorities. The official Facebook page for the ATO said cluster bombs were used to shell the airfield at lunchtime. ATO spokesman Alexander Motuzyanyk said that these munitions are not used by Ukraine's military. Each side has accused the other of shelling civilian areas in the course of the conflict. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's monitoring mission in Ukraine last week reported evidence of the use of cluster munitions in separatist-controlled Luhansk city. Cluster bombs are banned by many states because of their deadly impact on civilians. The main points of negotiations of the so-called Normandy group -- the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine -- would be the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the creation of a demilitarized zone and the beginning of a permanent dialogue between Kiev and the Donbas area, which comprises Luhansk and Donetsk, RIA Novsoti quoted a diplomatic source at the talks as saying. The big challenge facing Putin, Poroshenko, Merkel and French President Francois Hollande in Minsk is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick. A peace agreement was signed in September in Minsk. It called for a drawback of heavy weapons, self rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the Russia-Ukraine border. But the agreement quickly disintegrated, and the violence continued. The new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into Ukraine. But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. Merkel in the middle of a U.S.-Russia standoff . As the time for crunch talks to begin approached, questions remain over apparent differences between European leaders and the United States about whether to arm the Ukrainian government forces. Even as they tried to present a unified front at a media briefing Monday, it was clear that it's an area where Obama and Merkel don't quite see eye to eye. Obama said he hasn't decided yet whether to send arms to Ukrainian forces defending their country against Russian-backed separatists, and he hasn't set a deadline for when he will. But he insists it's an option that should be considered if diplomacy fails. Any weapons the United States sends would not be meant to help Ukraine defeat the Russian army in an all-out battle, Obama said, but ""simply to defend itself."" Merkel favors a different approach. ""I've always said I don't see a military solution to this conflict,"" she said. ""We have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution."" Both Obama and Merkel stressed the importance of working together. If the Minsk talks fail, U.S. lawmakers will probably ratchet up pressure on Obama to send weapons to Ukraine. All the while, the crisis in Ukraine, which stemmed from a trade agreement, has killed more than 5,000 people, including many civilians, and forced more than 1.5 million from their homes, according to the United Nations. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Alla Eshchenko, Frederik Pleitgen, Catherine Shoichet, Khushbu Shah, Matthew Chance, Radina Gigova, Emma Burrows and journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev, Ukraine, contributed to this report.","Separatist leaders gather with Ukrainian and Russian officials before peace talks officially kick off .

"Passengers on the Crown Princess are coming home early from a Caribbean cruise, thanks to a second nasty outbreak of gastrointestinal illness. Nearly 60 crew members and 114 passengers have reported illness on the current voyage, according to Princess Cruises. The ship was cleaned for the current sailing after nearly 400 people became ill on the last voyage. The new outbreak means the ship will return to port in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday, two days early, for an extensive two-day cleaning, Princess Cruises said in a statement. ""We sincerely regret having to cut short our passengers' cruise vacations because of this highly unusual situation. We will, of course, be refunding their cruise fare, arranging flights home, including covering change fees if air was not booked through Princess, providing hotel accommodation if necessary, and offering a 25% future cruise credit,"" the cruise line said. Princess is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vessel Sanitation Program to combat what officials suspect is norovirus. Norovirus causes symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain, according to the CDC. It is spread from person to person through contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces. The enhanced cleaning will include ""thorough sanitization of all public spaces and surfaces including soft furnishing and carpets, railings, door handles and the like,"" Princess said, and staterooms will be cleaned more than once before the next guests board. The next cruise is set to depart as scheduled on Saturday. A second Princess cruise ship, the Ruby Princess, also experienced a recent outbreak of gastrointestinal illness.

"The FBI on Monday unveiled a videotaped message from the actor who played the infamous fictional insider trader Gordon Gekko to help bolster a wide-ranging attack on financial crimes. At an FBI headquarters briefing on the stepped-up fight against financial misdealings, the bureau proudly showed a 30-second public service announcement featuring actor Michael Douglas. His character in the 1987 film ""Wall Street,"" Gordon Gekko, proclaimed that ""greed, for lack of a better word, is good."" But in a new message to help the FBI, Douglas says, ""The movie is fiction, but the problem is real."" Douglas asks viewers who suspect financial crime to contact the FBI. A new report issued Monday by the FBI shows that in the last fiscal year, FBI investigations led to 242 indictments and 241 convictions of corporate criminals. The FBI says it secured $2.4 billion in restitution from corporate criminals. The FBI says it has increased convictions of securities and commodities fraud, health care fraud, mortgage fraud, insurance fraud, and money laundering. Kevin Perkins, the FBI's assistant director of the criminal investigative division, says the FBI has hired 250 new forensic accountants who are all focused on major cases. Some of them are involved with investigations of 2,600 mortgage cases. Attorney General Eric Holder traveled to New York on Thursday to deliver the message that the Justice Department is committed to rooting out corporate crime. ""From securities, bank and investment, to mortgage, consumer and health-care fraud, we've found that these schemes are as diverse as the imaginations of those who perpetrate them, and as sophisticated as modern technology will permit,"" Holder said. Holder has emphasized the effort to combat health-care fraud schemes. In the past fiscal year more than 1,400 people were charged with fraud in 500 cases.

"(CNN) -- Whisper it quietly, but after years of foreign domination the prospect of a French winner of the Tour de France is more than just a mere pipe dream. You have to rewind the clock to 1985 -- 29 long years -- to find the last time that a home winner stepped on to the podium on the Champs-Elysees -- with Bernard Hinault claiming his fifth and final victory. Hinault is ranked among the all-time greats and one of only six men, 2014 Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali included, to win all three of the sports major tours in Italy, Spain and France. But his legacy has been one of a steady decline with Richard Virenque's second place in 1997 the last time a French rider even made the podium -- until this year. Jean-Christophe Peraud and 24-year-old Thibaut Pinot may have finished around eight minutes adrift of Italy's Nibali in second and third spots respectively, but that hardly mattered to a French public desperate for success. Further hope came in the form of 23-year-old Romain Bardet, who battled it out with compatriot Pinot for the white jersey of best young rider, before coming home a creditable sixth. ""The French, promise for 2015,"" read Monday's headline in the famous sporting newspaper L'Equipe, already anticipating next year's Grand Boucle. Pinot's burst to briefly distance Nibali on one of the 16th stage in the Pyrenees last Tuesday had set home pulses racing, although the team FDJ hope admitted he had made his move with thoughts of white rather the yellow jersey of the leader. ""My big objective was to gain time on Bardet,"" Pinot said after his heroics. He had eventually to give best to compatriot Peraud, who despite being 37 has only been a professional on the road circuit since 2009, having previously won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in mountain biking. Peraud's superior ability at individual time trialing (racing alone against the clock) saw him edge out his French rival but it was the young men, Pinot and Bardet, who hold most hope for the future. ""It was great for the French to have two men on the podium,"" said Stephen Farrand, of Cyclingnews.com. ""With Pinot I think they are really optimistic for next year, he's quite a character. ""I think the Tour is always better when home riders are performing well, there's a lot more enthusiasm about the race and the French never need an excuse to be patriotic,"" he added. Over the past decade that patriotism has mostly been reserved for the never-day-die attitude of Thomas Voeckler, still making brave breakaways, for team Europcar on this year's Tour at the age of 35. Back in 2004, Voeckler became a national hero when he led the Tour for against the odds for 10 days with the fleeting prospect he could beat the all-conquering Lance Armstrong. Even back then there was the suspicion -- particularly in the French media -- that Armstrong was getting extra help from banned substances, while home riders, personified by Voeckler were manifestly ""pure"" and free of drugs. With Armstrong disgraced and stripped of his seven Tour titles, cycling is believed to have cleaned up its act and there have been no positive tests on the 2014 edition. Farrand believes the French have more to gain than most in the new era. ""In the past nobody really knew what was going on,"" he said. ""Now there are so many good signs, the French have always been anti-doping and now they are able to compete for the yellow jersey."" Whether that's a realistic prospect, certainly for 2015, will depend on if Nibali is able to repeat his outstanding performances, four stage wins included, and Froome and Contador can return with a vengeance. ""He's a most deserved winner,"" said Farrand of Nibali. ""He had the yellow jersey for all but two days and his margin of victory is the second biggest in Tour history."" Nibali's victory is also a shot in the arm for Italian cycling, which like its French counterpart, has been in something of a trough, hit by doping scandals and the poor state of its economy. Despite previous victories in the Giro d'Italia and Tour of Spain, he had been lightly regarded by the media, ""only about half a dozen journalists attended his pre-race press conference,"" said Farrand, but proved them wrong. An audacious late break to win the second stage in Sheffield, England, saw him gain time on Froome and Contador and he rode brilliantly on the treacherous and cobbled fifth stage to open up a further gap. After his main rivals exited, Nibali proceeded to claim a further three stage wins in the Alps and Pyrenees and comfortably hold off the challenge mounted by his French rivals and Spain's Alejandro Valverde. Italy's main sports newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport gave him top billing with a nice tribute from Hinault, who congratulated him on the podium in Paris. ""Throughout the tour, Nibali has shown great wisdom, mastery, he never panicked,"" he said. The 59-year-old Hinault, who works for Tour organizers ASO, will doubtless be hoping against hope that over the next coming years he will be presenting the yellow jersey on the Champs-Elysees to a compatriot. It is not only Pinot and Bardet who could break the overseas domination of the top step of the podium. There are high hopes for 22-year-old Warren Barguil, described by Hinault as a ""huge talent"" after winning two mountain stages of the Tour of Spain last year. Barguil was left off the Giant-Shimano squad because it concentrated on helping Germany's Marcel Kittel win four stages of this year's Tour, including the blue-riband finish on the Champs-Elysees. French sprinting talent is also emerging, with young fast men like Bryan Coquard, third in the points classification to Peter Sagan this year and Nacer Bouhanni, who won three stages of the Giro d'Italia. Whether they can challenge the likes of Kittel and Britain's Mark Cavendish, who did not make it past stage one after hitting the tarmac in Harrogate, in the future is again open to debate, but it all points to a welcome renaissance for the traditional home of cycling.","France has two riders on Tour podium for first time since 1984 .

"Rainbows of color, spice-market smells, an urban orchestra of sounds: Morocco can be overwhelming at first. Lying 13 kilometers, or 8 miles, from the coast of Spain, the North African country mixes Middle Eastern magic, Berber tradition and European flair. Tourism has more than doubled since 2002, to nearly 10 million visitors in 2011. King Mohammed VI wants to increase the annual visitor numbers to 18 million by 2020. The royal ruler's strategy is underpinned by infrastructure development, making traveling around the country even easier. Add to this a program of ongoing social, political and economic reforms, and Morocco is one of the most moderate and peaceful countries in the region. Cafes dominate life in Tangier . Cafes are the key place to socialize, for Moroccan men at least. They gather to drink sweet mint tea and watch people as they go about their affairs. The northern port city of Tangier has a history of literary bohemianism and illicit goings-on, thanks to its status as an International Zone from 1923 to 1956. The Interzone years, and the heady decades that followed, saw writers, rock stars and eccentrics flock to the city's 800-plus cafés. Two must-visit spots: Cafe Hafa (Ave Hadi Mohammed Tazi), overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar, was a favorite hangout of Tangier's most famous expat, writer and composer Paul Bowles. Smoky and slightly edgy, Cafe Baba (1 rue Sidi-Hosni) is the coolest spot in the Kasbah. A photo of Keith Richards, kif-pipe in hand, still adorns the grimy walls. Most mosques are off-limits to non-Muslims . Nearly 99% of the population is Muslim, and hearing the muezzin's melodic call to prayer for the first time is a spine-tingling moment. While very few Moroccan mosques are open to non-Muslims, one exception is the towering Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca (Blvd Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdallah; +212 522 22 25 63). Located on a promontory over the Atlantic Ocean, the mosque was completed in 1993 and can hold 105,000 worshipers inside and out. Tradition and technology sit side by side, with colorful zellij (mosaic tiles), intricate stucco and carved cedar complementing the retractable roof and heated flooring. If you can't make it to Casa, Marrakech's 16th-century Ali ben Youssef madrassa-turned-museum (Pl Ben Youssef; +212 524 44 18 93) is open to all and also features impressive Islamic design. Multilingual Moroccans will put you to shame . Moroccans switch languages mid-sentence, reflecting the cultures -- Berber, Arab, French and Spanish -- that have crisscrossed the country. Arabic is the official language, and you'll hear the Moroccan dialect, Darija, spoken on the street. French continues to be widely spoken in cities; foreigners are often addressed in this first. Spanish is still spoken in Tangier. There are also three main dialects spoken by the country's Berber majority: Tashelhit, Tamazight and Tarifit. You'll be able to get by with English in the main tourist hubs, although ""La, shukran"" (""No, thank you"" in Arabic) is one phrase to master. Don't get stuck in Marrakech . Marrakech is justifiably popular, but there's so much more. Fez tops the list for its maze-like medina, fabulous foodie scene and annual Festival of World Sacred Music. For a slice of the Sahara, there's the desert town of Merzouga, near the impressive Erg Chebbi sand dunes, accessible via camel treks. Active types can hike between Berber villages in the High Atlas or head to the blue-hued Andalusian town of Chefchaouen to explore the Rif Mountains. Beach bums will love laid-back Essaouira and Sidi Ifni on the Atlantic coast, while surfers often head south to Taghazout. For quiet contemplation, Morocco's holiest town, Moulay Idriss, is hard to beat. Plus, you'll have the nearby Roman ruins of Volubilis pretty much to yourself. If you don't like cumin, you may starve . Cumin is one of the main spices used in Moroccan cooking. This pungent powder is used to flavor everything from tagines to mechoui (slow-roasted lamb). Cumin is used as a condiment on most Moroccan tables, along with salt and chili. It's also a popular natural remedy for diarrhea. ""Cumin has anti-parasitical properties, so if you've got an upset tummy, a spoonful of cumin knocked back with water will help,"" said food guide Gail Leonard with Plan-It Fez. Trains are cheap, comfortable and reliable . Train company ONCF operates one of the best train networks in Africa, making it the easiest way to travel between cities. It's worth paying extra for first class, which comes with a reserved seat and A/C. First class carriages have six-seat compartments or open-plan seating. Stock up on snacks, or buy them onboard, as it's customary to share food. When it comes to traveling to smaller towns and villages, buses and grand taxis, usually old Mercedes sedans that can seat six (at a squash), are best. Couscous is served on Fridays . You'll see it on every restaurant menu, but traditionally, couscous is served on Fridays, when families gather after prayers. This is because the proper (not packet) stuff takes a long time to prepare. Coarse semolina is hand-rolled into small granules to be steamed and fluffed three times. It's pale in color, deliciously creamy and served with vegetables and/or meat or fish. Bread is the staple carb and is served with every meal, except couscous. It's baked in communal wood-fired ovens, one of five amenities found in every neighborhood (the others being a hammam, or bathhouse; a drinking fountain; a mosque and a preschool). Riad rooftops rock . The traditional Moroccan house (riad) is built around a central courtyard with windows facing inwards for privacy. They're decked out with elaborate zellij, stucco and painted cedar and are easily the most atmospheric places to stay. While Moroccans tend to use their rooftops as clotheslines, a riad roof terrace is the place to be come sunset. In Marrakech, Italian-designed Riad Joya (Derb El Hammam, Mouassine Quarter; +212 524 391 624; www.riadjoya.com) has prime views of the Koutoubia Mosque minaret, while five-star La Sultana (403 rue de la Kasbah; +212 524 388 008; www.ghotw.com/la-sultana) overlooks the Atlas Mountains. Top picks in Fez are the bohemian Riad Idrissy (13 Derb Idrissi, Sieje, Sidi Ahmed Chaoui, +212 649 191 410; www.riadidrissy.com) and its suntrap terrace, while Dar Roumana (30 Derb el Amer, Zkak Roumane; +212 535 741 637; www.darroumana.com) has sweeping views of the world's largest living medieval Islamic city. When you hear 'balak!' watch out . Morocco's souks are not for the faint-hearted. The narrow streets teem with hagglers, hustlers, mule-drivers and motor scooters. Rule No. 1 is to step aside when you hear ""Balak!"" It means there's a heavily laden handcart or mule bearing down on you. You'll inevitably get lost, as maps don't usually include the warren of small alleys that make up the medina. A guide can help you get your bearings and fend off touts, but be aware that anything you buy will have his commission built in to the price. Alternatively, taking snaps of landmarks with your smartphone can help you find your way back to your accommodation. It's not weird to be bathed by a stranger . There are plenty of posh hotel hammams, but nothing beats a visit to a no-frills public bathhouse. Spotting the entrance can be tricky, as most signs are written in Arabic. Look for a shop selling toiletries or a mosque, as these are usually nearby. It's advisable to stock up on black olive oil soap, ghassoul (clay used as hair conditioner), a kiis (exfoliating glove) and a mat to sit on. Visitors need to take their own towels, comb and flip-flops. Women strip to their knickers (no bra), and men wear underpants. Then you'll be steamed, scrubbed and pummeled until you're squeaky clean.","Cafés are where Moroccan men socialize, gathering to drink sweet mint tea .

"There's something strange about seeing Sylvester Stallone get deep and thoughtful. It's like sitting through one of those plays where prisoners perform Shakespeare -- it's just unexpected. Likewise, the side of Sly on show in his new art exhibit at The State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, is far from the pages of People. Dealing with themes like triumph, failure and chaos, Stallone reveals himself as a man who's more than just a gruff, muscled hero out to beat the odds, but someone who's emotional and even intellectual. Stallone is just starting to unleash his paintings on the world. His first exhibition was in Switzerland in 2011. Apparently, Stallone's been painting for nearly 50 years -- even before he started acting. The exhibition -- which includes three dozen paintings -- describes painting as his first love. But, an introduction reads, ""due to financial problems, he had to become an actor."" Because that's the first thing you do if you're poor: act. Russia's 10 ritziest hotels . 'Never Ever Land' Stallone's work is influenced by abstract expressionism. It's as if emotion is thrown onto the canvasses in red (Stallone's favorite color, according to the museum), black and yellow. Each painting lives in its own world, like ""Never Ever Land,"" 2010, where Stallone paints the downfall of Michael Jackson, who's life is collapsing around him as he's dressed in his iconic 1990s military jacket, with strands of black hair draped over his face. Beyond the recurrent self-portraits of himself as his legendary ""Rocky"" character bleeding in a boxing ring, there are also more whimsical paintings, including one in which Stallone scrawled phrases like ""Time, Billy Bob,"" ""The Arts Endure You"" and ""Whores."" Celebrity status . When it comes to modern art, Stallone is no Andy Warhol -- though the exhibit does feature photos Warhol took of his friend Stallone. Many of the visitors crowding into the museum's narrow halls say they never knew Stallone painted. They come because they're fans of his movies, like 20-year-old Daniel Schneider, visiting from Moscow. ""He's very popular. So many people have seen his films in Russia."" But that's about as far as Stallone's talent goes, he says. ""It's not good. But there are some interesting elements."" St. Petersburg: Best sights in city of tsars . Others have a more imaginative view of Stallone the painter. ""I think it's a new system for Sylvester Stallone to explain his creativity,"" says Italian tourist Maiolino Alessandro. Russian communists don't like his art though. They unsuccessfully protested the opening of the exhibition because of Stallone's role in ""Rambo,"" in which he goes on a communist-killing crusade. Expect the unexpected . Even if you don't enjoy Stallone's work, on- or off-screen, it may be worth the visit if only to see the Italian Stallion in a different light. The exhibition runs through January 13. The State Russian Museum, St. Michael's Castle, 2 Sadovaya Street, and The Marble Palace, 5/1 Millionnaya Street, St. Petersburg, Russia; +7 812 313 41 12; open Wednesday-Sunday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m., Monday, 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; tickets for adults RUB 300 ($9.91), students RUB 150 ($4.95) 40 years since death: Bruce Lee exhibition .","Stallone exhibition runs until January 13 in St. Petersburg, Russia .

"Resource rich and home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies, the stage is set for Africa to become the world's next industrial juggernaut. But making this dream a reality remains a major challenge. A lack of railways, ports and quality roads has hindered Africa's development in recent years. But today, economic heavyweights such as China and India are pumping billions of dollars into Africa to transform the continent's fortunes and stake a claim in the world's next high-growth territory. And last month, the African Development Bank and the Africa Foundation launched a fundraising initiative for Africa50, a project aimed at speeding up infrastructure ventures on the continent. Here, CNN takes a look at some of the big projects set to take Africa by storm. Tell us what you think about them in the comments section below. Great Inga Dam -- Democratic Republic of the Congo . Potentially the world's largest hydroelectric dam, the Great Inga is a project to tame the mighty Congo River and provide much-needed renewable energy for up to 500 million Africans. With work scheduled to begin in October 2015, it's claimed the Great Inga would produce 40,000 megawatts (MW) of energy, that's twice as much as China's Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest. Read this: DR Congo's mega dam ambitions . In May, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo announced the first phase of its grandiose plan, a $12 billion development, dubbed Inga 3, which will produce 4,800 MW. World Bank estimates suggest that just 11.1% of DRC's population has access to electricity. But with the whole project estimated to cost $80 billion, analysts says that raising funds will be a challenge. Mombasa -- Kampala -- Kigali railway project -- Kenya/Uganda/Rwanda . Stretching almost 3,000 kilometers and connecting three East African countries, the Mombasa-Kigali railway could be the continent's answer to the Orient Express. Starting in Kenya's second city with a stop-off at the Ugandan capital, Kampala, the rail line will circumvent Lake Victoria before heading for its final destination of Kigali, Rwanda. With work scheduled to start on the Mombasa-Nairobi section next month, the whole project is due to be completed by March 2018 with an estimated cost of $13.5 billion. Konza City -- Kenya . Konza City is a $9.2 billion dollar technology and financial metropolis project located southeast of Nairobi. Dubbed the ""African Silicon Savannah"" the project is part of ""Vision 2030,"" the Kenyan government's plan to improve the quality of life for its citizens. Read this: Ghana plans $10 billion tech city . The government expects the city to provide 100,000 jobs and will include a business district, a university, residential areas and city parks. But the state will provide only 5% of the funding, with the rest expected to come through land leases to private companies. Ethio-Djibouti railway -- Ethiopia/Djibouti . This 650-kilometer railway will link up the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and the Port of Doraleh in the small Red Sea nation of Djibouti. The project is part of the Ethiopian government's Growth and Transformation plan and is set to cost $1.2 billion, according to estimates from consultancy KMPG. Djibouti represents Ethiopia's only seaport access and would significantly reduce the cost of goods and transportation for the landlocked country. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam -- Ethiopia . Ethiopia's 'under construction' renaissance dam is set to be as grand on scale as it is in name. Scheduled to be completed by July 2017, the enormous barrier will cost the Ethiopian government $4.7 billion and is being assembled by Italian engineering firm Salini Costruttori. The Renaissance Dam will sit on the Blue Nile river in the Benishangul-Gumuz region. Creating 12,000 jobs and generating 6,000 MW of energy, the dam will also serve neighboring Sudan and Egypt, which both rely of the Nile River's water resources. The project has caused controversy in Sudan and Egypt, as both countries are concerned the dam will give Ethiopia control over the flow of water. Jasper project -- South Africa . Once completed, the Jasper Power Project will be a 96 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in South Africa's Northern Cape -- one of the biggest solar installations in the continent. In May this year, Internet giant Google, which has spent more than $1 billion in renewable energy projects in the United States and Europe in recent years, made a $12 million investment in the scheme. The project will create 300 construction jobs and 50 permanent operational jobs, according to the South African Department of Energy. Read more: 'Solar sisters' spreading light in Africa . The joint venture is part of South Africa's ambitious target of generating 18 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy by 2030 and reducing its dependency on coal. Other African countries are also following the solar craze. Earlier this year, Mauritania, in West Africa, launched what's described as Africa's biggest solar PV plant so far, a 15 MW solar PV plant that will supply energy to nearly 10,000 homes. Lagos Metro Blue Line . A major cosmopolitan transport project to connect Nigeria's largest city, the Lagos Metro Blue Line is designed to ease congestion and speed up journey times for the city's inhabitants. The Blue Line will run between Marina and Okokomaiko stopping at 13 stations and is part of the Lagos Rail Mass Transit program implemented by the government. Read this: Lagos of the future . However, funding issues mean the Blue Line launch has been pushed back to 2015. The Line is set to cost $1.2 billion and will be funded by the Lagos State Government. Rail operator Eko Rail has a 25-year contract to run and maintain the service.","Great Inga Dam, Congo, could become the world's largest hydroelectric dam .

"(CNN)More than a week after the Paris terror attacks and with an investigation in full swing, the evidence points to an international conspiracy by militants to bring terror to the streets of France's capital. There are reports of a new accomplice, in addition to the three gunmen killed by French authorities and the widow of one, who escaped. There's a money trail that points to Yemen and a cache of weapons reportedly found in an apartment. This all comes as a nation continues to mourn and Parisians flock to newsstands in support of the satirical magazine targeted by the terrorists. Everyone seems to want a piece of history. Three million copies of Charlie Hebdo's first edition since the terrorist attacks flew off newsstand racks Wednesday. Another million or so went on sale Thursday. The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying as he holds a sign saying ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie,"" beneath the headline ""All is forgiven.""  This run of the magazine could reach 5 million copies. Some have criticized the magazine's decision to depict Mohammed, however, since this is deeply offensive to many Muslims. The government of Jordan condemned the move Thursday, saying that continuing to publish ""offensive drawings"" of Mohammed would ""hurt the feelings of the Muslim communities everywhere."" This irresponsible act ""does not represent the freedom of expression, which is based on the foundation of the responsibility and the respect of religions,"" its statement added. Freedom of expression is a right, but there are limits when it comes to insulting faiths, Pope Francis told reporters Thursday, referring to events surrounding the Charlie Hebdo attacks. ""One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith,"" Francis said on a flight from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to the Philippines. Likewise, he said, people have religious liberty, but ""one can't kill in the name of God."" He said this after a reporter asked him about religious liberty and freedom of expression. Francis noted that the reporter was French, and he framed his answer with the Paris attacks: ""You are French? Let's (reference) Paris, let's speak clearly."" Pakistan's National Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the publication of a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed by Charlie Hebdo, Pakistan's Dawn News reported. The resolution also calls on the European Union, the United Nations community and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation take steps to prevent the publishing of such material, according to the report. Pakistan joins other predominantly Muslim countries whose leaders have spoken out against Charlie Hebdo for its latest publication. Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif ""said that freedom of speech should not be used to hurt the religious sentiments of any community"" and that the world should discourage the ""publication of provocative material."" More funerals for victims of the violence were held Thursday. They included ceremonies for policeman Franck Brinsolaro, Charlie Hebdo cartoonists Bernard ""Tignous"" Verlhac and Georges Wolinski, and columnist and psychoanalyst Elsa Cayat. All were killed in last week's attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices. Magazine staffers and contributors were gathered for an editorial meeting when, authorities said, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into the newsroom and gunned down staffers, killing 12 and wounding 11. One positive story emerged from Friday's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in Paris, just two days after the Charlie Hebdo rampage. It was that of Lassana Bathily, a Malian Muslim immigrant and supermarket employee who said he helped some hostages into a walk-in freezer at the store while it was under attack. On Thursday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said France would grant him French citizenship, according to a statement. The French government expedited Bathily's application, which he filed in July 2014. Cazeneuve himself will conduct the citizenship ceremony on January 20. Nearly 300,000 signatures have been added to a Change.org petition calling for Bathily to receive French citizenship and France's prestigious Legion of Honor award. In a speech at the Arab World Institute, French President Francois Hollande said that Muslims"" are the first victims of fanaticism, fundamentalism and intolerance"" and that Islam was compatible with democracy. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Wednesday for tCharlie Hebdo shooting. The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. For days, intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the Kouachi brothers, the gunmen who attacked the magazine, met him on trips to Yemen -- a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim. What is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? Al-Ansi praised the magazine attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo's depictions of Mohammed. U.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they weren't ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. AQAP did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it. ""It was a blessing from Allah"" that the store siege, in which four hostages were killed, took place about the same time, al-Ansi said. French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice, a man from a Paris suburb, may have driven gunman Amedy Coulibaly to the kosher supermarket, where Coulibaly later shot dead four people. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. The Kouachi brothers also are dead. But investigators' efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week's attacks are continuing. Le Parisien's report said investigators identified Coulibaly's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Neighbors told CNN the apartment, in the Paris suburb of Gentilly, was raided Saturday by police. Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also think the suspected accomplice may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week -- an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report. Le Parisien says Coulibaly's suspected accomplice, whom the newspaper did not name, may have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow, may have played a role in the attacks and has fled to Syria. Coulibaly and Boumeddiene drove from France to Madrid on December 31, a Spanish source close to the nation's security sources told CNN. Coulibaly remained until January 2, when he returned to France, while Boumeddiene flew that same day from Madrid to Istanbul, the source said. Spanish security authorities are investigating what Coulibaly and Boumeddiene did while in Madrid, and are trying to determine where they stayed, whom they had contact with, and whether they had any support in Spain. Eyup Serbest, a reporter for Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper, said that on January 5, two days before the Charlie Hebdo attack, police searched the hotel where Boumeddiene stayed in Kadikoy, Istanbul. Police took all the digital registration records on the hotel's computer, including video recordings within the hotel. Belgian federal prosecutors told CNN on Thursday that a man is under arrest in Charleroi in connection with arms trafficking. They said he recently bought a car from Boumeddiene. Prosecutors said the man was ""known to police"" but couldn't be directly linked to Coulibaly. According to Belgian media, the man went to police after learning about last week's shootings. They then searched his house and found documents that matched the type of gun Coulibaly used in Paris. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details of the raid on the man's home or the documents found, after contacting police. U.S. officials have told CNN it's believed that when Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011, he returned carrying money from AQAP earmarked to carry out the attack. Investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as $20,000, but the exact amount has not been verified. French newspaper La Voix du Nord reports that Coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket. He got the loan for $7,000 (6,000 euros) from the Cofidis Bank in Villeneuve d'Ascq, in northern France. The paper reported the amount that Coulibaly borrowed was not high enough to require an explanation of how the money would be spent. He took out the loan in December. U.S. President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron are expected to discuss the Paris attacks when they meet Thursday and Friday in Washington. The two leaders pledged to safeguard ""our way of life"" in a jointly written opinion piece for the Times of London. ""We will continue to stand together against those who threaten our values and our way of life,"" they said in Thursday's edition. ""Along with our French allies, we have made clear to those who think they can muzzle freedom of speech and expression with violence that our voices will only grow louder."" With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism, the Justice Ministry said. It's unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks and Facebook posts, the ministry said. Investigation: The key people, places and questions . CNN's Al Goodman, Dheepthika Laurent, Holly Yan, Salma Abdelaziz, Pierre Meilhan, Pamela Brown, Tim Lister, Vasco Cotovio, Daniel Burke, Barbara Starr, Greg Botelho, Hande Atay, Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","Report: Pakistani legislators condemn Charlie Hebdo over latest cover .

"Director Spike Lee issued an apology Wednesday night to a Florida couple who had to leave their home after he retweeted a message that erroneously listed their address as belonging to George Zimmerman. ""I Deeply Apologize To The McClain Family For Retweeting Their Address,"" Lee tweeted. ""It Was A Mistake. Please Leave The McClain's In Peace. Justice In Court"" Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who claimed he killed teenager Trayvon Martin in self-defense last month, lives more than 4 miles from David and Elaine McClain. He is reported to be in hiding. The McClains moved into a hotel room after the retweets. ""We got out of the house. It is just too scary,"" Elaine McClain told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday before the Lee apology. ""We've got to quit the hatred and the vengeance and start looking on the inside of people and quit looking on the outside of people. It is just sad the reactions that have been going on."" She told CNN Orlando affiliate WKMG that her youngest son has the last name of Zimmerman and the middle name George. The couple told the station they received a letter addressed to George Zimmerman on Monday. On the back was a reference to Skittles. Outcry mounts in Trayvon Martin case . Zimmerman fatally shot Martin, 17, on February 26 as the teen was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford.

"The steady drumbeat of preparations for some sort of a U.S. strike in Syria is stirring up old anxieties. Americans have no appetite for another military campaign in a foreign land. Syria feels far away; a tragedy, no doubt, but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention, it is simply too removed, too complicated, too foreign to view as an American problem. Military action, the skeptics rightly say, has consequences, often unpredictable ones. But so does inaction. Inaction is more dangerous -- potentially riskier and costlier -- than smart, limited intervention.  Syria may seem far away, but every passing day, every calamitous, explosive, hate-infused day, makes it more America's -- and the world's -- problem. Here are five reasons why: . 1) Other dictators are watching: When the president of the United States says the use of chemical weapons is a ""red line,"" other dangerous regimes pay very close attention to see what he means. If that line is crossed -- as is gruesomely visible in Syria -- and nothing happens, it sends a clear signal to current and future powers that may threaten American interests and fundamental international norms. The message that America's warnings can be ignored, that the international community's warnings can be disregarded, is most welcome in places like Iran and North Korea, whose pursuits of weapons are a threat not just to the United States but to the entire world. Syria: Chemical weapons -- how did we get here? 2) Chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds: More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria. That alone should stir the conscience of humanity. But there is something uniquely dangerous about the introduction of chemical weapons.  Horrified by the effects of chemical weapons in the battlefield, nations have come together over the years to develop international bans on nerve gases, blister agents, blood agents and choking agents. The Syrian government, by all appearances, used nerve gas to kill hundreds of its own citizens. If it passes without a response, this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield. Chemical weapons are not only appealing to dictators refusing to relinquish power, but they also could make an appearance in other wars, and they are ideal for terrorist groups seeking to inflict maximum fear. Gingrich: Stay out of Syria's civil war . 3) The war is spreading, the choices are worsening: The United States has largely kept its distance in the Syrian civil war. Two years ago, President Obama declared that President Bashar al-Assad must go. A year ago, he drew his famous red line. But any hope that the situation would somehow resolve itself has only produced the worst possible outcome. The U.S. should have provided material and logistical help to the more moderate among the rebels early on. Failure to do so resulted in today's terrible dearth of good choices, in which America wants al-Assad to fall, but the opposition is  dominated by extremist jihadists, some of them affiliated with al Qaeda. In the meantime, the war is bursting beyond Syrian borders. Millions of Syrians have fled their homes, straining resources and occasionally raining fire into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and even Israel. The war threatens to engulf the region. The Middle East remains the most explosive region of the world. It produces a big portion of oil supplies and it lies at the crossroads of global commerce. This is the last place to allow a wildfire to spread before trying to affect its direction and ultimately extinguish it. Opinion: Why Western intervention in Syria will leave chaos . 4) Inaction will hand a victory to al-Assad, Iran and Hezbollah: The Obama administration is telegraphing an attack against Syria aimed at punishing al-Assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war. But the course of the war matters. Without forceful American action, al-Assad's latest maneuvers constitute a victory for his regime and its top allies, Iran and Hezbollah.  Giving a boost to this alliance runs counter to regional and global peace and stability. Iran and Hezbollah have a nefarious track record. They have carried out a wave of terrorist attacks in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Just last week  a judge in Thailand sentenced an Iranian man to life in prison for his role in a terrorist plot against Israeli diplomats in Bangkok. Iranian and Hezbollah agents have been implicated in terrorist plots in Argentina, Cyprus, Bulgaria, India and elsewhere. Even if you don't care about Syria or the Middle East, handing a victory to this dangerous threesome should worry everyone. 'Red line' debate: Chemical weapons worse than attacks? 5) A new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy: The war in Syria has raged for 2½ years. During that time, it has descended into ever greater levels of brutality and carnage. It has also become increasingly sectarian. It all started as a peaceful uprising demanding a dictator step down and allow a democratic government representing the different religions and ethnicities in Syria. It is now a hate-filled maelstrom of Sunnis, Shiites, Allawites, Christians, Kurds and others. People are being killed based on their community of origin. This is how you create hatreds that burn through the ages, enduring for generations of revenge-seeking, and triggering new wars. The longer this fire rages, the more likely its sparks will start new fires, far into the future. The United States and its friends should strike al-Assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that America's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle. Beyond that, Washington should do what it should have done long ago. Without sending any U.S. troops into Syria, the United States and its allies should find and strengthen the more moderate members of the opposition so they will gain the upper hand against extremists within opposition ranks. Then they can remove al-Assad from power by wining what is, most assuredly, their war, the Syrians' war, but one that is of great consequence to America and to the rest of the world.","Frida Ghitis: U.S. inaction in Syria is risky; the situation endangers the world .

"(CNN)Lake Urmia, in northwest Iran, once bore the weight of a ton of people. The extreme salinity of what used to be the largest lake in the Middle East allowed people to swim and relax without sinking. Over the last 20 years, however, the salt lake has almost completely dried up along with the area's agriculture and economy. According to the United Nations Development Program, the lake has shrunk by two-thirds since 1997 due to Iran's water crisis and detrimental agricultural policies. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged $5 billion to fix the problem over the next 10 years, but can this buoyant wetland rebound? That's the hope of Meysam Mir Zendehdel, a documentary photographer from Tehran, Iran. In 2013, Zendehdel took a trip to the lake with some friends. At the time, he had heard stories of the lake's dissipation, but it was not until he witnessed it that he grasped the true devastation of the ecosystem. ""After seeing it, I found it an environmental and social disaster,"" he said. ""It was a tragedy."" Zendehdel said it was a calling for him to document the dying lake and its effect on the community -- a photography project he said he will never finish. Abandoned ships and wooden planks are just some of the random remains that tell us water was once in abundance here. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The surrounding residential complexes and children's playgrounds are now full of salt and dust and memories of a once-bustling neighborhood. Bleak and austere, the atmosphere appears completely desolate. Some people still live there, according to Zendehdel, but most moved out to neighboring villages after their farms were depleted. ""When you walk on dried crystal of salt, in the absolute silence, you hear just the sound of cracking salt crystal. You remember that the sound of water in this area had been people's life, and it's very disappointing that that silence of the lake has silenced the life,"" Zendehdel said. Like the washed-up boat in Urmia Lake, Zendehdel's passion to document the drought is strikingly clear. ""I believe that it is my duty to show realities and facts, and the judge is up to audiences,"" he said. Meysam Mir Zendehdel is a documentary photographer from Tehran, Iran.

"Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Tuesday rescinded punishments against four players in the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. The ruling overturned a decision made in October by Roger Goodell, the current commissioner, against Jonathan Vilma, Anthony Hargrove, Will Smith and Scott Fujita. SI: Goodell the big loser here . Under the bounty program, Tagliabue wrote, Saints players were given incentives during the 2009 through 2011 seasons to render opposing players unable to play. They were called ""cartoffs"" and ""knockouts."" In addition, it was alleged that the Saints offered a bounty for injuring Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre during the NFC Championship game in January 2010. In October, after he upheld suspensions, Goodell appointed Tagliabue to review player appeals. In his 18-page order, Tagliabue found that Fujita's actions ""were not conduct detrimental"" and vacated a one-game suspension imposed by Goodell. Tagliabue wrote that Fujita ""did not participate in the program including cartoffs and knockouts and that his participation in a 'non-injury' pay-for-performance pool is typically subject only to club discipline."" Tagliabue found that Hargrove, Smith and Vilma engaged in ""conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football,"" but ordered their punishments also be rescinded. Read Tagliabue's ruling (PDF) Hargrove had been suspended for seven games but was credited with having served five. Goodell found that Hargrove falsely answered an NFL investigator's questions about the misconduct. But Tagliabue said it was not clear Hargrove lied about the program and noted that he was ""under tremendous pressure to follow the chain of command in order to keep his job."" Tagliabue concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Hargrove's alleged misconduct merited a suspension. Peter King: Ruling points finger at Saints brass . Goodell had suspended Smith for four games after finding he gave money to the program. But Tagliabue said Smith was being singled out unfairly because he was a team captain. ""On the present record, selective prosecution of allegations of misconduct and enforcement of discipline relative to Smith cannot be sustained,"" Tagliabue wrote. ""Whatever the reason for such selective enforcement, it does not satisfy basic requirements for consistent treatment of player employees similarly situated."" Goodell had found that Vilma offered a bounty to any Saints player who could knock Favre out of the 2010 championship game and suspended him for the entire 2012 season. But Tagliabue nixed that suspension, too, saying it was not clear that any such pledges were made seriously. ""Was it inspirational only?"" he asked. ""Was it typical 'trash talk' that occurs regularly before games? The parties presented no clear answers."" Tagliabue wrote reducing the suspensions to fines could be justified in the cases of Hargrove, Smith and Vilma. ""However ... this entire case has been contaminated by the coaches and others in the Saints' organization,"" he wrote. After the order was released, Saints quarterback Drew Brees took to Twitter: ""Congratulations to our players for having the suspensions vacated. Unfortunately, there are some things that can never be taken back,"" he wrote. Are athletes who speak their minds out of bounds? In a statement, the NFL noted that the matter had been reviewed by Goodell, two collective bargaining agreement grievance arbitrators, the Collective Bargaining Appeals Panel and now Tagliabue. ""The decisions have made clear that the Saints operated a bounty program in violation of league rules for three years, that the program endangered player safety, and that the commissioner has the authority under the CBA to impose discipline for those actions as conduct detrimental to the league,"" the league said. ""Strong action was taken in this matter to protect player safety and ensure that bounties would be eliminated from football."" October: Goodell upholds suspensions . In a statement, the NFL Players Association, the union, said it was pleased with the decision. ""Vacating all discipline affirms the players' unwavering position that all allegations the league made about their alleged 'intent to injure' were utterly and completely false. We are happy for our members."" Vilma's lawyer, Peter R. Ginsberg, accused Goodell of ""trying every conceivable maneuver to avoid real and honest scrutiny of his manufactured allegations that Jonathan Vilma engaged in a bounty program aimed at opposing players."" Though gratified that his client ""no longer needs to worry about facing an unjustified suspension,"" he said Tagliabue's order ""does nothing to rectify the harm done by the baseless allegations lodged against Jonathan.""","Decision by former commissioner overturns current NFL chief .

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old British schoolboy has struck a chord with his eloquent response to actress Emma Watson's United Nations speech encouraging men to join in the fight for gender equality. Ed Holtom's letter, published in the Sunday Telegraph, was praised on social media for demonstrating an understanding of gender issues that many adults today don't fully comprehend. ""If we want equality, it will take more effort than paying women the same as men, or giving women equal opportunities,"" he wrote in his letter supporting Watson. ""We must stop pressuring each other to fit stereotypes which more often than not leaves us feeling repressed and unable to express ourselves. We must not let gender define us."" A student at St. Albans, an all-boy's school in Hertfordshire outside London, Holtom said that boys and girls are unwittingly steered into confining gender roles. ""By using words such as 'girly' or 'manly' we inadvertently buy into gender stereotyping,"" he wrote in the letter. ""We play with toys designed for our gender, we play different sports based on gender, we often go to segregated schools."" Holtom's letter was republished by a handful of news sites and quickly gained traction on social media, where many commenters praised his views as unusually thoughtful for someone his age. Nicholas Pegg, a British actor and writer, called the letter ""magnificent"" and posted a link to it on Twitter. Actor-director Samuel West wrote on Twitter that Holtom ""writes the sort of letter you want to read from today's schoolboys, and tomorrow's men."" Reached Monday via Twitter, Holtom told CNN he is heartened by the response to his words. ""My life hasn't really changed - at the moment things are pretty normal, apart from people giving such great support in response to the letter,"" he said. ""Emma hasn't responded, she doesn't have to. I didn't write it for attention, I just wanted people to know I how I felt."" Watson's impassioned speech, delivered September 20 as part of her role as a goodwill ambassador for UN Women, drew attention for her remarks about the need for equality and for men to embrace feminism. It also prompted a minor backlash, including a threat to leak alleged nude photos of the star. The threat was later revealed to be a hoax. ""Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong,"" Watson told the UN. ""It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals."" In his letter to the Telegraph, Holtom said he agreed with everything Watson said and supports equal rights for women. ""We're lucky to live in a Western world where women can speak out against stereotypes. It's a privilege. Gender equality and feminism is not about 'man-hating' or the idea of 'female supremacy.' It is, by definition, the opposite,"" he wrote. ""The definition of feminism is, 'a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes.' It's pretty simple really, and if you believe in those things, then you're a feminist."" Holtom also wrote in his letter that he was ""disappointed"" by how ignorant some of his classmates were about the gender issues Watson raised in her speech. But in a Twitter message Monday to CNN, he said he hadn't encountered many hard feelings so far from schoolmates. ""My classmates have reacted pretty well, it wasn't really about anyone in particular - but I understand that some people could have misinterpreted it,"" he said. ""Overall, everyone I know has been really nice and supportive, it's great that so many people agree. :)"" .","Schoolboy in UK writes letter defending Emma Watson's speech at the UN .

"Walter Dean Myers, a beloved author of children's books, died on Tuesday following a brief illness, according to the Children's Book Council. He was 76. Myers's career spanned over 45 years, during which he wrote more than 100 books. Some of his best-known work includes ""Monster,"" a fictional 1999 account of an African-American teenager on trial for a felony murder in New York, and ""Fallen Angels,"" a 1988 novel about the Vietnam War. Myers was born in West Virginia but spent much of his teenage life in Harlem. He frequently set his fiction in there, including a picture book titled Harlem. He was also a staunch advocate for diversity in children's literature, arguing for a wider array of representation in a March opinion piece in the New York Times.

"(CNN)President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting a resolution that will grant him authority to use military force against ISIS. In an effort to placate opponents of military intervention in both parties, the administration has hedged the request by including language that restricts ""enduring offensive ground forces"" and limits any intervention to three years. He sent a letter with the request promising Congress that he would not authorize ""long-term, large scale ground combat operations"" as occurred in Iraq or Afghanistan. With that language, he then does ask for authorization to use ground troops. There is no reason not to take Obama at his word with what would be the first authorization for the use of force since 2002 when President George W. Bush requested this to conduct strikes against Iraq. Obama has usually been hesitant to use large-scale force unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the nation's interest, and he has shown a clear preference for other methods of combatting terrorism -- from the use of targeted drone air wars to diplomatic initiatives. Obama, who came into office railing against Bush's use of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which he has drawn down, is not eager to jump into another major conflict. Yet the history of these kinds of resolutions should give Congress pause. For a start, lawmakers will have to be extraordinarily vigilant in how they word the resolution and make very clear the kind of limits that they want to impose, and to live by. The reality is that even when presidents have promised to use limited force, the nature of foreign conflict has a logic of its own. Pressure can escalate to support intervention. Within the United States, the dynamics of politics can drive both parties toward a more hawkish stand, relying on the most liberal interpretation of the war powers that had formally been granted. ""What does it mean,"" asked Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, about the term ""enduring offensive ground operations? How long, how big is 'enduring'? 'Offensive', what's 'offensive' when it comes to the Department of Defense?"" We have seen this dynamic repeatedly in recent American history. Most famously, we saw Lyndon Johnson approach Congress in August 1964 to request a resolution authorizing the use of force in response to alleged communist attacks against U.S. Navy ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. Back then, Johnson sent word to members, through Sen. William Fulbright of Arkansas, that he only wanted power to deal with this specific incident. Fulbright told fellow senators that if Johnson wanted to do anything bigger he would return to Capitol Hill to request their support. That's not how the war unfolded. Just as Harry Truman had seen with the conflict in Korea, Johnson kept steadily escalating the military presence in a conflict that would consume his presidency. And while there were a number of legislators who stood up against the war, warning that it was a mistake and threatening to use budgetary power to stop the President, the conflict proved extraordinarily difficult to control. Indeed, far more legislators gave their support to the operation once it had started. Proponents of the war in both parties did a good job of isolating opponents of the war as dangerous, unpatriotic radicals who were not willing to support the fight against communism. The strength of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army, meanwhile, constantly created pressure to intensify the conflict. The same dynamics were at work even when presidents did exercise restraint. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush asked for support to employ force to remove Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces from Kuwait. In that case, in the short term, the elder Bush lived up to his word and ended the mission once it was complete. The problem was that the dynamics of the region created ongoing pressure for military intervention. Once the United States had formally announced that Hussein was a threat, it was difficult to ignore the continued provocations, and when Hussein continued to violate U.N. resolutions, there was ongoing pressure to employ force. The continued presence of troops in the region after Operation Desert Storm, meanwhile, triggered intense animosity that helped fuel the creation and spread of al Qaeda. After 9/11, President George W. Bush sought war power to combat the forces that had been responsible for the horrendous attacks. Initially, this was the focus. But that quickly escalated. First Congress passed a resolution in 2001 granting Bush sweeping wartime powers, a resolution that Obama's current request would leave in place even if many critics have argued that it has been used far too liberally. In 2002, Bush built on this to seek a resolution using force against Iraq. Similarly congressional-approved counterterrorism surveillance programs would be used in the same fashion. While it's not always the case, wars can often get bigger and bigger -- so-called mission creep. If Congress is not extraordinarily careful with how it crafts the resolution, initial authority can quickly become the basis for ongoing, large-scale and prolonged intervention -- far beyond what legislators originally intended. All this means that when the president sends such a request to Congress, legislators in both parties should take seriously their responsibility to ensure that the language is as tight as possible and that their intentions are clear. They should also use this moment to revisit the 2001 authorization. And once they have done all this? That's when the toughest part begins. Because that is when Congress will have to live by its initial word and push back against any efforts to expand the mission in ways that go beyond the scope of the authorization. That will be much easier said than done.","President Obama has sent military force request to Congress .

"Lille, France (CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn conceded Wednesday that his approach to sex is rougher than that of most men, as he took the stand for a second day in his trial in France on aggravated pimping charges. His words followed testimony from two sex workers about his behavior at sex parties he's accused of organizing or encouraging in Europe and the United States. He denies knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes. One, named only as Mounia R., told the court in the northern French city of Lille that Strauss-Kahn had ""brutal"" sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid. A second, named as Jade, told the court that she had been subjected to an ""unsolicited"" sexual act by Strauss-Kahn -- who's commonly known by his initials, DSK -- after going to a party at the Tantra sex club in Belgium. ""Through this trial, I am discovering that my sexuality is perhaps rougher than most men's sexuality. If some women don't like it, it's their right. But my behavior is the same with all women,"" Strauss-Kahn said. Strauss-Kahn, who was married to French TV journalist Anne Sinclair until their divorce in 2013, has never denied that he took part in the parties. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved. Both Mounia R. and Jade are plaintiffs in the case. Jade told the court she had refused to have sex with Strauss-Kahn at the Tantra club, ""because it was a butchery."" He was allegedly on a mattress with 40 people. She later accompanied Strauss-Kahn to his hotel at the request of fellow defendant Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director, she said. It was there that she was subjected to the unwanted sexual act, she told the court through tears. Asked by the judge if she had voiced her refusal, Jade responded that she didn't have time to say anything. Strauss-Kahn didn't ask and she would have said no had he done so, she said. ""Had I been a libertine, he would have asked, this seems obvious,"" she said, using a term that describes someone who is sexually or morally unrestrained. Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes, saying he was told by Paszkowski that they were ""libertines"" who liked sex. She had previously met Strauss-Kahn at a hotel in Paris, Jade said, when he was the only man surrounded by other women in a bed. He did not speak to her but treated her ""like an object, not as a human being."" Asked about Jade's testimony, Strauss-Kahn maintained that he didn't know she was a prostitute, although she mentioned to him that she was performing dances in a swinger club for money. The dances were sometimes followed by sexual acts on stage. Jade later went on a trip to Washington, D.C. as part of a group accompanying Strauss-Kahn, the court heard. She told the judge that she had agreed to go despite his behavior in Belgium because she needed the money -- she was paid 2,000 euros ($2,260) -- and wanted to see the American capital. ""I was there for him, for DSK. I was told so, otherwise why would I go to DC? No one else was in DC, except him!"" she said of the trip. She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said. He approached another woman in the group for sex but was turned down. The court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers, named as Estelle and Marion, who joined a second trip to Washington with Strauss-Kahn. Estelle alleged that Strauss-Kahn had asked to see her without Paszkowski's group and had inquired about her fees. Marion's testimony said that Estelle had told her that. Questioned about this, Strauss-Kahn conceded that he had asked to see Estelle alone but denied speaking of any remuneration. He said that if money was mentioned, it was just to cover her travel expenses. The two women had been introduced to Strauss-Kahn as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, was employed. According to excerpts read out by a magistrate, a witness who was part of that second trip to Washington said he had doubts about the professions of Estelle and Marion after spending time with them. The next day he allegedly told Paszkowski: ""You are not going to make me believe they were secretaries. Never do this again to me!"" Strauss-Kahn: I didn't know there were prostitutes at sex parties . Two women who accompanied Strauss-Kahn on a third trip to Washington said they considered themselves libertines, not prostitutes, but would not turn down a ""present."" The women, named Florence and Hélène, said they worked as an assistant film director and a financial counselor and received payment for the trip. They were not in court Wednesday, but parts of their statements were read aloud by magistrates. Unlike other women in this case, Helene and Florence said they didn't perceive any brutality or deviance at the parties. When asked whether the men of the group knew of their being paid, Helene said, ""Even if things weren't told, and considering their status and intelligence, it would have been too good to be true."" Late Wednesday, a woman named Ines recalled hearing Strauss-Kahn say he ""loathed whores."" That comment came after she wondered aloud about the profession of women at a sex party they'd both attended, Ines said in a statement read in court. Ines, who said she slept with Strauss-Kahn in hopes he'd help her find work in communications, did not attend the hearing. Prosecutors say the operations of the prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille, stretched all the way to New York and Washington. Sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. In questioning Tuesday, Strauss-Kahn acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda. ""But I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever,"" he said, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him. He also spoke of his dislike for prostitution and the risks that he considered using prostitutes would pose in terms of his political ambitions. Prosecutors say Paszkowski and Roquet picked up the bills for the sex parties for their influential friend. The prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing lack of evidence. However, the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations. The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in Lille just over a week ago. He was later cleared of the New York allegations. Before that scandal erupted, he had been on track to run for the French presidency -- an election his Socialist Party later won with Francois Hollande as its candidate. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Lille and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Strauss-Kahn: ""I am discovering that my sexuality is perhaps rougher than most men's""

"(CNN)Faced with sky-high real estate prices in the Chinese capital, one Beijing man has sacrificed his shoe collection to get a foot on the property ladder. The man, identified only by an English name, Mick, pawned 283 pairs of limited edition Nike Air Jordan sneakers in exchange for a $160,000 loan, which he plans to use to cover the down payment for an apartment to share with his new wife, the pawn shop said. Wang Xiaoyu, the vice president of marketing at Beijing World of Pawn Co told CNN that a very small number of the sneakers had been worn but most were in pristine condition, wrapped in their original packaging. It was the first time the company had accepted sports shoes as collateral for a loan and they had to find an expert to evaluate them. He valued the shoes at 2 million yuan ($320,390), but Mick only wanted a loan for 1 million yuan. Mick told local media he started collecting sneakers more than a decade ago when he was 14 years old. An avid basketball fan, he particularly liked watching Michael Jordan matches. One of the most expensive pairs in his collection, valued at 110,000 yuan ($17,600), is a pair featuring the signatures of all the players in the Chicago Bulls team led by Jordan that won the 1993 NBA finals, reports said. Mick said he plans to pay back the loan within two months and reclaim his beloved collection. CNN Beijing Interns Sherry Fei Ju and Harvard Zihao Zhang contributed to this report.","A Chinese man has pawned 283 pairs of limited edition Nike Air Jordan sneakers .

"(CNN)Marsha Bobb spotted Lenny Spence one day in 2005 while she was walking down the aisle of an American Airlines flight from Jamaica to Miami. Lenny was sitting in Marsha's window seat. And she wasn't happy about it. ""I hope I'm not sitting beside him,"" she recalls thinking. Lenny had the opposite thought. ""I saw this beautiful lady, and I thought, 'I hope she's sitting here,' "" he remembers. Lenny was correct -- Marsha was sitting in the same row. Not that he switched seats. Marsha grudgingly took the open center seat. Then her attitude changed. ""He seemed nice and pleasant,"" she says, hoping that someone as well-dressed and well-groomed as Lenny was probably a gentleman. ""I don't think we'd even left the tarmac, and we started talking."" Except for one gap, they've barely stopped since -- through long-distance phone calls, a 2011 wedding and now as parents of two boys. It wasn't love at first sight, however. More like comfort, which developed into a close friendship. After all, they were separated by thousands of miles: Marsha owned her own business in Toronto and Lenny was a long-distance truck driver based in Florida. But they talked -- for hours. Lenny says his phone bills used to be in the four figures. ""My phone bill was like a mortgage,"" he chuckles. ""I would go over my minutes and be calling AT&T and asking, 'Is there any way you could work with me?' "" The friendship appeared to have run its course in 2008. The two lost touch but still thought of one another. For Lenny, Marsha was the ""the girl that got away""; for Marsha, Lenny was a special memory. There was one time when Marsha called Lenny out of the blue and he didn't recognize her voice. And he tried other social media services, including MySpace, hoping to stumble across her. But Facebook put them together again in 2010. ""I sent her a message, and she responded the following day,"" Lenny says. ""Once we started talking again, it was like we picked up where we left off."" ""He didn't waste any time,"" adds Marsha, who says she was in a better place for a relationship. Marsha ended up moving to Florida. They were married 10 months later. What's the secret to their ""fairy tale,"" as Marsha calls it? Trust, honesty and respect, they say. And ""communication is key,"" Marsha adds. She wishes to thank American Airlines, Facebook and AT&T for helping bring them together. Incidentally, they now have an unlimited plan.","Lenny and Marsha Spence met on a plane in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- Douglas McAuthur McCain grew up in the Minneapolis area. Aged 33, he died more than 6,000 miles to the east of his birthplace, fighting in Syria for ISIS, the group that calls itself the ""Islamic State."" ISIS is a group that even al Qaeda has rejected, in part, for its reprehensible tactics, which run to public crucifixions. McCain's transformation to a militant jihadist left his family ""devastated,"" his uncle, Ken McCain, told CNN. McCain is the first American known to have been killed while fighting for ISIS. But he is not the only American drawn to the group or to al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, the al-Nusra Front. In May 2014, Moner Abu-Salha, a 22-year-old American citizen from Florida, conducted a suicide bombing on behalf of Nusra. Abu-Salha had reportedly re-entered the United States after he received training from the group in Syria and before returning to the conflict. Abu-Salha is the first American suicide bomber known to have died in Syria. Some 100 other Americans are believed to have either fought in Syria since 2011 or been arrested before they could get there. According to a count by the New America Foundation, eight of these individuals have been indicted for traveling, attempting to travel, or facilitating the travel of others to fight with ISIS or the al-Nusra Front. Some of these cases involved those who tried to join ISIS or Nusra, but were arrested before they could leave the States: . • Abdella Tounisi, an 18-year-old American citizen from Aurora, Illinois, was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to Nusra. On April 19, 2013, he was caught in a sting operation and said that he had no combat skills to speak of: ""Concerning my fighting skills, to be honest, I do not have any."" Tounisi pleaded not guilty and awaits trial. • Basit Sheikh, a North Carolina man, was arrested in November 2013 at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina while allegedly trying to fly to Lebanon in order to join Nusra. He awaits trial. • Nicholas Teausant, a 20-year-old from California, was arrested in March 2014 while allegedly traveling to join ISIS. Teausant pleaded not guilty and awaits trial. • Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old Denver woman, was arrested in April 2014 and charged with attempting to provide material support to ISIS. She awaits trial. • Adam Dandach, a 20-year-old Orange County man, was arrested at John Wayne Airport while allegedly attempting to travel to join ISIS. Dandach was charged with lying about needing a passport replacement to conceal that the real reason he needed to replace his passport was that his mother had hidden his original passport to prevent his travel. He awaits trial. • In December, Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, an American citizen from southern California, pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to provide material support to al Qaeda. Between December 2012 and April 2013, Nguyen had traveled to Syria, where, he stated, he fought alongside Nusra. On his return, Nguyen discussed with an informant his intent to participate further in jihad. • In August 2013, Gufran Mohammed, a naturalized American citizen living in Saudi Arabia, was charged with attempting to provide material support to Nusra in Syria by facilitating the recruitment of experienced fighters from al Qaeda's Somali affiliate to travel to Syria. • Michael Todd Wolfe, a 23-year-old Texas man, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization by traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. Because of the murky nature of the Syrian conflict, it is sometimes a challenge to identify the groups that Americans traveling to Syria are involved with. Two cases -- those of Nicole Mansfield and Eric Harroun -- illustrate this difficulty. Mansfield, a Michigan woman, was killed in Syria in 2013, reportedly during a military clash. However, details on whether she was fighting in Syria and, if so, which group she fought for remain under investigation. Harroun was indicted upon his return to the States in 2013 for fighting with Nusra, but it was later discovered that the FBI had mistranslated the name of the group he fought with and he had actually fought with a group that was not aligned with al Qaeda. So far, no U.S. citizen involved in fighting or supporting Nusra or ISIS has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the United States. Further, ISIS' predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, never tried to conduct an attack on the American homeland, although it did bomb three American hotels in Jordan in 2005. And it's also worth noting that in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the States since 9/11 -- such as the Boston Marathon bombings last year or Maj. Nidal Hasan's massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 -- did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas. Returning foreign fighters from the Syrian conflict pose a far greater threat to Europe, which has contributed a much larger number of foreign fighters to the conflict than the United States, including an estimated 700 from France, 450 from the United Kingdom and 270 from Germany. Unlike in the United States, European countries have reported specific terrorist plots tied to returning Syrian fighters. Mehdi Nemmouche, a suspect in the May 24 shootings at a Jewish museum in Brussels, Belgium, that killed four people, spent about a year with jihadist fighters in Syria, according to the Paris prosecutor in the case. But Nemmouche's case is the only instance of lethal violence by a returning Syrian fighter in the West. What can be done? Western governments are keenly aware of the problem of Syrian veterans coming home both radicalized and trained. The problem is that in some European countries with hundreds of returnees, it is just not possible to monitor all of them. That was vividly illustrated by the case of Nemmouche. Information-sharing between Western governments about the identities of those who have traveled to Syria and have received militant training is the key to preventing more incidents such as the one at the Jewish Museum in Brussels.","Peter Bergen, David Sterman: First American known killed while fighting for ISIS .

"A week before her death, South African model Reeva Steenkamp talked about her secure, blissful environment. ""I woke up in a happy, safe home this morning,"" she tweeted. ""Not everyone did."" Four days after she posted that message, neither did she. The 29-year-old model was shot dead by her boyfriend at his house in Pretoria. She died on Valentine's Day last year. Who is ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius? Her boyfriend, Olympian Oscar Pistorius, 27, has been convicted of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally -- but unlawfully -- killing a person. He was also found guilty of one gun charge in an unrelated shooting at a restaurant. Pistorius has admitted to shooting Steenkamp but says he mistook her for an intruder. The judge ruled that he'll serve a maximum five-year prison term for the killing, to run concurrently with a three-year sentence -- suspended for five years -- on the gun charge. Beauty and brains . Before she started dating Pistorius, Steenkamp was famous in her own right. She was a striking, platinum-haired model, gearing up for her reality television debut. A law school graduate, she had a vibrant personality and a slew of modeling gigs under her belt. As Judge Thokozile Masipa said in sentencing Pistorius, Steenkamp was young, vivacious and full of life at the time of her death. ""The loss of life cannot be reversed. Nothing I say or do today can reverse what happened,"" she said. A haunting message . In the months before her shocking death, Steenkamp's added exposure brought more opportunities. She was a presenter for FashionTV in South Africa, an FHM cover girl and the face of cosmetics company Avon. FHM described her as a ""beautiful, intelligent and warm-hearted woman"" who had a ""wicked"" sense of humor. ""She was the kindest, sweetest human being, an angel on earth,"" said Capacity Relations, the agency that represented her. And her fame was growing. 'I don't have any regrets' Two days after her death, a prerecorded reality show in which she appeared as a contestant aired. In the context of what transpired, her message in it sounds haunting. ""I'm going home with sort of a sweet taste in my mouth. I don't have any regrets. I don't have any bitterness. I'm going to miss you all so much and I love you very, very much,"" she said as she blew a kiss to the camera. South Africa's national broadcaster aired the show ""Tropika Island of Treasure"" showing a clip discussing her exit from the taped program. The show features local celebrities competing for prize money. Power couple . Steenkamp was born in Cape Town but moved to Johannesburg years ago to pursue modeling. The two became an item around November 2012, and were popular in South African social circles. She constantly referred to him as ""my boo"" on social media and posted pictures of their vacations together. But phone messages read during the trial showed a couple that had some rocky patches as well. In some of the messages, she accused him of being overly jealous and overbearing. But he said he loved her and was planning a life with her. About a month before her death, the model shared a picture collage that included the runner. ""Some of my favorite people,"" she described the picture. Shortly after they met, she posted a message that appeared to make a reference to their love. ""The only guy you need in your life is the one who proves that he needs you in his,"" she said. They had big dreams . Pistorius' relatives said she made him happy. ""All of us saw at first hand how close she had become to Oscar during that time and how happy they were,"" said Arnold Pistorius, his uncle. Both had big dreams, the uncle said. ""They had plans together and Oscar was happier in his private life than he had been for a long time,"" he said.  ""We are all grieving for Reeva, her family and her friends. Oscar -- as you can imagine -- is also numb with shock as well as grief."" The younger Pistorius made history when he became the first double-amputee to compete in the able-bodied Olympics in London in 2012. He ran on special carbon fiber blades affixed to his legs. He was born without the fibulae in his legs, and they were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. Empowering women . Before she died, Steenkamp sent out a message urging her thousands of social media followers to empower women. ""Speak out against the rape of individuals"" in South Africa, she said in a post on the photo-sharing site Instagram. ""RIP Anene Booysen."" Booysen, 17, was raped and mutilated in South Africa in February 2013, putting a spotlight on violence against women in the nation. Steenkamp urged her followers on Twitter to wear black the day after Valentine's to protest violence against women. A tragic end on Valentine's . Steenkamp was looking forward to Valentine's Day. ""What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?"" she asked her Twitter followers the day before. ""Get excited."" At dawn, she lay dead in a pool of blood.","The striking, platinum-haired model was gearing up for her reality television debut .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Barbra Streisand is following in the footsteps of Rihanna and Justin Bieber by creating an Instagram account. The two-time Oscar-winning actress-singer posted her first Instragram photo Wednesday with the message: ""Hello Instagram... isn't my Samantha just precious?"" Samantha is her dog, a Coton de Tulear that travels with Streisand as she tours the world. The photo shows the pooch sitting with her on a grassy lawn. Streisand announced her new Instagram account through Twitter, which she's been on for five years: ""Big news... Barbra has joined @instagram!"" Don't expect Streisand to try to match Rihanna's often revealing selfies. Her Twitter pics have been pretty tame, such as one photo of her with Sen. John McCain. Her tweets have not been written in a first-person voice, suggesting she relies on a publicist to handle her social networking. Streisand could learn from how Elizabeth Taylor used Twitter to connect with her fans in the last two years of her life. The legendary actress personally posted tweets on her smart phone, including messages from her hospital bed. ""I like the connection with fans and people who have been supportive of me,"" Taylor said when Kim Kardashian asked about Twitter in an interview just before her death in 2011. ""And I love the idea of real feedback and a two-way street, which is very, very modern. But sometimes I think we know too much about our idols and that spoils the dream. So, like all things, it is to be used with care!"" Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube have become essential marketing tools for musicians. Billboard magazine publishes a weekly chart -- the Social 50 -- that ranks artists based on their social media movement. The chart has become an important way to measure the success in the industry. CNN first learned about Streisand's Instagram account through Twitter. Kim and Kanye turn Instagram into wedding album .

"(CNN)The U.S. military is bringing home all but 100 troops sent to West Africa 10 months ago to support efforts to battle the Ebola epidemic, the Pentagon announced Tuesday in a press release. ""At the height of the epidemic, there were 2,800 DoD [Department of Defense] personnel deployed to West Africa,"" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""Given the success of the U.S. response to the crisis, the majority of DoD personnel in West Africa will now return home. ""Today, around 1,500 of them are already back to their duty stations and nearly all will return by April 30. All have or will undergo established controlled monitoring procedures."" Kirby said about 100 military service members will remain in West Africa to support the 10,000 civilian responders who remain. These service members will ""build on a strong military partnership with the Armed Forces of Liberia to enhance their Ebola response efforts and provide disaster response training to the government of Liberia,"" he said. There have been more than 22,000 reported confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola since the outbreak began, with almost 8,800 known deaths. The World Health Organization said last month that the number of new Ebola cases reported in the three worst-hit countries -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- fell to its lowest level since late June. WHO said the response has shifted from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. The White House said President Barack Obama will host some of the people responsible for the success of the U.S. response on Wednesday. ""This response showcased American leadership at its finest on the world stage, just as we came together as a nation to fortify our domestic resilience in the face of understandable apprehension,"" the White House said in a news release. ""To be sure, our tasks are far from complete; we will keep working to meet this challenge until there are zero cases in West Africa and our domestic infrastructure is fully completed."" Rajiv Shah, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development, praised the military's performance. ""Military engineers oversaw the building of new Ebola Treatment Units; military logisticians directed the deployment of life-saving resources from across the globe; and military doctors supported the brave men and women who treated patients every day,"" Shah said in a news release. ""Just 10 months since the first U.S. government personnel deployed, we have delivered extraordinary results. Across West Africa, cases are down by 80 percent. In Liberia -- once the heart of the epidemic -- we've helped cut down new cases from more than 30 a day to as few as one or two.""","All but 100 U.S. troops will be brought home from West Africa by April 30, Pentagon says .

"(CNN)We may all feel like we're under a cloud from time to time, but in hot and dry climates having your own personal misting cloud is as uplifting as it can get. In Dubai, the Gulf State mega-city situated in one of the hottest parts of the world, the benefits of evaporative cooling have long been known. Neighboring Saudi Arabia is already one of the world's largest dairy producers and its massive indoor herds are kept at an even 21 and 23 degrees Celsius with gigantic misters. Now one group of designers is reinventing the technology for human beings, devising a system that uses motion tracking and ceiling-mounted misters to provide each pedestrian with their own cooling spray. Ultrasonic sensors embedded in the canopy structure recognize visitors and send data to a control system that activates hydro-pumps and LED lights in their proximity. ""If you create a more responsive climate around people, you can save a lot of energy by creating just a bubble of heat or a bubble of cool in which they can travel,"" Professor Carlo Ratti, the head of the team at Carlo Ratti Associati from Turin, Italy, that developed the Cloud Cast technology, told CNN. ""If you use a system like this it allows people to use more outdoor spaces. This is very important in a city like Dubai which is so hot that people really can't spend much time outdoors."" Cloud Cast works by creating mobile responsive clouds that follow people as they move under a canopy. An array of responsive nebulizers is guided by sophisticated motion sensing, creating a personal climate for each person that walks under it. ""It's something that people have been using for centuries, it's called evaporative cooling,"" Ratti said. ""People in this part of the world have been using water to freshen the air for a long time."" Dubai - with its vast shopping malls and indoor leisure centers -- is currently one of the world's biggest consumers of power for air-conditioning. According to the International Energy Authority (IEA), the emirate is among the largest consumers of energy per capita in the world. An estimated two-thirds of that in the summer months is burned on driving air-conditioning. Outside temperatures might reach 50 degrees Celsius, (122 degrees Fahrenheit) but inside its public buildings the temperature can be so low that people wear jackets. At some cinemas, customers can even rent blankets. Energy consumption solely for air-conditioning is now one of the region's looming headaches. According to Chatham House, neighboring Saudi Arabia could actually be consuming more oil than it exports in 15 years due largely to air conditioning. The UAE is experimenting with many traditional solutions to air-conditioning, including wind towers that funnel upper currents of cool air down into houses. The most elegant examples of these wind towers still stand in Dubai's historic quarter of Al Bastakiya -- known locally as The Creek -- where Persian traders created ornate structures in the 1850s to cool and ventilate their urban mansions. Often, the towers were wrapped in wet fabric to increase their cooling ability. The towers also did more than simply cool the air -- the creation of positive pressure inside the building automatically creates a negative pressure on the outside, which means that stale and bad air inside the building is drawn away. While air-conditioning might provide immediate thermal comfort, wind towers rid buildings of the constant build-up of CO2 and reduce stuffiness. Contemporary variants of wind towers in the United Arab Emirates have achieved a temperature reductions of as much as 12 degrees in buildings. Ratti, however, says the beauty of their Cloud Cast system is that it is responsive to people. ""It can cope with as many people as you want -- whether it's a crowd of people or whether there's just one, there will be a misting spray,"" he said. ""It's also highly efficient because you're not misting a whole space -- you are just cooling a small volume around the person."" The Cloud Cast is currently at the prototype stage and is debuting at the Museum of Future Government Services in Dubai this month, but Ratti believes the evaporative cooler could become popular anywhere there's a hot climate. ""We think we'll have some ready for commercial sale in the near future,"" Ratti said. ""Hot and arid climates are perfect for evaporative cooling."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN)I'm sitting in a tiny, open-air seafood restaurant in Yeonhwari fishing village in Busan, South Korea, waiting for my breakfast. In the distance, on the rocky shore, a local haenyeo (""sea woman"") is picking through her morning's catch. ""She's late,"" says a fellow patron when she notices me staring. ""All the other haenyeo have already finished their diving and delivered their catch."" Like their more famous Jeju Island counterparts, Busan's haenyeo are ""mermaids"" who support their families by diving for seafood without the use of any particular tools or artificial breathing aids. The subject of many documentaries, they're a dying breed  -- an estimated 20,000 haenyeo still work in South Korea -- due to the intense physical difficulties of the job. While most haenyeo usually dive about five meters and stay underwater for 30-second intervals, many are capable of diving as deep as 20 meters and staying underwater for as long as two minutes. Jeju Island: Asia's new best weekend getaway? Seaside dining . Yeonhwari itself is a tranquil contrast from the crowds and bustle in other parts of Busan. The little string of shops selling hoe (Korean sashimi) in ""Lotus Alley"" provide a classic example of the matriarchal family businesses headed by Busan's haenyeo. Women dive in the morning, then pass their catch to other female members of the family, who run one-person operations selling the day's seafood in shacks by the shore. While the shacks may seem crude from the outside, dining areas in the back are clean and have beautiful views of the sea. Seagulls fly about and quirky lighthouses in the background -- a trademark of the region -- provide excellent photo ops. Thick green porridge . A specialty of the area is abalone porridge, known as jeonbokjuk. ""Jeonbokjuk is the best breakfast food because it's so smooth and easy on the stomach,"" says Choi Joeong-hye, 56, owner of one of the small seaside restaurants. She ladles thick spoonfuls of the freshly made, steaming porridge, making sure to show me the beautiful mother of pearl she removed from the abalone I picked from a tank 15 minutes ago. Her sister-in-law dove for abalone that morning, she tells me, and has been doing so for the past 12 years. While the setting is humble and the table plain, the price isn't cheap. A bowl of porridge costs ₩10,000 ($9). Sides of raw conch and live octopus (also ₩10,000 each) come squirming on my plate. The porridge is thicker and greener and more delicious than any I've had in Seoul. The live octopus is incredibly fresh. The sesame oil-dipped tentacles tingle in my mouth as they writhe for the last time. Beyond Seoul: 19 reasons to explore Korea . While breakfast is a quiet affair, it gets crowded at lunch, says Choi. That's when businessmen from nearby towns flock to the village for lunch, along with the local ajumma (older Korean women) who gather here to dish the latest gossip. Do foreign visitors ever come? I ask. ""We get occasional international tourists who come just to see the village, but they can't really stomach the seafood,"" says Choi. ""The porridge, maybe.""

"(CNN)For the first-timer, a Rio sucos, or juice bar, is a little overwhelming. Piles of exotic fruits, many of which you've possibly never heard of, line glass cases, or are stacked reverently in displays that seem more like a shrine to a Balinese god than a commercial enterprise. ""When the gringos arrive here, they go crazy when they see all the fruits displayed in the store,"" says Rodrigo Vidigal Peixoto, whose family runs Polis Sucos in Ipanema and several other locations in Rio. According to Peixoto, his father opened Rio's first juice bar in 1958. ""When they see the fruit they can smell and touch, it's incredible for them."" The artichoke-looking thing is a fruta do conde, or sugar apple -- it's a delicious pear-like fruit rich in antioxidants that makes one of Polis Sucos' most popular drinks. The little red fruits are acerola, which have one of the highest concentrations of Vitamin C on the planet. The orange bell pepper-like things with the curled handle on top are caju, the cashew apple, which comes from northeast Brazil and makes for a smooth, sweet blend. The handle is the cashew nut. The yellow mango-type fruits are caja, packed with vitamins A, B and C, iron and calcium. MORE: 10 things to know before visiting Brazil . Bet you never heard of this fruit . The daily sucos is a sacred ritual in Rio, a tonic to beat the heat, get a boost of natural sucrose, antioxidants or vitamins and sample a dizzying array of blends, courtesy of the exotic fruit capital of the world. The website Toda Brazil lists 146 fruits grown in Brazil. The count runs to 14 before you're even out of the A's: abacate (avocado),  abacaxi (pineapple),  abiu,  abricó, açaí, acerola, akee, ameixa, amêndoa, amora, anonáceas, araçá, atemoya, avelã. You can find sucos bars on just about any street in the city's Zona Sul. You can order juice with sugar or without (""sem acucar"") or ""natural,"" fresh-squeezed, instead of with ready-made pulp. Many sucos also offer cheap eats, which make them a great place to save money but eat well in a city where dining can be expensive. You can get everything from omelets to meat, beans and rice combos, to an assortment of salgados, the meat and cheese pastries Brazilians love. There are natural energy drinks, from guarana berries or cupuacu, an Amazon fruit whose juice is a cross between pear and banana. Calming beverages are made from the popular maracuja (passionfruit). Another favorite sucos is made with graviola, a pear-sized green fruit covered in prickly knobs that's said to aid digestion. It has a hint of pina colada but it's lighter and, of course, fresher. MORE: Insider Guide: Best of Rio de Janeiro . How to shop for fruit . Fresh-squeezed juice is the currency of the Rio sucos bar. ""The freshness of the fruit is the secret to the best sucos,"" says Peixoto. He's a stickler for using only fruit that's at peak ripeness. As a buyer for Polis, he goes to the Ceasa, the giant fruit and vegetable wholesale market in the north of Rio, and picks only fruit that's just right for juicing. He looks first for fruit that's visually pleasing, with a healthy color. Then he feels the product to see if it's firm. It can't be soft, or it's past its time. ""The people in other stores buy inferior fruits, less quality,"" says Peixoto. ""They use sugar to pretend the fruit is mature and sweet, but it's not. My juices all are (made) without sugar."" Some fruit is too fragile for shipping and handling, so pulp is used. Polis Sucos uses pulp only for graviola, cupuacu and acai, fruits from the northeast and the Amazon. The deep purple acai is one of the most popular items at any sucos. The market for this ""superfood"" loaded with antioxidants is also booming outside Brazil. It's served as a smoothie, blended with banana or honey or mixed with granola and served in a bowl. Of course, there are plenty of fruits most foreigners have heard of as well, from pineapple to mango, papaya, bananas and oranges -- and all seem to grow tastier under Brazilian skies. The favorite Brazilian banana, known as the silver banana, is typically firmer and sweeter than the kind Americans know from Central America or Ecuador. They make for particularly delicious sucos blends. READ: Samba central: Moving to the rhythms of Rio's Lapa district . Historic decision . Rio's juice bar tradition began when Peixoto's father, Eduardo Fernades Peixoto, was working as a restaurant and bar manager. He didn't really like his job, so he was ready to take a risk when the owner suggested one day that the two of them open up a juice store in Ipanema, with Eduardo as a partner. Eduardo eventually became the sole owner of Polis Suco, then passed it down to Rodgrigo's brother Carlos. Today, the family operates four stores, including two in Barra da Tijuca and one inside the headquarters of Globo TV, at Projac da Globo. ""We pioneered the concept, then other people opened many other stores,"" says Peixoto. ""People began to want a more natural, healthy life. ""It's also very hot here, so people wanted something healthy that could quench their thirst."" He recommends travelers try his mango and maracuja combo. ""The sweet fruit with the sour fruit is a wonderful combination. It's very good."" At a price of 7 reais ($3 for 300 ml) and 10 reais ($4.50 for 500 ml), it's a tasty deal, and one that could get to be a habit during your stay in Rio.

"(CNN)The first-time visitor quickly notices the pretty pastel houses and curious sculptures placed at intervals throughout the town -- but the quaint facades and works of modern art signal merely the tip of the fascinating story behind a little known hillside labyrinth in Busan known as Gamcheon village. Not on any standard travel itinerary, the village offers a stark contrast from the glitzy skyscrapers of ""new Busan"" or even the bustling markets of ""old Busan."" Instead, the eerily quiet village is a destination for a different type of traveler -- one that's not driven by foodie discovery or lazing on the beach, the primary reasons Koreans vacation in Busan. Instead, Gamcheon lures travelers with an interest in art and history. Religious roots . The village has an unusual origin story. Many accounts say Gamcheon began as a slum town in the 1950s filled with refugees from the aftermath of the Korean War, but the village actually owes its beginnings to an ascetic religious community called Taegeukdo, an obscure religion birthed during political upheavals in Korea in the early 1900s. Although relatively scarce today, members of the Taegeukdo religion believe that the meaning of the universe can be found through a philosophy of ""great polarity,"" which incorporates the concepts of yin and yang. The swirling blue and red Taegeuk symbol has been important throughout Korea's history -- it's the symbol in the center of today's South Korean flag. In 1955, during the rebuilding phase that followed the Korean War, the city of Busan ordered some 800 families of the religious movement to move into designated area on a nearby hillside. The religion's headquarters also moved. It remains the preeminent landmark of the village today. Meaningful layout, artistic rebirth . Unlike other area villages that sprang up in ad hoc fashion, Gamcheon's multi-tiered communal layout was meticulously planned. ""By building the houses in tiers so that no house blocks any house behind it, the architectural layout of the village adheres to the Taegeukdo teaching of allowing others to prosper,"" says Kim Kye-young, a local representative of the Taegeukdo religion. Gamcheon's art-themed makeover began in 2009, when it hosted a public art project and invited art students and artists to ""decorate"" the village. While the villagers had for decades painted their own homes in pastel hues, artists added dozens of colorful touches throughout town, attaching nicknames such as ""Korea's Machu Picchu"" (bizarre choice) and ""Korea's Santorini"" (closer). While the view is best from a high vantage point called ""Sky Garden,"" where the village information center is located (only Korean brochures and guides are available), the real delight lies in getting lost in the village's maze of alleyways. Each alley leads to a different surprise, from bird sculptures on roofs to Murakami-like playful installations in abandoned houses. The quirkiest surprise is ""The Little Prince,"" from the French novel of the same name, sitting atop a fence, staring forlornly out at the Busan Harbor alongside his fox. Getting around . It's almost impossible not to get lost. Each alley leads to three or four others. One way to maintain your bearings is to ""follow the fish"" -- painted schools that ""swim"" throughout the streets. Look closely and you'll spot tiny people sitting on top of the fish, or kicking them in the eye. ""Photographers come and fall head over heels in love with the village,"" says In Sik Kim, a local tour guide. ""But the villagers don't like the fact that so many people are traipsing through their houses, and many of them are moving away. The houses don't sell though, so they just abandon them."" More than 300 local houses are estimated to be empty. Artists are stepping in to turn many of them into exhibition spaces. Some have been transformed into cafes and restaurants run by the town. Profits go back to the villagers. Small, quiet and mostly hidden from the tourist path, Gamcheon isn't ready for a flood of visitors. It prefers the occasional trickle that it has today. ""I don't think fat foreigners can fit through these alleyways,"" says another guide when asked about tours for foreigners. ""They'll have to watch their heads every step, too. It'll be very uncomfortable."" How to get there . In Busan, take the subway to Toseong-dong Station or Goejeong Station, then take a taxi to Busan Gamjeong  Elementary School (taxi will cost approximately $2.50).

"What European city has fallen under the rule of the Polish Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Soviets and the Nazis? Here's a clue: It's lined with cobbled roads and features some of the world's most eclectic examples of historic architecture -- from renaissance to baroque to art deco. Answer: Lviv, Ukraine's official capital of culture. Never heard of it? You're not alone. With its independent coffee houses and traditional chocolatiers, Lviv looks, smells, and tastes like the best of Europe. Indeed, its Western flavor has earned it the moniker ""Little Paris of Ukraine."" And yet, compared to other prized European cities, relatively few people travel here. For centuries Lviv -- located 50 kilometers from the Poland-Ukraine border -- was a significant stopping point on the main trade routes between the east and west -- and this prime location helped pay for its striking beauty. ""You had to be rich and famous to be here,"" explained local historian Yaroslav Hrytsak. During the renaissance, the city could afford Italy's finest architects because every merchant passing through was forced to stay and sell their goods for at least two weeks. ""It was a very smart move to collect money from them,"" said Hrytsak. ""It kept the wealth in the city, and that wealth has been transformed into (architectural) richness."" Read related: Gas pipes and price hikes: Ukraine, Russia's uneasy alliance . The buildings endure but Lviv's prosperity didn't survive its bloody history. The city has, over the centuries, shifted in ethnic, cultural and political make-up - mixing Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish and other identities during a series of gruesome upheavals. ""Here regimes changed quite a lot,"" said Hrytsak. ""We had the Polish rule, then the Hapsburg rule, then for a short period the Russians, then the Ukranian, then Russian, then Nazi."" Then for almost 50 years Lviv was swallowed by the Soviet Union. With that, concludes Hrytsak, the city was condemned to relative obscurity. But very recently things have started to change -- and fast. According to research from the Lausanne School of hotel business, Lviv experienced a sudden 40% increase in tourism in early 2010, compared to the previous three-year average. This, it said, was the highest rate in Europe. Just last month, the floodgates opened even wider, when Lviv became a host city for the Euro 2012 football championships. So how has this happened? With the USSR's collapse, some saw new opportunities for reviving Lviv's former wealth and fame. In the mid 90s, Yaroslav Rushchyshyn began producing women's clothes, paying his workers $4 a month. Today they get a vastly improved, but still modest, $250. With nine factories across western Ukraine, his company, Trottola, is now a major producer and exporter for European fashion labels. ""I'm proud because Japan, after the Second World War, started from blouses as well. And where is Japan now?"" he said. The unlikely parallels don't end there. Strolling through Lviv's old streets, you'd never guess the city is now a booming international hub for the I.T. industry. Limelight networks is a U.S.-founded, Nasdaq-listed company specializing in online content delivery. It's one of many up-and-coming digital tech firms to have opened offices in Lviv over the past few years. ""It had good growth and experience in the U.S., however the company needs more talent to do the new cool projects and products for our customers. This is why we're here in Ukraine."" Lviv's unexpected abundance of I.T. talent is in fact a legacy of the U.S.S.R. To help the military, many Soviet universities focused on turning out world-class engineers and Lviv's university is still producing them.  The city boasts a disproportionately large educational center with 23  higher education institutions. Most tellingly of all, seven of these are dedicated to training support staff for work in the tourism industry. It's clear the city of Lviv does not intend to remain a hidden gem for very much longer.","Since Euro 2012, little-known Ukrainian ""capital of culture"" Lviv put back on map .

"(CNN)Joni Mitchell thinks she's experienced being a black man. One of the most influential singer-songwriters of the late 20th century, Mitchell, 71, mentioned her crossover experiences in New York magazine interview about wresting her legacy from the biographers who don't understand her, the recording industry that's tried to limit her and the sexist movie stars and singers who have decried her fashion sense. The Canadian wisp of a singer feels she shares an affinity with black men.  ""When I see black men sitting, I have a tendency to go -- like I nod like I'm a brother,"" she told New York magazine. ""I really feel an affinity because I have experienced being a black guy on several occasions."" She claimed it started with comments by her dentist. ""One day he said, 'Oh, you've got the worst bite I've ever seen. You have teeth like a Negro male.' "" It got her thinking about casual racism, and that inspired her to play with the cover of her 1977 album, ""Don Juan's Reckless Daughter."" The cover features a young child, Mitchell as herself and someone who looks like a black man. ""That's me. The black guy in the front."" What? Mitchell said that, inspired by someone walking down Hollywood Boulevard, she dressed up -- in blackface -- like the man for a Halloween party. It caused such a ruckus, the singer said. Later, she says, she was annoyed by the photographer shooting her album cover, so she decided to throw him for a loop. ""It was a great revenge. That was all to get his a**. To freak him out. I had to keep him on the defensive.""","Joni Mitchell told New York magazine she's experienced being a black man .

"(CNN)Metro systems that travel underground in the United States may be unprepared for smoke or fire emergencies, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said Tuesday. The board wants a nationwide audit of transit systems, with emphasis on trains that operate in enclosed tunnels. The huge undertaking would be the first of its kind, Holloway said. The call for an audit comes as investigators look into a January 12 fatal accident that happened near the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station in Washington. An electrical malfunction inside the tunnel caused train cars to fill with smoke. Passengers who were trapped inside said they struggled to breathe. One female passenger died. The Washington Metro system, operated by a multistate compact known as WMATA, has ventilation fans at strategic locations designed to remove smoke and heat from the tunnels, but investigators found they were inadequate. ""The ventilation strategy that WMATA implemented during the accident was not consistent with best practices."" the NTSB said. Investigators also found Metro employees had no written procedures for dealing with ventilation during smoke and fire events underground. ""The investigation to date has revealed that WMATA does not currently have the means to determine the exact location of a source of smoke in its tunnel network,"" the NTSB said. The findings in Washington raised concerns there could be similar problems in other transit systems across the country. Transit networks with significant portions of their tracks underground will be the focus of the audit. New York City's MTA, Washington's WMATA, Atlanta's MARTA, San Francisco's BART, Los Angeles's MTA, Boston's MBTA and Philadelphia's SEPTA would be included. In a letter, board members called on the Federal Transit Authority, a division of the Department of Transportation, to conduct the examination of tunnel ventilation systems as well as written emergency procedures for fire and smoke. The FTA has not yet decided if it will investigate. The agency said it ""has not yet determined how an audit of this nature would be conducted or the potential impact such an audit would have on the transit riding public.""","NTSB wants audit of transit systems, with emphasis on trains that operate in enclosed tunnels .

"(CNN)Military family activist Liz Snell never thought it would happen to her group: Apparent ISIS sympathizers hacked her group's Twitter account and posted threats against a half dozen or so members. The threats came just a month after Snell told CNN she wouldn't allow the ISIS-related hack of the U.S. military's Central Command Twitter account to deter her fight to help military spouses in distress. On Tuesday, the ISIS-connected threats became personal, against her group, Military Spouses of Strength. ""I never thought we would be in this position,"" Snell said Tuesday after the group's Twitter account was hacked by a group calling itself the CyberCaliphate, which partly refers to ISIS' efforts. ""Initially, I felt scared. I think I would be lying if I didn't, if I said otherwise,"" Snell said. ""I feel a sense of responsibility to our members and followers. Military Spouses of Strength was formed for military spouses to feel that they have a safe place."" For now, the group's Twitter page is indefinitely shut down at Snell's direction, and she's ensuring everyone in her group ""is being safe as possible."" Her group promotes the mental well-being of spouses whose partners are U.S. military personnel deployed to the battlefield, often repeatedly. The hacking is the latest volley in an ongoing cyberbattle that pits ISIS and its sympathizers against hacking groups such as Anonymous, which on Tuesday claimed responsibility for cyberassaults against nearly 800 Twitter accounts, 12 Facebook pages and more than 50 email addresses linked to ISIS. On the other side of the cyberwarfare is CyberCaliphate, which claims ISIS ties. On Tuesday, it appeared the group hacked the Twitter accounts of Newsweek and the breaking news system of a Maryland television station. According to Newsweek, IBTimes.com, the website of the International Business Times, was also hacked. CyberCaliphate is the same organization that was confirmed to have hacked the Twitter account for U.S. Central Command earlier this year. RELATED: CENTCOMM Twitter account hacked, suspended . The group also posted threatening tweets against first lady Michelle Obama and others. On the Twitter account of Military Spouses of Strength, the ISIS sympathizers posted a threatening form letter and opened each threat with the name of one of the six or seven members of the group. ""You think you're safe but IS is already here. #CyberCaliphate got into your PC and smartphone,"" the threat said. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is also known as the Islamic State (IS). The militants, condemned internationally, seek an extreme Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. Snell said the threats targeted group members who were quoted in a CNN article in January entitled ""After ISIS Twitter threat, military families rethink online lives."" Snell was also featured in a 2014 CNN project about suicides and suicidal acts among military spouses, whose experiences often go uncounted in official studies. ""It looks like to me that everyone who was threatened was connected to the CNN article,"" Snell said. Snell reported the apparent ISIS-related hacking to the FBI. The FBI doesn't confirm if it receives particular complaints and wasn't commenting Tuesday on whether it was investigating Snell's complaint, said FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Ram. ""Depending on the nature of the threat and the extent of any related attacks, it may be appropriate for the FBI to investigate the intrusion. If there is a threat of physical violence, victims are also encouraged to contact local authorities,"" Ram said. Amy Bushatz, another Military Spouses of Strength member who was threatened, said she also received a friend request on her personal Facebook page that originated from a group apparently connected to ISIS. The friend request came from a person who identified himself as ""Gaspar CyberCaliphate Sadz."" The friend request featured a person's head wrapped in a black-and-white checkered head scarf. ""I thought, well, that is creepy,"" Bushatz said Tuesday. When she went to look at that person's Facebook page again, ""it was gone,"" Bushatz said. ""It had been deleted."" Then Bushatz learned of the threat on the military spouses' Twitter account. ""I would be lying if I didn't say it (made) me a little nervous,"" Bushatz said. ""I don't think you can receive what appears to be a personal threat from ISIS without being nervous."" But Bushatz said Tuesday, as she did in January, that she won't live in fear. Bushatz is a reporter and editor for Military.com, which describes itself as ""the largest military and veteran membership organization,"" with 10 million members. She covers military spouses and family news, she said. ""Being in a military family is a vulnerable place to be,"" Bushatz said. ""So I would say being cautious isn't a bad thing, but we're not people who live in fear. If they think they can have control over us by frightening us, they're wrong."" Citing such personal safety measures, both Snell and Bushatz declined to give their husband's names and the military base to which they're assigned. Bushatz, whose husband is an officer in the Army, also writes the SpouseBuzz column for Military.com, and on Tuesday, she wrote a story about how ""ISIS Threatened Me But They Didn't Win."" ""You might be thinking 'that's what you get for being stupid enough to be quoted by name in a CNN article about ISIS and cyberthreats.' However, the decision to have my name used in that story wasn't a hard one. My name is everywhere — here, on Military.com and in other national publications. I am a public person. That ship has sailed,"" Bushatz wrote. Another military spouse told The Hill website that her Twitter account was hacked by someone claiming to be part of ISIS. The threat by the CyberCaliphate targeted military spouses and their children in the name of a ""cyberjihad."" The threat stated: ""While your president and your husband are killing our brothers in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan we're coming for you,"" according to The Hill. ""You think you're safe but the IS is already here, CyberCaliphate got into your PC and smartphone,"" the threat continued. ""We know everything about you, your husband and your children and we're much closer than you can even imagine. You'll see no mercy infidel!"" according to The Hill. The military spouse wasn't identified in the story, but The Hill said the Twitter account was owned by the spouse of a U.S. Marine and is used to publicize her nonprofit, which advocates for military spouses. On Tuesday, Newsweek Managing Editor Kira Bindrim confirmed that the magazine was hacked, and said the outlet had regained control of the account. ""We apologize to our readers for anything offensive that might have been sent from our account during that period, and are working to strengthen our newsroom security measures going forward,"" Bindrim said. Maryland station WBOC tweeted just after 9:30 a.m. Tuesday that its ""text alerts have been hacked by the group calling itself the CyberCaliphate. WBOC is aware of the situation and working to remedy it."" The station said as many as 16,000 subscribers received threatening messages like the following: ""We're CyberCaliphate! With Allah's permission we're coming for you! You'll see no mercy infidel!""

"Jeb Bush is the clear Republican presidential frontrunner, surging to the front of the potential GOP pack following his announcement that he's ""actively exploring"" a bid, a new CNN/ORC poll found. He takes nearly one-quarter — 23% — of Republicans surveyed in the new nationwide poll, putting him 10 points ahead of his closest competitor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who tallied 13%. RELATED: Read the entire CNN/ORC poll here . Physician Ben Carson comes in third, with 7% support, and Sen. Rand Paul and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are both tied for fourth with 6%. That marks a drop in support for all but Christie and Bush from the last CNN/ORC survey of the field, conducted in November. That poll showed Bush in the lead, but only taking 14% of the vote, while Carson came in second with 11% and Christie tied Rep. Paul Ryan for fourth with 9% support. Bush's 10-point lead is a milestone for the potential GOP field — it marks the first time any prospective candidate has reached a lead beyond a poll's margin of error in the past two years. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still far and away the favorite to take the Democratic nomination for president if she runs, with the support of two-thirds of Democrats polled. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal favorite, comes in a distant second place with just 9%. Bush would still face some skepticism from GOP primary voters if he ran, but the CNN/ORC poll shows they are largely willing to forgive him for some of his more controversial comments and positions. GOP primary voters are about evenly split on whether his support for allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the United States makes them more or less likely to support him, or has no difference on their opinion of him. Forty-two percent say his description of illegal immigration as an ""act of love"" make them less likely to support Bush, but another 39% say it makes no difference to them. And while 40% say the fact that state government spending increased under Bush's watch as Florida governor, another 49% say that doesn't matter to them. Even on Common Core educational standards, which many conservatives vehemently oppose, GOP primary voters are about evenly split on whether his support for those standards would make them less likely to support him. Regardless, however, Bush may ultimately have little trouble overcoming his sins with the conservative base, as the CNN/ORC poll found Republican primary voters taking a pragmatic stance on the party's nominee. Sixty-nine percent say they want a nominee that can beat the Democratic candidate for president, even if that person doesn't agree with them on every issue, while only 29 percent of GOP primary voters are purists. And that makes Bush the candidate to beat in a GOP primary. Out of all of the seven head-to-head GOP match-ups with Clinton tested, Bush fares the best, trailing her by just 13 points. She takes 54% support to his 41% support. The survey was conducted by live interview among 1,011 adults nationwide from Dec. 18-21, with a subsample of 453 Republicans and 469 Democrats, via landline and cell phone. The overall sample has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.","Jeb Bush leads the GOP field by 10 points, with 23% support .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian military and intelligence officials say they are preparing to launch an operation against al Qaeda cells that have recently been established in the restive Sinai peninsula. While Egypt has seen a number of homegrown militant Islamist groups emerge and dissipate over the past 20 years, none has had clear organizational links with al Qaeda. But senior officials told CNN that al Qaeda cells have now surfaced in northern Sinai, which has seen acts of sabotage and clashes between rival Salafist groups this year. Among the incidents, a gas pipeline to Israel was blown up several times. The focus of their concern is the coastal area between el-Arish, a resort town of about 80,000 people on the Mediterranean, and Rafah on the border with Gaza. ""Al Qaeda is present in Sinai mainly in the area of Sakaska close to Rafah,"" a general in Egypt's intelligence service told CNN Thursday. ""They have been training there for month, but we have not identified their nationalities yet."" The official said a military operation was imminent ""to deter these armed groups."" ""Units from the 2nd infantry division, with support from general security and the border guards,"" would take part in the operation, said the secretary general for North Sinai governorate, Gaber al-Araby. ""We plan to clean out those criminal pockets around the area of Rafah and Sheikh Zuweid,"" al-Araby said. A group claiming affiliation with al Qaeda has recently begun a propaganda campaign in the region, according to Egyptian officials. The authority of the state has rarely carried much weight in the Sinai peninsula, where Bedouin tribes have great autonomy. Gen. Abdel Wahab, the governor of North Sinai confirmed that a flier titled ""Al Qaeda Sinai Branch"" circulated outside a mosque in el-Arish on Wednesday. The document called for an Islamic state in Sinai and announced that the group was planning attacks on the police stations and security forces Friday. ""A security cordon has been placed around the entrances of el-Arish and reinforcements arrived outside the police stations and the el-Arish central prison in anticipation of an attack on Friday,"" said Hazem El Maadawi, an officer stationed outside the North Sinai police headquarters. ""Tomorrow is the big day,"" El Maadawi said, adding that he feared the worst. At the end of last month, seven people were killed in clashes in el-Arish. The clashes began after members of a militant Islamist group called Takfir wal-Hijra stormed a rally being held by another Salafist group outside a mosque. Mohamed Mahmoud, who was among the protesters, told CNN; ""The Takfiris stormed in by the hundreds mounted on pickup trucks and motorcycles waving black flags, a symbol of Jihad."" ""The militants were heavily armed with machine guns, hand grenades and rocked-propelled grenades,"" he said. ""They attacked two police stations and scared the residents under the name of Jihad. We only call for Jihad if someone attacks our Islamic country or people."" The head of security in North Sinai, Gen. Saleh al Masry, told CNN last week that Takfir-wal-Higra had become active during the revolution that led to the ousting of President Hosni Mubarak. ""The terrorists were joined by members of Palestinian factions and they are currently being questioned by military intelligence. We arrested 12 assailants including three Palestinians,"" al Masry said. What's not clear is whether the Takfiris are part of -- or aligned with -- the al Qaeda cells said to be training in Sinai. The new leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is Egyptian and before leaving his homeland in the mid-1980s, had similar views to Takfir about overthrowing the Egyptian state and replacing it with Islamic rule. More recently al-Zawahiri has recorded several messages exhorting Salafists in Egypt to take advantage of the ousting of Mubarak. In an audio message that appeared on Jihadist forums earlier this month, al- Zawahiri said: ""I commend the heroes who blew up the gas pipeline to Israel. I ask Allah to reward them for their heroic act, for they have expressed the anger of the Islamic Ummah against this continuing crime from the reign of Hosni Mubarak to the rule of the Military Council.""","Egypt sees homegrown militant Islamist groups emerge and dissipate over the years .

"(CNN)Got your flats? Topped up the credit card? Got a handful of Euros for gelato and a slice? That's all you need for a tour of the fashion center of the fashion capital of the world. And our handy guide. Milan's ""fashion quadrangle"" is one of the world's top shopping districts, sparkling with glossy boutiques, squeaking with luxury designer brands. Brands scream for attention, often with outrageous displays or perplexing marketing campaigns. ""You must be stupid,"" Renzo Rosso, the billionaire founder of Diesel jeans, tells CNN, referring to the need to take risks to succeed. He ""invented"" ripped denim at the age of 15, he says. ""I still don't know why but I did something stupid: the cloth was stiff so I started rubbing the jeans on the cement of my barnyard. My jeans had a great success."" Now he has a store on one of the most enviable retail streets in the world, at the southern end of Via Montenapoleone. ""You must be ready to take risks and have a crazy approach. Only the stupid can be truly brilliant."" The four main intersecting streets: Via Montenapoleone, Via Alessandro Manzoni, Corso Venezia, Via della Spiga are noisy and busy. The internal alleys are more relaxing. ""Here you can breathe the essence of Milan's fashion universe: creative, vibrant, dynamic,"" says personal shopper Annamaria Lamanna, who takes foreign clients on tours. Advisory: The price tags within may not be suitable for all viewers. For big names: Via Montenapoleone . The top brands on Via Montenapoleone are clustered together like over-friendly neighbors. But don't be fooled: tough-looking security agents guard entrances and there are few price tags exposed. ""It's the quadrangle's symbol road, loaded with identity and the biggest boutiques,"" says Lamanna. This is where the ultimate in fashion names hang out: Giorgio Armani, Salvatore Ferragamo, Fendi, Roberto Cavalli, Ralph Lauren, La Perla and Gucci, to name a few.

"While all eyes are on Nelson Mandela's health, the former South African leader's legacy is gaining ground in an unlikely place. On Saturday, at a soccer stadium in the north-east of England, the 94-year-old's messages of peace and equality will be given center stage during a Premier League match involving one of the world's biggest clubs. However, it is not Manchester United that will be promoting its own ""Mandela Day"" and lending its efforts to the anti-racism campaign gathering force around Europe -- but rather its host Sunderland, a team battling to keep its place in the English top flight, and one that is committed to making an impact in one of football's emerging markets. Mike Farnan was one of the directors responsible for spearheading United's drive  into China and South-East Asia in the late 1990s, and now he is guiding one of the EPL's less glamorous teams into a region that is actively seeking investment -- Africa. ""There's so many similarities -- a growing economy, new wealth forming, the  people love football,"" he told CNN ahead of a match which will be the club's first big public statement about its work with Mandela's foundation. While governing bodies, football associations and clubs search for an effective response to the problem of racism, Sunderland is pursuing a more active approach. Television viewers around the world, including an estimated 1.2 billion in Africa who watch EPL games, will see Mandela's messages on a big screen that would otherwise show commercials. There will be TV commentary in Swahili, Farnan said. Players will warm up in Nelson Mandela Foundation t-shirts, its flag will be displayed by the pitch and drummers from Burundi will entertain the crowd, who will be asked to donate to the South African charity. On the surface it may seem like an advertising gimmick, but Farnan says Sunderland is serious about its involvement with Mandela's group and about its relationship with Africa. ""We have links with academies in Canada and the Caribbean but nothing like this. This is a first. Our whole focus is now Africa,"" the club's marketing director said. It happened almost by chance. Having been approached in 2011 by the ""Invest in Africa"" initiative started by the Tullow Oil company, which was impressed by Sunderland's Foundation of Light program for kids in the community, a two-year shirt sponsorship deal followed last June. ""It opened our eyes to this huge continent who's screaming out, 'We love football, we love the Premier League,' "" Farnan said. It led to further interest from African businesses, and link-ups with clubs in Ghana, South Africa and Tanzania. ""The Mandela conversations took place following that,"" Farnan said. ""We had read about the foundation and legacy program. What made us contact them was that this whole racism problem started popping its head up again in European football and it was unhealthy. ""Of course, Nelson Mandela is the torchbearer of equality and racism issues, and we felt that as a club working in Africa would it not be an idea to see if there was anything we could do, utilize him and support him in that message."" Before deciding on the partnership, its first with a major sporting organization, Mandela's foundation staff  visited Sunderland to see its community program, which works with more than 40,000 young people and their families each year. It plays a vital role in a region which has been hit hard in recent decades by economic recession and the demise of its coal mining and shipbuilding industries. Sunderland's present stadium is actually situated on the former site of the region's last coal mine. Now owned by American billionaire Ellis Short, the club -- formed by school teachers back in 1879 -- is a focal point for the locals. ""They are the most genuine, down-to-earth folk that you'll ever meet in the UK. I'm an outsider who's come in but I feel it's a very friendly community,"" said Farnan, an Irishman. ""If you play for the club you're a hero to them."" Sunderland's links with ""Madiba"" go further than his foundation -- Farnan recently discovered that one of the club's fans was an activist with the African National Congress when Mandela was in prison. ""He ended up becoming a UN supervisor when Mandela got out and was actually at the stadium when he was released (in 1990). It's an amazing story,"" Farnan said. Beyond promoting Mandela's key legacy objectives, Sunderland can also expect to do significant business, according to Tullow Oil's chief executive Aidan Heavy. ""Sunderland will become the Premier League club in Africa,"" Heavy said when the shirt sponsorship deal was announced. ""Everybody will be wearing the Sunderland shirt, every kid in every school will want a Sunderland shirt which says 'Invest in Africa,' believe me. It will be the number one club."" That sounds fanciful given the popularity of top EPL clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, who have all fielded top African players, but Farnan has high hopes. ""If you've got Africa written on your shirt and you're promoting the continent and you're in the Premier League, definitely without question it highlights you,"" he said. ""The Premier League, as an entity, is almost bigger than Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea  -- every team involved down to the lowest fan base, they get massive exposure. People are aware of who they are. ""A few years back people might not have known about Wigan -- now everyone knows that there is a Wigan and they play Manchester United twice a year."" Sunderland's own profile has been raised by the presence of prominent British politician David Miliband on its board, where he is vice-chairman. Miliband plans to continue his role at the club despite deciding to move to the United States, where he will work for the International Rescue Committee -- a humanitarian relief and development organization. Miliband, a former foreign secretary in Britain's previous Labour government, played a key role in establishing Sunderland's African interests. ""He was out at the foundation last week in South Africa talking to over a hundred leading personalities in Africa about how we will support the program,"" Farnan said. Sunderland will undertake a preseason tour of South Africa in July, based around Mandela's birthday on the 18th of that month, and Farnan said the players would be actively involved with the foundation's programs -- which the club has agreed to support for the next three years. ""I'm over there almost every month now in parts of Africa,"" Farnan said. ""People want to talk to us, they are genuinely interested in the fact that we've linked with football clubs. We've got fulltime staff working in Africa, we're proactive, we're not just going out for a preseason tour and disappearing.""","English soccer club will promote this weekend's match as ""Nelson Mandela Day""

"(CNN)Has Russian President Vladimir Putin gone completely mad? This question is actually being debated in serious circles. In a telephone conversation with President Obama a few months ago, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have suggested her Russian counterpart is ""living in another world."" The Ukraine crisis: Everything you need to know . Just last week, a leaked report commissioned by the U.S. Defense Department in 2008 concluded that the Russian leader may have Asperger's Syndrome, a type of high-functioning autism. The report said it may account for his apparently high degree of control. A Pentagon spokesman said there was no guidance from the Department of Defense on the report and experts told CNN they were skeptical of the reliability of the Asperger's claim. For the record, the Kremlin has dismissed the allegation as utter nonsense. Putin, though, is an enigma. His unflinching support for rebel separatists in Eastern Ukraine, despite their alleged excesses, has plunged Russia's relations with the West into their worst crisis since the end of the Cold War. Even in the face of mounting international sanctions that have isolated Russia and helped hobble its fragile economy, Western officials say weapons and manpower continue to flow across the border, although the Kremlin insists it is supplying neither. Clearly, Putin is determined to get his way in Ukraine. We already know, essentially, what this means in terms of a peace deal -- a truce was signed last September, although it didn't hold. The Minsk Protocol agreed that, among other things, autonomy would be granted to Ukraine's southeastern regions. The Russian language would be given official status. A buffer zone would be established along the front lines and heavy weapons would be pulled back from civilian areas. But Putin may actually want much more. On an official visit to Egypt this week, the Russian president dropped a large hint -- and not for the first time. In an interview with the Al-Ahram newspaper he rejected Russian responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine. ""It emerged in response to the attempts of the U.S.A. and its Western allies, who considered themselves winners of the Cold War, to impose their will everywhere,"" Putin told the newspaper. ""Promises of non-expansion of the NATO to the east have turned out to be hollow statements,"" he said. A solution to the Ukraine crisis, then, may involve ruling the country out of any future NATO membership, however unpalatable that may be to some in the West. Russian diplomats call it guaranteeing Ukraine's ""neutral status"" -- which sounds much better than ""capitulation."" The bigger problem, though, is that this may not end with Ukraine. For Putin, this crisis is only the latest in a catalog of grievances, which includes the West trampling over Russia's interests from Kosovo to Iraq, to Libya and Syria. Putin's ultimate goal may be to tear up the post-Soviet assumptions about what Russia will tolerate, and permanently change Russia's relationship with the West. Obama says Putin has failed to modernize Russia .","A solution to the Ukraine crisis may involve ruling the country out of any future NATO membership, writes Matthew Chance .

"(CNN)Ten dollars -- that's all that Rwandan science teacher Cephas Nshimyumuremyi had to start his business with two years ago. It may sound less than promising, but Nshimyumuremyi made that initial initial investment go a long way. Today, his company Uburanga Products, which makes herbal jelly and soap from local medicinal plants, is worth $30,000 and employs 12 workers. ""The $10 helped me to purchase the empty bottle in order to put my product on the market,"" says Nshimyumuremyi, winner of the Educat -- GT Bank Entrepreneurship Award 2014, a local business prize. His idea for natural cosmetics with healing properties came from trying to teach his students how the science they were learning in class could be applied in practical ways: ""I teach chemistry so I showed my students how you can test a plant, and know the capacity of that plant to kill bacteria,"" says the young entrepreneur, who launched his company in a bid to supplement his income from teaching . Nshimyumuremyi also wanted to use the local medicinal plants, used by some traditional healers, in a scientific way. He says his future goal is to provide the solution for ""some skin diseases in Africa."" 'Start with little, use your knowledge' Herbs used in Nshimyumuremyi's remedies are grown in a botanical garden, then dried and mixed to create either soap or jelly. ""The products made by Uburanga help the skin to be smooth and they protect from bacteria which can cause skin disease,"" says the entrepreneur. Like with many new businesses, the greatest challenge Nshimyumuremyi had to overcome was getting the word about his product out to a wider audience, without having money to advertise. Another was the high cost of containers in which his products are sold, which he had to import: ""In our country there is no industry producing such kind of bottles and cartons, so we purchase them from Kampala [Uganda]),"" Nshimyumuremyi says. His message to fellow would-be entrepreneurs thinking of starting a business is encouraging: ""Don't think that you need a lot of capital,"" he says.

"(CNN)The leaves that go into a cup of Ceylon tea play a surprisingly complex role in the history of Sri Lanka. It started with a single camellia sinesis plant brought from China in 1824 by the British, who had colonized the island then known as Ceylon in 1801. The plant was to be displayed in the Royal Botanical Gardens outside Kandy in the country's lush interior -- but it has since grown into a $1.5 billion export business for the teardrop shaped island nation off India's southern tip. Alongside the agricultural production of tea, which accounts for 2.5% of the country's $60 billion GDP, tea tourism is also emerging as a popular experience for travelers. In 1867 Scottish coffee planter James Taylor, the man who would be recognized as the pioneer of Sri Lanka's tea industry, planted 19 acres of tea near Kandy at an altitude of around 500 meters. In the 1860s, however, Sri Lanka was the world's largest coffee producer and few paid attention to Taylor. Two years later came the first seeds of change when Hemileia vastatrix, or coffee rust, was detected on the island. Within 10 years, this lethal fungus led to financial ruin for the island's British coffee planters. Roughly 1,700 left for England while the remaining 400 or so switched to growing tea. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle famously commented that ""the tea fields of Ceylon are as true a monument to courage as is the lion at Waterloo."" Tea industry starts . The East India Company brought Tamil women from Southern India to work as tea pluckers, ushering in the next chapter of human suffering on these lush green acres. By 1890, the year Thomas Lipton arrived to purchase tea estates, 23,000 tons of tea were exported to London's tea auctions. Ceylon had become an island synonymous with tea. Ceylon won independence from British rule in 1948 but the tea industry remained a colonial domain. When government pressure led to the selection of six Ceylonese men as the first indigenous tea tasters in 1950, one of them, Merrill J. Fernando, remembers being told by British colleagues, ""You all eat too much curry, it ruins the taste buds!"" Even as the island nation became the world's largest tea exporter in 1965, the industry itself was still dominated by the British, who exported the tea as raw material and branded it overseas. Fernando began dreaming of packaging and marketing 100% pure Ceylon tea, dispensing with middlemen and keeping more profits for his country, which officially became known as Sri Lanka in 1972. Two destructive rounds of land reform in the 1970s delayed those dreams and nearly wiped out Sri Lanka's tea industry, but in 1988 Fernando founded Dilmah Tea. Today, Dilmah is Sri Lanka's most recognized international brand. World famous . According to the World Tea Council, in 2012 Sri Lanka exported 340 million kilograms of tea, the third highest by volume behind Kenya and China, though number two when measured in value terms, thanks to the premium revolution begun by Dilmah's founder. When asked about the future of Sri Lankan tea given increased competition from younger, more productive fields in Kenya and the global coffee craze, Fernando's son, Dilmah executive Malik Fernando, points to his competition. ""We need Teaeli and others to continue introducing sophisticated products that identify Ceylon tea as the finest grown to the next generations,"" he says. For his part, Teaeli founder Dushyantha De Silva saw a market niche five years ago. ""Ceylon tea had not changed much since my grandparent's time,"" explains the 22 year-old Colombo native. ""When our 26-year civil war ended in 2009, we all knew a tourist boom would come. I felt the market had room to welcome creative new tastes, especially for overseas visitors who want to leave with a souvenir of Sri Lanka's tea culture."" Sri Lanka's top 7 tea experiences .

"He picked up the Pittsburgh Steelers from the bottom of the pile, and when he finished with them, they had become a fearsome powerhouse. Chuck Noll, the man who led his team to four Super Bowl victories -- the most by any head coach -- died late Friday. He was 82. Family was by his side when Noll passed away of natural causes at his home in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County medical examiner's office said. He had suffered from Alzheimer's and heart disease. His Super Bowl triumphs are the tip of the iceberg of the winning legacy Noll left behind. When he took over the helm of the Steelers in 1969, the team had not won a single title in nearly 40 years, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which inducted Noll into its Canton, Ohio, shrine in 1993. During his first year as head coach, the team floundered to a season close of just one win and 13 losses. But Noll homed in on the yearly draft of college players and used his savvy to assemble the gritty, talented nucleus of what would become a dynasty. By 1972, the Steelers' fortunes turned, when they won their first-ever division title, the AFC Central. They went on to win eight more during Noll's stint of 23 seasons, which ended in 1991 with an overall record of 209 wins, 156 losses and one tie. The Noll era spawned one Steeler Hall of Fame player after another, such as quarterback Terry Bradshaw; ""Mean"" Joe Greene, who anchored the ""Steel Curtain"" defensive line; center Mike Webster, linebackers Jack Ham and Jack Lambert; receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth; and running back Franco Harris, whose career rushing yards rank 13th in NFL history. Steeler greats mourn their former coach . ""I had a great amount of fear for him,"" Bradshaw said Saturday. ""He's kind of like a father from whom you want approval and you don't quite get it."" For Bradshaw, who had a stormy relationship with Noll, that fear amounted to respect. ""I'm proud to have played for him. It was a great honor."" ""Chuck was just the ultimate leader,"" said Greene, who played his entire career for Noll. ""He had truth and belief in what he was saying, and over time all of those things he said were validated, the things about winning football games and being a solid citizen."" ""I am a little shocked by this, and sad,"" added Harris. ""These are times when we reflect on all the great memories and the great times that we had. And there's no doubt that these memories that we had, probably people consider them the best of times in pro football."" Four Super Bowls in six years . Noll began his pro football career in the 1950s, playing as a guard and linebacker for the Cleveland Browns. After his playing career he became an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Chargers (later the San Diego Chargers). He was the defensive coordinator in 1968 for the seemingly invincible Baltimore Colts. Despite a season that ended in a Super Bowl loss to the New York Jets, the Colts' defense gave up only 144 points. It was Baltimore head coach Don Shula who recommended him for the Pittsburgh job. Shula, who himself would go on to win two Super Bowls at the helm of the Miami Dolphins, told CNN that letting Noll go ""was the right thing to do."" ""He wanted to be there, and he needed to be there, so I let him go."" Noll, Shula said, was ""a wonderful human being."" ""He never got the credit he deserved for his accomplishments."" Noll and the Steelers took their first Vince Lombardi Trophy in January 1975, beating the Minnesota Vikings 16-6 in Super Bowl IX, then went on to win three of the next five, capped by a 31-19 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. Since Noll's retirement the Steelers have gone on to win two more Super Bowls for a total of six, more than any other NFL franchise. Reaction .

"(CNN)Raymond Heiber estimates he has told this story 100 times. He'll never get tired of telling people about the forces that brought him to his soul mate at 51. The story begins in 1969, when Raymond walked down the aisle with Helen Klinger for the first time. They were the ring bearer and flower girl in the wedding of Raymond's uncle, Ron, and Helen's oldest sister, Charlotte. Ray was about to turn 6, and Helen was 7. After the wedding, they remained childhood playmates, meeting up at family picnics and pool parties in the coal region of Pennsylvania where they lived. But by the time they were teenagers, their lives took different directions. Helen married young and had four children. Raymond joined the Navy, married and had a son. Things didn't work out how either of them planned. Raymond's wife died of lung cancer after 30 years of marriage, and Helen's marriage ended in divorce. In early 2014, they were both on their own again, living 50 miles apart in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. ""All she wanted in her life was for someone to love her, for her,"" Raymond said. ""And the way I was left, all I wanted was to love somebody for one more day."" That's when what they like to call the ""divine conspiracy"" began. Ron and Charlotte, now living in Las Vegas, traveled back to Pennsylvania in May to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. Thinking of the couple, knowing they each could use a companion, Charlotte suggested Raymond give Helen a call, just to talk. He was nervous. ""He said, 'It's been years, I don't even know if she would know me anymore,' "" Charlotte remembers. Raymond called Helen a week later. You can probably guess what happened after that. ""Things just fit together -- there was no real working stuff out. The whole thing was very easy. The families knew each other, I knew her brothers, I knew her sisters, she knows my whole family and everything just worked out,"" Raymond said. Helen, who says Raymond had appeared to her in a dream weeks before they reconnected, looks at the picture of him and her as ring bearer and flower girl and believes they had a spiritual connection even then. Sometimes, they wonder why they didn't get married all those years ago, but they believe God truly did have a plan. From ring bearer and flower girl to husband and wife, 20 years later . ""If his wife wouldn't have passed away and I hadn't got divorced, we probably wouldn't have met again,"" said Helen, who just turned 53. ""I think he was supposed to go through that experience, just like I was supposed to go through my experience to be a better person."" After dating for four months, they walked down the aisle for the second time on September 14, 2014, to become husband and wife. This time, the roles were reversed: Ray's uncle carried the rings and Helen's sister carried the flowers.","Raymond Heiber and Helen Klinger first walked down the aisle in 1969 .

"Washington  (CNN)As Republicans attempt to build more inroads with black voters, the Republican National Committee sought to highlight its progress on Wednesday, recognizing three newly elected black Republicans to Congress. The committee held its third annual awards lunch at the Howard Theatre, a historic black landmark in Washington where the RNC and more than 400 attendees also paid tribute to the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke, the first African-American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, who died last month at the age of 95. The event recognized Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the first black senator elected from the South since Reconstruction (in 2014 he was elected to the same seat he was appointed to in December 2012); Rep. Will Hurd, the first black Republican elected to Congress from Texas; and Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets and a major GOP donor, helped introduce the three lawmakers. ""It's amazing to me that we're dealing with 'firsts' in this century,"" Johnson told CNN in an interview after the event. ""There should be 'seconds, thirds and fourths,' and really the Republican Party is open to all."" While Republicans had a big year in 2014, Scott and Love still won largely with the support of white voters, while Hurd won with the support of white and Hispanic voters. In South Carolina, for example, Scott won 10% of the black vote, only slightly more than the other South Carolina senator, Lindsey Graham, who's white and brought in 6% of the black vote. ""We've got a ways to go,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said on stage Wednesday. ""I know we're not going to carpet the world here in one or two years or one election cycle, but it's an improvement, and we always have to be improving as a party."" Black voter turnout in the midterm election this past November did reach into the double-digits in some states, like Florida (12%), Wisconsin (10%) and in Ohio, where Gov. John Kasich won re-election with 26% of the black vote. For her part, Love told a story about a student who asked Love how she's able to be a black Republican woman living in a red state like Utah in ""today's America."" ""I am all of those things because I refuse to fit this mold that society tells me I need to fit into,"" she replied. SEE ALSO: GOP places hopes on new class of black Republicans . Love also urged Republicans to focus on a message of being independent from government. ""People who are independent are the ones that make a difference,"" she said. ""We need to remove ourselves from a different kind of slavery, and what I'm talking about is the slavery that comes from being dependent on people in power."" Narrowing the GOP's gap with minority voters became a priority following the 2012 presidential loss, when Mitt Romney won only 6% of the African-American vote and 27% of the Latino vote. Romney's privately recorded comments, in which he argued that 47% of Americans were dependent on government, became a damaging moment for the then-nominee, and it's a message that Republicans are still trying to run from. ""The reason Republicans lost can be summed up in two words: 47%,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who's seriously considering a presidential bid, said recently at an event sponsored by the Koch Brothers. That lesson helped spur renewed attention to anti-poverty efforts, and some potential presidential contenders, like Sen. Rand Paul and Gov. Chris Christie, have tried to appeal to minority voters by focusing on criminal justice reform. Wednesday's event largely stayed away from policy and focused more on efforts Republicans have made to build relationships with black voters through community outreach and black media. The party has spent millions on hiring staff who are tasked with improving the Republican brand in places with nontraditional GOP voters. ""As we enter the presidential election year, we'll share our ideas with Americans of all backgrounds,"" Priebus said, adding that he's committed to building a more ""inclusive"" Republican Party. ""This is about being present all the time. America is strongest when both parties fight to earn every vote. No voter should be taken for granted, and no voter should be overlooked,"" he said. The event also didn't touch on racial tensions that erupted last year with the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, or the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was killed by police in a chokehold in New York City. Both cases, in which the officers were not indicted, became a political flashpoint and spurred mass protests across the country. Michael Tyler, director of African-American media at the Democratic National Committee, argued the RNC lunch was simply a ""perfunctory gesture"" and called on Republicans to ""actually fight for the issues that most affect black families across the country,"" naming education, health care and minimum wage as examples. ""While minority 'outreach' is sorely lacking in today's GOP, what is even more lacking is a record of real results,"" Tyler said. CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.","As part of a Black History Month celebration, Republicans paid tribute to record-setting members of Congress .

"Washington (CNN)To gauge Jon Stewart's impact on American politics, try to imagine a presidential election without him. The last time that happened was in 1996 when Bill Clinton faced off against Bob Dole. ""The Daily Show"" host's hordes of millennial fans and political junkies will soon find out what a sans-Stewart election is like as they pick their way through the spin, obfuscations and outrages of the 2016 race without him. Stewart, sometimes known as ""The Most Trusted Name in Fake News,"" made the surprising announcement on Tuesday that he would quit the Comedy Central hit before the end of the year after 16 years behind his desk. In a slice of irony almost too delicious to be true, news of the fake newsman's retirement emerged at the same time as a real newsman, Brian Williams, was suspended by NBC for six months after reports of his exaggerated war stories came to light. Over the years, Stewart has carved out a unique place at the intersection of politics, entertainment and journalism, offering a mocking take on the news with his whiplash humor and pseudo anchorman's persona. Stewart's grillings of politicians are legendary. Candidates who go on his show endure an unpredictable, high wire rite of passage and the host's sharp tongue -- all in pursuit of the young voters who form his core audience. It's been repeated so often that it's now a cliche. But plenty of studies show that many young Americans get their political news not from TV networks or newspapers but from Stewart's biting satire. In a 2012 survey, the Pew Research Center for People and the Press found that 39% of ""The Daily Show's"" regular viewers were between 18 and 29, but the group makes up just 23% of the public as a whole. That is a demographic politicians kill for. And it explains why those running for office -- particularly Democrats keen to connect with Stewart's urban, left-leaning audience -- brave appearing on his show. Though Stewart frequently denies his program is a news show and is merely about entertainment, his work appears to serve much the same function as traditional network news shows. His dissection of issues and forensic dismissal of political hypocrisy perform much the same roles as fact checkers in traditional media. Another survey in 2007 showed that Americans who knew most about what was going on in the world also tended to be viewers of ""The Daily Show"" and its recently shuttered Comedy Central spin off ""The Colbert Report."" Stewart has been a constant guide for a certain segment of Americans throughout the tumultuous decade-and-a-half that has opened the 21st Century, filtering events and curating opinion. In moments of farce, like the 2000 election, or instances of tragedy, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and subsequent political races, Stewart was there surfing the zeitgeist and resetting conventional media wisdom. When George W. Bush had the 2000 election handed to him by the Supreme Court, Stewart voiced the frustrations of many liberals who thought the election was stolen. ""I was not elected to serve one party"" a young-looking Stewart showed Bush in a clip saying, before adding ""you were not elected!"" A year later, Stewart helped teach America to laugh again in the harrowing weeks after the terror attacks. On his first show back after 9/11, Stewart replaced his normally sardonic opening segment with a moving monologue about the impact of the tragedy on his beloved New York City. ""We are going to get back to this. It is going to be fun and it is going to be funny,"" he sniffed through tears. When the Iraq war turned into a quagmire, Stewart turned his searing wit on the Bush administration's missteps and failures of the occupation with his long-running ""Mess O' Potamia"" segment. His daily lambasting of top Bush aides reflected and helped to shape the fast souring public mood on the war, which eventually provided the conditions for the rise of anti-war candidate Barack Obama in 2008. Obama, who revolutionized campaigning with his use of YouTube, social media and new digital technologies and Stewart -- with his easily sharable segments which popped perfectly for emerging media sources like Facebook -- might have been made for one another. Young voters were vital for Obama's hopes of beating the Hillary Clinton machine in 2008. And he knew where to find them -- on Stewart's show. ""The Daily Show,"" under the guise of humor and satire, also allowed Obama to gently deal with fiercely divisive campaign issues that were off limits or were difficult to handle on regular news shows. In a 2008 Obama appearance before the Pennsylvania primary, for instance, Stewart took on the latent racism that many Democrats thought was hampering the senator in the state and elsewhere. ""I am going to cut through the spin for you, sir, that's what I am here for,"" Stewart told a laughing Obama. ""We are concerned that ultimately at the end of the day .... if you are fortunate enough to become the president of the United States, will you pull a bait and switch, sir, and enslave the white race?"" In 2010, Obama was back on the show days before the midterm elections in what was seen as a transparent attempt to reconnect with the young voters who powered his 2008 campaign but had since soured. Obama, the first sitting U.S. president to appear on ""The Daily Show,"" may have got more than he bargained for when Stewart mocked him as a shadow of his 2008 persona after he hit gridlock in Washington. ""You wouldn't say 'Yes we can, with certain conditions,'"" Stewart quipped, to Obama's evident discomfort. Obama often felt the lash of Stewart's tongue, most often when he fell short of the high expectations he raised in 2008. In 2013, Stewart ripped the president for what he thought was his dismissive response to perceived scandals in the IRS and over the death of a U.S. diplomat in Benghazi. ""I wouldn't be surprised if President Obama learned Osama bin Laden had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television,"" Stewart joked. More recently, Stewart slammed Obama for not showing up  to a march in Paris to honor victims of those killed by Islamic extremists on an attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. ""How could the U.S. not be there?"" Stewart asked. But despite the critiques of Obama, Stewart has his own critics, including Republicans who complain he favors Democrats too openly, and  some pro-Israel groups, who have complained at his coverage of the Jewish state. It is not only politicians who have felt Stewart's mockery. The media gets it in the neck too. Fox News and its perceived conservative bias has been a target on Stewart's show for years. One of Stewart's most well-remembered skits was his merciless takedown of conservative commentator Glenn Beck, complete with glasses and fake blackboard. In 2010, Stewart mocked dueling protest marches engineered by Beck and civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton and drew more than 200,000 people to Washington's National Mall with the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or fear"" with his Comedy Central partner Stephen Colbert. Stewart's ire often was directed at the state of political journalism itself -- and the way news shows tend to play off a conservative and a liberal pudits on opposite sides and call it balanced news coverage. CNN wasn't immune from his attention. Stewart famously came on the CNN show ""Crossfire"" in 2004 to skewer hosts Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala. ""You're partisan, what do you call it ... hacks,"" said Stewart. ""Stop hurting America,"" he blasted in an appearance on the set. Stewart, who took a sabbatical from his show in 2013 to direct a movie, appeared to foreshadow his departure from the ""Daily Show"" late last year in an interview with ""Fresh Air"" host Terry Gross on NPR. ""I do feel like I don't know there will ever be anything that I will be as well suited for as this show,"" Stewart said. ""That being said, there are moments when you realize that is not enough anymore. The minute I say I am not going to do it any more, I will miss it like crazy."" Stewart's fans, not least those in politics, are already feeling the same about him.","Stewart hanging up mic after 16 years .

"(CNN)The American and British embassies in Yemen suspended operations and moved staffers out Wednesday, and urged their citizens to leave the politically-unstable nation as well. The U.S. Embassy had already been operating on a skeletal staff since late January. The French embassy also said it would close its doors starting Friday due to the security situation. The troubled Middle Eastern nation has been without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict since Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament, and placed the President under house arrest. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi later resigned in protest. ""The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain extremely concerning,"" said a U.S. State Department travel warning issued Wednesday. The warning said an ""ongoing risk of kidnapping"" exists, and the U.S. government is worried about possible terrorist attacks on Americans and Western facilities. However, there are no plans for a U.S. government-sponsored evacuation of American citizens at this time, the State Department said. ""U.S. government-facilitated evacuations occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist,"" it said. The message from the British Foreign Office was similar. The security situation continues to deteriorate, it said, and ""we now judge that our Embassy staff and premises are at increased risk."" It too asked British nationals to leave immediately. The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement to its citizens in Yemen. ""Given the recent political developments, and for security reasons, the Embassy invites you to temporarily leave Yemen, as soon as possible, via commercial flights at your convenience,"" the statement said.  ""The Embassy will temporarily be closed as of Friday, February 13, 2015, until further notice."" It wasn't immediately clear how the embassy closures will affect the work of United States and its allies work in combating Isliamist groups in the country, but the Pentagon says the U.S. military remains active in Yemen. ""They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yeman and frankly ... there's some counterterrorism training that's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces,"" said Pentagon spokesman Rear  Adm. John Kirby. ""I'd be less than honest if I said that there hadn't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty,"" he said. ""We're just going to have to watch this closely going forward."" Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo. ""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America.  We're watching them very closely."" Late last month, Meda Al Rowas, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated, the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim. ""Our forecast is really civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas,"" she said. The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa. But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa. There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, U.S. officials said last month.","The troubled Middle Eastern nation has been without clear leadership .

"(CNN)It was closing time. Scott Tayloe marched up to the Starbucks counter in Jacksonville, Florida, and handed the barista a napkin with his number on it. ""Call me sometime,"" he said, hoping his voice hit a cool-guy tone, though he knew in reality it was probably cracking like a schoolgirl's. Josh Holder looked down at the napkin. Scott was handsome, well-mannered and professional -- just the type of guy he had always envisioned himself with. But he knew he wouldn't call. A couple years later, Josh was at the Lemon Bar in Jacksonville. A friend of his had met a great guy at a party and thought he'd be perfect for Josh. She invited both to the bar -- a sort of blind date in the midst of a group hangout. As Josh walked toward the guy, he realized it was the same Starbucks customer whose number he had secretly kept for so long. Scott tried to pretend he didn't remember but eventually cracked. ""Why didn't you call?"" he asked. Josh explained he had been in a serious relationship at the time. By the end of the night, the two had exchanged phone numbers. For the next week, they spoke on the phone every day for hours. On July 15, 2004, they went on their first date. ""I always dreamt I would meet my future husband in line at the grocery store,"" Scott wrote on CNN iReport. ""I would be buying spaghetti, and he would be buying spaghetti sauce. Our eyes would lock and the rest would be history."" ""I always dreamt I would have a cute story. And I got one."" The first date was followed by a second, then a third. They rented giant sumo wrestling costumes and battled each other in a friend's backyard. They went horseback riding on the beach. For their six-month anniversary, they flew down to the Florida Keys. They took a road trip to Salt Lake City and spent months backpacking around Europe. ""It was like one of those crazy romantic movies,"" Josh remembered. ""Nobody does dates like this, but we did them all."" On July 29, 2011, Scott slid a note under Josh's door while on Cape Cod in Massachusetts: ""Starbucks Boy, will you marry me today?"" Today, Scott and Josh Tayloe live in Los Angeles with their son, Hayden. They disagree over small things -- movie selection, driving styles, which drawer to put the shorts in -- but agree on all the big things, such as their plan to adopt more children. With this kind of love story, it's no wonder the couple believes so strongly in fate. One of Josh's favorite stories is from Plato's ""Symposium"": The Greeks believed humans were originally created with four arms and four legs. Fearing their power, Zeus split them in half. ""So you have a perfect match,"" Josh said. ""You just have to find it.""","Scott and Josh Tayloe met at a Starbucks in Jacksonville, Florida .

"Louis Zamperini, the Olympic runner and World War II officer who survived a horrific plane crash, a seven-week journey across the Pacific in a raft, near starvation and unspeakable torture in Japanese POW camps, has died. He was 97. The cause of death was pneumonia, his family said in a statement from Universal Pictures, which is making a film adaptation of ""Unbroken,"" Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling chronicle about Zamperini's life. ""Having overcome insurmountable odds at every turn in his life, Olympic runner and World War II hero Louis Zamperini has never broken down from a challenge. He recently faced the greatest challenge of his life with a life-threatening case of pneumonia. After a 40-day long battle for his life, he peacefully passed away in the presence of his entire family, leaving behind a legacy that has touched so many lives,"" the Zamperini family said in a statement. ""His indomitable courage and fighting spirit were never more apparent than in these last days."" On her Facebook page, Hillenbrand wrote, ""Farewell to the grandest, most buoyant, most generous soul I ever knew. Thank you, Louie, for all you gave to me, to our country, and to the world. I will never forget our last, laughing talk, your singsong 'I love you! I love you!' and the words you whispered to me when you last hugged me goodbye, words that left me in happy tears, words that I will remember forever. I will love you and miss you to the end of my days. Godspeed, sweet Louie."" Angelina Jolie, the director of the ""Unbroken"" film, added, ""It is a loss impossible to describe. We are all so grateful for how enriched our lives are for having known him. We will miss him terribly."" Zamperini's tale is one of those that would be dismissed as fiction if it weren't true. A wild child who grew up in Torrance, California, he was tamed by a love for running and an unquenchable competitiveness. At 19, he ran the 5,000 meters at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin despite mere weeks of training at that distance. He missed a medal but, in his determination to catch the leaders, ran his last lap in an astonishing 56 seconds. With the 1940 Olympics canceled due to the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps prior to Pearl Harbor and eventually became a bombardier on the sometimes unwieldy B-24 Liberator, nicknamed the ""Flying Brick."" In late May of 1943, he and a crew took off on a search mission for a fallen pilot. Somewhere over the open Pacific, the plane failed and crashed into the ocean. Zamperini and two colleagues survived, but their troubles were just beginning. He and the other crew members had to survive 47 days on a raft, in scorching sunlight and often without drinking water. They collected rain when it fell and killed albatrosses who alit on the raft. Sharks constantly circled beneath them. One person died on the journey. When Zamperini and his buddy, pilot Russell Allen ""Phil"" Phillips, finally washed ashore on a Pacific island, they found they had drifted 2,000 miles -- only to be taken in as prisoners of war by the Japanese. Life only got harder. The men were fed poorly and feared being killed by their captors. Zamperini was singled out for abuse by one camp sergeant, nicknamed ""the Bird,"" who beat him regularly in psychotic fury. Zamperini was declared dead by the U.S. military. Yet he endured. As documented in ""Unbroken,"" after the war, Zamperini struggled to adjust. He drank heavily. He had trouble sleeping. He wanted revenge on the Bird. But, thanks to a newfound faith -- inspired by visits to Billy Graham's Los Angeles Crusade in 1949 -- and an unshakable spirit, he overcame his troubles and became an inspirational speaker. He established a camp for troubled youths called Victory Boys Camp. His wife, Cynthia, was a cornerstone of his life. They were married for more than 50 years, until her death in 2001. He also forgave his wartime tormenters, some of them in person during a 1950 visit to a Tokyo prison where they were serving sentences for war crimes. He was willing to forgive the Bird, Mutsuhiro Watanabe, though Watanabe refused to meet with Zamperini when he had the chance, in 1998, when Zamperini returned to Japan to carry the torch at the Nagano Winter Games. Scott Blackmun, CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, issued a statement offering condolences to the family and saying, ""We're proud to say that among his many accomplishments and triumphs, Mr. Zamperini was an Olympian. His fighting spirit was a true representation of Team USA and our country, both in Berlin and throughout his life. His presence will be missed."" Hillenbrand's book was released in November 2010. It remains on the bestseller lists almost four years later. Jolie's movie is scheduled to be released Christmas Day. ""It will be hard to make a film worthy of this great man,"" she told the Hollywood Reporter in 2013. ""I am deeply honored to have the chance and will do all I can to bring Louie's inspiring story to life.""

"(CNN)Here's a tip for traveling in Busan: whatever time you've allotted for a venue or attraction, triple it. No, quadruple it. Everything in South Korea's second largest city (after Seoul) is better than you think it's going to be, and you'll want more time to explore and enjoy. Case in point is Spa Land Centum City, a gigantic, modern jjimjilbang (Korean-style sauna/spa) located inside Shinsegae Department Store Centum City, reportedly the world's largest department store, which opened four years ago. Before seeing Spa Land, I had set aside an hour for a visit -- the usual amount of time I allot for soaking and scrubbing at a Korean bathhouse. Coming from Seoul, I was skeptical about how different one jjimjilbang could be from any other. The capital, after all, is well known for its extravagant spas. Boy, was I mistaken. A spa like no other . Centum City's Spa Land takes the jjimjilbang concept to an entirely new place. While Seoul jjimjilbangs tend to be mobbed 24 hours a day with families and groups of friends, Spa Land presents a more refined, upscale and leisurely experience. Despite state-of-the-art facilities, admission fees are reasonable -- ₩12,000 ($10.50) on weekdays and ₩14,000 ($12.25) on weekends. Students get a slight discount and -- here's an interesting kicker -- children under 13 aren't allowed inside, an unheard of concept in Korea, where families often make weekend rituals of jjimjilbang visits. Another unusual feature is the four-hour limit on stays. Most Korean jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and often serve as a crash pad for over-indulgent partiers, many of whom prefer to sleep off the effects of the night in a spa rather than face the repercussions of coming home late and smelling like the inside of a brewery vat. How to do Spa Land right . The first thing Koreans want to know about a jjimjilbang is whether the water is special enough to bathe in. The water in Spa Land's baths and pools is pumped from two types of hot springs that lie 100 meters underground, and which are sterilized 36 times a day. The ""sodium bicarbonate hot spring"" is the ""beauty bathtub,"" said by the spa to ""remove your dead skin cells and make your skin and hair shiny."" The ""sodium chloride hot spring"" is ""similar to seawater"" and has a ""heat-preservation effect"" that is ""good for blood circulation and helps to relieve pain from neuralgia and backache."" The spa ritual itself is familiar. Visitors change into cotton shirts and pants handed out at reception. Then they head to communal areas. There's a tarot card reading station set up near the entrance, but most people beeline past this and head straight for the outdoor foot bath area. Here there's a large heated pool for wading back and forth, as well as private booths where couples often play games on their phones while perched precariously above pools of water. Theme rooms . Spa Land has dreamed up a variety of themes for its many steam and sauna rooms. These range from extremely hot (I couldn't enter this one without yelping in pain) to extremely cold (the Ice Room has a cute, fake jellyfish aquarium) to the gimmicky. How gimmicky? The walls of the pyramid room are set at a 52-degree angle, ""which has been said to be the easiest angle to collect energies from the universe,"" according to the spa. The SEV room ""radiates electrons from SEV"" meant to ""metabolize your body rapidly."" The theme rooms are fun to take pictures in. The downstairs snack bar serves bingsu (a beloved Korean shaved ice dessert) and various vinegar drinks said to be good for the skin. Customers can take the snacks and eat them all around the bathhouse. Upstairs there's a restaurant and cafe run by chefs from the Westin Chosun Hotel. Alcohol consumption is limited to 500 ml per person, to prevent sauna accidents and overly rambunctious parties from disrupting the austere atmosphere. Bath time . My favorite spot in the spa is the outdoor rock pool in the women-only bathing area. I soaked under its sodium bicarbonate waterfall for a good 20 minutes before my appointment with the seshin ajumma (scrub ladies) in the scrub room. For 25 minutes I beached myself on a plastic slab, and gave myself over to the capable hands of a professional scrubber. Clad in black bras and panties (standard scrub uniform), she scoured my entire body with two loofahs. ""Young ladies are the most sensitive,"" she said in an amused voice when I squeaked a little. ""The older ladies always ask for the hardest pressure."" I emerged red and raw, but wonderfully clean. It was the best extra ₩20,000 ($18) I've ever spent in spa. Next time I'll plan on three hours for a visit. Make that four.

"(CNN)Grand jury proceedings are secret, and when no indictment is handed down -- as was the case for Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson -- the files remain locked up. But in an unusual step after a grand jury deliberation, transcripts of testimony that jurors heard considering Michael Brown's death have been released to the public. Late Monday night, officials made available 24 volumes of material, covering 23 meetings that the grand jury held between August 20 and November 21. A CNN team is going through all of the court documents. Here's what has emerged so far from that review: . Wilson had never fired his gun on duty before shooting Michael Brown, he told the grand jury. Asked if he had ever used excessive force before, he replied: ""I've never used my weapon before."" Wilson called the area where Brown was shot a ""hostile environment."" ""There's a lot of gangs that reside or associate with that area. There's a lot of violence in that area, there's a lot of gun activity, drug activity, it is just not a very well-liked community. That community doesn't like the police."" What's next for Officer Wilson? Wilson told the grand jury his original goal was to arrest Brown, after identifying him as a possible suspect in a shop theft. ""My main goal was to keep eyes on him and just to keep him contained until I had people coming there,"" he testified. ""I knew I had already called for backup and I knew they were already in the area for the stealing that was originally reported. So I thought if I can buy 30 seconds of time, that was my original goal when I tried to get him to come to the car. If I could buy 30 seconds of time, someone else will be here, we can make the arrest, nothing happens, we are all good. And it didn't happen that way."" Wilson told the grand jury he didn't normally carry a stun gun. ""We only have a select amount. Usually there is one available, but I usually elect not to carry one. It is not the most comfortable thing. They are very large. I don't have a lot of room in the front for it to be positioned,"" he told the grand jury. The officer testified he was carrying mace when he encountered Brown. Officer Wilson told the grand jury that Brown punched him in the face when the officer drove back to him. Wilson said he tried to get out of his cruiser but Brown slammed the door shut twice and hit him with his fist. ""I felt that another of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse ... I've already taken two to the face and I didn't think I would, the third one could be fatal if he hit me right,"" Wilson said. Twelve shots were fired by Wilson. Wilson said two shots were fired during a struggle at his police vehicle and that he then fired three bursts of gunfire as he chased and then backed away from Brown.  He testified that his Sig Sauer .40 caliber gun held a maximum of 13 bullets. Twelve casings were recovered and one bullet remained in the weapon, according to the grand jury documents. How prosecutor defended grand jury's decision . Wilson testified he shot at Brown on the street when Brown turned on him. ""As he is coming towards me, I tell, keep telling him to get on the ground, he doesn't. I shoot a series of shots. I don't know how many I shot, I just know I shot it,"" he said. ""I know I missed a couple, I don't know how many, but I know I hit him at least once because I saw his body kind of jerk,"" he said. Wilson testified that Brown did not slow down. ""At this point I start backpedaling and again, I tell him get on the ground, get on the ground, he doesn't. I shoot another round of shots,"" he said. ""Again, I don't recall how many him every time. I know at least once because he flinched again. At this point it looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making him mad that I'm shooting at him. ""And the face that he had was looking straight through me, like I wasn't even there, I wasn't even anything in his way."" He told the jurors he thought Brown was going to tackle him. ""Just coming straight at me like he was going to run right through me. And when he gets about that 8 to 10 feet away, I look down, I remember looking at my sites and firing, all I see is his head and that's what I shot. ""I don't know how many, I know at least once because I saw the last one go into him. And then when it went into him, the demeanor on his face went blank, the aggression was gone, it was gone, I mean, I knew he stopped, the threat was stopped. ""When he fell, he fell on his face."" Brown put his hand under his shirt into his waistband when he ran at Wilson, Wilson told the grand jury. ""He turns, and when he looked at me, he made like a grunting, like aggravated sound and he starts, he turns and he's coming back towards me,"" Wilson said. ""His first step is coming towards me, he kind of does like a stutter step to start running. When he does that, his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his side, his right one goes under his shirt in his waistband and he starts running at me."" Wilson was diagnosed with a bruised face after his confrontation with Brown, according to a medical report dated the day of the killing, August 9, 2014. No other injuries were mentioned in the report. He was prescribed Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory medicine commonly used to treat pain. The medical investigator did not take photographs at the scene of Brown's killing because the camera battery had died, the grand jury heard. The investigator, who goes to the crime scene to collect evidence for the pathologist, also did not take measurements of anything at the scene because they ""didn't need to."" The investigator, whose name was redacted, said: ""It was self-explanatory what happened. Somebody shot somebody. There was no question as to any distances or anything of that nature at the time I was there."" Typically, a medical investigator will take crime scene photos in addition to the ones taken by police investigators. The investigator testified that they did not see evidence of ""stippling"" (gunpowder) around the wounds on Brown's body. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .

"(CNN)Quick: Guess how old Jon Stewart is? I'll give you two hints: . Forty-ish, you say? Forty-five, maybe? Nope, 52. And isn't it incredible that someone that age -- or, anyone of any age, really -- could become the countercultural voice of multiple generations, from the millennials to the boomers. Stewart announced on Tuesday his departure as host of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show."" Incredibly, he'd recently started his 17th year on the show. In his signature Gen X-adjacent style, he joked that that was the longest he'd held any single job -- ""by 16 years and five months."" It's not like Stewart's dead. Or even gone from the show yet. That may not happen until later much later this year, he said. I feel no need to eulogize him. But the thought of nightly cable TV without him is a bit stunning -- for me, age 32, and for people of all ages, really, who get frustrated with the stilted earnestness of old-timey news programs, and who, likewise, are turned off by televised shouting matches and hype. He's a transcendent figure, in that sense. Someone who makes sense to the Snapchat set. And someone my dad might talk about over a round of golf. He'll be missed by everyone but the 2016 Republican candidates. On Wednesday morning, I asked my Facebook friends and followers what he meant to them. Several, including a former classmate, said he helped them process the 9/11 terrorist attack. ""(W)hen I was a terrified college freshman on 9/11, Jon Stewart's was the voice that made sense,"" wrote Chelsea Samuel. A Facebook user identified as Daniel Thomas Bailey posted a photo of Stewart visiting his base in Afghanistan a decade later, in 2011. ""His news is honest. He's honest,"" wrote a woman identified as Samina Hope. ""Which is so incredibly rare in this world now. He has a genuine heart for humanity. His broadcast of a little girl with autism who he afforded the opportunity to sing with Katy Perry, will forever bring tears to my eyes."" The satirical form Stewart pioneered will, of course, live on. It may well survive in Stewart's own work. In his farewell, Stewart said he was going to spend time eating meals with his family -- ""who,"" he said, ""I have heard from multiple sources, are lovely people."" He also left open the idea that he could work again. ""I don't have any specific plans,"" he said. ""I've got a lot of ideas."" But the form surely lives on in his impressive cast of alums. John Oliver's HBO show ""Last Week Tonight"" is among the finest, smartest (and awesomely angriest) pieces of social criticism that exists today. Just watch him skewer the Miss America pageant. This is sharp investigative journalism, made funny and relevant. Stephen Colbert, meanwhile, is about to get a higher profile on the ""Late Show,"" and we can only hope that he makes that program a little edgier and more interesting than it was under the sleepy-eyed watch of David Letterman. Plus, there's always an upside to change. I hope that Stewart's departure from ""The Daily Show"" may usher in a new era -- in which the viewpoints of a younger generation are represented not just by old-ish white men but by actual younger people. Hopefully, too, the post-Stewart era will include more women, more racial minorities and more LGBT people. This country laughs with Stewart, Oliver and Colbert. We love them. But they don't really represent all of us. Those critiques will have their day, surely. Today, however, I think it's important to celebrate the political satire that Stewart ushered in. We've all gotten a good laugh out of it. And, importantly, our democracy is better for it. Stewart, after all, wasn't just in it for the jokes. He asked tough questions of politicians. Found ways to make uninterested people care about politics. And he did it with a zany, effortless wit. Instead of a ""moment of zen,"" the odd-ball segment that usually concludes ""The Daily Show,"" I'll leave you instead with this clip of Stewart's farewell to his live audience. When you hear the crowd moan, that's because they realize, too, that he was the voice of so many generations. And, thankfully, his was a voice that didn't take itself too seriously.","John Sutter: Jon Stewart is the voice of millennials as well as baby boomers .
He will be missed as he departs from his post at ""The Daily Show""
But hopefully this will usher in a more-diverse era of American satire, Sutter says ."
"(CNN)It's a tough headline to swallow. Best burger in the world? Yeah, right. Cue the commenters getting carried away ""my burger joint is better than yours"" rants. Walk them past Fergbuger on the main street of New Zealand's adventure capital of Queenstown, however, and the doubters might quickly turn into believers. Colloquially known as ""Ferg's,"" the burger joint is swollen with customers who spill out every opening hour, happy to wait around an hour at peak times for a feed. And ""peak time"" describes most of the store's 21-hour day. International tourists can be seen emerging with their takeouts, delicately removing a Little Lamby (lamb burger) or Sweet Bambi (venison), reverently folding the brown paper bag with the treasured logo and carefully tucking it in a backpack. Next step, burger selfie straight to Facebook. ""My mates in Taiwan/Sweden/Canada/wherever are gonna be jealous of this. Big check mark in that Kiwi trip must-do box."" Like checking out the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Ferg's has become the compulsory stop in Queenstown. If Michelin stars were still dished out the way they originally were, Fergburger would bag at least a couple, arguably three. (""Exceptional food, well worth a special journey."") Among burger lovers anyhow. And on any given day (save Christmas when Ferg's closes for a breather) burger lovers pick from quite a big menu -- around 20 variants, ranging from the standard Fergburger to the Southern Swine (beef, bacon, avocado) to the Chief Wiggum (pork belly) to stuff for impurists like the Bun Laden (falafel), Codfather (cod) and Holier than Thou (tofu). Tasty origins . Ferg's opened in 2001, a true hole in the wall, hard to find place that quickly rose in popularity -- especially among the ski/boarding, backpacker and adventure crowd. It moved to its current location on Shotover Street a few years later. Slightly more room but still pretty cramped with 10 cooks and servers in the kitchen and 50 employees total. Close proximity burger-flipping and managing hangry (hungry meets angry) crowds makes for a tight and well-run bunch of employees. ""The staff has the philosophy that Ferg loves you -- we treat others the way they want to be treated, and I think that's really the key to our success,"" says Fergburger general manager Steve Bradley. The success comes in spite of the challenges of operating a 24-hour (including the three hours of cleaning each day) restaurant in a small resort town, with a limited and transient staff and difficult food supply lines for fresh produce. Where's Ferg? The secret behind Queenstown must-visit restaurant doesn't sound like much of a secret -- hand-make everything with fresh produce every day. The other secret isn't so well-guarded either. After shelling out a fair bit of coin for a bungee jump, Shotover Jet boat ride or day on the slopes, NZ$10 to $15 for a hearty burger is extremely appetizing. While Bradley is happy to discuss management-type stuff, he's less revealing when faced with tougher questions. Like, who the hell is Ferg? ""There are so many stories I don't even remember what the real legend is -- he may have been the first person to swim naked to Glenorchy or -- my favorite -- the first man to go down Shotover River in a barrel,"" says Bradley. Ferg's owner prefers to remain hidden from the public, and management refuses to say anything about him/her. ""We're about the customer and the product, and providing great service and fresh, honest food,"" says Bradley. While franchise offers have been coming thick and fast, Ferg management hasn't been swayed. ""We think we're in a really special, beautiful part of the world and that's been a nice part of our formula,"" says Bradley. ""It would have to take an extra special idea to entice us to go somewhere else."" The closest thing to another Ferg's is the opening of Fergbaker in 2011, a bakery next door that does a Kiwi favorite, the meat pie, proud. For hungry visitors to Queenstown, this is the fallback when Fergburger crowd's prove too big a mountain to climb. Fergburger, 42 Shotover St., Queenstown Town Center; +64 3-441 1232; open 8:30 a.m.-5 a.m., daily except Christmas Day. Recommended burgers: Little Lamby (Prime New Zealand lamb, mint jelly, lettuce, tomato, red onion, alioli, tomato relish), NZ$12.50 ($10) and Sweet Bambi (Wild Fiordland deer with a Thai plum chutney, lettuce, tomato, red onion, alioli).","Fergburger's fresh handmade burgers are Queenstown's best known secret .
So popular people often wait an hour for a burger .
Despite success, Fergburger hasn't franchised or expanded into a chain ."
"(CNN)I was on the phone with a friend in his junior year at my alma mater, UNC Chapel Hill, discussing his campus work and future goals, when his roommates relayed the news and he stopped, suddenly, and said: ""Mariem, Deah and his wife were shot. They are dead."" A ping of utter shock struck. Then dismissal. Denial. Thinking I must have misheard, I asked, ""You're kidding, right?"" Of course, I would never think that my friend or anyone else I know would make light of such a thing, but it was too heavy a loss to swallow so quickly. In the minutes and hours that followed,  I learned of the full magnitude of the situation. Deah Barakat, Yusor Mohammad and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, three beacons of light and honor in our communities, had each been shot in the head in their apartment, and died. It is difficult to put into words the rush of emotions that we all felt last night, and that continue to fill our hearts and bring pain to our souls. We lost so much in a matter of minutes. These three young Muslim Americans were active in their neighborhoods and communities, worked with local and international charities and relief efforts, supported their brothers and sisters in the Triangle community in their educational and professional pursuits, promoted love, tolerance and togetherness. They laughed with us, shared in others' pains and sorrows, offered relief, and put their actions where their words so constantly were: striving for a better, more just and more caring world. In the hours that followed, as police arrived on the scene and began their investigation, family and friends gathered in the clubhouse of the apartment complex, grieving, praying with one another and offering comfort to the parents and siblings of our fallen. Deah and Yusor were barely six weeks married, a story of love, respect and support that warmed all our hearts. Razan, Yusor's younger sister, was visiting her big sister and brother-in-law when they were killed. Police said their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, came into their home and shot them. I cannot imagine the sweltering hatred and utter disregard for human life that must have plagued the killer's heart and soul, but all must know and honor the kinds of people Deah, Yusor and Razan were to understand how terribly they will be missed. A second year dental student at UNC Dental School and a community youth leader, Deah was the only one of the three I had met. He was an awe-inspiring model of all the absolute best attributes of humanity, and I am blessed to have known him. Yusor and Razan, though I never had the great honor of meeting either personally, radiated the most wonderful and captivating aura as I have ever seen. They were beloved by all who knew them, and they all made us better people, better friends, better brothers and sisters to our siblings, better children to our parents, better citizens and better Muslims. For them, and for all of us, our Islam is our guiding light, our motivation, the lens through which we see the world and our places in it. Our Islam -- Deah, Yusor and Razan's Islam -- is the Islam of grassroots organizing, giving and promoting charity work, treating everyone with only the best manners and a smile, always a smile. Our Islam tells us to do what Prophet Jesus said and did, to ""honor thy neighbor as thyself."" These three did this every single day. Our Islam tells us to do what Prophet Mohammed said and did, to confront hate and evil with love and kindness. Deah, Yusor and Razan transformed this mantra into their lives' work and passion, and lifted us all up in the process. They say you may not remember what a person says, but you will always remember how they made you feel. Well, these three made everyone they ever met feel cherished, valuable, empowered and loved. My prayers and those of my family and friends are for their souls' everlasting peace and rest, for patience and strength to their families and loved ones to endure this tragedy, and for the God consciousness we all need to carry on after such devastating loss.","Three Muslim students near campus of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were shot .
Mariem Masmoudi: Our prayers are with Deah Barakat, Yusor Mohammad, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha ."
"(Mashable)The Knickerbocker in New York City opens its doors to guests on Thursday, more than a century since John Jacob Astor IV built the hotel. Designed in the Beaux-Arts style, ""the Knick"" first opened on October 23, 1906, and the building has collected many anecdotes -- like being the (rumored) birthplace of the original martini -- in the years since. At its opening in 1906, the hotel was marketed as having ""prices within the reach of all."" ""While the Knickerbocker has not exactly furnished itself with a motto, the manager and his assistants will tell you that they are running 'a Fifth Avenue Hotel at Broadway prices,'"" the New York Times wrote of the opening. ""Between the hours of 1 and 6 o'clock the fifteen-story structure on the southeast corner of Forty-second Street and Broadway was thronged with visitors,"" the Times wrote. ""The lobby, on the Forty-second Street side, was much admired by the host of visitors, and all paused to take a look at the representation of Father Knickerbocker in the entrance hall."" Rates in 1906 averaged $3.25 a day (or about $78 in today's dollars after adjusting for inflation), according to the Times. Unfortunately travelers are unlikely to come by a room at that price in 2015: Room rates on the Knickerbocker's website start at $446. When John Jacob died on the Titanic in 1912, his son Vincent took over, eventually closing the hotel in 1921. As for why he closed it, speculators have blamed either prohibition, or a lack of interest in (or ability to afford) elaborate accommodations. Mashable: Watch an implosion reduce this Las Vegas hotel to rubble ... almost . In the years afterward, the building changed ownership several times. It was converted to offices and housed Newsweek magazine from 1940 to 1959. The Knickerbocker was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and designated a New York City landmark in 1988. Landmark status brings with it certain protections for the exterior of the structure, which made the restoration complicated, according to the Knickerbocker's managing director Jeff David. Exterior details — like the copper lion heads around the rooftop terrace — were meticulously preserved while the interior was completely redone. ""We're embracing the hotel's original DNA, while simultaneously offering guests intuitive service and relevant luxury,"" David said in a statement. ""The Knickerbocker's history is something that most luxury hotels cannot offer."" Texas-based FelCor Lodging Trust, which purchased and funded the $240-million redevelopment of the Knickerbocker, owns more than 70 hotels in the U.S., according to the Wall Street Journal. The company originally planned to open the hotel in late 2013, later revising the date to 2015. Times Square has changed nearly beyond recognition since the hotel first opened. Whereas the 16-story structure used to stand out, it is now surrounded by high rises and is one of the few Beaux-Arts buildings left. Mashable: Norway musicians play instruments made of ice . The original Knick welcomed ""glitterati and dignitaries,"" according to the hotel, and famous guests included F. Scott Fitzerald, who set a chapter of ""This Side of Paradise"" in the hotel bar; Italian operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, whose wife gave birth in one of the rooms; and John D. Rockefeller, who ordered those original martinis with his Wall Street friends. There were 556 sleeping rooms and 400 baths in the original hotel, accommodating about 1,000 guests. The newly-opened hotel will have 330 guestrooms, including 31 suites. For history buffs, there is one part of the Knickerbocker that unfortunately will not be re-opening: The sub-level ballroom, with a direct entrance from the subway platform. Mashable: What a night in New York City looks like from 7,500 feet . When the hotel was built, the nascent subway was so exciting to John Jacob Astor IV he had a door — still visible today — installed to provide direct access to one of the early lines. The area behind the door -- a corridor leading to the upper levels of the hotel -- is owned by the MTA, which apparently isn't interested in how much 21st century New Yorkers would be interested in a restored subway entrance. The lower-level parlor was elaborately decorated in the hotel's early years, but now sits in disrepair. David expects the history of the hotel -- with or without a refurbished subway parlor -- to attract guests. ""By drawing inspiration from our past to create a lifestyle experience that is beyond typical luxury hotel amenities, The Knickerbocker will undoubtedly appeal to both local New Yorkers and international travelers,"" he said. © 2015 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN)It's hard to believe Johannesburg didn't exist 130 years ago. It used to be a dusty, one-horse kind of place where a few farmers eked out a living from the land, although traces of early human habitation go back millions of years. Modern Johannesburg was born with the discovery of gold. Almost overnight, it became one of the fastest-growing cities in the world as fortune-seekers rushed in. The stories that make up the Joburg's past shape its character today, rewarding visitors who venture beyond the sanitized streets of wealthy Sandton to discover the real heartbeat of Egoli, the ""City of Gold,"" as it is also known. It has golden foundations . The richest city in South Africa, Joburg is also one of the biggest economies in Africa  overall -- its wealth built upon that discovery of gold in the late 1800s. ""There was no indigenous population, no water and the only reason for this city's existence was the discovery of gold,"" says Nechama Brodie, editor of The Joburg Book, a guide to the history of the city. ""It laid the foundation for everything else that happened, even the layout of the roads."" Within a few years, Joburg had become like an African Las Vegas, its wagons and tents transformed into brick buildings and the dusty gathering places become thriving market squares. But the wealth came at a cost: poverty forced many black Africans to work in the mines and they lived in terrible conditions. Nowadays, gold is no longer such a significant part of Joburg's economy. But that frontier spirit -- a sense that anything is possible -- remains and continues to attract people. Gold Reef City, south of Joburg (+2711 248 6800), provides a glimpse of the city's golden past. Sure, it's a bit kitsch but the recreated mining town features an original mine shaft you can ride down and you also get the chance to pan for gold. Standard Bank in the CBD or Central Business District (5 Simmonds St.) features a small museum around a mine shaft inside the building, and from the top of the 50-storey Carlton Center (152 Commissioner St.; +2711 308 1331) you have a good view of the mine dumps surrounding the city. Past Experiences (+27 11 678 3905) is one of the best companies for walking tours around the CBD. Everyone's from out of town -- originally . Everyone in Johannesburg seems to come from somewhere else. That contributes to the openness of the place compared with places such as Cape Town, which can feel cliquey to outsiders. ""Everyone in Joburg is a migrant, whether they [their families] arrived here 125 or two years ago,"" says Jo Buitendach, founder of a company, Past Experiences, which runs tours of the city center. ""Joburg is the whole of Africa, or the world, in one city -- you could be eating braaied fish cooked by someone from the Democratic Republic of Congo in Yeoville one minute and then Pakistani street food in Fordsburg the next."" Different ethnic neighborhoods reflect the various communities that moved here a century ago in search of riches -- Fordsburg has an Indian feel while old Chinatown in Ferreirasdorp in the CBD and new Chinatown in Cyrildene are the best places for a curry or dim sum. Many of the migrants found the streets were not paved with gold, and that was especially true of black Africans. Mine workers living in rundown hostels were eventually forced out of the city to live in townships such as Alexandra and Soweto. Today, it's wealth rather than legislative segregation that means many people still face very long commutes into the city. A great place to learn about the history of migrant labor is the Workers' Museum, in a vividly restored former Newtown hostel (52 Jeppe Street; +27 11 492 0600). Joburg was at the center of the anti-apartheid fight . The people of Joburg, and especially Soweto, were instrumental in the struggle against apartheid. Nelson Mandela moved to the city from the Eastern Cape to study at Wits University and opened the first black law firm in South Africa with another ANC activist, Oliver Tambo, at Chancellor House in downtown Joburg. The restored building (corner Fox and Gerard Sekoto Streets) now houses a ground-floor photographic museum. Also worth a visit is Liliesleaf Farm in the affluent northern suburb of Rivonia (7 George Avenue; +27 011 803 7882), where 19 ANC activists including Mandela were arrested and brought to trial leading to his imprisonment for 27 years on Robben Island. Music and the arts played a significant role in the anti-apartheid struggle, and the Johannesburg neighborhood of Sophiatown was at the heart of this cultural movement in the 1950s. Legendary musicians such as Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela played in the jazz clubs of this then racially integrated area that was the first target of forced removal of black people in the 1950s. Today, the spirit of Sophiatown is being revived through arts projects. The Sophiatown Heritage and Cultural Center (cnr Edward and Toby Streets; +2783 550 7130) runs walking tours in the area. Some of humankind's oldest traces have been found here . Johannesburg has one of the longest recorded histories of human habitation in the world. The earliest residents can be traced back 3 million years -- their presence preserved in a World Heritage Site called the Cradle of Humankind (+27 14 577 9000) 50 kilometers north of the city. The area has been the scene of some of the world's most important paleontological finds, including the perfectly preserved hominid skeleton ""Little Foot."" Maropeng, the visitor center housed within a giant grassy mound, has displays showing humankind's journey through time. You can also walk through the Sterkfontein Caves, scene of some of the most exciting archaeological finds in the area. Museum Africa (121 Bree Street, Newtown; +27 11 833 5624) has a wide range of displays exploring Africa's first civilizations. Melville Koppies (Judith Road, Emmerentia; +27 11 482 4797), a nature reserve in the heart of Joburg with evidence of Stone Age settlements, is a good place to escape the hectic pace of the city. It's inadvisable to go here alone, so join a guided walk.","Modern Johannesburg was born 130 years ago, after gold was discovered .

"(CNN)Ashley McIntyre had no idea who Danny Robinson was when she heard he was searching for a kidney. He was the same age as her and had already been through so much. Diagnosed at age 16 with IgA nephropathy, an inflammatory kidney disease, Danny had been in kidney failure since 2012, the same year he lost his father to brain cancer. The Louisville, Kentucky, electrician was working full time and undergoing four-hour stints of dialysis three nights a week to stay alive while he waited for a transplant. On January 16, 2014, Ashley overheard her mother telling her grandmother about Danny. The young man and his mother had just been on a Louisville radio talk show sharing their story. None of his family members had been eligible to donate their kidneys, and the anonymous donors who volunteered weren't compatible. Ashley immediately felt compassion for this soft-spoken stranger. The next day was her 25th birthday. She got a hold of Danny's mom through the radio host and said she couldn't think of anything she'd rather do for her birthday than give someone the gift of life. Woman to become living donor for a man she had never met . Before she had heard Danny's story, she was always signed up to donate her organs after her death, but she had never considered being a living organ donor. Danny had Type O blood, meaning he could only be matched with a Type O donor. She knew she had the right blood type. She would need to undergo a series of other blood tests, physical and psychological exams to see if she was eligible to give Danny a kidney. Ashley and Danny were deemed a perfect match for the transplant. What are the odds that they would fall in love? ""Never in a million years did I think it would be a perfect match all the way around and end up like this,"" Ashley said. Danny's mom, Denise Stutzenberger, says even before she met Ashley, she was convinced her son would end up marrying her. ""I told her, 'You are going to be my daughter-in-law, you just don't know it yet,' "" she said. ""I don't know how to explain it. Something in me told me."" More than 100,000 Americans need a kidney, and fewer than 17,000 people receive one each year, according to the National Kidney Foundation. Less than 6,000 of those come from living donors -- and fewer than 200 living donors are like Ashley, with no connection or relation to the person in need. Ashley didn't want to meet Danny or his family until she found out it was a go. ""She was so scared that she was going to let us down. All I wanted to do was hug her. She was our angel,"" Danny's mom said. The two families grew close in the months leading up to the transplant on April 17 at the University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington. The night before their surgeries, Danny gave Ashley a musical jewelry box inscribed with the words, ""Ashley, you're an angel ... Danny."" It played ""I'll Be There"" by the Jackson Five. Memorial Day weekend, with the transplant behind them, the couple sensed they had a deeper connection but proceeded cautiously. ""We both agreed we did not want to mess up the relationship between us or our families, because by that time we were connected for life,"" she said. On June 5, Danny asked Ashley to be his girlfriend. They've been inseparable ever since and are expecting a girl, Berkli, in June. Danny proposed on Christmas. Ashley does most of the talking; she's the one who gives you a sense of their love. Danny isn't really one to talk about his feelings. ""I guess you can say we just fell in love,"" he said. ""I told her I wanted to be with her forever."" Danny will take anti-rejection medication for the rest of his life, but he said he's healthy now. Ashley's kidney won't last forever, however. Whenever it fails, in an estimated 20 to 30 years, ""I will be doing whatever I can to help him get a new one,"" she said. ""I wish I had 50 kidneys to give him."" Ashley says it's been a whirlwind romance. ""I feel like my feet haven't touched the ground,"" she said. ""It's just been an incredible, unexpected, serendipitous journey.""","CNN invited readers to share their stories of true love .

"(CNN)Editor's note: This story is part of a series highlighting superlatives of countries around the world. Click here for pieces on Italy, the United States, Canada and South Korea, and watch for upcoming installments featuring other countries. With 23 million people crammed onto an island that covers just more than 36,000 square kilometers, Taiwan ranks among the 20 most densely populated places in the world. Although the industrious island has built a global reputation for cheap electronics, this is one Asian tiger that offers far more than stickers on the backs of calculators. Economically there's little it has left to prove, but Taiwanese people remain a  proud and determined bunch. Here are 10 things they do better than anyone else. 1. Night markets . For an island smaller in area than Switzerland, Taiwan sure has a lot of night markets -- an estimated 300 island-wide. These open-air bazaars are particularly loved for street food, referred to locally as xiao-chi, literally ""small eats."" Perennial favorites are oyster omelets, stinky tofu and an assortment of snacks on a stick straight off the grill. Specialty drinks range from bubble tea to shots of snake blood. According to the Taiwan Tourism Bureau, some 70% of tourists to Taiwan will visit a night market. The top three Facebook check-ins for 2013 in Taiwan were all night markets; Tainan Flower Night Market (12th globally) nabbed the top spot, followed by Luodong and Feng Chia night markets in Yilan and Taichung, respectively. 2. Themed restaurants . If literal toilet humor (eating out of miniature urinals and toilet bowls) is your idea of an amuse bouche, Taiwan provides a belly full of laughs. Modern Toilet restaurants address taboos pertaining to dining etiquette, posing witty rhetoric on websites such as: ""To eat or to pee? Now that is the question."" At the other extreme, you can get a cutesy overdose at a Hello Kitty namesake cafe, where everything from burger buns to soup bowls is shaped like the mouthless cartoon cat. (For more on the kitty obsession, read point 9 below.) What's that? Can't get enough pink and glitter? That's OK, because Taiwan is home to the world's first Barbie-themed restaurant, with Mattel-approved smotherings of pink plastic and frilly tutus. Previous themed restaurants in Taiwan have included a cafe based on an Airbus A380, complete with trolly dollies serving food and drinks from a cart, as well as restaurants with jail, hospital and school-inspired themes. 3. Free WiFi . Since 2011, Taiwanese citizens have been able to log onto iTaiwan, the island's free WiFi network. Taiwan is one of the first places in the world to offer free WiFi on a mass scale. In June 2013, the service was rolled out to tourists in four of the five largest cities, using more than 4,400 hotspots. Visitors can sign up for an iTaiwan account with their passport at Taiwan Tourism Bureau centers and offices in transportation stations, then receive complimentary WiFi in Taipei, New Taipei, Taichung and Tainan. More: Taiwan offers free WiFi to all foreign tourists . 4. Chinese artifacts . You might think it'd be in Beijing or Shanghai, but the National Palace Museum in Taipei houses the largest collection of Chinese artifacts and artwork in the world. The impressive permanent collection comprises more than 650,000 items. Chinese history is told through bronze statues, jade carvings, calligraphy, lacquerware and other historical pieces -- many of which belonged to Chinese imperial families -- including an intriguingly life-like, meat-shaped stone and a jadeite cabbage. Despite several rounds of building expansion, only a fraction of the collection is on display (no more than 10,000 items at any one time), making the museum worth returning to several times a year. 5. Animated news . With an army of about 400 animators, Next Media Animation (NMA), a Taiwan-based animation studio, can turn any news story into a cartoon in as fast as 90 minutes ('making-of' video here). More impressively -- the videos are usually satirical, outrageous and hilarious. The studio, created by a Hong Kong media tycoon, takes infotainment to another level. Founded in 2007 to create CGI-animated videos for news without real footage for Apple Daily News in Hong Kong and Taiwan, the talents of Taiwan's animators were exposed to the world with the 2009 release of their hilarious video of what might have happened during Tiger Woods' infamous car crash. In the video, now ex-wife Elin Nordegren chases Tiger Woods' car with a golf club after finding out about Woods' affair. After the video went viral, the company decided to service international audiences in Japanese and English. Some of the team's most popular recent works include a video about the execution of Kim Jong-un's uncle and a review of five stories that must die in 2014. 6. Mock meat . One of the world's most vegetarian-friendly destinations, Taiwan offers 6,000 or so restaurants serving an impressive variety of delicious vegetarian fare to feed the 10% of the country that shuns meat. But while it can't beat India in terms of the abundance and variety of vegetarian dishes on offer, Taiwan is the best place to hit when you're craving meat but don't actually want to eat any. That's right, we're talking about mock meat. Given how important flesh is to the traditional Chinese diet, it's no surprise Taiwan's fake meat -- usually made of soy protein or wheat gluten -- can fool even hardcore carnivores. Yes, there have been scandals that revealed actual meat inside supposed mock meat dishes. But it's is a thriving industry here and is considered a staple across Taiwan. Mock meat stir-fries in particular taste surprisingly like the real thing. 7. Little League baseball . Baseball may be Taiwan's most popular sport -- diamonds are almost as common as dumplings around the island. Taiwan holds the record for the most Little League World Series championship titles (17), nearly double that of its closest runner-up, Japan. Adding to a cabinet of trophies, a team from Taiwan won the 2013 Junior League Baseball Junior World Series. 8. National health coverage . In a year when the Obamacare debacle played out in global headlines, it's worth to noting that Taiwan has what many call the best universal healthcare system in the world. Legal residents can visit any specialist in the country. Docs anywhere will pull up their entire medical record via smart card, consult and prescribe Chinese medicine and/or prescription drugs. Fees are billed directly to and reimbursed by the National Health Insurance Administration, whose 2% administrative costs are the lowest in the world. 9. Hello Kitty obsession . Taiwan's obsession with the Japanese-born Sanrio character doesn't stop at feline-themed restaurants. Taiwan holds the distinction of being the first in the world to be honored with Hello Kitty-branded beer. Brewed by Taiwan Tsing Beer, the drink purred its way onto the shelves earlier this year. The light brew features fruity flavors, from lime to a distinctly avant garde banana infusion. Eva Airways in 2013 made headlines with the resurrection of its themed planes, which feature the ubiquitous cat on everything from exterior liveries to headrest covers to fruit, which is cut in the shape of you know what. Eva Airways' dedicated Hello Kitty Jets site offers horizon-expanding trivia, including Hello Kitty's height (five apples tall) and weight (three apples). The Grand Hi-Lai Hotel in Kaohsiung offers Hello Kitty-themed rooms, the cat's iconic ribbon and/or silhouette stamped on everything within eye(sore)'s reach. Pink kitty curtains, kitty bath amenities, kitty tea set and a radio that plays Hello Kitty music are all involved. Not reaching for the insulin shot yet? Then you can book a breakfast date with a talking and moving ""live"" Hello Kitty. 10. Little dumplings . Yes, we recognize xiaolongbao as a delicacy homegrown in Shanghai, but Taiwan is slowly taking over the dumpling world, one broth-filled bite at a time. Starting from a single shop in Taipei, Din Tai Fung now serves its famed xiaolongbao in destinations as far flung as Australia, Thailand and the United States. Two of its Hong Kong branches have earned a coveted Michelin star, with the mothership Xinyi store in Taipei sneaking into the Miele Guide. Not bad for a chain restaurant, and not a ""fancy"" one at that. When Tom Cruise visited Taiwan in 2013, he joined in on the 18-pleats-per-dumpling action with a cooking class at the shop's Taipei 101 branch. Even better? CNN put Din Tai Fung at number two on its list of best franchises for travelers. With additional reporting by Hiufu Wong .","About 70% of Taiwan tourists will visit a night market .

One woman, aged 23, is suspected of preparing for acts of terrorism and the second, aged 33, is suspected of failing to disclose information, a police statement said. Both were detained at their homes in the town of Walsall, north of Birmingham, on Wednesday morning by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. They are currently being held at a police station in the area, police said.

"(CNN)The announcement that Kayla Mueller, the 26-year-old held by ISIS, has been killed has thrust the question of how -- and whether -- to negotiate with extremists back into the spotlight. Mueller's grace, demonstrated in the letter she wrote to her family while being held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, was inspiring. And although the letter was clearly written under duress, that duress could not diminish the strength and beauty of her spirit. I'm thankful that I found out about her, but I'm also angry at how I did. I am, of course, not alone in being outraged by ISIS' recent spate of hostage-taking and executions. And that raises another interesting question: Is ISIS miscalculating? It goes without saying that the so-called Islamic State is no more about Islam than the Nazis were about Christianity.  They are about self-aggrandizement and shocking sensationalism.  They are commodities dealers.  They trade human beings for money, weapons and most importantly, publicity. But ISIS found themselves in over their heads with the reaction in the Middle East to how they murdered Moath al-Kasasbeh, the Jordanian pilot -- burning him alive in a cage. Previously, the group had been successful at using its murder videos for recruitment -- every outcast in the world seemed a little jealous of the masked miscreant nicknamed ""Jihadi John."" In contrast, al-Kasasbeh's death brought down swift and powerful condemnation of ISIS and its tactics from across the Muslim world. Yet even as ISIS were broadcasting video of the pilot's killing, they were also trying to figure out how to deal themselves out of the situation they found themselves in with Mueller. After all, holding a Western female humanitarian aid worker is a delicate negotiation, even for the seasoned commodities dealers that ISIS have become. Indeed, there was a similar episode back in 2004, when the group's mentors, al Qaeda in Iraq, held humanitarian aid worker Margaret Hassan. The courageous Hassan was ultimately murdered by her captors, but the backlash to her death was also swift. There is, simply, no good way to spin murdering a woman who isn't your enemy, who has done you no harm and who has actually done a great deal of good for those in a region you profess to represent. And spin is what this is all about; if there is the potential for good publicity, then there is also the potential for some very bad publicity. So what do the opportunistic serial killers masquerading behind masks and a religion do?  They see the Jordanian retaliation as an opportunity to rid themselves of a commodity they don't know what to do with. But the idea that a Jordanian bomb would somehow kill only a hostage and none of their oddball lot is ridiculous. And reading between the carefully worded statements by the White House, it is clear that our government is not buying this story that ISIS peddled, either. But what should our government be doing now? For a start, it must recognize that this battle is not just on the ground, it's three-dimensional.  ISIS is telling us they care very deeply about their PR, otherwise they wouldn't work so hard at it. But it is also important to realize that the most dangerous negotiation is the one you don't know you're in.  With that in mind, we should remember that ISIS started negotiating with the world with their first video -- they just don't want you to know that's what they're doing.  Instead, they hope the debates veer off into a debate over whether this is a conflict of Muslim versus Christian. And every single time anyone in the Western world wonders publicly why Arab nations aren't being more vocal in condemning ISIS, we play into their hands.  Whatever validity you think that argument has, it's hard not to feel a little uncomfortable that we are even engaging in the very debate and discussion that the enemy wants us to. And on the issue of hostage taking specifically? After about a year of slowly getting familiar with the United States government's actual policy on kidnapping, our policy implementers are finding out that it is actually quite good.  The policy says, in essence, that we're not afraid to talk to anybody. Nor should we be. President John F. Kennedy once said we should never negotiate out of fear, yet we should never fear to negotiate.  I'd suggest taking that principle one step further: We don't negotiate with terrorists. We negotiate against them.","Christopher Voss: ISIS is about self-aggrandizement and sensationalism .

"(CNN)Three defendants have been sentenced to prison for their roles in the hate crime death of a black man in Mississippi who died after being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck in 2011, U.S. authorities said. Deryl Paul Dedmon, now 22, was sentenced to 50 years in prison; John Aaron Rice, 21, to more than 18 years; and Dylan Wade Butler, 23, to seven years, federal authorities said this week. Each defendant had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in the death of James Craig Anderson, 48, authorities said. ""The defendants targeted African-American people they perceived as vulnerable for heinous and violent assaults -- hate crimes, motivated solely by race, that shook an entire community and claimed the life of an innocent man,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Seven other defendants are awaiting sentencing, authorities said. The three defendants admitted they and others conspired to harass African-Americans with beer bottles, sling shots and vehicles in attempt to injure them, authorities said. The defendants targeted blacks who were homeless or drunk ""because they believe that such individuals were less likely to report an assault,"" authorities said in a statement. ""The co-conspirators would often boast about these racially motivated assaults."" After a birthday party for a mutual friend, the defendants and other conspirators agreed to assault blacks, authorities said. Rice, Butler and other occupants in a Jeep found Anderson in a motel parking lot about 5 a.m. on June 25, 2011, in Jackson and ""decided that Anderson would be a good target for an assault because he was African-American and appeared to be intoxicated,"" authorities said in a statement. Rice and a conspirator distracted Anderson while they waited for Dedmon to arrive. Dedmon and two conspirators arrived in Dedmon's Ford F250 truck. Rice first punched Anderson in the face to knock him to the ground, and then Dedmon punched Anderson in the face several times while he was on the ground, authorities said. As the defendants and conspirators left the lot, one shouted, ""White Power!"" Just before getting back into his truck, Dedmon also yelled, ""White Power!"" Dedmon then ""deliberately"" ran over Anderson, causing injuries that killed him, authorities said. Rice, Butler and a number of the conspirators then gave false statements to police about the incident, authorities said. Anderson's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb. Watch: Incident caught on video . The killing prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 175,000. Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack, which took place after a night of drinking in largely white Rankin County, outside Jackson. The gang of teens climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove 16 miles to the western edge of Jackson. They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. He was standing in the hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp. On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. After the beating, some of the teens left and others got into the green Ford truck. At this moment, Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck. Shortly afterward, Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. ""I ran that n----- over,"" he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car. Drew Griffin and Scott Bronstein of CNN's Special Investigations Unit contributed to this report.","Deryl Paul Dedmon, 22, is sentenced to 50 years .

"(CNN)It might be in New Zealand, but the resort town of Queenstown feels as much like Aspen or Chamonix as it does Dunedin, its largest urban neighbor. Along with abundant adventure-travel offerings, the onetime gold rush hub is big on beauty: the aptly named Remarkables mountain range forms a dramatic backdrop to serene Lake Wakatipu, which shimmers on a sunny day with countless tiny glacial motes suspended in its waters. Queenstown neighbors Arrowtown and Lake Hayes add gold-mining heritage and nature exploration into the mix. The extraordinary setting and an international outlook have made this little corner of New Zealand's South Island a trans-seasonal center for cool-climate pinot noir, adventurous gastronomy and quirky design, galleries and hotels. Here's a small sample of what the area has to offer. Aggy's Fish and Chip Shack (Queenstown) Right on the shore of Lake Wakatipu, this tiny, much-loved kiosk serves beer-battered, deep-fried fresh scallops and oysters, fish and chips and idiosyncratic Kiwi fare such as whitebait (tiny, whole freshwater small fry), smoked eel and muttonbird. Muttonbird? No, New Zealand doesn't have sheep on wings. An acquired taste, this former staple of Maori and colonial sailors is the fledgling of local seabirds, with a dark, oily meat that some say tastes more like mutton than fish. Corner of Marine Parade and Church Street, Queenstown; +64 3 442 4076; open daily, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. The Spire Hotel (Queenstown) The subtle signage and unassuming dark frontage on a small lane off Church Street set The Spire apart from the chain hotels and lodges that dominate Queenstown. The five-star hotel started as a pet project for the original, design-loving owner-operators. They fitted out the property with limestone cladding, Italian leather upholstery and a collection of modern art and design classics before two sisters took over a couple of years ago. Each of the 10 suites has an Eames recliner, Phillippe Starck lighting and Bang & Olufsen phones. There's a popular cocktail bar and restaurant on site,  No. 5 Church Lane.

It reveals its history through preserved period details. Original wallpaper in some of the tiny rooms, for example, shows the height of flood levels in years past. Satisfyingly creaky wood floors offset international contemporary furniture and home wares on sale, along with a nicely edited range of prints and other art. Vesta Design Store, Williams Cottage, 19 Marine Parade, Queenstown; +64 03 442 5687; open daily, 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Pacific Jemm Cruises (Queenstown) New Zealand's longest lake, Lake Wakatipu also has some of its coolest waters.

The 24-meter Pacific Jemm, with wood-paneled interior and cabins for overnight stays, can be chartered for sailing or fishing trips. Pacific Jemm Cruises;  +64 27 442 7973 . Dorothy Browns Cinema (Arrowtown) Little Arrowtown must be one of the few places in the world of its size with its own arthouse cinema. Of the two cinemas, it's the smaller one, ""The Den"" (reservations recommended), that shows mainly independent films. Mainstream movies, including some in 3D, are shown in the main cinema, which has Chinese-silk ceilings and chandeliers. Both cinemas have big, cozy seats and warm possum-fur throws. The adjacent bar and cafe is home to a discerningly stocked little bookshop.

Locally foraged gooseberries and South Island scampi are on the menu, alongside homemade prosciutto and striking flavor combinations such as flash-fried beef cheeks tempura-style on cauliflower mousse. The schist-walled stone building in the center of Arrowtown's historic precinct (15 minutes' drive from central Queenstown) has a roaring fire in winter, a courtyard for outdoor eating and range of local wines. Saffron, 18 Buckingham St., Arrowtown;  +64 3 442 0131 . Nadene Milne Gallery (Arrowtown) This is yet another stop along geranium-lined Buckingham Street, an impressive gallery atop a set of iron steps.

"(CNN)A Belgian court convicted the leader of an Islamist group and several of his followers on terror charges Wednesday for sending jihadist fighters to Syria, in a case in which 46 people were accused. Fouad Belkacem, the leader of the Sharia4Belgium group, was jailed for 12 years by the court in the city of Antwerp, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, Fabienne Nackaerts, told CNN. Of the 46 people accused in the case, 36 could not be found and their arrests were ordered in their absence, a news release from the Antwerp court said. Of the 10 who appeared in court, one was acquitted. Most of those who could not be found are thought to be still fighting in Syria or to have died there. Those accused of being leaders in the terror group were sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison and fines of 24,000 to 30,000 euros ($27,170 to $33,940), the court said. Those accused of active membership of Sharia4Belgium without leadership roles were given lesser sentences. The offenses were committed in Antwerp and Brussels in Belgium as well as in Syria and Turkey between 2010 and 2014, the court said. The court ""also established that Sharia4Belgium has played an active role in the departure of several Syria fighters,"" it said. Radical British preacher Anjem Choudary's name was mentioned several times by the prosecutor during the Antwerp trial as having helped Belkacem set up Sharia4Belgium. Choudary acknowledged to CNN that Belkacem had consulted with him in 2010 on establishing the group, whose name refers to Sharia, or Islamic, law. Speaking after the sentence Wednesday, Choudary said: ""I believe nowadays in Europe if you call for Sharia you are considered to be guilty. Abu Imran (an alias for Belkacem) was just doing his Islamic responsibility. ""In 2010 he came to see me and he asked about how to set up a branch of our own body that we had in Britain. Sharia4 Belgium was under our own guidance. Abu Imran helped set up branches in Holland and France. ""I am extremely proud and I love Abu Imran and all the members of Sharia4Belgium."" Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN last August that he believed the ISIS extremist group would spread rapidly and be in Europe and the United States within decades. As of September, 350 Belgian citizens were known to have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join Islamist extremist groups fighting there, the Belgian Interior Ministry said then. Given Belgium's relatively small Muslim population, this is a high number, compared with other European nations that have seen radicalized citizens head overseas to fight. Authorities fear some who return will seek to carry out attacks motivated by jihadist ideas. Belgian authorities last month carried out a series of counter-terror raids on a suspected jihadist cell amid fears that its members were plotting an imminent attack on Belgian soil. A federal prosecutor said they planned to target police officers. Toxic mix that makes Belgium fertile ground for terrorism . CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Radical UK preacher Anjem Choudary says convicted leader was just doing his Islamic duty .

"(CNN)A swell of excitement is building in Australia after the nation woke up to the news it will be a wildcard entry in perhaps the biggest, brashest, most talentless singing contest in the world: the Eurovision Song Contest. ""Move over Azerbaijan"" was the common sentiment on Twitter as Australia mulled which of its performing artists was up to the task of waving a sequined Aussie flag in Austria in May. A few naysayers pointed out discrepancies in the world map. But if Britain's Prince Philip can have an Australian knighthood, why can't Asia-Pacific's biggest land mass muscle in on a traditionally European contest? Perhaps it's even time to change the name? Eurovision explained the logic in an effusive press statement pointing out that Australia's inclusion would help the contest ""walk the talk"" of this year's theme ""Building Bridges."" ""It's a daring and at the same time incredibly exciting move. It is our way of saying; let's celebrate this party together!"" said Jon Ola Sand, the contest's executive supervisor. As Dr. Eurovision -- aka academic expert Paul Jordan - points out in his blog, the contest already includes countries outside Europe. Azerbaijan? Israel? ""Having a country over the other side of the world take part is entirely in keeping with the general ethos of the competition,"" he wrote. ""Eurovision is huge down under, 3 million people watched the show last year. With so many European expats (and those Aussies of European descent) it makes sense for Australia to be invited to the party."" This year marks 60 years of the contest, which will pit performers from 40 countries against each other for the honor (and the huge expense) of hosting the event in 2016. The competition is known for its kitsch songs and outlandish performances. Last year it was won by bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst. This year, Australians will be allowed to vote in the semi-finals and grand final, which is watched by some 195 million people worldwide. Some even dared to dream.... what if we win? The nation that loves Eurovision also loves to gamble. So it wasn't long before Sportingbet offered odds on who would take on the formidable task of out-Eurovisioning the experts. Early favorites were ""X-Factor"" entrant Samantha Jade, former ""Australian Idol"" winner Guy Sebastian and  fellow ""Idol"" singer  Jessica Mauboy (who performed in the interval last year). Outside bets were placed on cricketer Brett Lee and actor, producer and singer, Russell Crowe. The bookie is paying out $251.00 should Prince Philip appear on stage. Stranger things have happened.","Australia will be ""one-off"" entrant to mark 60 years of Eurovision .

"(CNN)Not long ago, two lifelong friends talked about all the cool gifts the little kids they knew were getting for Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that celebrates the end of Ramadan. Omar AbdelBaky, 24, jokingly complained that when he and Deah Shaddy Barakat grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, they didn't get fancy toy helicopters. Barakat, 23, asked his friend for his address. Two weeks later, a delivery guy dropped one of those helicopters at AbdelBaky's door. ""That's who Deah was -- he gave without thinking twice about it. I want people to know that about him -- he was such a kind person,"" AbdelBaky said. A day ago, Barakat, his 21-year-old wife Yusor Abu-Salha, and her 19-year-old sister Razan Abu-Salha were shot and killed at the Barakats' home in Chapel Hill. Barakat worked tirelessly to raise money in the hope of providing dental care to Syrian refugees in Turkey.  Yusor Abu-Salha brought young women together in her community, forging strong friendships while she also focused on school. Razan Abu-Salha was a talented artist. It was so hard, AbdelBaky said, to conceive of so much life suddenly snuffed out. All three of them were known for their dedication to service, said Suzanne Barakat, Deah's older sister. ""They all had so much to offer, and I just want to make sure that we continue that legacy for them...and that all of us Americans, collectively, do not let their deaths go in vain,"" she told CNN. At a press conference on Wednesday, she asked authorities to investigate the ""senseless and heinous murders"" as a hate crime. It's a possibility police say they're considering. Suspect Craig Stephen Hicks has been charged with murder. Deah Barakat was a dental student. Yusor Abu-Salha had wed her husband about a month ago and had just moved in with him, AbdelBaky said. She had been accepted to UNC-Chapel Hill's dental program and was set to begin classes in the fall. Razan Abu-Salha was a student at North Carolina State University. A Facebook tribute page for the three featured her work as a videographer and an artist. A post with video footage of her putting together a 3-D model says the university recently recognized her for her art. ""She was wonderful!"" someone wrote. Another picture shows Yusor Abu-Salha's father twirling her around at her wedding. Mohammad Abu-Salha told CNN his daughters were always trying to serve the community. ""They all volunteered in downtown Raleigh many times a year to feed the homeless and the hungry,"" he said. ""They cooked loads of food. They came heartbroken to me to tell me how many grown men they've seen, standing in line, waiting for a bite."" Yusor Abu-Salha also went on a volunteer mission to help at a dentistry clinic for Syrian refugees in Turkey, her father said. Her husband did, too. And they were planning another mission trip to Turkey this coming summer. The family, he said, is devastated by their deaths. His wife is so heartbroken she's unable to speak. ""We're in shock,"" he said. ""Two children of ours, and our son-in-law...three outstanding, stunning, clean-cut, exceptional, articulate, intelligent, dedicated, charity-working kids, involved in community work, volunteer work, the whole nine yards, the best you can imagine an American kid to be."" Six weeks ago, Suzanne Barakat said she was crying tears of joy at her baby brother's wedding. ""Today,"" she said, their family is ""crying tears of unimaginable pain."" ""My brother, Deah, was a 6-foot-3-inch young man who had the kindest heart, who loved everyone he met, greeted strangers with hugs and dedicated his life to service,"" she told CNN's ""AC360."" He was well-known for his love of basketball. And he made dental school look easy, she said. ""He loved it. He loved what he did. He loved playing with the children when he was working abroad,"" she said. ""He was happy in everything that he did, and he made it light, and people loved being around him for that."" The son of Syrian immigrants, Deah raised money to provide dental care to Syrian war refugees. He had already managed to collect at least $10,000, AbdelBaky said. More money poured in after his death. By Wednesday afternoon, the fundraising web site showed more than $140,000 in donations. ""That is amazing,"" his sister said, ""and we want to continue that and we want them to be remembered for that."" The tribute page features a video of Deah Barakat explaining that he hoped to go to Turkey and provide free dental procedures for Syrian war refugees. He said he planned to work with 10 other dentists to hand out toothbrushes and paste at refugee camps and show good oral hygiene and teach refugees how to care of themselves. ""Have you ever felt helpless about the situation in Syria and felt like you can't do anything about it? Well, this is your opportunity to help..."" he said. ""These kids don't have access to the same health care as us. And their prolonged pain can easily be taken care of with the work that we do."" By Wednesday night, the page had more than 82,000 likes. Last week, Barakat gave out toothbrushes at a homeless shelter. His parents taught him and his older brother and sister the importance of generosity, friends said. AbdelBaky remembers attending massive dinners at Barakats' home where many laughed and ate and told stories all night. Last year, Barakat's mother made lunch for his dental class of about 80 people, driving the home-cooked goodness from Raleigh to Chapel Hill. When Barakat attended North Carolina State University, where he met his wife, he dreamed of becoming a dentist, his friend said. ""Dentistry was a great fit for Deah -- you can get people out of pain and fix smiles and make people happy,"" AbdelBaky said. He was ambitious and hard working, friends said, but he always knew how to play. Basketball was his game and he was always organizing pickup games. Mariem Masmoudi's brother shot hoops with Barakat this week. She said Yusor Abu-Salha was planning to get some girlfriends together this week to hang out, talk about life and discuss the importance of living a just life according to religious principle. It saddens her immensely when she thinks about the optimism all three shared, suddenly snuffed out. ""There was so much love and so much joy and happiness,"" Masmoudi said. The Barakats ""were really an adorable young couple. I don't know how to say it ... they really radiated this kind of light. They radiated humility, kindness, love. You couldn't help but be inspired by them."" CNN's Jason Carroll, Eliott C. McLaughlin and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","They were ""the best you can imagine an American kid to be,"" father says .

Houston's death was ruled an accidental drowning. But many questions remain about what happened to Brown. The family isn't saying much. Neither are police, though they've said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation. Though little concrete information has surfaced, rampant rumors certainly have. The speculation prompted Brown's family to admonish some media outlets, saying ""the desire to be 'first' has clouded the judgment of many reporters."" Cops questions Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend . So here is what we know, and don't know, about the case: . What we know: . She's in a medically induced coma. Early last week, sources close to the family said she opened her eyes briefly and suffered seizures. What we don't know: . The extent of her injuries. We also don't know what prompted doctors to induce her coma, or what the reported seizures and eye-opening mean. What we know: . Nick Gordon was one of the two people who reportedly found Bobbi Kristina Brown unresponsive in the tub. Brown called the 25-year-old her husband, but her father's attorney said the two were never married. Gordon was taken in -- but not formally adopted -- by Houston when he was 12 years old. A family friend says he's not welcome in Brown's hospital room. What we don't know: . Why Brown called Gordon her husband when she didn't appear to be legally married. In January 2014, she tweeted a picture of wedding rings, along with the words, ""#HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove."" ""GoodAmbreakfast for MYHusband,"" Brown also tweeted. ""Surprise baby!

"(CNN)Qwaider Al Nabulsi is an unremarkable place, at first glance. The clue is in the glamorous Indian woman standing out front waxing lyrical to a group of hungry looking tourists. The setting is a Palestinian-Jordanian restaurant in Dubai (Qwaider Al Nabulsi, Al Muraqabat Street; +971 4227 5559), the tourists are refugees from the city's culinary mainstream, and the woman is Arva Ahmed -- underground food guide extraordinaire. Ahmed is talking about the history and variety of Middle Eastern cooking. She rat-a-tat-tats to the assembled crowd about the spartan dishes of the Yemeni Bedouin and moves on to the love of vegetables in the fertile crescent through Turkey, Lebanon and Syria. Then she pauses as waiters appear from the restaurant to satisfy the food cravings Ahmed has stirred up. Onion and chili paste-stuffed falafel is the reward: like the restaurant it looks ordinary, but the dish is phenomenally tasty. The gooey, cheesy, sweet kunafa pastry served up afterward is likewise delicious. More: CNNGo in Dubai: The extravagant edition . Food-tourism pioneer . Frying Pan Adventures, Ahmed's walking tours around a series of unheralded Dubai restaurants, are partly an opportunity for her to share her love and knowledge of favorite Middle Eastern dishes, but she is also something of a pioneer for a different kind of tourism in the city. From a culinary point of view, Dubai's known for its outpost restaurants for celebrity chef empires. They tend to be stuck in an ostentatious tower along with strange spa treatments and a rooftop pool. Ahmed aims to show off an older, far less extrovert part of Dubai. Her beat is the Deira area on the north-eastern side of Dubai Creek, where her family has lived since 1989. Breakfast stop . Breakfast to Breakfast (Al Rigga Road, +971 4222 3566) is the second stop on the tour. Ahmed admits she avoided going here for a long time. It looked like a fast food joint -- and Dubai has no shortage of those. And so it was, but not of the chain variety. ""It does the best manousheh -- a Lebanese take on pizza,"" Ahmed says (and why not have pizza for breakfast?). It's fired briefly in front of us in the oven, then stretched out ultra-thin so it won't dominate the toppings -- which include sujuk, an Armenian sausage. More: Six things you shouldn't find in the desert . Food market forces . Getting Frying Pan Adventures off the ground wasn't just a case of showcasing neglected, but delicious, food from everyday, working Dubai. It was also about fighting the corner -- make that establishing a corner -- for small, entrepreneurial tour companies among the big, mass market operators. ""In Dubai, you tend to have to be recognized and to throw a lot of money at something, to make it happen,"" Ahmed says. ""But that's changing -- small ideas are beginning to take off."" Birth of a food blog . Thirty-year-old Ahmed was born to an Indian family living in the neighboring Emirate Sharjah, who moved to Dubai when she was six. After living in the United States for a while as an adult, she returned to Dubai in 2010 to help with her father's non-food-related business and began writing a food blog -- ""I Live in a Frying Pan."" She soon found her ideal subject: Dubai's unsung culinary centers. She took pride in locating homely looking joints that excelled in one particular dish. That quest led to finds such as Al Tawasol (Al Rigga Road, +971 4295 9797), a Yemeni restaurant with what resemble private indoor tents complete with Bedouin carpets, at the back. The key dish here is mandi -- buttery chicken designed to be eaten, thoroughly messily, with the fingers. Apparently, the practice stems from traditional water-saving techniques: no plates equals less washing up. More: Best Dubai brunches: The good, the very good and the 'drunch' A culinary conversation . It took a conversation with a friend to spark the idea of using Ahmed's knowledge of the Dubai food scene to set up walking tours. She thought she would only have to do a two-week tour-guiding course before she got started but she hadn't reckoned on Dubai bureaucracy -- resembling some ancient desert defensive system. ""There are a lot of checks and balances, which is good for keeping out rogue operators, but it stifles creative ideas,"" she says. ""The system is designed for veterans, and makes it extremely hard for an outsider to try anything."" Or fry anything. The irony is that Frying Pan Adventures -- finally launched in January 2013 -- offers precisely the more unusual sorts of experiences Dubai tourism chiefs are trying to promote. Dubai goes countercultural . That's right: Dubai is brushing out the hair gel, washing off the fake tan, putting the gold jewelry in a back drawer and going a little countercultural. In a bid to hit a target of 20 million tourists a year, the city-state's Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing wants to pump a lot more money into what it calls cultural and heritage tourism. AKA: things you can do in Dubai that don't have ""seven-star"" tacked in front of them. So, Ahmed could soon be riding a wave. Already she's having to turn people away to keep the small group ethos. When tourists hate tourists . She seems to have discovered an important and potentially lucrative truth: tourists often don't like other tourists. ""They get wildly excited when they see a restaurant with no one like them in it,"" she says. Like at Abshar (Al Maktoum Road, +971 4233 0555) an Iranian restaurant on the first floor of a non-descript mini-mall. It's one of Ahmed's favorites -- for its freshly made eggplant dip, bread sliding out of a roaring oven on wooden paddles and its rich fesenjoon stew of chicken, pomegranate and walnut.

"(CNN)From waterfalls in a forest to the beach haunts of movie stars, a number of scenic day trips are just a few hours' journey from Rio de Janeiro. Introducing three of the most popular day trips from the city: the tropical island of Ilha Grande, the splendidly preserved 17th-century colonial town of Paraty and the fishing-village-turned-beach-hotspot of Buzios. Ilha Grande . With its hiking trails and isolated beaches, this tropical island and former pirate roost makes for a perfect downshift from the buzz of Rio. Its dense forests have changed little since it served as a base for smugglers and adventurers a few centuries ago. A two-and-a-half hour trip from Rio, the tiny hamlet's business these days is ecotourism. Prior to that it was a fishing port and the site of a prison torn down in the 1950s. Cars are banned on the island and the focus is on human-powered transit -- hiking, kayaking, swimming. Boats and schooners can be rented for trips to several superb beaches on the island. Trails spanning 150 kilometers wend through forests that are home to a number of endangered species, from the maned sloth to the brown howler monkey. The trail to one of the peaks on the island, Pico do Papagaio, offers a rare, close look at what remains of an Atlantic Forest. The island's most popular beach, Lopes Mendes, turns up regularly on roundups of top Brazilian beaches. Getting there requires a taking a boat or schooner to a 20-minute trail through the jungle. Other beautiful beaches to check out include Lagoa Azul and Lagoa Verde. The official Ilha Grande website has information on transportation, accommodations, tours and services. READ: Insider Guide: Best of Rio . Paraty . A four-hour trip west from Rio on the scenic Costa Verde, Paraty is a time capsule of colonial-era Brazil, with cobblestone streets and wood-beamed architecture. A former distribution center for the gold mines of nearby Minas Gerais, the town was shaped by the gold trade, which died out in the late 1800s. The town's well-preserved past and fine restaurants, cafes, music and festivals have made it a tourist attraction and cultural hub. Its vibrant festival season runs late spring to early summer. The medieval Festa do Divino Espirito Santo is held around May 30 (50 days after Easter). The cowboy country-style Sao Joao Festival, celebrated throughout Brazil, kicks off festivities June 24. The San Antonio Festival is on June 13 and San Pedro is on June 29. Located near 300 beaches and 65 islands, the town is a great base camp for exploring neighboring areas. The official Paraty website has information on transportation, accommodations, tours and services. READ: Powerful flavor: Rio's incredible juice bars . Buzios . A resort getaway a few hours east of Rio, Buzios is one of Brazil's top beach playgrounds. It became popular with the jet set thanks to Brigitte Bardot in the 1960s, when the French actress became a regular at what was then just a small fishing village. In recognition of her role in putting the place on the map, one of the streets is named for her -- Orla Bardot -- as well as a movie theater. Since those days, the village has grown to become a major beach destination for travelers around the world. The cosmopolitan resort now attracts a wide range of visitors, from surfers to honeymooners to the St. Tropez set. READ: World's 12 sexiest accents . The town's cobblestone main drag, Rua das Pedras, has a roaring nightlife scene, with restaurants, bars and clubs lining the road. The main attractions in Buzios are the beaches -- the resort is situated on a peninsula that has 23 of them. Windsurfers frequent the windy eastern side, while tranquil coves for snorkeling and diving can be found on the calmer western side, especially the languid waters of Azeda beach.. The most popular surf spot is Geriba, home of wind-blown surf and flanked by bars, cafes and partyers. Kite surfers and windsurfers head to Ferradura and Ferradinho.

"London (CNN)The operation guarding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, is ""sucking our resources in,"" police say, as costs spiral to more than 10 million pounds ($15.3 million). Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe says the operation is being reviewed, as there's ""no doubt it's a drain."" Assange has been living in the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. The Australian national has not been charged and denies the claims, saying he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. On the operation to prevent Assange from fleeing the embassy, Hogan-Howe told LBC Radio that Metropolitan Police were looking at ""how we can do that differently in the future, because it's sucking our resources in."" Asked if that meant fewer officers stationed around the clock outside the embassy, Hogan-Howe added: ""We won't talk specifically about our tactics, but we are reviewing what options we have."" The cost of providing a constant police presence ready to arrest Assange should he emerge from the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, is estimated at 10 million pounds, a Scotland Yard spokesman told CNN. Assange has said the extradition warrant should be thrown out because, in part, Swedish authorities refuse to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy, thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he says should have concluded long ago. Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online. After it published the procedures manual for the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2007, it posted documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies. In August 2010, Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Assange over the allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers. He turned himself in to London authorities the same year, and was remanded in custody. At the time, a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden, and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court. It denied his appeal. In June 2012, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum, which was granted in August of the same year. He's been living at the embassy in London since then. Elaine Ly contributed to this report.","There's an operation guarding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN)When the Costa Concordia and its salvage convoy finally depart Giglio, the residents of this picturesque Tuscan island will breathe a collective sigh of relief -- and shed a collective tear. Nothing much ever happened on Giglio before the doomed cruise liner crashed here on that fateful Friday the 13th in January 2012. There were the odd inconveniences, like when bad weather stopped the ferries and cut off the island from the mainland, leaving the local population of about 900 people with limited supplies. The island had its fair share of tourists, but according to Mayor Sergio Ortelli, Germans came to camp and there were pockets of British who came to bird watch, but none of them left much of an impact. ""We were a perfect place, a best kept secret,"" he told CNN. That all changed shortly after the Concordia ran aground, killing 32 passengers and crew as it capsized and then sank into the pristine coral reefs near the harbor on the eastern side of Giglio. Within a few weeks of the disaster, foreign salvage crews moved in, first to defuel the crippled vessel and later to remove it. Italian with a Tuscan accent was no longer the language of commerce on the island. If the local businesses wanted to cater to the crews -- some 600 workers from 29 different countries at the height of the operation-- they had to learn at least a little bit of English, Dutch, German or Spanish. The languages have infiltrated the local dialect. The locals have also had to adjust their menus and hours of business to accommodate the crews' varied tastes and round-the-clock shifts. Suddenly, Giglio's bars and pizza joints found themselves serving lunch fare at night for the workers who needed packed lunches for their graveyard shift -- and beer at 7:00 am for the workers who were just coming in off the rigs who wanted an after-work drink. ""Our whole perspective changed,"" Rosalba Brizzi, owner of Bar Fausto in the center of the port -- a favorite spot for the salvage crews -- told CNN. ""No one ever challenged our way of doing things before. We were set in our ways and then suddenly our little island had to adjust to one of the most diverse populations anywhere in Italy. Can we go back to how we were before? I don't know how to do that."" Brizzi is one of the lucky Giglese whose business boomed when the crews came. She offered up a ""lunch to go"" service to make packed lunches for the crews to take on site, and allowed Titan Micoperi -- the firm behind the salvage of the Concordia -- to set up a credit system so workers could sign for their meals. And despite being forced to serve bacon and egg baguettes and chicken salad sandwiches with pickles, which she said she has yet to sample, she says she will miss the workers when they go. ""Our lives have been so enriched by this experience, and I don't mean monetarily. I've met people from Samoa, from South Africa, from places I had never heard of,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""They've brought their families, they show us pictures from home. And now we will lose them all. They won't come back."" The sentiment is echoed along the port, where locals have given the ship nicknames like ""the tomb,"" ""the dead whale"" and the ""astroship."" Trudy Brandaglia, an Australian who has had a tourist rental business on the island for nearly 30 years, said the salvage workers have become like family. ""We will miss them terribly,"" she told CNN. ""We are going to be lost without them."" The Giglese have adamantly refused to capitalize on the crash through tourist trinkets. You won't find t-shirts that say ""I got wrecked on Giglio,"" or even models of the ship. But the island does have two memorials to the 32 victims of the disaster and the Spanish diver who died during the salvage operation. One is a plaque with the victims' names engraved on it affixed to the stone wall of the pier closest to the wreck. The other is a statue of the Virgin Mary donated by the husband of Maria Grazia Trecarichi, one of the last victims to be found. The statue's neck is adorned with rosaries left by passengers and survivors' families who have come to pay their respects on the island. Father Lorenzo Pasquotti of the local Catholic church, which was a shelter for hundreds of passengers the night of the accident, has also created a museum in the church that includes life jackets from the ship, hard hats, a piece of rock from the bottom of the cruise liner and a tiny vial of oil from the Concordia's engines, almost like a relic of blood from a saint. He also keeps a loaf of bread, meant to signify the feeding of the salvage crews, and the crucifix and communion tabernacle from inside the Concordia's chapel. Pasquotti also keeps the cards and letters passengers have written to Giglio to thank the islanders for their help. But Pasquotti's church has scars, too. There is a crack in the apse from the underground drilling to remove the ship, which he says the workers have promised to patch up. The crews working under the direction of Nick Sloane, the man overseeing the world's biggest ever salvage project, have also been toying with the idea of leaving some sort of memorial made from the implements of salvage. According to Sloane, workers have discussed building a funicular from the port to the town of Castello, high on a hill overlooking Giglio's port. They may also try to leave behind some of the high-end fiber optic cables that were installed to give the island better Internet and phone service as crews hatched their plan to raise the Concordia. Giglio remains the epicenter of one of the most technically-advanced salvage operations on the planet, but you still can't buy a cellphone or computer charger anywhere on the island. Whatever emotional scars from the shipwreck remain on the island, the physical scars are worse. No matter how diligently crews work to clean up the implements of salvage, Giglio is indelibly marked with signs of the unspeakable tragedy that happened here. Giglio's pristine underwater ecosystem has been marred by the 30,000 bags of cement and grout poured into the reef, along with the pillars drilled deep into the island's bedrock in order to support the giant steel platforms that cradled the Concordia for most of the past year. When all of the cement and steel is finally removed, the seabed will have to heal itself.  All of the underwater grasses and mollusk fields that were relocated when the ship crashed will have to be moved back, even though they are thriving in their new environment. Divers working on the site say the ship has also created a bizarre unnatural reef where fish and sea snakes swim among the pillars and in and out of the ship's broken windows. Several local dive companies want to create a new reef and dive school using the steel platforms that propped up the Concordia. But Gian Luca Galletti, Italy's environmental minister, says that is not an option, even though the Giglese have been presenting redevelopment plans that include keeping the platforms in place. ""The platforms will be dismantled,"" Galletti told CNN, before adding that this was an Italian decision -- not one that could be made solely by the people of Giglio. ""We have always hypothesized from the beginning that Giglio would be returned to the same state as it was before the shipwreck and there were no platforms before the shipwreck."" Franca Melis, who owns a popular restaurant in Castello and a dive company in Giglio's port, disagrees. ""It is a mistake to remove them when we could have one of the best dive sites in the world if we leave them,"" she told CNN.  ""It will disrupt the seabed for another two years to pull them out, like a rotten tooth from the seabed. Let's try to see the bright side and use them to bolster the local economy."" ""When the ship is gone, it will be like this island is dying twice. Let's try to save ourselves. We are going to die here without that boat.""

"(CNN)Endless dunes, scrubby vegetation, camels. Dubai seems to have contemplated the kinds of things you'd expect to find in a desert and responded: irrigate! And so it has, planting not only botanical gardens but record-breaking botanical gardens, ski slopes complete with penguins (no, not a mirage) and dozens of greens, fairways and golfing water hazards. The secret? Well, desalinated water provides some of the countless gallons of water needed to realize these dreams but another source is somewhat dirtier. 45 million flowers . It takes a lot of water to maintain any kind of garden in the desert -- but imagine trying to keep 45 million flowers in bloom. That's the task for the team behind Dubai Miracle Garden, a seven-hectare attraction that opened in February in the sands just outside the city limits. Visitors are confronted with a riot of colorful -- some would say gaudy -- patterned flower beds, creative vertical displays and manicured lawns. With precipitation such a rarity in Dubai -- it falls on fewer than 25 days a year, on average -- the plants are kept hydrated using waste water and a drip irrigation system. A butterfly garden is next on the cards here and, this being Dubai, there are already world records to boast of -- the longest (800 meters) wall of flowers, the world's biggest flower clock and the tallest flower pyramid. An effort not to be sneezed at. Dubai Miracle Garden: Al Barsha South 3, Barsha/Dubailand; +971 4 422 8902; general admission: $5.40 per adult. More: Best Dubai brunches: The good, the very good and the 'drunch' Fairways and greens . Golf shouldn't be a desert sport. While all that sand might be good for bunker practice, lush fairways sound rather fanciful. However, this is the UAE, which seems to have staked its reputation on creating real-life mirages. The emirate has more than 20 golf courses -- but how do they keep the greens green? The answer's dirtier than you might hope. ""We use treated sewage effluent for irrigation,"" among other sources, says Mark Tupling, agronomy manager at Jumeirah Golf Estates.

You'll find birdies of a different kind, and a taste of wetland wilderness in an unexpected locale, at the Ras al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary on the northern edge of Dubai. Some 20,000 birds of 67 species make their home in these saline lagoons, which are fed by the Dubai Creek inlet and protected from the city's ever-expanding urban development. Waders such as egrets, spoonbills and flamingos, as well as raptors including ospreys and greater spotted eagles, give a real feeling of wildness next to the ultra-urban environment of Dubai. Ras al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary: Al Khail Road, Ras al Khor, Dubai; +971 4 606 6822; entrance is free but visitors must register at the Dubai Municipality website. More: Best falafel in Dubai -- and the woman behind it . Penguins and snow . Rather surreal, a small colony of 20 king and gentoo penguins recently took up residence in the emirate's Ski Dubai attraction and can be observed marching across the artificial snow-covered slopes. Even without the penguins, a winter sports arena in the desert is more than a little incongruous. Occupying 25,000 sq meters of the huge Mall of the Emirates, the self-styled indoor ski resort opened in 2006 and boasts five separate runs, complete with chairlift and tow. Basically one giant refrigerator, temperatures are kept at -1C during the day, then dip to -6C at night when cooled water is blasted out of an overhead snow gun and turned into new snow. Ski Dubai: Mall of the Emirates, off Sheikh Zayed Road, Dubai; +971 4 409 4000. Two-hour ski passes cost $55 per adult. Full-day passes are $83 per adult. Penguin encounters from $40. Fun runners . Given that most advice for getting about in the desert around Dubai is to travel inside an air-conditioned 4x4 and not over-exert yourself for fear of heat stroke, the sight of a gaggle of runners pounding the outback highways is a strange one. Temperatures often exceeding 40C do not, however, deter participants in the Dubai Desert Road Run, a 10-kilometer race following empty asphalt roads through the dunes. Races are held around six times a year, including in August, when the race kicks off at 6 a.m. to avoid the worst of the summer heat. Dubai Desert Road Run, +971 4 420 6001. Races start from The Sevens Stadium, Al Ain Road, Dubai. Entry fee for the 10-kilometer race: $22; three-kilometer fun run and junior race options also available. More: CNNGo in Dubai: The extravagant edition . Water slides . In times gone by, when Bedouin trekked across the Arabian desert in search of water sources, the thought of people floating down a nearby river on rubber rings, or riding an artificial wave on a boogie board, would have been considered the stuff of mirages. But now there are not one but four big water parks in the UAE -- Wild Wadi (+971 4 348 4444) and Aquaventure (+971 4 426 0000) in Dubai, Dreamland in Umm Al Quwain (+971 6 768 1888), and Yas Waterworld in Abu Dhabi (+971 2 414 2000).

"A video from 2011 has resurfaced showing American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn discussing how easy it is to buy guns in the United States and urging fellow radicals to do so. In the video, the California-raised Gadahn said militants should arm themselves for attacks on Western governments. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" said Gadahn, ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" Al Qaeda supports lone wolf terrorists abroad and has emphasized shootings, which require less specialized training than bombings or other attacks and may have a better chance of succeeding. The Army psychiatrist accused in the Fort Hood massacre in November 2009 and the suspect in the shooting of two U.S. servicemen at Frankfurt airport in early 2011 allegedly were inspired by al Qaeda. Gadahn isn't new to sharing his thoughts through video. In 2006, he praised those who took part in the 9/11 attacks and called President Barack Obama a ""devious, evasive and serpentine American president with a Muslim name."" However, the video released in June 2011 has found new life on buzzfeed.com amid the drive for new gun control laws in the United States following last December's school massacre in Connecticut. Federal law requires background checks on gun sales from licensed dealers and proposed legislation in the Senate would expand the mandate to gun shows and Internet transactions. Still, Gadahn was wrong about the ease of buying a fully automatic weapon. It is illegal under federal law to do so from anyone but a specially-licensed dealer, and additional permission is required as is a background check. Are they legal? Yes. Are they as easily obtainable as Gadahn suggests? No.","Video from 2011 shows al Qaeda spokesman discussing ease of buying a gun in the U.S.

Instead of texting, try talking, and actually engaging.  You know, like Tarzan and Jane did. ""I teach people how to meet people.  What I'm working to do is to get people you know off their phones and engaging with people,"" says Anthony Recenello, a self-described ""Social Development Coach."" While chucking the smartphone out the passenger side window is probably unrealistic, Recenello says going lo-tech can heighten ones chances of truly connecting: . ""The ability to just be there present with another person is the thing that people are losing."" On a course as complicated as dating, there's no reason to ride solo -- especially with so many experienced travelers available for assistance. As a part of Thursday's episode, Spurlock checks in with a professional ""wingman,"" several professional matchmaking services and multiple profile coaches, all of which boast an ability to keep daters on track. ""We do the work for you.  We meet everyone,"" explains Talia Goldstein, founder of matchmaking service ""Three Day Rule.""  ""When we find a great match, then we set you up on a date."" Of course few singles are as outgoing and charismatic as Spurlock, so an online dating coach may be a better way of staying the course.  In ""Money can buy you love -- or at least make you dateable,"" CNN breaks down a collection of sites offering everything from assistance with profile writing to live dating advice. On a roadtrip of any length, falling asleep at the wheel is a cardinal sin; cruising for companionship is no different. As the ""Inside Man"" explores individual landmarks this week, one constant theme remains: stay awake, and keep on coming.  In visiting with ""OKCupid,"" one of the world's premier dating sites, Spurlock learns of creating ones own path to a successful relationship: . ""OKCupid's philosophy is that you don't need to wait for destiny to take its course when you could use a mathematical model instead to find your one true love."" In the same way a safe driver crunches the numbers on an odometer or fuel gauge, an OKCupid member deals with data in the form of a relatively simple algorithm: . ""We let people weigh an importance.  So like if you really, really care about scary movies or whatever you could max it out or if you just don't care then you could give it a zero basically,"" details Chris Rudder, one of the site's founders.  ""So the match percentage is actually really simple.  There's not like calculus or anything."" And whether it's virtually online, through ""OKCupid,"" or literally on line, like in a local watering hole, the secret to success is keeping one's foot on the proverbial pedal.  Behind the ""OKCupid"" curtain, it's revealed that increased activity on the site -- posting photos, regularly checking in -- rewards users.  Meanwhile, at Spurlock's urging, the habitually single Raja steps outside of his comfort zone and buys someone a drink at a bar. ""Well that was nice ... there is an interest that is for sure,"" he reports, furthering the notion that while being overly aggressive will cause you to crash and burn, a squeaky wheel will almost certainly get oiled first.  ""I had a real connection."" Alas, the road to true love has forever been a complicated one, often full of twists and turns.  But with Morgan Spurlock at the wheel, the latest episode of ""Inside Man"" (airing Thursday at 9 p.m.) sets out to handle dating detours and lead even the most sour of relationship lemons out of their respective rut. More on dating in the digital age .","Dating in the digital era can be a rocky road, but in the forthcoming airing of ""Inside Man,"" Morgan Spurlock looks to redefine the road trip ."
"(CNN)If laughter is the best medicine then Patrick ""Salvado"" Idringi should be Uganda's chief doctor. The comedian's blend of laugh-out-loud humor and cheeky charm has brought him widespread following in his home country and abroad, and even landed him inside the pages of Vogue. However, he has followed an unorthodox path to success, having spent years working as a switch engineer for one of Uganda's biggest telecoms companies. It was only when he entered a comedy competition on the encouragement of his sisters and came second that he realized he could make a living out of his funnyman persona. ""I left my job in 2011 because I was making unserious money by being serious. I realized you can make serious money from being unserious,"" Salvado says. But leaving secure employment with a regular monthly paycheck had been far from easy, and the comedian had to quickly learn the ropes of being a freelance performer. Some gigs would offer beer instead of payment, but Salvado soon realized that that wasn't going to help him pay his rent. ""Leaving my job was one of the hardest moments of my life, especially the first month, because I wasn't sure how I was going to make ends meet,"" he says. He even entertained the idea of returning to his old job, but in the end stuck with his new profession. ""I was patient, because deep down in my heart I knew it was going to work. I didn't know how long it would take, but I definitely knew it was going to work,"" he says. Salvado mines his own personal experience for his show material, and attributes his success to his openness to talk about subjects that some comedians in Uganda might avoid, such as sex, love and death. He says that, while he loved engineering, he always felt something was missing, and that he wasn't using his full potential, but that comedy has helped him grow as a person. ""When you do a joke today, there's no way you're going to do it tomorrow. So you're challenged to do something better, you're challenged to use your head, to use your mind, to use every part of your body to the best of your ability,"" Salvado says. ""It has helped me actually exploit most of the things that I didn't know I could do. So I should say comedy has changed my life.""","Patrick 'Salvado' Idringi is one of Uganda's best known comedians .

"(CNN)Walter Cronkite had a golden rule for all wartime reporters: never self-aggrandize. Even though Cronkite had been the first reporter to fly over the beaches at Normandy on June 6, 1944, he minimized the experience. When asked decades later whether he had flown over Utah or Omaha Beach, Cronkite shrugged. ""I think it was Omaha,"" he said. ""We didn't know about those names then, of course. All I knew was the beach. I didn't even know how extensive the landings were."" Such self-deprecating responses regarding his own WWII experiences became de rigueur for Cronkite. He gained credibility by dialing back his valor. Considered the ""Dean of the Allied Air War,"" for going on U.S. bombing missions over Nazi Germany, Cronkite, a reporter for the United Press, insisted he was nothing more than a nervous-nelly fly-on-the-wall. Although Cronkite had once crash landed in a Dutch potato field under enemy fire, he chose instead to focus on celebrating the liberation of the Netherlands at the hands of the Free Dutch. ""They pelted us with tulips until our car was fender deep in them,"" Cronkite recalled. ""Tulips are heavy flowers. In bundles they are dangerous. The only blood I spilled in the war was that day -- hit by a bunch of tulips tied together with a piece of wire."" Cronkite was Brian Williams's all-seasons' hero, and Williams was one of the heirs apparent to the Cronkite tradition. ""I was a Cronkite groupie by the age of 6,"" Williams once told me."" ""At our household, dinner was hinged on Walter's saying 'And that's the way it is.' Only then could the meal get served. That was the mid-1960s, and I continued to travel with him from the age of polyester to the age of his ever-thickening sideburns and beyond."" Cronkite, however, retired from CBS News in 1981, just as cable TV was beginning to blossom. For Williams to be the Cronkite of the Internet Age on NBC News, he had to be dramatic, not steady; pithy, not ""aw shucks""; au courant, not a throwback to the days of Lowell Thomas. Everybody trusted Cronkite because he reminded them of their favorite uncle or trusted family physician. Being square in the age of the Beatles made Cronkite retro cool. Williams, at his heart, is the broadcast news nerd extraordinaire -- everybody's friendly neighborhood TV news anchorman writ large. At his worst he doubles as a multimedia showman, the class clown, eliciting laughs by lampooning his own nightly news straight-man act. What Williams has accomplished with this progressive strategy -- a postmodern approach to the patriarchal voice-of-God news anchor -- is to prove that he isn't a stuffed shirt, that he is self-deprecating like Cronkite. Media critics have lauded Williams' two-act juggle: serious newsman and surprisingly funny clown. But what Williams failed to consider was that death -- in either war (Iraq) or national disaster (Katrina) -- shouldn't have a showman front and center. Ernest Hemingway learned from hunting that one should never milk death or drown it in a sea of verbiage. Being solemn always trumps being out in front in a battle zone. What's important to know about Williams, why he deserves a second chance, is that he is a fine broadcast journalist. Like Cronkite after the Tet Offensive of 1968, Williams gets on the airplane, travels to danger zones, ad-libs for hours on end seldom making a gaffe. As a TV journalist, he is a pro. When Williams brings himself into the narrative, however, when he goes on ""David Letterman"" or ""The Daily Show"" or babbles to Michael Eisner, the showman overruns the reporter. When you sit around a campfire telling ghost stories, you want the audience to lean forward (the slogan of MSNBC), to be utterly captivated by every detail. The more embellishment the better. But Iraq and Katrina are all too real for that. I interviewed Williams about his New Orleans experiences for my book ""The Great Deluge."" His personal narrative was riveting. Give him credit for breaking a dozen news stories during those dark days in 2005. Online allegations now rage that Williams fabricated what he saw and experienced in post-Katrina New Orleans. That is unfair to him. Everything was helter-skelter in the Gulf South, and Williams did a public service by trying to make sense of the post-hurricane situation. Williams did have a dysentery-like condition (if not textbook dysentery), which he explained in an interview I did shortly after the Category 3 hurricane hit. ""I couldn't keep anything down,"" he said. ""That whole night was hazy. I couldn't get clarity of mind."" Overall, his reporting of the post-Katrina events is credible. Nevertheless, Williams-as-showman very well may have embellished or conflated or compressed some of the on-the-ground, in-the-moment facts, but it's silly now to nitpick whether the dead body he saw was on Canal Street or Claiborne Avenue. It is clear that Williams needs to apologize more profusely, to set the record straight once and for all -- but only once, and for good -- for his Iraq fabrication and to clarify details about his Katrina experience. He needs to stay off the comedy shows for a while and to stop talking about himself. There is an Japanese adage that the nail that stands the tallest gets hammered down. Williams' hazing has made him right-sized. But enough is enough. The public needs hardworking newsmen like Williams as a matter of trust, of public good. If Cronkite were placed under the same digital media microscope, he'd look smaller than we remembered. The public shouldn't lose faith in Williams as a journalist, but it is all right for us to shout loudly in his ears, ""It's not about you!"" The superhighway of celebrity and showmanship is filled with debris. Tuesday night, NBC News decided to suspend Williams for six months without pay. That seems about right. Maybe Williams needed to be reminded of which role -- newsman or showman -- was most important, which ball to favor in his juggling act. It is a fact that Cronkite knew all too well: sometimes a little tuliping in a war zone goes farther than a tale of looking down the tube of an RPG.","Douglas Brinkley says Williams should have heeded Cronkite's golden rule for war reporters: never self-aggrandize .
He says the newsman got tripped up when he tried to also be a showman ."
"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A man accused of playing a role in the 1968 hijacking of a Pan Am flight from New York to Puerto Rico was arrested Sunday, federal officials said. Luis Armando Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's JFK International Airport. Luis Armando Pena Soltren, 66, surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after exiting a flight from Havana, Cuba, officials said. It's the same airport from which Pan Am Flight 281 took off more than 40 years ago. He flew to New York under the custody of State Department diplomatic security personnel, said a law enforcement source and a senior State Department official. Authorities did not offer additional details about Soltren's arrest. Soltren ""will finally face the American justice system that he has been evading for more than four decades,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack Flight 281 on November 24 of that year. They were accused of bringing concealed guns and knives aboard and using them to take over the flight. Crew members told authorities at the time that the armed suspects forced their way into the plane's cabin and ordered the crew to fly to Havana, according to court documents. Cruz and Castro were sentenced in the 1970s after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in New York. They received 15-year and 12-year sentences, respectively. Their current whereabouts were not immediately known. Figueroa was acquitted in 1969. CNN's Evan Buxbaum, Carol Cratty and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Luis Armando Pena Soltren, 66, surrenders to federal authorities at JFK Airport .

"(CNN)We're in a dimly lit shebeen (pub) in Soweto sharing beer from a communal cup and the conversation is getting heated. We're discussing President Jacob Zuma's house refurbishment using more than 200 million rand of state funds --  a move being investigated by the country's anti-corruption watchdog. ""Pah, he lives there in his own Hollywood, and we have nothing,"" spits a drinker while whacking his fly swatter furiously against the bench we're sitting on, lashing one unfortunate drinker. It's just another afternoon in Africa's most famous township -- a hotbed for political dissent since its creation in 1903 as part of the forced resettlement of black workers from Johannesburg. Soweto, now incorporated into wider Joburg, is a generally safe and culturally rich place to visit that's gone through substantial regeneration in the past few years. We're seeing it by bicycle, a far more direct way to appreciate the street life than from behind the windows of a tour bus. Our guide is local man Tshepo Mokone, from Lebo's Soweto Backpackers. The roads are good, although be warned: Soweto has hills -- but they're a great place to catch the views including of the new Soccer City stadium and Orlando Towers, which you can bungee jump from. Shebeens . Shebeens were originally a type of illegal pub, normally run by women in shacks to service men living in workers' hostels. Now they're legal and a place to while away the hours drinking umqombothi, a traditional beer made from maize, as we discover during a visit to a shebeen in the poor Soweto quarter of Mzimhlophe. With communal toilets and taps, and raw sewage running in the streets, living conditions are tough and the shebeen a kind of refuge. Tshepo explains the strategies shebeens used to employ during police raids. ""The shack had no windows, so you couldn't see inside,"" he says. ""People were told not to make any noise but that's hard after a few drinks, so if the police came they would start pretending to worship -- as if it was a church service."" Another cunning plan was to dress in traditional African attire, as if the drinkers were in the midst of a Zulu ceremony. Tshepo gives an example as he dons a beaded head-dress and jewelry, much to the mirth of the assembled clientele. Other typical places to eat and drink in Soweto include The Spot, a tavern (corner of Vilakazi and Baqwa Streets); Nambitha (Vilakazi Street; +27 11 936 9128) and Sakhumzi (Vilakazi Street; +27 11 536 1379) serve upmarket township fare. Lebo's Soweto Backpackers . Owner of the first and apparently only black-run backpackers hostel in South Africa, Lebo Malepa started offering overnight accommodation at his great-grandparents' house in 1998 before officially opening the guesthouse and bike tour business in 2003. ""I came into the industry because I wanted to see people getting off the [tour] bus,"" Lebo says. ""Soweto is a great place to learn about the history of South Africa. Every person and every building has a story to tell."" Set on a hill with views over the more affluent Soweto suburb of Orlando West and near the much-visited Vilakazi Street, Lebo's backpackers feels a bit like a laid-back beach hotel. There's even a sandy bar area out back where you can enjoy a beer and fried fish before setting out on a bike or walking  tour. Or you can just sit around and chat with the employees, including Lebo's Swedish wife Maria who came to work for him and never left. 10823A Pooe Street, Orlando West; +27 11 936 3444 . Vilakazi Street . This buzzy road was home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners, Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, who, like Soweto, are icons of the struggle against apartheid. It's also where successful locals come to rev up their Mercs and blare out the latest kwaito (a form of South African house music) from booming speakers -- it makes our bike tires judder. You can learn about Soweto's past as a center of resistance at the Hector Pieterson memorial and museum off Vilakazi Street (8287 Khumalo St.; +27 11 536 2253), named after a 13-year-old boy shot dead by police during a peaceful student protest in 1976. Nelson Mandela lived on Vilakazi Street with his first and second wives. His house has since been turned into Mandela House Museum (8115 Orlando West; +27 11 936 7754) featuring exhibits and personal items such as the first shoes he wore as a free man. The road has some cool street art, the result of a competition among 130 local artists. The winning wall murals, sculptures and mosaics are inspired by daily township life and Soweto's history. Learn the lingo . If you want to interact with Sowetans as you peddle through the streets, you should learn a few words of the local slang. Sowetans have a wicked sense of humor and the lingo is fast, furious and funny. On being greeted by us white folk on Vilakazi Street, one guy solemnly told us: ""Don't talk to me, talk to my lawyer."" Take your choice of how to say hello. The common South African handshake involves the normal gesture, followed by a clasping of the thumbs and then back to a normal handshake. Variations on the ending include a slow sliding of the palms together or a snapping of your thumbs in tandem (tricky at first). In Soweto it's popular to use the Spanish greeting ""hola"" to say hi (the reasons why are obscure). Or the Zulu ""sanibonani"" for ""how are you?"" to which the streetwise reply is ""yebo"" -- ""cool."" A popular expression is ""shap shap,"" meaning anything from ""agreed"" to ""hello,"" ""bye"" or ""great."" If you hear someone saying it, you can be sure they're happy. In Soweto, a ""kota"" is a kind of local version of a burger. A quarter loaf of bread is hollowed out and filled with various delights such as chips, egg, mince and achaar (a kind of pickle salad). And if kids run up to you on your bike and plead with you to ""shoot"" them, they don't have a death wish but want you to take a photo of them. Boutique hotel . Kliptown is one of Soweto's oldest neighborhoods and the venue for the signing of the Freedom Charter in 1955, when thousands of activists agreed on a document that would form the basis of the country's post-apartheid Constitution. Freedom Square is a vast and impressive area of modernist architecture with an unusual monument and art gallery, shops and a bustling marketplace. You can hop off your bike and walk into Soweto Hotel on the square (+27 11 527 7300). A funky boutique hotel featuring black and white photos by the late great black South African photographer Alf Khumalo, Afro-retro decor and friendly staff, it's a great place to recover while listening to live jazz and sipping a cocktail. The hotel's founding partner Lindiwe Sangweni-Siddo trained in Switzerland and worked for luxury chains abroad but returned to South Africa to launch her vision for a high quality Soweto hotel. ""My vision was to start a company with a typical African flavor -- a place where we could begin to define South African hospitality,"" she says.","Cycling is one of the best ways to see this huge former black township .

"(CNN)President Barack Obama will renew his push for paid sick days and paid family leave for the millions of American workers who don't have either during a visit to Baltimore on Thursday, according to Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the President. Jarrett, who used an unconventional outlet to outline Obama's expected announcements -- in a blog for LinkedIn -- said the President will call on Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would allow millions of Americans to earn up to seven days per year of paid sick time. Obama pushes for universal broadband access . ""How many Americans have to show up to work when battling an illness even when they know they won't be at their best, it will lengthen their recovery time, and they may likely spread their sickness to others?"" wrote Jarrett. ""The last thing we should do is add guilt, fear, and financial hardship on working parents as they try to do what's right -- while keeping their job,"" she added. More than 40% of private sector workers in the U.S. currently don't get paid sick days, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research. During a lunch with a group of women in Baltimore, the President will also call on cities and states to pass similar laws at the local level. In 2006, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to guarantee access to earned sick days, and in 2011, Connecticut became the first state to mandate the benefit, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. In the November election, the National Partnership for Women and Families said voters approved paid sick leave ballot measures in Massachusetts, Oakland, California and Montclair and Trenton, New Jersey. Can Obama's community college plan get through Congress? The President will also announce programs to help cities and states provide paid leave to American workers. Currently, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, workers are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons, such as the birth of a child or caring for an ill parent. Many employers, including the federal government, do not pay for that leave. In his 2015 budget, the President will propose $2.2 billion to reimburse up to five states for three years for their costs associated with implementing a paid leave policy, $35 million in grants to states and $1 million through the Labor Department for feasibility studies around providing paid leave programs, Jarrett told CNN. Last year, the President's budget included $500,000 for feasibility studies, which three states and the District of Columbia used to help craft what will become paid leave programs, she added. At the federal level, the President will also sign a presidential memorandum directing his agencies to allow federal employees to have access to at least six weeks of paid leave when a new child arrives or to care for ill family members, and propose that Congress offer six weeks of paid administrative leave as well, said Jarrett. The push for paid sick days and paid leave stems, in part, from last year's first-ever White House Summit on Working Families, said Jarrett. ""The conversation we had that day was only the beginning. It has carried on in the months since then around the country and the President has continued to take action to make progress for families,"" she said. Jarrett also wrote directly about why the White House chose LinkedIn to reveal the news about the President's push for paid sick and family leave, saying the social networking site was in ""the best position to drive change."" ""This is the world's largest online audience of professionals. And if you're an employer, the folks who are coming to your company's pages will be looking to see if you offer precisely these sorts of policies on your books,"" wrote Jarrett. ""Keep in mind that nearly 1-in-2 working parents has turned down a job because it would not work for their family. Don't let your job be one of those,"" she said.

"Tokyo (CNN)A Japanese man has been sentenced to six years in jail for slashing two members of popular J-pop group AKB48 with a saw at a fan event. Satoru Umeta, 24, was convicted of assaulting singers Rina Kawaei and Anna Iriyama, both 19, along with one of the group's male employees at a ""hand-shaking event"" for fans in Takizawa City, Iwate Prefecture last May, CNN's affiliate TV Asahi reported. The attack left the three victims severely injured, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. Handing down the sentence in the Morioka District Court, Judge Takehiko Okada said that the consequences of the attack -- which involved a foldable saw fitted with box cutter blades -- could have been worse. ""What he did was a dangerous act that might have claimed the lives of the victims,"" said Okada. The unemployed Umeta had been motivated to commit the attack out of his frustration at failing to find a job, the judge said. The month after the attack, Kawaei appeared amid tight security at a stadium in Tokyo for the group's ""general election"" to hear the results of a ballot as to who would lead the band for the coming year. Named for Tokyo's Akihabara district, where the group has a theater, and the number of members in its initial lineup, the band holds the Guinness Record for being the world's largest pop group. It currently lists 186 members on its website. Engineered to be accessible to its passionate fanbase, the group is subdivided into various units, allowing one team to perform while the others tour, promote or record. Concerts at their theater are so popular that tickets for the daily performances are allocated on a lottery system. The formula has made AKB48 one of Japan's best-selling musical acts, and won them fans elsewhere in Asia, with ""sister groups"" in Indonesia, Taiwan and China. But the group has also attracted its share of criticism, with questions raised over its occasionally sexualized lyrics, and the group's management accused of exploiting its young charges. In February 2013, eyebrows were raised when member Minami Minegishi appeared in a YouTube video with a shaven head, making a tearful apology for having stayed the night at a male friend's place -- against the group's strict code of conduct.

"Eight previously unheard Michael Jackson songs will be released on a new album in May, Epic Records announced Monday. The late pop icon's music has been ""contemporized"" by several producers who Epic Chairman L.A. Reid believes have the ""gravitas, depth and range to creatively engage with Jackson's work,"" the announcement said. Fans can preorder the new album, titled ""Xscape,"" on iTunes starting Tuesday, but it will be in stores around the world on May 13, the company said. Jackson died at age 50 on June 25, 2009, while preparing for his ""This Is It"" comeback tour. ""Michael left behind some musical performances that we take great pride in presenting through the vision of music producers that he either worked directly with or expressed strong desire to work with,"" Reid said. Timbaland is the lead producer, with contributions from Rodney Jerkins, Stargate, Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon and Jackson estate executor John McClain, the release said. Timberland had previously revealed he was working on the project for Epic. The album title is derived from one of the new singles. Jackson and Jerkins co-wrote and co-produced the song ""Xscape,"" which Jerkins ""contemporized"" for the project, the company said. Sony's Columbia Epic Records -- Jackson's record label for three decades -- signed a long-term deal with Jackson's estate to posthumously release music from the large archives of his recordings. Reid ""was granted unlimited access to the treasures representing four decades of material on which Jackson had completed his vocals,"" the announcement said. The Epic release included a quote from Jackson estate co-executors John Branca and John McClain supporting the new album. ""Michael was always on the cutting edge and was constantly reaching out to new producers, looking for new sounds. He was always relevant and current. These tracks, in many ways, capture that spirit. We thank L.A. Reid for his vision."" ""New"" music is not always met with a warm reception from fans and the Jackson family.  Some questioned the authenticity of the vocals on a 2010 album, although the estate and the record company said sound experts verified Jackson's voice.","Fans can preorder on iTunes Tuesday or get ""Xscape"" in stores May 13 .

"(CNN)Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker and ISIS hostage whose death was confirmed by her family this week, might have been paired with a male ISIS fighter during her captivity, U.S. intelligence and government officials said Wednesday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited unspecified intelligence gleaned about the case. A U.S. intelligence official said it was unclear whether Mueller was coerced, sold or forced into the pairing. Intelligence suggests Mueller may have been given to an ISIS fighter as a sort of bride, one U.S. government official said. The National Security Council said it was breaking with protocol to make a statement about an American hostage. ""Reports that have been published by certain news outlets regarding Kayla's time in (ISIS) captivity are speculative and unproven at this time,"" spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said. ""The U.S. government continues to analyze any information regarding Kayla's captivity but has not corroborated any of the multiple theories regarding the conditions throughout the duration of her captivity."" Mueller's parents announced Tuesday that it had received confirmation that their daughter, who was captured in northern Syria in 2013, had died. ISIS sent the family a private message over the weekend with information about her death, Meehan said Tuesday. The message included photos. One picture showed her wrapped in a burial shroud, but there was enough showing for the family and forensics examiners to identify her, a U.S. official briefed on the matter told CNN. The information did not confirm how Mueller died, a law enforcement source familiar with the case said on condition of anonymity. On Friday, ISIS said that Mueller, 26, of Arizona, had been killed in a building hit during a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital in Syria. At the time, ISIS offered no proof to back up its claim, other than an image of a building in rubble. The photos in the private weekend message showed bruises on the face, The New York Times reported, but it was unclear whether her injuries were consistent with being killed in the rubble of a flattened building, as ISIS claimed. Mueller made it her life's work to help others. She was a 2009 graduate of Northern Arizona University and worked with humanitarian groups in northern India, Israel and Palestinian territories, a family spokeswoman said. ""She had a quiet, calming presence. She was a free spirit, always standing up for those who were suffering and wanting to be their voice. ... Kayla's calling was to help those who were suffering, whether in her home in Prescott, or on the other side of the world,"" her aunts, Lori Lyon and Terri Crippes, said Tuesday. In August 2013, Mueller fell into the hands of hostage-takers in Aleppo, Syria, her family said, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital she was visiting. Mueller's letter gives glimpse into time in captivity . Her family said ISIS contacted them in May with proof that she was alive. The militants eventually said they would kill her if the family didn't pay nearly $7 million by August 13, according to a source close to the family. A number of rescue and negotiation attempts to free Mueller failed, officials said. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, told CNN's Jake Tapper that he and his staffers tried to facilitate Mueller's release on several occasions. Negotiations between the family and ISIS at one point, he said, included discussion about whether Mueller could be swapped for Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, a prisoner being held in Texas who was convicted for conspiring with the enemy. The Mueller family reached out to the White House last summer when ISIS issued a deadline to execute Kayla and asked if the government would be willing to trade Siddiqui, known as ""Lady Al Qaeda,"" in exchange for Mueller, a spokeswoman for the family said.  ISIS has repeatedly made public calls for Siddiqui's release. ""The family was doing everything it could to bring their daughter home,"" the spokeswoman said. It asked the White House if it could have Siddiqui's sentence commuted.  The White House responded, but the spokeswoman would not say what the answer was. The request to the White House was first reported by the Daily Beast. Mueller was still alive after the ISIS-imposed deadline to execute her, the spokeswoman said, although she didn't specify how that was known. Mueller's boyfriend, who was captured with her but later released, posed as her husband and risked his life trying to rescue her from a terrorist training camp in Syria, the spokeswoman said. He still talks with the family. Orouba Barakat, a friend of Mueller, said she received a short audio clip made by Mueller after she was kidnapped. ""She begged for help. 'Please try to help me, get me out (of) here. I'm so sick, I'm dying,' "" she said, recalling the audio. Barakat, a Syrian journalist who met Mueller while in Turkey, said she heard the 10- to 15-second recording about three months after Mueller was abducted. She tried contacting Mueller by Skype and by email, but never heard back from the hostage. U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the government had worked to free Mueller and other hostages. ""We devoted enormous resources, always devote enormous resources to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world. And I deployed an entire operation -- at significant risk -- to rescue not only her but the other individuals who had been held, and probably missed them by a day or two, precisely because we had that commitment,"" Obama said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Confirmation of Mueller's death drew condolences and tributes from across the country and around the world. In Jordan, where seething leaders have vowed revenge after ISIS burned a captive Jordanian pilot to death, government spokesman Mohammed Al-Momani expressed ""grief and anger"" over Mueller's death. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he had ordered flags at state government buildings to fly at half-staff until sundown Wednesday in her honor. ISIS' high-profile hostages .

"(CNN)My parents, Shanthi and C. S. Seshadri, met only twice before their wedding 30 years ago in southern India. ""Met"" is a stretch. My father was 32. My mother was 21 and had no say in the pairing. It was a shock to her when the man who came to see her was my father. She didn't understand why her brothers and her father would set her up with a man 11 years older, from a family that was so different from hers. He was a city boy, had traveled to and lived in various parts of India. He enjoyed cheese puffs, knew how to eat with chopsticks and the names of different types of alcohol. She had never ventured too far out of her town of Vellore, had never heard of these foods and alcohol was an unspeakable word. Whether it was a desperate match to stop a few town boys from pursuing her, or whether their horoscopes were perfectly aligned, she doesn't know. But her brother had a great feeling about it, and the match was made. Engagement. Wedding. They had no choice but to trust that their parents knew what they were doing, and they went with it. They were thrown into a relationship, their first and only one, and slowly learned everything about that person -- raw and true -- from the beginning. They grew together because it was new and awkward and special for both of them. And no matter what came their way -- scraping for dowries, moving countries, a heart attack, the death of a child -- they stayed together and they dealt with it. They didn't even know that it could be any other way. I think there's a beauty to that. Indian parents aren't the best at expressing love, in my experience. They don't think the words are necessary when you support each other for ... well, forever. But over the past few years, my parents have individually divulged their fondness for one another to me. And maybe because I'm older now, I catch them looking adoringly at each other in the temple. Stealing smiles in the kitchen. One discreetly stroking the other's head. My father doesn't like talking about his feelings, but a year ago, he told me my mother is his favorite person. When we tease him about their age difference, he says he likes taking care of her. He thinks she's innocent, has a good heart and deserves to be taken care of. My mother says she and my father are 99% made for each other. They are on the same page for all the things that matter. They are opposites in many ways. She doesn't share his love for cricket or Hollywood, and he doesn't engage in her discussions of Tamil literature. But they are perfectly complementary. Often my mother jokes and tells me even if she searches the heavens and Earth, she can't find a husband as great as hers for me. If that isn't love, I don't know what is.","The author's parents were arranged to be married in 1985 .

"Having landed a world-record shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors in July, soccer team Manchester United is looking to cash in once more after buying out training kit partner DHL. The English Premier League club signed a $559 million agreement with GM to have the Chevrolet logo on its shirts for seven years from 2014 onwards. And, despite signing a $64 million training kit deal with logistics firm DHL in 2010, the Glazer family-owned team has already set its sights on securing a more lucrative endorsement. ""We have successfully negotiated an early buyout of our training kit agreement with DHL effective 30 June 2013,"" read a statement from one of the world's richest clubs, which has won the English league title a record 19 times and been crowned champion of Europe on three occasions. ""The significantly increased value of agreements concluded since entering into this agreement, such as our recent $559 million world-record shirt sponsorship with General Motors, leads us to believe that there should be strategic opportunities to further optimize the value of these rights."" Back to the future: Black pioneer's battle with racism . United has already announced two lucrative partnerships this month. First it entered into a three-year arrangement with Azerbaijani telecommunications company Bakcell, which became the club's first broadcast partner in the country. Then food and beverage company Kagome became United's official soft drinks partner in Japan. Despite incurring huge debts when the Glazers bought the club in 2005, United has remained one of the most profitable teams on the planet. For the tax year ending June 30 2012, United's total income was £320.3 million ($516.3 million). Meanwhile, Forbes Magazine ranked Alex Ferguson's side as the most valuable in world sport, with a brand worth an estimated $2.23 billion. On the pitch, Ferguson will be without Shinji Kagawa for one month after it was announced the Japanese playmaker aggravated a knee injury during Tuesday's European Champions League victory over Braga. ""Kagawa is out for three to four weeks with a knee injury,"" Ferguson told a press conference ahead of Sunday's match with EPL leaders Chelsea. ""Playing on Tuesday didn't help. It is disappointing."" Kagawa joined United from German champions Borussia Dortmund in June and has so far scored two goals for the club.","Manchester United buys out DHL from training kit sponsorship package .

"Washington (CNN)They're railing against President Barack Obama for going too far on Obamacare and immigration but Republicans are prepared to cede broad authority to the White House to fight ISIS. It's an interesting theme that's developing as the administration prepares to send Congress a request as soon as Wednesday that would authorize Obama to use military force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Democrats, wary of another long war, are seeking strict limits on the use of U.S. ground forces. Republicans, meanwhile, are the ones arguing that the commander-in-chief needs room to move as he sees fit. Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, doesn't want to see any restrictions in the authorization -- meaning no limit on the use of ground troops, the length of time the authorization can remain in force and no restrictions on the geographic area to which the new law would apply. ""If we want to constrain the president's actions, we have the power of the purse,"" McCain said Tuesday.  ""The Constitution says the president of the United States is the commander in chief."" Several other Republican senators speaking in the days before language for the so-called Authorization for the Use of Military Force, or AUMF, was expected to be released by the White House declined to weigh in on what they could support, but emphasized the need to give the White House as much flexibility as needed to wage this fight. ""I'm sort of a traditionalist on this maybe. I think the executive branch ought to be telling us they want flexibility,"" said Sen. Rob Portman, stressing his concern the White House would take certain options off the table. ""I think it's wrong for the commander in chief to tie his own hands."" While details are still being finalized, the White House is expected to request a three-year AUMF that places some limits on the use of U.S. ground forces, according to members of Congress briefed on the proposal. The GOP is hardly monolithic on this issue -- or any other -- but many in the party do not want to see the president limited on matters of war. And the battle against ISIS is just one example of Republicans' willingness to grant the president wide authority on specific issues, even as they question his use of power in other instances. Many top GOP members are also pushing fast-track, or Trade Promotion Authority, known in Washington as TPA, which would allow the President to get an up or down vote in Congress -- without amendments -- on often complicated trade deals negotiated largely in secret by the executive branch, as long as they meet certain parameters. So is there a disconnect here? Republicans have been furious over Obama's use of executive power in other areas, from adjustments he made to Affordable Care Act requirements to his moves on immigration in November. The party has filed lawsuits against the president claiming executive overreach on the health care law and plan to do something similar on immigration. Georgia GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson said the battle against extremists and the one against the healthcare bill should not be compared. ""Disliking a single-payer government health care system like the Affordable Care Act and fighting an enemy like ISIL are two entirely different things,"" he said. ""You're talking about policy and direction in terms of the health care law and you're talking about the survival of our democracy, you're talking about terrorism."" Distrust of the president is a common theme on Capitol Hill. Many members have long argued that the White House cannot be relied on to enforce immigration law or secure the border, so there is little point, they argue, in pushing through a comprehensive immigration overhaul. ""There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws,"" House Speaker John Boehner said last February. ""And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes."" In response to those claims, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer proposed in February 2014 to pass the immigration bill, but not have it go into effect until 2017, when a new president would be in office, said a spokesman. The GOP didn't bite. The dynamic opens Republicans up to questions about whether they can have it both ways, expressing alarm and distrust about how Obama uses his powers on health care and immigration while backing him on trade and -- perhaps his biggest responsibility -- waging war. ""It is kind of inconsistent on their part. On the other hand, presidents have always been given much, much greater leeway to use their power in international economics and in defense and security issues,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the Governance Studies program at the Brookings Institution. ""It's not surprising that the issues break like this."" While the public often has strong opinions on domestic matters like immigration or health care, the same is not true for issues like TPA. That means the opposing party can claim immense distrust of the president on one issue while giving him free rein on another. ""Nobody knows what TPA is and nobody cares and therefore the fact that there's a muddled message around it doesn't become evident,"" Kamarck said. ""These lucky politicians can have it both ways, as they do with many things."" For their part, Republicans questioned by CNN said their support for the president's use of power on some matters was part of the job, otherwise nothing would ever get done in Washington. ""My job as a senator is to do the best that I can to pass legislation that I believe is important and is in our national interest,"" said Tennessee GOP Sen. Bob Corker, a strong supporter of Trade Promotion Authority. ""Even though I may have concerns about the executive branch and the way that they would carry things out from time to time, that still doesn't mitigate my job or alleviate the job that I have which is to try to pass legislation that is meaningful and good for our country.""","Republicans often criticize Obama for overstepping his power .

"(CNN)The United States is now working on the assumption that Charlie Hebdo attacker Said Kouachi met American terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki at some point in Yemen and received orders from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to carry out an attack, a U.S. official tells CNN. The official said Kouachi's motivation for waiting so long -- possibly since 2011 -- to launch an attack was not clear. U.S. officials Sunday said American authorities don't have evidence yet directly linking AQAP to specifically ordering the Paris attack last week at the offices of the satirical magaine. ""We don't have credible information, at least as yet, to indicate who was responsible, who sponsored this act. That is clearly one of the things that we have to make a determination of,"" Attorney General Eric Holder told CNN's Gloria Borger on ""State of the Union."" French security agencies had been monitoring Said Kouachi and his brother, Cherif, but stopped months before the two carried out the attack that left 12 people dead. The French monitoring faded despite a previous tip-off from American intelligence agencies that one of them had likely trained with al Qaeda in Yemen, a French news magazine reported Saturday. Said Kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in Yemen during a trip he made with another French national to Oman between July 25 and August 15 in 2011, according to multiple French officials who spoke to L'Express national security reporter Eric Pelletier. Pelletier shared the details of his reporting with CNN. Peter Bergen: Even from grave, al-Awlaki inspires terrorism . U.S. agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability that Said Kouachi slipped across to Yemen during the trip to Oman and informed their French counterparts, according to Pelletier's French sources. The French immediately responded by placing Said Kouachi under surveillance in late November 2011 by issuing a ""Fiche de Surveillance"" -- a surveillance notice, multiple French officials told Pelletier. The surveillance was conducted by both DGSI -- France's domestic security service -- and later by the judicial police. Wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother Cherif. A U.S. official told CNN  last week that the initial assessment was that Said Kouachi's 2011 travel lasted three or more months and that he is believed to have trained with al Qaeda in Yemen during that period. But the surveillance of Said was terminated in June 2014 because French security services judged him no longer dangerous, Pelletier was told. The surveillance of Cherif Koachi stopped earlier -- at the end of 2013. Cherif's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes. French intelligence authorities believe there is a strong probability Cherif also traveled to Yemen for a short trip in 2011. A U.S. official told CNN they are still corroborating information that Cherif also went to Yemen, but they have no reason to doubt the French government. Pelletier's sources said Cherif's wife told French authorities after the Paris attack that her husband traveled to Oman together with Said in the summer of 2011, but French security services have yet not been able to confirm the brothers made the trip together. Pelletier's sources said that Cherif Kouachi was already under some form of control order in France at the time. He had previously served a prison sentence, after being convicted of terror offenses in 2008 for being part of a recruitment network for al Qaeda in Iraq. But the control order had been placed on him after he was implicated in a plot to break an Algerian terrorist from prison.  Pelletier said it was not clear what type of control order he was under. Some require the surrender of passports, while others require regularly reporting to designated officials. Morten Storm, a former jihadist who became a double agent working for Western intelligence services, told CNN  that training trips such as Kouachi's were a regular part of operations for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula when the terror group's external operations head was al-Awlaki, an American imam. Recruits were told to return home and avoid any appearance of radicalization. ""And that is what Anwar al-Awlaki had asked me for in the past to get brothers, i.e., Muslim terrorists, to get them over,"" Storm told Robertson. ""But the condition was that they had to have a clean passport and they had to have a clean name. They do not have to be under any sort of radars or surveillance or interest by the government. So, they had to be totally clean from that."" Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike on September 30, 2011.

"(CNN)Two major trials kicking off 2015 feature defendants invoking the insanity defense. For many, this adds to the myth that insanity is commonly used and frequently successful. But in fact, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases, and it's only successful in a fraction of those. Moreover, defendants judged to have been legally insane at the time of the offense and subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity are in almost all cases indefinitely committed to psychiatric hospitals for treatment. Statistically speaking, for those who want to see some guilty verdicts in the trials of James Holmes or Eddie Routh, they are likely to get their wish. The legal standard for insanity varies across America, with each state free to apply any number of tests developed over the last centuries. While it may seem strange to have patchwork law among the states on an apparent issue of science, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, that's exactly how it was intended to be. In 1843, the English House of Lords articulated the first modern insanity test in the infamous M'Naghten case. Daniel M'Naghten was a commoner who killed an English civil servant while suffering delusions. He was acquitted and placed in a mental institution for the remainder of his life. Henceforth, the M'Naghten rule says that a person is insane if, because of a ""disease of the mind"" at the time he committed the act, he (1) did not know the ""nature and quality of the act"" that he was performing; or (2) he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The M'Naghten rule was thereafter widely adopted almost word for word in the United States. One of the major criticisms of the M'Naughten rule was that it focuses on the cognitive ability to know right from wrong, and ignores the concept of self-control. This led to the development of another kind of test -- the ""irresistible impulse"" provision in many states, under which a defendant who can distinguish between right and wrong can still be absolved if he is still unable to stop himself from committing an act he knows to be wrong. Still another test was developed by an appellate court in 1954. In Durham v. United States, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia scrapped the M'Naughten rule and the ""irresistible impulse"" tests and held that a defendant could not be found criminally responsible ""if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect."" The decision eschewed moral definitions of insanity, and focused more on science and psychiatry. The Durham rule was also criticized as vague and overly broad; many states rejected the test, and in 1962, the American Law Institute, or ALI, announced yet another insanity defense, which enjoyed immediate popularity with many legislatures and judiciaries. Under the ALI test, an individual is not responsible for his criminal conduct if, because of mental defect, he either lacked ""substantial capacity"" to appreciate the ""criminality"" of his conduct, or he failed to ""conform"" his conduct to the requirements of law. Notice the difference from the M'Naghten test -- the ALI test accepts not only cognitive impairment but also volitional impairment as an excuse -- which is the loss of control or ability to ""conform"" conduct to the law. The popularity of the ALI test and its ""volitional"" component would be short-lived. In fact, its death knell sounded in 1981, when John Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity, based on an ALI standard, of the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. The effects of the public furor over Hinckley's acquittal were immediate. Federal and state jurisdictions promptly did away with the ALI standard and returned to a restrictive test reminiscent of M'Naghten. As it stands today, some 46 states have an insanity defense, and 45 of those have insanity tests based on either M'Naghten or the Model Penal Code tests. States with the Model Penal Code test have chosen to include a control element, and certain states still using the original M'Naghten test have added that ""irresistible impulse"" or control element. It gets even more complicated. Some states don't even have the insanity defense. Montana was the first state to do away with it completely. After the Hinckley backlash, four other states followed suit and abolished the defense: Utah, Kansas, Idaho and Nevada -- the latter's Supreme Court later ruled the absence of the insanity defense unconstitutional. To say reasonable minds can differ on the insanity defense is an understatement. It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state. After all, isn't medicine a science? Like astronomy and biology? The law of gravity and the speed limit of light don't vary from state to state. Should our legal definition and recognition of illness and brain function vary from state to state?  Arthritis, psoriasis and a sprained ankle are the same in Mississippi as they are in Oregon. But the law is fundamentally different than medicine. If medicine is applying science to illness, the law is about a regional people's collective norms and perceptions of that illness. As Justice Louis Brandeis said in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann,  ""It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory, and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."" That's right. Not only are the states free to develop disparate law in the field of legal insanity, but under the Constitution, they are encouraged to do so. Of course, Brandeis was quick to add that the court has ""the power to prevent an experiment. We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable."" And ultimately, that's what this debate will always boil down to -- whether a state is free to legislate with unfettered discretion in accepting or not accepting an insanity defense, or, if insanity is a constitutionally guaranteed option, outside a state legislature's jurisdiction. To many, particularly in the defense bar, the availability of the defense is often academic. With a success rate so low, many would say the insanity defense is effectively abolished already.  But don't take my word for it. Keep score on the Holmes and Routh cases. We'll reconvene after.","Trials of James Holmes and Eddie Routh will invoke insanity defense .

"An Al Jazeera correspondent who has been held for nearly a month by Egyptian authorities calls his detention an attack on press freedoms, according to a letter posted online Saturday by the news network. Peter Greste, an Australian, is one of three Al Jazeera employees who have been held since December 30 by Egyptian authorities, who have accused the three for allegedly meeting with members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. ""How do you accurately and fairly report on Egypt's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved,"" he wrote. The network did not say how it obtained the letter from Greste, who has previously worked  for CNN, Reuters and BBC. He is being held along with producers  Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. Western leaders, human rights groups and journalists have repeatedly called on Egypt to release the men, saying their arrests were  a violation of human rights and press freedoms. Fahmy worked for CNN and The New York Times prior to joined the Qatar-based network. Mohamed is a Cairo-based producer for the network. International media demand Egypt release detained journalists . Text of the letter, entitled ""A letter from Tora prison,"" released by Al Jazeera: . I am nervous as I write this. I am in my cold prison cell after my first official exercise session -- four glorious hours in the grass yard behind our block and I don't want that right to be snatched away. I've been locked in my cell 24 hours a day for the past 10 days, allowed out only for visits to the prosecutor for questioning, so the chance for a walk in the weak winter sunshine is precious. So too are the books on history, Arabic and fiction that my neighbours have passed to me, and the pad and pen I now write with. I want to cling to these tiny joys and avoid anything that might move the prison authorities to punitively withdraw them. I want to protect them almost as much as I want my freedom back. That is why I have sought, until now, to fight my imprisonment quietly from within, to make the authorities understand that this is all a terrible mistake, that I've been caught in the middle of a political struggle that is not my own. But after two weeks in prison it is now clear that this is a dangerous decision. It validates an attack not just on me and my two colleagues but on freedom of speech across Egypt. All of a sudden, my books seem rather petty. I had been in Cairo only two weeks before interior ministry agents burst through the door of my hotel room, that of my colleague and producer Mohamed Fahmy, and into the home of Al Jazeera's second producer Baher Mohamed. Accuracy, fairness, and balance . We had been doing exactly as any responsible, professional journalist would -- recording and trying to make sense of the unfolding events with all the accuracy, fairness and balance that our imperfect trade demands. Most of the time, it is not a difficult path to walk. But when the Egyptian government declared the Muslim Brotherhood to be ""terrorist organisation"", it knocked the middle ground out of the discourse. When the other side, political or otherwise, is a ""terrorist"", there is no neutral way. As George W. Bush loved to point out after 9/11, you are either with the government or with the terrorists. So, even talking to them becomes an act of treason, let alone broadcasting their news however benign. The following day, the government fleshed out its definition of the term. Anyone caught handing out Muslim Brotherhood leaflets, or simply participating in protest marches against the government could be arrested and imprisoned for ""spreading terrorist ideology"". The Muslim Brotherhood has lost much of the support and credibility once had when its political leader Mohamed Morsi became Egypt's first democratically elected president just over a year and a half ago. And many here hold it responsible for a growing wave of islamist violence, but it remains the single largest and best organised social and political force in Egypt. What then for a journalist striving for ""balance, fairness and accuracy?"" How do you accurately and fairly report on Egypt's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved? I worried about this at the time with Mohamed Fahmy, but we decided that the choice was obvious -- as obvious as the price we are now paying for making it. The three of us have been accused of collaborating with a terrorist organisation [the Muslim Brotherhood], of hosting Muslim Brotherhood meetings in our hotel rooms, of using unlicensed equipments to deliberately broadcast false information to further their aims and defame and discredit the Egyptian state. The state has presented no evidence to support the allegations, and we have not been formally charged with any crime. But the prosecutor general has just extended our initial 15-day detention by another 15 days to give investigators more time to find something. He can do this indefinitely -- one of my prison mates has been behind bars for 6 months without a single charge. 'The prisons are overflowing' I am in Tora prison -- a sprawling complex in the south of the city where the authorities routinely violate legally enshrined prisoners' rights, denying visits from lawyers, keeping cells locked for 20 hours a day (and 24 hours on public holidays) and so on. But even that is relatively benign compared to the conditions my colleagues are being held in. Fahmy and Baher have been accused of being Muslim Brotherhood members, So they are being held in the far more draconian ""Scorpion prison"" built for convicted terrorists. Fahmy has been denied the hospital treatment he badly needs for a shoulder injury he sustained shortly before our arrest. Both men spend 24 hours a day in their mosquito-infested cells, sleeping on the floor with no books or writing materials to break the soul- destroying tedium. Remember we have not been formally charged, much less convicted of any crime. But this is not just about three Al Jazeera journalists. Our arrest and continued detention sends a clear and unequivocal message to all journalists covering Egypt, both foreign and local. The state will not tolerate hearing from the Muslim Brotherhood or any other critical voices. The prisons are overflowing with anyone who opposes or challenges the government. Secular activists are sentenced to three years with hard labour for violating protest laws after declining an invitation to openly support the government; campaigners putting up ""No"" banners ahead of the constitutional referendum are summarily detained. Anyone, in short, who refuses to applaud the institution. So our arrest is not a mistake, and as a journalist this IS my battle. I can no longer pretend it'll go away by keeping quiet and crossing my fingers. I have no particular fight with the Egyptian government, just as I have no interest in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood or any other group here. But as a journalist I am committed to defending a fundamental freedom of the press that no one in my profession can credibly work without. One that is deemed vital to the proper functioning of any open democracy, including Egypt's with its new constitution. Of course we will continue to fight this from inside prison and through the judicial system here. But our freedom, and more importantly the freedom of the press here, will not come without loud sustained pressure from human rights and civil society groups, individuals and governments who understand that Egypt stability depends as much as on its ability to hold open honest conversations among its people and the world, as it does on its ability to crush violence. We know it is already happening, and all of us are both moved and strengthened by the extraordinary support we have already had, but it needs to continue. Peter Greste . Tora Prison .

"Crimeans voted to break off from Ukraine and join Russia. Their vote represents the re-establishment of a historic cultural relationship. But take away the emotional side of the Crimean referendum and reality hits home -- the economic challenges that are yet to knock on their door. The peninsula only produces one-tenth of the energy it consumes. Ninety percent of its water, 80% of its electricity, and roughly 65% of its gas come from the rest of Ukraine. And while Russia has enough energy to supply power to Crimea, it's lacking the infrastructure -- there are not even any underwater cables though the Strait of Kerch, which separates Russia and Crimea. Crimean authorities set out their plan to nationalize the oil and gas company Chernomorneftegaz, but according to Lilit Gevorgyan, Senior Economist at IHS, that may not be enough to ""solve fully their energy problems and ...  become independent of Ukraine."" And the costs don't end there. Crimea depends heavily on the Ukrainian mainland to balance its books. Around 70% of Crimea's $1.2 billion budget comes directly from Kiev. Annexation of Crimea would be costly for Russia too because Crimea will need similar support, if not more, from Moscow. And while Russia's economy is stable, it is not growing. Moscow recently announced it will invest between $5 billion and $6 billion in Crimea, according to Helena Yakovlev Golani at the University of Toronto. The costs begin to add up -- and that's not including the challenges of integrating the banking system and currency and validating land titles. For the Crimeans, the most noticeable change could be the lack of tourists this season, with many expecting visitors to cancel tours because of the crisis. This will be damaging for Crimea, according to Ukraine's Tourism Board, given that Crimea attracted 6 million tourists last year. Seventy percent of holiday makers in the region are domestic visitors from mainland Ukraine. The crisis has been portrayed as a geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West, but it will also affect ordinary people;  they still need to eat, pay bills and dress their children. Some in Crimea have portrayed the situation as an economic crisis, but actions on the ground suggest this is less about the economy and more about Russia's desire to project power in a strategically important region.

"(CNN) -- It's been 19 months since the Costa Concordia, one of the largest cruise liners ever built, ran aground off the west coast of Italy, killing 32 passengers and capsizing after granite rock tore a 50-meter hole in the ship's hull. Now the rotting 952-foot wreck has been raised from its partially-submerged resting place off the Tuscan island of Giglio in what engineers say is a risky and unprecedented operation. The salvage team used cables attached to hydraulic pumps to rotate the ship upright -- a process known as ""parbuckling"" -- from the seabed onto a platform, which consists of a series of cement bags and huge under-water steel structure. After repairs are made to the previously submerged side of the Concordia, giant steel ""caissons,"" or boxes, on the sides of the ship will be pumped full of air and the cruise liner will theoretically float to the surface and be towed to a nearby seaport -- hopefully all in one piece. Success was anything but guaranteed: Engineers had warned they would only have one shot at parbuckling the ship -- and any error during the hours-long process could have seen the ship break apart, or over-rotate off the underwater platforms and sink completely. More than 500 people have been working around the clock on the rescue, which is being overseen by Florida-based Titan Salvage and the Italian firm Micoperi. The final bill will be at least $400 million, according to the salvage project's website. But the raising of the Concordia is far from the end of the story. The bodies of two passengers are still yet to be retrieved from the wreckage of the $570 million ship, which was carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew when it struck the granite rocks off Giglio on January 13, 2012. Even after the parbuckling and the repairs to the starboard side of the 114,500-ton vessel, the salvage crew will still have to wait for winter to pass before it can be towed to a nearby seaport to be taken apart. It could also take years to fully restore Giglio's pristine waters and marine life to their previous state. The island is part of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park, the largest protected marine area in the Mediterranean. Five members of the Concordia's staff were sentenced in July to short prison terms for their roles in the disaster. Francesco Schettino, the ship's captain, is being tried separately on charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship. His trial is set to resume in late September. CNN's Erin McLaughlin and CNN Wires contributed to this report.","Wreck of the Costa Concordia, one of the largest cruise ships ever built, raised from sea bed .

"(CNN)Yemen has been mired in political unrest, and Wednesday's decision by the United States, the United Kingdom and France to suspend embassy operations shows just how far the nation on the southwestern edge of the Arabian Peninsula has fallen into chaos. Yemen has been without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict since Houthi rebels seized control of key government facilities, dissolved parliament, and placed the President under house arrest. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi later resigned in protest. There are competing political interests across the troubled Middle Eastern nation and how they play out will have implications that reverberate around the globe. Many would-be jihadis from the West are recruited into al Qaeda through a slick English-language online magazine, Inspire, that's run out of Yemen. And U.S. officials consider the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous branch of al Qaeda. With that in mind, here are the things you need to know to make sure you're up to date on what's happening in Yemen. The U.S. State Department cited a deteriorating security situation in the capital, Sanaa, terrorist activities and civil unrest in its travel warning for Yemen. ""The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain extremely concerning,"" the warning said.  ""Demonstrations continue to take place in various parts of the country and may quickly escalate and turn violent."" There's been a political vacuum in Yemen since Houthi rebels rolled into Sanaa. Because of the instability, the U.S. Embassy had been operating with reduced staffing since September and a skeletal crew since January. The Houthi are Shia from northern Yemen and make up about 30% of the population in the majority Sunni country.  Saying they have been marginalized, they've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade. In September, they marched in to the capital, Sanaa, and seized government building and its airport. They demanded greater political influence. Some Western diplomats allege that Iran, one of the few Shiite Muslim nations, is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthis deny that. President Hadi has said the Houthis are being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. There's also a third party that's often mentioned: Ali Abdullah Saleh. He is Yemen's former President, who clung to power until he was forced out two years ago in the Arab Spring protests. The Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with his supporters, said Meda Al Rowas, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk. But politics, as we know, makes strange bedfellows. The alliance is fragile, she said, not least because Saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the Houthis. It really depends on the part of Yemen one lives in.  The central government has never been terribly strong. The Houthis hold sway in the north. But the South is a different matter. Southern separatists are a strong political force there.  Ever since North and South Yemen united in 1990, southerners not happy with the decision have long wanted to go independent again. Then there's Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which exerts influence over many rural areas stretching from the country's southwest to the northeast. Finally, the unrest in Yemen also has provided an opening for ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis. Still, ISIS remains a relatively small player in Yemen compared to al Qaeda. There are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that control their territories. Terrorists in Yemen have reached into the United States. Remember Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the ""underwear bomber"" who tried to blow up an American jetliner over Detroit in 2009? He took his marching orders from AQAP. The Boston Marathon bombing suspects and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the American soldier who gunned down 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, apparently were inspired by an American-born cleric in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki. An American drone killed him in 2011. Chaos is good for terrorists and bad for Western anti-terror efforts. The weaker the government, the easier it will be for al Qaeda to bring in people and train them for terrorism, which can be unleashed on the West. Under the old government, the United States had an ally against the terrorist network. With the chaotic situation in Yemen, Western efforts to hunt down al Qaeda are not impossible, but greatly hampered.

"(CNN)You could be forgiven for thinking that Italy's second city is all about fashion and finance. But go beyond the banks and boutiques and Milan offers a world of subterranean secrets, surreal meals and -- when its party scene gets too much -- silence. Above all, Milan offers an experience of Italy that sometimes feels very un-Italian. Here are a few things to know before you go. 1. All roads lead away from Rome . Rome might be Italy's eternal city, but it has an intense rivalry with Milan. While Rome is the seat of political power, Milan has the banks, the stock exchange and, of course, Italy's power houses of style. Romans have been known to say the best thing about Milan is the train back to Rome. But that doesn't stop them having the time of their lives partying here. 2. Restaurants often close early . Milan is a northern city -- it doesn't move to the Mediterranean beat of other parts of Italy. Restaurants away from the boutiques and clubs can stick to rigid opening hours and may be unwilling to serve you lunch after 1.30 p.m., or dinner after 8.30 p.m. The Milanese are known to be extremely punctual, so if you reserve a table, it's best to get there on the dot. 3. Less espresso, more long coffee . If you're bored with chain store coffee, Milan will be heaven . But don't expect to the strong, bitter, pungent taste of Italian espresso. Milanese tend to drink their coffee quite long, with added water. This is no doubt to help them linger over the amazing array of pastries and cakes the city has to offer. Panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas desert loaf, was invented in Milan . Sant'Ambroeus (Corso Matteotti; +39 2 76 00 05 40) is one of the oldest pastry shops in town. 4. Happy hour is aperitivo hour . Milan rules when it comes to laid back lounges, wild cocktails and gourmet bar snacks. The city is known for its love of the ""spritz"" -- a blend of prosecco, soda and a fruity Italian aperitif by the name of Aperol. Basso Bar (Via Plinio 39; +39 2 29 40 05 80) is the birthplace of Negroni Sbagliato -- a happy accident created when a busy barman mixed a Negroni cocktail with spumante instead of gin. At the Armani Bamboo Bar (Via Manzoni 31; +39 2 88 83 87 03) traditional Italian dishes have been turned into cocktails. The Caprese Mary mixes vodka, tomato juice, basil and mozzarella, while the distinctly fishy Cacciucco Experience features swordfish broth and anchovy cream. At Pavé (Via Felice Casati 27; +39 2 94 39 22 59), the rhubarb cocktails are served alongside fancy finger food. 5. Eating can get experimental . Milan isn't scared of tinkering with the tried and trusted Italian dining experience. Bianca's (Via Panizza 10; +39 2 45 40 90 37) offers a Tarte Tatin of caramelized apples, foie gras dipped in Marsala wine and chocolate crumble. Its Puntarelle salad dressing is made of vinegar and house-made raspberry sauce. At Cinc's  (Via Formentini 5; +39 2 36 55 02 57) there's a rice pie with a topping made of cinnamon melted in warm cream and mixed with Parmesan. The Risotto Acquerello at Don Carlos (Via Manzoni 29; +39 2 72 31 46 40) is cooked in Gorgonzola cheese, pears and licorice. 6. It's not just about the F-words . Yes there's the fashion and finance. But Milan is also a city with a rich Roman and Spanish heritage -- even if some if it lies buried from view. Deep beneath Milan's Duomo cathedral lies a maze of underground galleries, some dating to the 4th century. Visitors can join guided tours inside this subterranean world (Viale Romagna 46; +39 2 36 56 56 94). As well as lending its name to a formidable looking orthopedic brace back in the 15th century, Sforza Castle (Piazza Castello 1; +39 2 88 46 37 00) stands as a potent symbol of Milanese grandeur. Piazza Vetra, where witches were burned to death, offers a spookier side to the city. And there's always ""The Last Supper."" The Leonardo Da Vinci masterpiece that, for better or for worse, inspired Dan Brown can be seen at Cenacolo Vinciano (Piazza Santa Maria delle Grazie 2). 7. Navigli rules the night . Navigli is the city's most stylish district, the pulsing heart of Milan's party scene, where the young, hip and effortlessly cool hang out at bars and restaurants lining a network of canals. Among the best places to eat is Eppol (Via di Porta Ticinese 65; +39 2 36 79 82 90), home of the odd-sounding ham and whiskey club sandwich. Once you're partied out, you can hit the dreamy quiet of Milan's Quadrilatero del Silenzio. Art historians at Milano Guida offer tours of this ""silent"" neighborhood's mosaics, weird statues, secret gardens swarming with flamingos, and quirky architecture that includes a huge, ear-shaped door bell. Silvia Marchetti is a freelance journalist and writer based in Italy.","Restaurants off the beaten track might be unwilling to serve you dinner after 8.30 p.m.

"A newly revealed claim of conspiracy in the death of Princess Diana has royal watchers buzzing once again, nearly 16 years after the woman who would now be a royal grandmother died in a Paris car crash. But British police seem to be knocking down the claim -- that the British military was involved in the deaths of Diana, her boyfriend and their driver in August 1997. ""This is not a re-investigation,"" London Metropolitan Police tersely stressed, in a statement that revealed none of what it had been told. The latest claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to London police by the parents-in-law of a British special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart, according to an article on the website of the Sunday People newspaper. It did not offer a source for its reporting. Sunday People said it had seen a seven-page handwritten letter by the in-laws alleging that the soldier, whom the newspaper did not name, had boasted to his wife that the elite British Special Air Service commando unit was behind the deaths. The UK Ministry of Defence told CNN only that ""this is for Metropolitan Police to investigate."" Military authorities have been aware of the claim since the 2011 court-martial of the soldier's former roommate on weapons charges, Sunday People reported. The unnamed soldier mentioned in the letter was a witness in that case, according to the newspaper. Neither the Sunday People piece nor an earlier version carried by Press Association offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths. Diana, 36, and Dodi Fayed, her 42-year-old boyfriend, died when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997. They were being followed at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Their driver, Henri Paul, was also killed. Investigators concluded that Paul was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Dress Princess Diana wore to dance with Travolta auctioned . The princess left behind her two children, Prince William, whose wife recently gave birth to Diana's first grandchild, and Prince Harry. Some 2.5 billion people around the world watched Diana's funeral. A British coroner's inquest in 2007 concluded that the deaths were the result of ""grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes."" The inquest found no evidence of murder. A London police spokesman said no new information had been examined since this inquest. Yet the deaths have always been paired with conspiracy theories accusing British and French intelligence services and members of British royalty of orchestrating Diana's death. The Daily Mirror reported in 2003 that the Princess of Wales wrote to her former butler Paul Burrell 10 months before she died, saying her life was at its ""most dangerous"" phase and warning of a plot to tamper with the brakes of her car. After their deaths, Mohamed al Fayed, Dodi's father, said the couple were planning to announce their engagement and publicly accused Prince Philip, Diana's former father-in-law, of orchestrating the couple's murders. He testified at the 2007 inquest. A spokesman for al Fayed said Sunday he had no comment at this time but trusts the police will do a thorough investigation. Diana remains wildly popular in death, and news of the new claim sparked an immediate surge in discussion of her death on news sites and social media. But many seemed skeptical. ""Is it just me or does it (seem) like a Princess Diana conspiracy hits around this time of year, every year?,"" Twitter user DMR09 posted. The rumors come to light weeks before the 16th anniversary of Diana's death, and a little more than a month before the British premier of ""Diana,"" a new movie about the former princess's life. It's unclear whether these allegations will make it any further than previous claims have. London police seem unlikely to make any big announcements, based on the closing line of their statement. ""Not Prepared to Discuss Further,"" Scotland Yard said in the statement. Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18,369 .","Ministry of Defence says claim is for civilian police to deal with .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong authorities have vowed to conduct an impartial investigation into a video which appears to show several plainclothes police officers beating up a detained pro-democracy demonstrator. The widely circulated video shows officers carrying the man to a dark corner, where he's laid on the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched while others stand around, apparently keeping watch. ""Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force,"" said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning. ""The Complaints Against Police Office has already received a relevant complaint and will handle it in accordance with the established procedures in a just and impartial manner."" Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Lai Tung Kwok told reporters the ""officers involved will be temporarily removed from their current duties."" He declined to take questions. Embattled Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police. ""We will use the same mechanisms and procedures to deal with the complaint against the policemen on the incident last night,"" he said. Claims of 'brutal violence' The victim has been identified as Ken Tsang, a member of the Civic Party, who's also a social worker and a member of the 1,200 member election committee that choses Hong Kong's leader. Civic Party leader Alan Leong told CNN: ""This is an apparent abuse of police power that a society as civilized as Hong Kong would definitely not swallow. I would advise the commissioner of police to immediately arrest the six officers involved in that attack."" Tsang's lawyer Dennis Kwok said, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, ""six or seven police officers"" led his client to a corner where they punched and kicked him. ""It was unprovoked and unnecessary for anyone to use that kind of violence on an arrested person,"" Kwok said. He said some people had accused Tsang of pouring water on police, but ""whatever he was doing he was already arrested, his hands were cuffed and the proper procedure was to take him into custody and deal with him in accordance with the law."" Amnesty International called for the prosecution of any officers found to have acted unlawfully. ""It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law,"" said Mabel Au, the group's Hong Kong director. One of protest groups -- Occupy Central With Love and Peace -- circulated photos showing large circular welts on Tsang's back, bruising on his face and scratches on his neck and arms. Another main protest group -- The Hong Kong Federation of Students -- issued a statement calling for the resignation of Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-hunh, and other police commanders involved in preventing protesters from re-occupying Lung Wo road on Tuesday night. The road runs past the central government offices, and is near the main Admiralty protest site, the epicenter of the weeks long standoff between protesters and police. Protest clashes . Protesters accused police of using pepper spray during the operation, which succeeded in clearing the road for traffic. A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said. Authorities accused them of behaving ""in a disorderly manner,"" throwing traffic cones, snatching police barriers and building road blocks. Four police were injured in the operation, according to a government statement. During the attempted takeover of Lung Wo road, demonstrators declared they were ""not afraid of anything."" ""Ask them if they're afraid of bullets. They're not. This is our last chance. We know we're most likely going to fail, but we have to try,"" said 62-year-old demonstrator Lo Cheong. Retaking Lung Wo road was necessary ""to protect the protesters,"" said a demonstrator named Bon. In a statement released on Wednesday morning, police appealed to protesters in the area to ""stay calm and restrained."" ""Protestors advancing against Police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act,"" the statement said. By dawn, morning rush-hour traffic was flowing as normal. The contingent of demonstrators relocated to a park near the government offices, to a green space that they're occupying with tents. Protest disruption . Since late September, protesters from a number of pro-democracy groups have been blocking major roads, demanding a greater say in who leads the Special Administrative Region of China. At the peak of the protests, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets, calling for the resignation of leader C.Y. Leung, and demanding the right to be able to nominate candidates for the next election in 2017. Who's who in the protests? Protesters have been guarding barricades erected at protest sites at Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, and for many nights slept in the open air on the asphalt before the arrival of reinforcements with tents over the weekend. Traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures, bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites. Taxi drivers say their takings are down, and businesses claim the protests have cost them income. Hope that the two sides might be able to solve the impasse evaporated on Thursday when the government canceled talks planned with student groups, after protest leaders urged supporters to keep up the occupation. 'Not a revolution' On the weekend, Hong Kong's chief executive told local free-to-air station TVB that the protests were not a ""revolution,"" but a ""mass movement that has spun out of control."" Who is C.Y. Leung? He said student leaders had ""almost zero chance"" of pushing Beijing to change its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected. He added he would not submit to the protesters' demands that he resign, because his resignation ""will not solve the problem."" ""It is because the students and other occupation protesters demand more than that. They want the Standing Committee to withdraw its August 31 decision. That is impossible,"" he said. Beijing white paper . He was referring to the white paper issued by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress stating that Hongkongers would be able to vote on their leader in 2017, but only from an approved shortlist of candidates. In response to Leung's comments, the three main groups leading the occupy campaign said it was the government that was out of control -- ""a government that fires tear-gas at unarmed citizens and unilaterally terminated dialogue with the students (sic)."" On September 28, police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowd after protesters failed to disperse. The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech. The end of police trust?

"(CNN)About 300 migrants are feared dead after their boats sank in the Mediterranean Sea, the U.N. refugee agency said Wednesday. The incident is just the latest in a long series of disasters involving migrants risking dangerous journeys to seek a better life. The migrants left Libya on Saturday in rubber boats, the International Organization for Migration said. Some may have died without entering the water. Initial reports suggest 29 people died Sunday on one boat, mainly from hypothermia, said Andrej Mahecic, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 110 survivors arrived on the Italian Island of Lampedusa after being rescued by the Italian coast guard and a merchant vessel, he said. ""They confirmed to UNHCR that they had left on Saturday from Libya on rubber dinghies and had been at sea for days, without food and water,"" Mahecic said. Only two out of 107 passengers survived on one boat, and seven out of 109 people survived on another dinghy, the U.N. agency said. The Italian Coast Guard is continuing to search for a fourth dinghy, but rough sea conditions are hampering efforts. ""This is a tragedy on an enormous scale and a stark reminder that more lives could be lost if those seeking safety are left at the mercy of the sea,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR Europe bureau director. Worldwide, more than 40,000 migrants have died in their journeys since 2000, the International Organization for Migration said in September. Over half of them were trying to get to Europe. About 6,000 deaths occurred along the U.S.-Mexico border. And the situation is getting worse in Europe. Italy has recorded at least 50 migrant deaths this year, compared with 12 by this point last year, UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told journalists in Geneva, Switzerland. The migrants' primary country of origin? Syria, where millions have tried to flee the country's four-year civil war. Syrians accounted for 22% of the migrants arriving in Italy in January, Edwards said. Many of the maritime tragedies involve human traffickers transporting migrants in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats. ""Limited opportunities for safe and regular migration drive would-be migrants into the hands of smugglers, feeding an unscrupulous trade that threatens the lives of desperate people,"" IOM research chief Frank Laczko said last year. ""Undocumented migrants are not criminals. They are human beings in need of protection and assistance, and deserving respect."" Desperation, dire conditions for migrants fleeing to Europe .

"Grosseto, Italy (CNN)The captain of the Costa Concordia is guilty of manslaughter and other charges related to the ship's fatal wreck in January 2012 off the Italian coast, a judge announced Wednesday night, capping a tumultuous 19-month trial and providing a little more closure for dozens of grieving families. Lengthy trial or not, the three-judge panel needed only about five hours to decide the fate of Francesco Schettino. Their choices:  Agree with prosecutors who cast the captain as an ""idiot"" who abandoned ship like a coward, or with defense lawyers who characterized him as a ""scapegoat"" who ended up in a lifeboat only because he lost his balance and fell into it. The judges apparently sided with prosecutors, and sentenced Schettino to spend 16 years in prison and to pay court costs. It could have been worse.  The former captain faced a possible sentence of 26 years behind bars for convictions for causing a maritime disaster, abandoning ship and multiple counts of manslaughter. The nightmare will never end for the families of those 32 people who died after the cruise ship, captained by Schettino, crashed into rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio. And for a while, it may have seemed like Schettino's trial wouldn't end either. Over the past two years, the judges heard from a wide variety of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and technical experts. Those testifying included the captain's female guest on the cruise, Domnica Cermortan, a Moldovan dancer who testified that she was in a romantic relationship with Schettino and that she was with him on the bridge when the accident occurred. Schettino admitted to the court that his reason for sailing close to Giglio -- leading the ship to hit rocks -- was to ""impress the passengers."" Just before the judges got the case, the captain took the opportunity to speak again. Breaking down in tears, Schettino recalled that January day three years ago. ""I died along with the 32 others,"" he said. And since then, Schettino insisted, he's become a victim, processed by a ""media meat grinder."" Schettino's lead lawyer, Domenico Pepe, began closing arguments Monday, saying the Champagne bottle used to christen the ship when it was put into service in 2006 did not break. ""Everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far,"" he said. Pepe addressed each of the charges against the captain, starting with the count of causing a shipwreck and maritime disaster. He said helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin allegedly did not understand English -- a language he was required to speak -- when Schettino gave the orders to turn the ship away from the island. Therefore, the attorney argued, Rusli Bin caused the accident -- not Schettino. Rusli Bin was subpoenaed to testify, but his last known address was in Indonesia, and he could not be forced to come to the court in Italy. Schettino's defense also hinged on alleged malfunctions of the ship's equipment and infrastructure, including claims that the ship had faulty watertight doors and generators, and that the elevators did not work when the ship was listing. These claims were hard to verify because much of the ship was immersed off the coast of Giglio for many months after the accident. ""Everything that did not work on the ship is part of the cause of the accident,"" Pepe told the court. ""Lights didn't work. People fell into holes. Elevators got stuck."" Pepe ripped the prosecutor, who referred to Schettino as an ""idiot"" in his closing arguments last week. The lawyer offered one last defense of his client Wednesday, even as he said it would be ""easier to fly than defend Schettino,"" given all the barbs directed his way by the cruise ship company and media who ""needed a scapegoat."" ""In these three years,"" Pepe said, ""Schettino has suffered the same as a 30-year sentence."" Pepe tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers. He used a graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time Schettino apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore.  He said that once on shore, Schettino was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation. The attorney addressed the famous exchange between Gregorio De Falco -- commander of the Livorno Port Authority the night of the accident -- and Schettino, during which De Falco told Schettino to ""get back on board for f**k's sake."" Pepe called De Falco's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm. Pepe suggested it was De Falco's stern manner, rather than Schettino's alleged ineptitude, that damaged Italy's reputation. Addressing the manslaughter charges, Pepe tried to bolster his argument that because no one died on impact when the ship slammed into the rocks, Schettino cannot be held liable. Everyone who perished lost their lives as a result of the chaotic evacuation, he said. Pepe defended Schettino's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour. ""Stop for a minute to consider what would have happened if he had abandoned ship 1 kilometer from shore,"" Pepe said. ""There could be 4,500 dead, not 32.""  (There were 4,229 passengers and crew on the ship.) He also suggested that finding Schettino not guilty would actually be good for Italy's image, somehow restoring it in the eyes of the world, which has seen this case as an example of Italian ineptitude. But unless there's a successful appeal, Italy will never find out if that would be the case.","Francesco Schettino is sentenced to 16 years in prison .

"Brooklyn, New York (CNN)A New York police officer was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed Brooklyn man in November. Officer Peter Liang was arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court for ""recklessly"" causing the death of Akai Gurley, according to court documents. In addition to the manslaughter charge, Liang faces one count of criminally negligent homicide, one count of second-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of official misconduct. He was released without bail. If Liang were convicted on the charge of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison. ""The defendant ignored his training"" when he used his firearm, lead prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court. The defendant also did not try to help Gurley, instead retreating to a hallway and telling a fellow officer ""I'm going to get fired,"" Fliedner said. The prosecution will prove Liang made a ""deliberate motion"" with his firearm, he added. CNN tried to get a comment after court from defense attorney Stephen Worth but was unsuccessful. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson thanked Fliedner and others ""who worked so hard on this case so that the judicial process could be conducted fairly."" Thompson also thanked NYPD officers for their assistance. It was important to ""recognize the courage and valor"" that many officers showed when they responded to the scene, he said. Several officers tried to stop Gurley's bleeding. Prosecutors don't believe Liang intentionally killed Gurley, the DA said, but he had his finger on the trigger and an innocent man was killed. Gurley, 28, was ""a total innocent who just happened"" to run into Liang in a ""pitch black"" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an ""accidental discharge."" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. ""This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,"" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. ""The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident."" Liang and his partner were part of a ""violence reduction overtime detail"" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer fired his weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon ""for safety reasons,"" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers ""based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm."" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. Gurley's shooting occurred at a time of strained police-community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. A few weeks after Garner's death, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Darren Wilson, a decision that led to national  demonstrations.","Akai Gurley was taking the unlit stairs at a housing complex when he shot in the chest .

"(CNN)Home to a gorgeous coastline, ancient cities and lush countryside, Sri Lanka is also slowly healing from the wounds of war. But with a steadily improving infrastructure, this tiny emerald-shaped island is on the rise. Here are five essential experiences and destinations. 1. Riding the rails . One of the easiest ways to get around the country -- not to mention the cheapest -- is via Sri Lanka's rail network. It stretches across some of the country's most scenic landscapes, from tea gardens and paddy fields to that famed coastline. Three of the most photogenic routes are from Colombo to Kandy, from Kandy to the tea estates of Ella and from Colombo to Galle. Sri Lanka has two competing high-end rail services, Expo Rail and the Rajadhani Express. Both are first-class carriages run by private operators attached to regular trains run by Sri Lanka Railways. Rajadhani Express trains can be found on three routes that run on two major Sri Lanka rail lines. ExpoRail serves more than 60 destinations on four different routes. 2. Walking tour of Pettah, Colombo . Pettah is one of the most famous neighborhoods in Colombo, known for its historic buildings and markets. A great place to start your tour of this historic area is the Pettah Market on Main Street, a hotbed of Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim merchants. It's one of the most important trading centers in Colombo, selling everything from spices and dried fish to textiles. From here, you can head to Sea Street for gem shopping. South of the old Town Hall, vendors sell vegetables and fruits. While in the area, it's worth paying a visit to the impressive Wolfendaal Church, built in 1749, and the historic Jami Ul Alfar Mosque, built in 1909. 3. Golden Temple of Dambulla . The simplicity of its façade is a false tell -- Sri Lanka's Dambulla cave temple -- also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla -- contains wonderful painted murals and ancient artifacts. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this rock temple complex dates back to the 1st century BC. Towering more than 160 meters, the complex houses five main shrines. In the second cave, known as the temple of the great kings, you'll find the most impressive and biggest of all five. Built by Vattagamini Abhaya, it houses many Buddha statues in varying positions as well as deities from the Hindu pantheon. At the top of the complex visitors can watch the sun setting over the countryside. Coupling the trip to Dambulla cave with a visit to the nearby ancient city of Sigiriya makes for a spectacular experience. The best way to do this is to base yourself in the central Sri Lankan city of Kandy, 70 kilometers from Dambulla. For hotels, you can't go wrong with the chic Kandy House (Thekandyhouse.com, Amunugama Waluwa, Gunnepana, +94 81 492 1394; rooms from $225). 4. Glamorous Galle . The beautiful town of Galle was built around the 16th century by the Portuguese. A major trading post on the spice trade route, it also shifted hands between the Dutch and English. Today, it's a delight to walk or cycle around, its quaint streets strewn with old warehouses, churches, boutiques and beautiful homes. Galle Fort occupies roughly 130 acres. You can start your exploration with a walk around the fort wall, moving on to the National Maritime Museum just opposite the post office. Galle has some fabulous restored historic hotels. It's worth spending a night or two, as you get a real sense of the place when the daily tour buses leave. One of the best properties in town is Galle Fort Hotel (28 Church St., Galle Fort, Southern Province; +94 91 223 2870). From a weather standpoint, December to April is the best time to visit Galle. 5. Beach hopping . With its 1,340-kilometer coastline, Sri Lanka doesn't make things easy for those trying to decide which beach to bum on. First there's Unawatuna, famed for its golden sand. It's one of the busiest beaches in Sri Lanka, dotted with shacks, restaurants and hotels for every budget. Among these is French Lotus (Yaheddimulla Road, Unawatuna, Gall; +94 77 152 28 67; rooms from $38), a modest colonial house with cheap rates. For surfers, the waters of Ahangama have the best waves in Sri Lanka. There are many surf schools as well as rental shops across from the beach. Lapoint Surf Camp, situated just opposite the Ahangama beach, is renowned among surfers. Guests stay in an ocean-side villa, while the camp offers surfing lessons for all levels. Seven-day packages start from $443. Secluded on the southernmost tip of Sri Lanka you'll find the most fabulous stretch of off-white sand and azure water in the country -- Tangalle. Yet to be hit by mass tourism, it's a rare piece of paradise. Among recommended hotels in Tangalle: the luxurious Amanwella (Boddhi Mawatha, Wella Wathuara, Godellawela, Tangalle; +94 47 224 1333; suites from $600) with its private beach and modern suites. For whale and dolphin watching expeditions there's Mirrisa beach. But you'll first have to face a three-hour boat ride through rough waters. Raja & the Whales (+94 77 695 3452; tours from $43 per person) is one of the most responsible tour operators running whale watching trips.","Sri Lanka is home to historic cities, ancient religious relics and beautiful beaches .

"(CNN)Technology: the solution to, and cause of, so many of life's problems. For better and for worse, we're tethered to our computers, glued to our TVs and parked in front of video games for hours. Even texting can hurt your body. But don't ditch your devices altogether. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that smartphone applications and wearable devices are actually quite accurate in tracking step counts. ""Data from smartphones were only slightly different than observed step counts, but could be higher or lower,"" wrote the authors of the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The UPenn study recruited healthy adults who agreed to walk on a treadmill, tethered to 10 popular applications and devices by companies such as Fitbit, Jawbone and Nike, while an observer counted steps using a tally counter. They found wearable devices in general were less accurate than the smartphone apps. The most accurate devices, according to the study, were the Fitbit Flex, One and Zip. One device, the Nike FuelBand, reported step counts more than 20% lower than observed; Nike did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Despite the potential these devices have to get us up and moving, not very many of us have them, compared with mobile phones. A leading market research company says one in 10 adults in the U.S. own trackers, while nearly two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone -- and new technology has enabled these devices to easily track physical activity and other health behaviors. ""Increased physical activity facilitated by these devices could lead to clinical benefits not realized by low adoption of pedometers,"" the authors wrote. ""Our findings may help reinforce individuals' trust in using smartphone applications and wearable devices to track health behaviors, which could have important implications for strategies to improve population health."" Multiple studies have shown that if you're aware of and alerted to your progress, you're more likely to keep up the good work, exercising regularly and staying active. But if you're going to keep that phone while walking around, just make sure you keep your head up and look where you're going.","A study says smartphone applications and wearable devices are quite accurate in counting steps .

"Minsk, Belarus (CNN)Four key leaders converged on Belarus' capital Wednesday with one official mission: bringing peace to Ukraine. Whether they can achieve that is unsure, considering the violence, bitter divisions and failed negotiations. Still, the fact that French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin made the trip to Minsk to talk peace is notable. The stakes are high. Not only has war raged for months in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels angry about political upheaval in Kiev have declared their independence, but it's getting worse, threatening not only the lives of more civilians, but the stability of the region. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday before his arrival in Minsk, Poroshenko called the summit ""the most important one so far I have had as a President,"" Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported. The President said he and Ukraine's lawmakers were ready to introduce martial law across the country if ""further irresponsible actions"" lead to more escalation of the conflict. ""It will depend on the results of the summit whether we stop the aggressor through diplomatic means or go to a totally different regime,"" he is quoted as saying. Video showed Denis Pushilin of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Vladislav Deinego of the Luhansk People's Republic at the talks, speaking with reporters in Minsk on Tuesday night, putting to rest earlier doubts about their attendance. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also attended the preliminary meeting. That set the stage for the main event involving Hollande, Merkel, Poroshenko and Putin that began Wednesday night in Belarus' Palace of Independence. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that a document would likely be signed Thursday, according to the semiofficial Russian news agency RIA Novosti. But it was unclear what such a document might say. Will these talks yield a breakthrough? French and German officials sounded a note of caution about the prospects of finding consensus. And even if there is some sort of agreement, it's probably not wise to start celebrating right away -- given that there have been ceasefires before, none of which has lasted. The main points of negotiations of the so-called Normandy group -- the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine -- are expected to be the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the creation of a demilitarized zone and the future status of the Donbas area in Ukraine, which comprises Luhansk and Donetsk. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Tuesday that the talks were ""another huge chance to take a big first step towards de-escalation, hopefully towards a silencing of the weapons. ""But I underline it again, nothing has been resolved yet. The taking place of the summit alone is not a guarantee of its success. Therefore I urge and expect Moscow and Kiev to take it seriously and in the face of imminent military conflict really seize this chance."" Likely sticking points include who will control Ukraine's border with Russia in the disputed territory, disarmament of the separatists and what degree of political autonomy is granted to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Poroshenko has been invited to Brussels, Belgium, by European Council President Donald Tusk on Thursday to address European lawmakers and ""coordinate future steps,"" Poroshenko's website said. Meanwhile, the separatist leaders have been invited to Moscow, where they will brief Russian lawmakers on the outcome of the Minsk talks. The conflict, which broke out in April, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, has claimed more than 5,000 lives, many of them civilians. There's been no let-up in the violence ahead of the peace talks; in fact, both sides appear to have stepped up their efforts to gain territory before the lines of the potential demilitarized zone are drawn. Four people were killed and nine injured after a central bus station in Donetsk city was hit by shelling Wednesday morning, according to the official news agency of the Donetsk People's Republic, DAN. The Donetsk city office website reported that two buses were hit and burst into flames. In the past 24 hours, 19 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 78 injured in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military operation against the separatists, Vladislav Seleznyov, told reporters in Kiev on Wednesday. Shelling in the town of Kramatorsk on Tuesday killed 12 civilians and injured 35, including children, with 29 military personnel also injured, according to the Kiev-backed Donetsk regional authority. Kramatorsk, deep inside Ukrainian-held territory, is the location of the main base for the government's military operation against the separatists, which it calls the anti-terrorist operation, or ATO. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned what it said was ""another bloody crime"" by the separatists and said Russia, which it accuses of sending heavy weapons and troops across the border, should be held responsible. The OSCE said its monitors saw evidence that cluster bombs had been used in Kramatorsk. Cluster bombs are banned by many states because of their deadly impact on civilians. Fighting continues around the strategically important town of Debaltseve, which has been under siege by separatist forces for weeks. Ukrainian Gen. Oleksandr Rozmaznin said the town remained under Ukrainian control despite a separatist bid to attack the police station there. He said there was no fighting in the streets. A Ukrainian unit also launched an offensive Wednesday against the separatists near the city of Mariupol in the southeast. Each side has accused the other of shelling civilian areas. What's next in the conflict? U.S. President Barack Obama called Putin on Tuesday and urged him to seize the opportunity for peace, the White House said. ""The President emphasized the importance of reaching and implementing a negotiated settlement underpinned by the commitments in the (prior) Minsk agreement. However, if Russia continues its aggressive actions in Ukraine, including by sending troops, weapons and financing to support the separatists, the costs for Russia will rise,"" the White House said. Obama has not ruled out providing weapons to the Ukrainian military to help it defend against the separatists' advances. A Kremlin readout of the call said it focused on finding a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking alongside his Greek counterpart in Moscow on Wednesday, said there was ""no military solution to the crisis"" in Ukraine. Peace can be achieved only through dialogue between Kiev and the people of eastern Ukraine, he said, adding: ""The rights of all people who live there need to be respected."" Russian state news agency Sputnik reported that Lavrov would be traveling to Minsk for the talks. The European Union's Foreign Affairs Council agreed on additional sanctions Monday against Russian and separatist interests but said their implementation would be delayed for a week to ""give space for current diplomatic efforts."" Merkel in the middle of a U.S.-Russia standoff . The big challenge facing the leaders meeting Wednesday in Minsk is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick. A previous peace deal was signed in September, also in Minsk. It called for a drawback of heavy weapons, self-rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border. The new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines. The September agreement quickly disintegrated, and the violence continued. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into Ukraine. But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. All the while, the crisis in Ukraine, which stemmed from a trade agreement, has forced more than 1.5 million people from their homes, according to the United Nations. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Minsk and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Greg Botelho, Antonia Mortensen, Nick Paton Walsh, Alla Eshchenko, Frederik Pleitgen, Khushbu Shah, Laura Akhoun, Claudia Otto, Alexander Felton and journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev, Ukraine, contributed to this report.","Leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine meet in Belarus' capital .

"(CNN)Jerry Tarkanian, the legendary men's basketball coach who won the 1990 national championship at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and who was known to battle with the NCAA, died Wednesday in Las Vegas. He was 84. UNLV confirmed on its website the passing of the former Runnin' Rebels head coach. ""Coach Tark, my father, the greatest man I have ever known, passed today, to take his place in heaven,"" son Danny Tarkanian tweeted Wednesday. ""I will miss him every day of my life."" Tarkanian had been hospitalized since Monday with respiratory problems and had been hospitalized three times in the last 10 months for various ailments, including two heart attacks, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""The UNLV community mourns the passing of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, and our condolences are with Jerry's wife, Lois, and the Tarkanian family,"" UNLV President Len Jessup said. ""Coach Tarkanian's contribution to UNLV and Southern Nevada stretches far beyond the game of basketball. Many in Southern Nevada and around the nation were introduced to UNLV through Coach Tarkanian and the Runnin' Rebels. He made Runnin' Rebel basketball a brand name during his 19 years on campus, inspiring our community and creating a legacy that endures to this day. He will be deeply missed though fondly remembered as a college basketball icon and as one of the greats in our university's history."" Tarkanian, known as ""Tark the Shark,"" retired in 2002 after 38 seasons of coaching, including 31 in Division I. He coached UNLV from 1973-1992, taking the Runnin' Rebels to four Final Fours and won the national championship in 1990 -- a 103-73 win against Duke. The 30-point win set a record for margin of victory in the title game, a record that still stands. At UNLV, he won 11 regular-season conference championships, seven tournament championships and made 12 NCAA tournament appearances, including a stretch of nine consecutive years. After briefly coaching the NBA's San Antonio Spurs in 1992, Tarkanian coached at Fresno State, his alma mater, from 1995 until his retirement in 2002. ""Jerry Tarkanian is one of the true legends in the coaching profession,"" current Fresno State head men's basketball coach Rodney Terry said. ""He was successful at so many different levels in college basketball. Coach Tarkanian welcomed me in from the first day I arrived in Fresno. He loved the Bulldogs and stayed connected with our program throughout the years. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Lois, and family during this extremely difficult time."" Tarkanian wasn't afraid to go up against the NCAA. He was investigated several times in his career and once sued the NCAA in 1992 for trying to suspend him while at UNLV for violations found when Tarkanian was at Long Beach State. In 1998, while he was with Fresno State, the NCAA reportedly settled with Tarkanian for $2.5 million. Tarkanian compiled a career record of 784-202 while at Long Beach State, UNLV and Fresno State. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, the first UNLV coach or player to be enshrined. Tarkanian is survived by his wife, Lois; four children; and seven grandchildren. A campus memorial event is being planned, according to the UNLV website.

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)The trial of the man accused of killing Chris Kyle, the protagonist in the top-selling book and hit movie ""American Sniper,"" began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle's own words to bolster an insanity defense. Eddie Ray Routh is accused of killing Kyle and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a firing range at Rough Creek Lodge, about 90 miles southwest of Dallas on February 2, 2013. In his opening statement, defense attorney Tim Moore read a text Kyle sent to Littlefield about Routh as the three men rode in Kyle's pickup truck to the range. ""About an hour and a half into the drive, Chris Kyle was sitting in the driver's seat and he texts Chad Littlefield sitting right next to him. He texts, 'This dude is straight-up nuts,'"" Moore said. ""Chad Littlefield texts Chris Kyle back, 'He's right behind me, watch my six [military lingo for 'watch my back.']. So while we don't know what the conversation was, we do know what Chris Kyle was thinking at the time he was in that truck."" Moore said Routh killed the two men because he suffered ""a psychosis so severe that at that point in time he did not know what he was doing was wrong. ... He thought in his mind at that moment in time it was either him or them."" But Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash told the jury that Routh told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning. He admitted that he killed the two men and said he ""knew what he was doing was wrong,"" the prosecutor said. Routh used two guns, Nash said. Routh shot Kyle five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head, using a .45-caliber pistol, and shot Littlefield with a 9 mm pistol four times in the back, once in the hand, once in the face and once in the head, Nash said. A different .45-caliber pistol with all its rounds fired was found on the ground near Kyle's head, Nash said. ""(Kyle) had shot all the bullets in his gun when he was shot in the back,"" said Nash, referring to the fact that Kyle had just fired at a target. The trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. The film has grossed more than $280 million, the most ever for a war movie, and the autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. The first witness with Kyle's widow. Taya Kyle recounted the last conversation with her husband, on the phone. ""I said are you OK?"" she said. ""He said 'yep.' And that's not common for him. I could tell something was up and he was just quiet ..."" On that day, Kyle took Littlefield and Routh, a troubled veteran he was trying to help, to the firing range. Taya Kyle said her husband sounded irritated. ""Normally, going out there, especially a place like Rough Creek -- usually it's beautiful. He feels really good about helping somebody. He's making their day and he knows it,"" she testified. ""Earlier, he thought that guy sounded really excited to go, so he thought he was doing a good thing."" She said their last conversation ""was very short, and it wasn't short like, 'Hey, you are interrupting a good time.' It was short like, 'I wish I could say more but I'm not going to because there were people around.' "" Later she texted and he didn't reply, and she became worried, she testified. Kyle had already risen to fame through his book when he died. He'd been doing charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated, authorities said. Frank Alvarez, resident manager of Rough Creek Lodge, testified Kyle had ""exclusive access to the range when he came out."" Kyle had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes, Alvarez testified, but ""about 5 p.m. I got a radio call that said I had to go to the shooting range. Something had happened."" A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived.  Jurors were shown graphic photos of their bodies. Taya Kyle was in the courtroom at the time. Routh, an unemployed former Marine reportedly diagnosed with PTSD, was gone, and so was Kyle's black Ford pickup, police said. Routh drove up in Kyle's truck at his sister's house 65 miles away, police said. She called 911, telling the operator he claimed to have killed two men. ""They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy,"" Routh's sister told authorities. Routh got back into the truck and hit the road again, police said. Officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a Dallas suburb. While talking with police, he jumped back into the truck and sped off again, police say. They gave chase and stopped him after spiking his tires. He did not struggle when they arrested him, police said. Relatives of Routh, 27, and those close to him declined interview requests from CNN. Routh's attorney is making the case that his client is not guilty by reason of insanity. Since July 24, 2013, when a judge filed a gag order in the case, nobody associated with Routh's trial has been permitted to speak to the media. Before that order was issued, a reporter asked Capt. Jason Upshaw of the Erath County Sheriff's Office what could have driven Routh to the alleged murders. ""I don't know that we'll ever know,"" Upshaw said. Routh served in the Marines from June 2006 to June 2010. His time in the military included a 2007 tour of duty in Iraq and a humanitarian mission to help the victims of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Kyle learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father, then went on to serve four combat tours in Iraq with the SEALs, though his official biography notes he also worked with Army and Marine units. He received two Silver Stars and other commendations before leaving the Navy in 2009 after 160 confirmed kills, which he called a record for an American. He said that while killing did not come easy at first, he knew it meant saving lives. ""The first time, you're not even sure you can do it,"" he said in the interview. ""But I'm not over there looking at these people as people. I'm not wondering if he has a family. I'm just trying to keep my guys safe."" Kyle's story and the movie made from it have triggered broad enthusiasm but also drawn critics and doubts about his accounts. A sniper's view: 'When you are bred to kill, you know' Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Jason Morris reported from Stephenville, Texas, and Ralph Ellis and Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)The body parts found inside a suitcase on a San Francisco sidewalk were identified as the remains of a 58-year-old man who resided in the Bay Area, authorities said Wednesday. The man was Omar Shahwan of Vallejo, California, according to the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Authorities are still investigating the cause and manner of death, according to Christopher Wirowek, acting medical examiner administrator. One person was arrested and later released in connection with the discovery of the dismembered body, but that person, Mark Andrus, 54, died Saturday after admitting himself to a hospital the same day, San Francisco Police said. On Wednesday, police weren't disclosing what was the relationship between the dismembered man and Andrus, said San Francisco Police Lt. Albie Esparza. Shahwan's ""ID helps us out a lot. However, we still need to wait for the cause of death,"" Esparza said. Andrus was released from custody last month after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to prove a case against him. ""We are very disturbed by the facts of this case and are working with the San Francisco Police Department to secure the evidence necessary to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law,"" the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said last week. ""Given the current state of the evidence, there is insufficient evidence to charge this suspect with murder."" The dismembered body was discovered on January 28 when police were called to the South of Market district in San Francisco. Other body parts were found in a trash can less than a block from the main crime scene. ""Andrus was our primary person of interest who was subsequently arrested and booked for the crime,"" San Francisco Police Department spokeswoman Officer Grace Gatpandan said earlier this week. Jeff Adachi, a public defender who represented Andrus, said he was sorry to learn of his death. ""During the short time I represented Mark, I found him to be a kind and engaging person,"" Adachi said. CNN's Steve Almasy, Tony Marco, Catherine E. Shoichet and Sam Stringer contributed to this report.","The remains are those of Omar Shahwan, 58, of Vallejo, California .
Authorities are still looking at the cause and manner of Shahwan's death .
Police aren't disclosing the ties between Shahwan and a suspect, who's now also dead ."
"(CNN)It really isn't fair that just a million people call New Zealand's South Island home. Why should so few people get to hog such spectacular landscape? (Compared to, say, similarly sized England's population of 52 million.) The larger of the country's two main islands is more visually stunning than the North Island. With its smaller population, it's also more lonely and wild. To get a handle of the island's most sublime landscapes, we asked Auckland-based award-winning photographer Mike Hollman to share his favorite spots to photograph. Named New Zealand Travel Photographer of the Year in 2013 by the New Zealand Institute of Professional Photography, Hollman grew up on the South Island and says the landscape has had a tremendous impact on his work. ""The light is always changing and offering different views,"" says Hollman. ""My favorite time to shoot is in autumn, especially April (New Zealand's fall is from March to May) when the trees turn golden and the light on the landscape is magical."" 1. Milford Sound . With an annual rainfall of 6.8 meters, Milford Sound is one of the wettest places in New Zealand. All that rain makes for spectacular waterfalls, with hundreds cascading into the fjord on a wet day. Located within Fiordland National Park, Milford Sound is a 295-kilometer road trip from Queenstown, through vast landscapes of mountains and rainforest. Numerous scenic flight options are available from Queenstown. 2. Glenorchy-Queenstown Road . The 45-kilometer road between Glenorchy and Queenstown may be the most scenic in New Zealand. Magnificent views greet every turn as the road winds its way along the edge of Lake Wakatipu. ""The light is constantly changing and there are always opportunities for great photographs,"" says Hollman. He recommends the view from Bennets Bluff Lookout, 25 kilometers from Queenstown. 3. Matai Falls, The Catlins . Located on the southeast corner of the South Island, The Catlins is home to beautiful waterfalls such as Matai Falls. There's a lot to explore in the area. Landscapes range from rolling farmland to sweeping coasts to temperate rainforests. It's a 30-minute forest walk to reach Matai Falls, with parking available at the Matai Falls car park on the Southern Scenic Route, 18 kilometers south of Owaka. 4. St. Clair Beach, Dunedin . St. Clair Beach is one of the beautiful sandy beaches that sweep along the eastern suburbs of Dunedin. Located 15 minutes from central Dunedin, it's a popular surfing spot and home to cafes, bars and an outdoor heated saltwater swimming pool. ""The old wooden poles at the end of the beach have always been one of my favorite places to photograph,"" says Hollman. 5. Moeraki Boulders . These large, strange-looking spherical concretions eroded from the shoreline are some of nature's oddest sights. Some of the largest boulders measure more than two meters in diameter. Maori legend claims the boulders are remains of food washed ashore from the wreck of a large sailing canoe. ""Best viewed at low tide, these beautiful boulders always make for interesting photographs,"" says Hollman. The boulders are located on Koekohe Beach on State Highway One, 75 kilometers north of Dunedin or 40 kilometers south of Oamaru. 6. Church of the Good Shepherd, Tekapo . Located in Mackenzie Country in central South Island, Tekapo is renowned for its stunning clear skies and was declared an International Dark Sky Reserve in 2012. ""This is a great location for astro-photography, which attracts tourists from the world over,"" says Hollman. ""The Church makes for a nice subject, with the Milky Way and a shooting star in the background."" Tekapo is located on State Highway 8, midway between Christchurch and Queenstown. 7. Lupins on Lake Tekapo . Each summer the lupins around Lake Tekapoturn turn startling colors, attracting visitors and photographers in droves. Found along the shores of Lake Tekapo and surrounding countryside, the flowers are usually at their best during the first two weeks of December. Lake Tekapo is on State Highway 8 between Christchurch and Queenstown. 8. Aoraki/Mount Cook . New Zealand's highest mountain (3,754 meters) is known as Aoraki by Maori; it received its European name, Mount Cook, in 1851. Located in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, it features a number of walks and activities for all levels of fitness. ""The mountain is spectacular to photograph and is always different each visit,"" says Hollman. Accommodations at Aoraki/Mount Cook village range from backpacker-friendly to luxury. The village is 334 kilometers from Christchurch, and 258 kilometers from Queenstown. 9. Icebergs on Tasman Lake . Located in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, Tasman Glacier on Tasman Lake is New Zealand's longest glacier at 27 kilometers. The towering sights can be viewed from the shoreline or you can book a boat trip with Glacier Explorers from September to May for closer views. 10. Lake Matheson . At the heart of Glacier Country and Westland National Park, Lake Matheson is an achingly pretty sight. Formed by glaciation 14,000 years ago, it's surrounded by an ancient native forest. The lake mirrors two of New Zealand's highest peaks -- Mount Cook and Mount Tasman. 11. Franz Josef Glacier . A main attraction on the South Island's west coast, this 12-kilometer-long glacier descends from high peaks through temperate rainforest to just about 300 meters above sea level. Activities can be booked from the township of Franz Josef, located five kilometers away. 12. Southern Alps . Running 450 kilometers from north to south, the Southern Alps form a natural range along the entire length of New Zealand's South Island. At 3,724 meters, Aoraki/Mount Cook is the highest point. ""A scenic flight is a fantastic way to see these mountains closeup,"" says Hollman. ""There are many options and they operate out of all of the local tourist areas. For the best light, try for an early morning or evening flight."" 13. Waimakariri River . The Waimakariri River flows from the Southern Alps across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean. One of the loveliest areas of the river is near Arthur's Pass. ""The braided river banks and mountain light make for some great landscape photography,"" says Hollman. He recommends views of the river from State Highway 73, between Arthur's Pass and Christchurch. Mike Hollman is an award winning photographer based in Auckland, New Zealand. A Fellow and Master of Photography with The New Zealand Institute of Professional Photography, he was named New Zealand Travel Photographer of the Year in 2013. His work has been featured in National Geographic's travel photo competitions, published in books and magazines and can be viewed at http://www.mikehollman.com and www.facebook.com/mikehollman.photograph.","New Zealand's South Island has fewer people and more scenic views than North Island .

"(CNN)Often called ""the summer capital of South Korea,"" the port city of Busan is just a two-and-a-half-hour train ride from Seoul. The country's two largest cities, however, are remarkably different places. 50 reasons why Seoul is the world's greatest city . In the more low-key Busan, a night out usually means drinking soju with friends on the beach while watching kids play with firecrackers. Or eating hoe (Korean sashimi) -- again with soju -- at the shiny new fish market. Or watching burly, tattooed local men (widely considered more manly than their Seoul counterparts) play a popular street game, driving nails with a single blow into a thick wooden beam, for prizes of cigarettes and whiskey. Even apart from the prevalence of seafood, the cuisine in Busan is also different from that found in the rest of the country. Here's what to do in Korea's second city. Beaches . Haeundae . During the summer swim season -- it runs from July 1 to August 31 each year -- millions of Koreans, and increasingly more foreign visitors, descend on this strip of beach and revel in the water before heading out to party on weekend nights. Just in front of the beach is the Haeundae ""Sea Village"" Pojangmacha street, a strip of identical, tented seafood stalls selling everything from live octopus to lobster. Customers pick their own meal from a tank and minutes later have it cooked and served to them alongside their favorite Busan soju. Haeundae Tourist Information Center; +82 51 749 4335 . Gwangalli . Lit by 100,000 lights that change colors, Korea's longest suspension bridge is particularly beautiful from the beach at night. While Haeundae is a family friendly beach, Gwangalli is popular with younger crowds who come in single-sex groups and eye members of the opposite sex and occasionally party together. etour.busan.go.kr; +82 51 780 0077 . Hotels . Westin Chosun Busan . The Westin Chosun Busan's Haeundae beachfront view is so fantastic that the government capped the hotel at 10 floors when it was being built 35 years ago. The lobby has floor-to-ceiling windows with spectacular panoramic views of the sea; the hotel organizes local tours for guests (free or with a minimal fee). Savvy guests ask for sea-view rooms when booking. Westin Chosun Busan, Haeundae, 737 Woo 1-Dong, Busan; South Korea; +82 51 749 7000; rooms start around $200 excluding 10% service charge and 11% tax (rates vary according to season ) Park Hyatt Busan . The newest, highest and shiniest hotel in Busan isn't on the beach, but it has great views of Gwangalli beach. The rooms have stunning interiors that incorporate traditional Korean design into a monochromatic modern aesthetic. Park Hyatt Busan, 51 Marine City 1-ro, Haeundae-gu, Busan, South Korea; 82 51 990 1234; rooms from $240 excluding 11% tax (rates vary according to season ) Paradise Hotel Busan . The Paradise Hotel is the hippest hotel in the city for nightlife (there's a club in the hotel), spa (the new rooftop pools have incredible views and a bar) and fancy desserts. The lobby lounge's mango bingsu (Korea's favorite shaved ice dessert) is made with rose petals and is a culinary marvel. Paradise Hotel Busan, 1408-5 Jung-dong Haeundae-gu, Busan, South Korea; +82 51 742 2121; rooms from $210 (rates vary according to season) Eat and drink . Dwaeji gukbap (""pig soup rice"") This humble pork stew is probably Busan's most emblematic dish. It's served with an equally humble-looking dish of vegetables and a bowl of rice. The slightly stinky smell from salt-fermented shrimp masks the deep, satisfying flavor. Locals call it a perfect hangover cure or 2 a.m. post-clubbing meal. Miryang Sundae Dwaeji Gukbap, 543-1 Woo-1-dong Haeundae-gu, Busan, Korea; +82 51 731 7005; ₩6,500 ($6) Naengchae Jokbal . Busan has a number of food-themed streets, but a favorite among locals is Jokbal Golmok (Pig Feet Alley). Cooked in soy, ginger and garlic, the pig feet are served on a large platter with the option of naengchae -- a side of cold jellyfish slivers in mustard sauce -- that's particularly popular in summer. The longest lines are at Hanyang Jokbal, in the middle of the alley. Hanyang Jokbal, 35 Bupyeong-dong 1-ga, Jung-gu, Busan, South Korea; +82 51 246 3039 . Food map: Eat your way around Korea . Ssiat Hoddeok (seed hotcake) The highlight of Busan street food is a local sunflower seed variation of hoddeok, a hot, sweet, fried cake bursting with crunchy seeds and sugary goodness. Though many vendors in the International Market seem to sell the same thing, one hoddeok vendor located right next to the circular stage in the middle of market has lines at all hours of the day while neighbor vendors look on jealously. Gukje Sijang (International Market), Sinchang-dong 4-ga, Jung-gu, Busan, South Korea; ₩1,000 (90 cents) Dongnae Halmae Pajeon . This 50-year-old, family-run restaurant serves the softest, most delicious pajeon (pan-fried green onion ""pancakes"" with seafood) we've ever tasted, and is one of the region's legendary restaurants. Must-order dishes include Dongnae Pajeon (₩30,000 or $26 for medium-sized option) and the Utjiji, a row of sweet, chewy ddeok (rice cakes). Warning: there's a sneaky restaurant out front with a near-identical name but without the ""Halmae"" (grandmother) in the middle, trying to piggyback off the success and reputation of the original. Dongnae Halmae Pajeon, 367-2 Bokcheon-dong, Dongnae-gu, Busan, South Korea; +82 51 552 0792 . Busan soju . Busan variations of the best-selling liquor in the world are lighter and sweeter than their mainstream counterparts. Men drink the stronger C1 soju, while women tend to prefer the ""Ye"" series. Locals order a particular brand of soju according to mood or occasion: Jeulgowoye, meaning ""happy,"" is for the lighter occasions, while Geuriwoye, meaning ""nostalgia,"" is served at more somber events, such as funerals. 20 delicious Korean drinks . Temples . Beomeosa . This 1,300-year-old temple high in the mountains offers a breathtaking respite from urban life. Monks go about their daily rituals without taking notice of the few visitors wandering timidly around the premises. Those who want to experience temple life (meditation techniques, tea ceremonies, temple food) can sleep over with the temple stay program. The one-night-two-day program costs ₩50,000- ₩80,000 per person ($44-$70) per person, depending on the choice of activities. 33 stunning Korean temples . The temple is a 30-minute cab ride from the beaches of Haeundae. There are no taxis available on Mt. Geumjeong, so it's a good idea to ask the driver to wait around for the return journey. Round trips from Busan cost around ₩50,000 ($43), including wait time. Beomeosa, 546 Cheongnyong-dong, Geumjeong-gu, Busan, South Korea; +51 058 3122 . Haedong Yonggunsa . It's unusual to find a seaside temple in South Korea and Haedong Yonggunsa is one of the most beautiful of its kind. Usually mobbed with tourists and school groups, it's one of most popular places for locals to watch the first sunrise of the New Year. Haedong Yonggunsa, 416-3 Sirang-ri, Kijang-eup Kijang-gun, Busan, South Korea; +82 51 722 7333 .

"(CNN)A bar owner arrives to find his bartender still drunk, sleeping on a floor littered with empty beer bottles and cans. The band arrives, carrying a beaten-up car door. The intoxicated bartender, struggling to consciousness, is incapable of walking a straight line, yet he takes to a tightrope strung across the bar to do tricks to impress the cute female vocalist. This isn't a a scene from a wild Cambodian bar. It's the opening act of ""Khmer Metal,"" a show by the Phare Cambodian Circus in Siem Reap, the departure point for exploring dazzling Khmer archaeological sites such as Angkor Wat. After a day scrambling ruins in the sticky heat, most tourists spend their nights dining on Khmer barbecue while downing cold one-dollar beers on Pub Street. But increasingly, visitors are opting for a taste of contemporary Cambodian culture, everyday life and entertainment under the big top at the city's new circus. CNNGo in Cambodia . Performing arts wiped out by the Khmer Rouge . Seeing a circus in Siem Reap isn't such a strange idea. Carvings at temple ruins dating back as far as the 6th century vividly illustrate the country's circus tradition, depicting circus artists performing for ceremonies and festivals. In the 1960s, King Norodom Sihanouk encouraged a revitalization of the circus, only to see it die in 1975 when Pol Pot's brutal Khmer Rouge abolished all forms of art, culture and creative expression, and murdered artists. After the Vietnamese occupation sent the Khmer Rouge fleeing into the jungle, eight young Cambodians who'd been in a refugee camp on the Thai border decided to help rebuild their country by reviving the arts and culture scene. In 1994, the group established Phare Ponleu Selpak (PPS), a ""Beacon for the Arts,"" and opened a school for visual and performing arts, including circus skills, in a place that needed it most: poverty-stricken Battambang. Near the Thailand border, the small city was a magnet for repatriating refugees, including orphans, most suffering post-traumatic stress. PPS rescued disadvantaged children from the street, troubled homes and trafficking by providing free food, education, training and jobs. While the school is flourishing in Battambang, where some 1,400 students are enrolled, PPS decided to raise its shiny red big top tent and launch a program of shows starring students and graduates in Siem Reap. Cambodia's most popular tourist destination, Siem Reap had 1.24 million foreign tourists visit in the first seven months of 2013, making PPS's mission to reap profits and become self-sustainable more achievable. Mike's Burger House: Phnom Penh's In-N-Out-inspired fast food joint . Distinctly Cambodian show . Phare is no ordinary circus, but an edgy, alternative, down-to-earth, all-singing-and-dancing Cambodian circus in the tradition of Cirque du Soleil. A contemporary circus without animals, the cast of talented young Cambodian performers are accomplished in acrobatics, contortion, aerial ballet, balancing, tightrope walking, fire dancing, vaulting, juggling, music, dance, drama, mime and comedy. Their show, ""Khmer Metal,"" about love, life and rock 'n' roll, is set over the course of one night in a crazy bar and it's edge-of-the-seat stuff. A cocktail-sipping customer in a miniskirt and high heels does an elbow stand on the table, folding her legs over her back and head with ease to shoot a bow and arrow at a balloon with her feet. A moneyed, muscle-bound customer in skinny white jeans, who has had his iPad stolen, takes to the bar, doing some impressive hand-balancing moves on beer taps to grab her attention. In between these daring feats and complex tricks, bar staff and customers break into choreographed dance numbers as the band performs Cambodian rock songs, incorporating an array of samples, from heavy metal to hip hop, traditional Khmer folk music to 1960s Cambodian pop. 10 meals every visitor to Cambodia should try . Show draws from folk traditions . While ""Khmer Metal"" is thoroughly modern in its setting and storytelling, the group's ""Eclipse"" show is steeped in tradition, drawing from folk stories, religion and popular beliefs to tell the story of a bullied hunchback, rejected by villagers, who seeks divine intervention from an angel-like Apsara, the celestial maiden who graces Angkor temple walls. Wearing the simple black garb of rural peasants and using few props, the artists perform elaborate acrobatics and audacious stunts, forming human towers to strike Apsara poses, doing somersaults in flight and executing an impressive aerial strap routine. In between acts, they do a spirited, high-energy dance to the upbeat rhythms of the traditional xylophone, guitar and drums. As clever as it is, it's ultimately uplifting fun, the energy and enthusiasm of the artists contagious. What also makes Phare special is that it's distinctly Cambodian -- the music, dance, settings, themes and stories provide an insight into Cambodian culture and everyday life difficult to experience scrambling about ruins -- or drinking beers on Pub Street. Phare Cambodian Circus . Tickets (adults/kids $15/$8) available for daily 7:30 p.m. shows from 7p.m. at Phare Cambodian Circus, Komay Road, Siem Reap and from local travel agents. Backyard Travel offers a two-day, behind-the-scenes Phare Circus Experience for $482 including rehearsals, dinner at Phare Café, the show, meeting performers afterward, a cruise to Battambang to visit the PPS school, meals, hotels and transfers.

"(CNN)On most days, the gorgeous Gideon Putnam Resort & Spa in Saratoga Springs, New York, looks like the perfect place to start a new romance. This Valentine's Day, however, it'll be used to end one. That's the day a couple from Long Island, New York, with help from a company called DivorceHotel, will come together for the last time as husband and wife to finalize legal proceedings and make their divorce official. Married for 25 years with four children, Antonio and Kathie (who prefer not to provide their last names) are both in their mid-40s. Antonio works in the construction business in New York City, Kathie is a medical professional. Amid the lush grounds of the resort in the foothills of New York's Adirondack Region, the details of their split will be made official over three days, with wine and maybe spa treatments on the side. ""The hotel is actually known for weddings,"" says Kathie. ""It's got a great spa and it's in a great town with really good atmosphere. ""If you get stressed you can get a massage or a facial."" Though they share a ""warped sense of humor,"" the couple insists their Valentine's Day divorce is no joking matter. ""We're not trying to be flip about divorce,"" says Kathie. ""It was a long hard road to finally make this decision -- whether you've been married five or 10 or 25 years, divorce is never easy -- but it's best for both of us and our family, the six of us. ""We don't hate each other and we won't hate each other and this has lot to do with it. We're not taking this as a joke, but we can still joke about it."" If that attitude about something as potentially soul-crushing as divorce surprises you, the story behind the company that's facilitating what it calls a ""special ceremony"" might make you a believer. Though combining divorce and vacation might seem as American (and heart-friendly) as fried chicken and waffles, DivorceHotel is actually a Dutch company, founded in the Netherlands in 2011 on, if you can believe it, Valentine's Day. The company doesn't actually own or operate any hotels -- it partners with various properties to host divorce proceedings -- but says the concept behind its vision of ""divorce vacations"" is both pragmatic and positive. ""We started DivorceHotel because a lot of divorce procedures end up in fights that drag on for months and sometimes years,"" says company founder Jim Halfens, who is neither married nor divorced. ""The element of time destroys a lot of divorce procedures and a lot of lawyers and other professionals delay procedures on purpose based on their hourly rate."" DivorceHotel provides mediation services prior to the final divorce procedures, during which it enforces a strict three-day timeline to wrap things up. It operates on a flat fee. The couple tells CNN they're paying a total of $6,500 for their divorce -- that includes mediation and dealing with the legal end of the divorce, the hotel bill and resort weekend, including some meals, and $1,000 or so in state filing fees. ""The longer a divorce procedure takes the bigger the risk the procedure will fail, because more and more people with opinions will be involved and make it complex,"" says Halfens. ""We are able to split up our spouses in a clean and positive way."" ""We have friends we've seen go through divorces and it usually takes years,"" says Antonio. ""Even when it starts off amicably, by the time it gets to trial everybody's seething with hatred and making all sorts of crazy accusations. ""A buddy of mine was married for five and a half years and over $30,000 that they couldn't agree about (in mediation), it ended up costing him $200,000 (mostly in legal fees) and it's probably going to cost him his house."" Antonio and Kathie will travel to the resort separately and stay in separate rooms. ""I'm not looking forward to this weekend, but it's taking a lot of stress out of an already stressful situation,"" says Kathie, emphasizing that the couple's split is amicable. ""It makes it much easier to deal with."" Making a tough situation easier sounds good, but why target the day associated with heart-shaped chocolate boxes and other hopeful ""Be Mine"" sentimentality? ""When you think about it, this weekend has twofold meaning,"" says Kathie, who, along with Antonio, says the Valentine's Day timing is pure coincidence. ""Friday is Friday the 13th. Then we have Valentine's Day ... We are trying to keep our sense of humor."" Does Halfens have something against Valentine's Day? ""We started DivorceHotel in 2011 on Valentine's Day to show the world we believe it is possible to split up in a positive way,"" he says. ""It's more that we have an association with Valentine's Day -- positivity. ""You could say this is one special. It will be the first time in our existence we will process a divorce on Valentine's Day."" ""Special"" might not be the word Antonio and Kathie would settle on -- both make it clear the divorce decision process has been incredibly difficult and painful -- but they're at least satisfied with their decision to take care of the details the way they have. ""The whole notion of sitting in the cold, antiseptic environment of a courtroom or a conference room with attorneys and hash out all the details of my life, I didn't want it,"" says Antonio. ""That's not how we began our relationship and it's not how we should end it. ""This is civilized.""","Couple's Valentine's Day split makes point about emotional toll of divorce .

"(CNN)Many have been asking whether Tuesday's horrific execution-style killing of three Muslim students in North Carolina was due to a dispute over a parking spot. Let's be real. People don't die over parking spots. Craig Stephen Hicks was arrested on Tuesday over the deaths of Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, Yusor Mohammad, 21, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19. Chapel Hill police have said that an ongoing dispute over a parking place may have been a contributing factor. But while that may be true, the evidence suggests that Hicks had an underlying animosity towards the victims because of their beliefs. On his Facebook page, Hicks reportedly showed his support for ""anti-theism,"" the active opposition of religious belief. As Reza Aslan explained in a recent essay, anti-theists often view ""religion as an insidious force that must be rooted from society -- forcibly if necessary."" The lead photo on Hicks' page talked about how he wanted ""religion to go away,"" and in a 2012 post, he quoted heavily from biologist and so-called ""New Atheist"" Richard Dawkins. Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of two of the victims, said his daughter -- who wore the Muslim headscarf and lived next door to Hicks -- had reportedly told her family a week earlier ""that she had a hateful neighbor."" The News and Observer reported that he also said that in the past, she had told her family that Hicks picked on her and her husband and would talk to them while carrying his gun in his belt, making them feel extremely uncomfortable. "" 'Honest to God,' she said, 'He hates us for what we are and how we look,"" he recalled. Hicks' postings on social media suggest that he is not only anti-religion, but like many prominent New Atheists, likely has a particular contempt for Islam. Although Dawkins condemned the murders on Twitter, it is hard not to recall the comments he and other New Atheists like Sam Harris and Bill Maher have made about Islam in the past. Dawkins himself said he considers this religion of some 1.6 billion people ""as one of the great evils in the world."" For his part, Hicks allegedly wrote, ""When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I."" Following the shootings, the attorney of Hicks' wife said that her husband ""had a problem with many of his neighbors,"" and that the ""victims were at the wrong time and the wrong place."" But when we consider Hicks' own comments and postings on social media in the context of much of the anti-Muslim rhetoric we see in the media and elsewhere, it is hard to see Tuesday's tragedy as a genuinely random incident. Anti-Muslim hate crimes are five times more common today than they were before 9/11. And just a couple weeks ago, a Texas state senator effectively questioned the loyalties of Muslim-Americans, reportedly posting on her Facebook page that she had left instructions with her office that Muslim visitors ""publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws."" Neighbors have said that Hicks was prone to outbursts and that he made everyone feel unsafe, Muslim or otherwise. But that in and of itself doesn't make Hicks an equal opportunist when it comes to his choice of alleged victims. Being mentally unstable or a generally angry person and being motivated by religious hate are not mutually exclusive. In a move familiar to many Muslim organizations that are called upon to denounce the actions of a violent co-religionist, the American Atheists organization issued a statement condemning the murders of the three Muslim students. But we shouldn't expect them or any organization to apologize for the murderous actions of an individual. If Hicks is found guilty, there is no doubt that he alone should bear the responsibility for his actions and be punished accordingly. Even if he self-identifies as atheist, atheists and atheism are not to blame for his heinous actions. Still, although the killings of these three young Muslims should not be attributed to a lack of belief in God, they were allegedly committed by a man with an active contempt for belief in God. Regardless of whether law enforcement deems these killings officially a hate crime, we as a society need to acknowledge that violent extremists come in all creeds -- and they can be inspired and their anger nourished by any religion, or animosity towards one. With this in mind, the mainstream majority -- hailing from whatever faith or ideology -- needs to stand united against these kinds of acts of violence, regardless of the source. In practical terms, this means going beyond condemnation, by following the examples of people like Deah, Yusor, and Razan who lived out their faith values through service to others. We should also follow the example of organizations like Found Beyond Belief, which launched an atheist and humanist community drive to honor the victims. Ultimately, our nation's diversity is its strength. As citizens, we must do whatever we can to protect it.","Craig Stephen Hicks is being held over killing of three Muslims .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)A female suicide bomber attacked a crowded market in northeastern Nigeria's Borno state on Thursday, killing seven people and seriously injuring 20 others, residents and a hospital source said. The bomber, wearing a hijab, detonated her suicide vest in the midst of shoppers at a weekly market in the town of Biu around 3 p.m. at the peak of business, witnesses said. ""We have evacuated eight bodies, including that of the bomber, to the hospital along with 20 people injured in the attack,"" Bukar Maina, a trader at the market, said. A nurse at the Biu General Hospital confirmed the number of dead. No claim of responsibility was immediately made, but the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia, or Islamic law, across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram has recently increased its attacks against troops and civilians in a country preparing for a March 28 presidential election. The group also has launched attacks in neighboring Cameroon and Chad. Earlier this month, several African nations -- including Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad -- pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram. Thursday's blast targeted the provision goods section of the market, which attracts shoppers from the town and neighboring villages. ""I was in my shop, attendi‎ng to customers, when I heard a loud explosion that made me duck under the table,"" said Abacha Kachalla, another trader. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Attack happened at height of business at weekly market in town of Biu in Borno state .

"Elevated hopes that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 might soon be found were tempered Friday, when the joint search agency said the latest signal probably isn't from the missing plane. The most recent acoustic signal detected by an Australian aircraft in the search Thursday is ""unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said in a statement Friday. ""On the information I have available to me, there has been no major breakthrough in the search for MH370,"" Houston said. ""Further analysis continues to be undertaken by Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre."" But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in China on  Friday that authorities are ""very confident"" the signals picked up by acoustic detectors are coming from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported. It's unclear whether Abbott was referring to four signals detected earlier this week. As planes and boats scoured the Indian Ocean for more signals and signs of wreckage, a senior Malaysian government official and another source involved in the investigation divulged details about the flight to CNN on Thursday, including new information about what radar detected, the last words from the cockpit and how high the plane was flying after it went off the grid. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from military radar for about 120 nautical miles after it crossed back over the Malay Peninsula, sources say. Based on available data, this means the plane must have dipped in altitude to between 4,000 and 5,000 feet, a senior Malaysian government official and a source involved in the investigation tell CNN. The dip could have been programmed into the computers controlling the plane as an emergency maneuver, said aviation expert David Soucie. ""The real issue here is it looks like -- more and more -- somebody in the cockpit was directing this plane and directing it away from land,"" said CNN aviation analyst and former National Transportation Safety Board Managing Director Peter Goelz. ""And it looks as though they were doing it to avoid any kind of detection."" But former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo was not convinced. She said the reported dip could have occurred in response to a loss of pressure, to reach a level where pressurization was not needed and those aboard the plane would have been able to breathe without oxygen, or to get out of the way of commercial traffic, which typically flies at higher altitudes. That would have been necessary had the plane's transponder been turned off and it lost communications. ""If you don't have any communications, you need to get out of other traffic,"" Schiavo said. ""We still don't have any motive and any evidence of a crime yet,"" she said, adding that most radar can track planes at altitudes below 4,000 feet, so the plane's descent may not have indicated any attempt by whoever was controlling it to hide. She held out hope that the black boxes hold the answers and that they will be found soon. New flight details revealed . Malaysian sources told CNN that Flight 370's pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was the last person on the jet to speak to air-traffic controllers, telling them ""Good night, Malaysian three-seven-zero."" The sources said there was nothing unusual about his voice, which betrayed no indication that he was under stress. One of the sources, an official involved in the investigation, told CNN that police played the recording to five other Malaysia Airlines pilots who knew the pilot and copilot. ""There were no third-party voices,"" the source said. The sources also told CNN that Malaysian air force search aircraft were scrambled about 8 a.m. March 8 to the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, soon after Malaysia Airlines reported that its plane was missing. The aircraft took off before authorities corroborated data indicating that the plane turned back westward, a senior Malaysian government official told CNN. But the air force did not inform the Department of Civil Aviation or search and rescue operations until three days later, March 11, a source involved in the investigation told CNN. Later Thursday, communications officials from Malaysia's Transportation Ministry denied that jets had scrambled shortly after the plane went missing, calling that claim a ""false allegation."" Possible signal raises hope . The possible signal heard by a search plane was picked up through sonar buoys equipped to receive such electronic data and was detected near the Australian ship Ocean Shield, said the Joint Agency Coordination Centre. The Australian Defense Force source said the signal detected was not at the 37.5 kHz frequency consistent with the pingers from flight data recorders but in a range that suggests strongly that it is from something that is man-made. Commodore Peter Leavy of the Royal Australian Navy said Wednesday in Perth that existing technology in RAAF P3 aircraft had been modified to allow the acoustic processor to pick up sounds in the frequency range. Using the technology in this way is experimental, according to the source. The source said four RAAF P3 Orions have been modified with this technology, with the sonar buoys expiring and sinking about eight hours after they are deployed from the aircraft. On Wednesday, Leavy said that each P3 is capable of deploying 84 buoys, laid in a pattern or grid coordinated with the Ocean Shield. Although Leavy said the buoys have sensors that can detect signals ""at least"" 1,000 feet below the surface, the source is confident that the technology has been tested at a ""much deeper depth."" Crews have been narrowing the search area in the Indian Ocean. Imagining the search underwater . Search areas shrinks . Up to 12 military aircraft, three civil aircraft and 13 ships were assigned to assist in Friday's search for the Boeing 777-200ER, which was carrying 239 people when it vanished March 8 on a fight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. There were no sightings reported by search aircraft or objects recovered by ships on Thursday, the Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. Friday's search area was about 18,000 square miles (46,700 square kilometers), centered 1,436 miles (2,312 kilometers) northwest of Perth. That's far smaller than the search area's size a few weeks ago. ""It's pretty incredible, if you look at where we started, which was virtually the entire Indian Ocean, now getting it down to what's essentially a couple hundred square miles (where the pings have been detected) is pretty miraculous,"" Marks said. The Ocean Shield first picked up two sets of underwater pulses on Saturday that were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons. It heard nothing more until Tuesday, when it reacquired the signals twice. The four signals were within 17 miles of one another. ""I believe we are searching in the right area, but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,"" Houston said Wednesday. As the search continues, a U.S. Navy supply ship will help provide supplies and fuel to the ships that are looking for the missing plane. The USNS Cesar Chavez will help supply Australian naval ships involved in the search ""in the coming days,"" the Navy said in a statement. That's likely a sign that search teams are preparing for a lengthy hunt, analysts said. Tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane's data records, wreckage and the 239 people aboard. ""I think they're getting ready for the long haul,"" Goelz said. ""Even if they do get four or five more pings, once they drop the side-scanning sonar device down, that is going to be painstaking and long. So I think they are settling in for the long search."" Friday is Day 35 in the search. Time is of the essence: The batteries powering the flight recorders' locator beacons are certified to emit high-pitched signals for only 30 days after they get wet. ""The signals are getting weaker,"" Houston said Wednesday, ""which means we're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying."" As the focus narrows, more questions emerge in search for Malaysia 370 . The hunt for a Flight 370 ping: How they are doing it . How deep is deep?

"Washington (CNN)When Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal recently finished a speech blasting the Common Core education standards, a room full of activists from the conservative American Principles Project jumped from their seats in applause. Less than a year ago, they might have rushed for the door. The scene of Jindal railing against Common Core -- the education standards embraced by more than 40 states -- stands in stark contrast to his enthusiastic approval of the program when it was first introduced. Jindal proclaimed to business leaders in 2012 that Common Core ""will raise expectations for every child."" In a short time, Jindal has gone from serving as a steward of the Common Core standards to one of the nation's chief critics. But what's more remarkable is that conservatives -- known for seeking ideological purity in their politicians -- aren't blasting Jindal as a flip-flopper as he considers a 2016 presidential run. Instead, they see him as uniquely positioned to be a leading advocate for their cause with the governor's office to back up. Indeed, many on the right have accepted Jindal's repentance and are propping him up as an unlikely model for the anti-Common Core movement. ""Of the governors, he's been the most active in speaking out on the issue,"" Emmett McGroarty, APP's education policy director, told CNN. ""Quite frankly, he is the governor who has done the most to remove his state from Common Core."" This week, Jindal released an education proposal through his nonprofit advocacy network, ""America Next,"" that in part recants his support. The paper seeks to absolve Jindal of his previous position by claiming he had been misled through ""deception."" ""It was a bait-and-switch,"" Jindal told reporters Monday at a luncheon at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ""It wasn't what we've been told. It wasn't what we had been promised."" But how did Jindal go from championing the program to becoming one of its leading opponents? In 2012, after Jindal and other governors implemented the program, Common Core became a lightning rod issue among grassroots conservative activists who bemoaned it as a ""federal takeover of education."" In 2013, Jindal began expressing concerns about the program after his staff held meetings with Common Core opponents in the state. While some of the most vocal opposition to Common Core came from conservatives worried about increasing federal control of local education, many parents also voiced concerns about the substance of the curriculum, particularly noting that their children found it confusing. Other savvy Republicans, particularly those with White House-sized ambitions, began to take note. At conservative gatherings over the next year,  Common Core grew into one of the most talked-about issues. Suddenly, almost every conservative who had ever hinted at having presidential ambitions wanted to make it clear that they opposed the new standards. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who once supported Common Core, came out against it. The rallying cry ""repeal Common Core!"" became -- and remains -- a consistent crowd-pleaser in speeches by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. In the context of the burgeoning presidential race, the opposition has one added bonus: It lets Jindal use Common Core as a proxy to outline a case against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a consistent Common Core supporter who has also shown interest in running for president. Common Core fight a larger battle over the size of government . Jindal didn't become one of the movement's biggest proponents overnight. Activists cite his leadership and what they describe as tireless advocacy as handing the anti-Common Core movement new momentum. Anna Arthurs, a mother with school-aged children who has helped lead the grassroots push in Louisiana, said she first met with Jindal's staff in September 2013, bringing detailed information about the ills of Common Core. Over the next year, Arthurs and other activists lobbied legislators in Louisiana and the governor's staff to gather support. Finally, frustrated with the lack of results, Arthurs reached out to her legislator and demanded a meeting with the governor â€” and she got it early that summer. That first meeting came around the time when Jindal began to express his firmest opposition to Common Core. And when he flipped, Jindal flipped hard. By May 2014, Jindal began comparing the way Common Core was being implemented to  ""central planning"" in Soviet Russia. Amid a separate education battle with the Department of Justice over the use of school vouchers in Louisiana, Jindal began to accuse Democrats of standing ""in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids,"" comparing them to segregationists who fought against the civil rights movement in the 1960s and blocked black students from attending classes with white students. Arthurs, who sat next to the governor at the APP event last week, said that she believes Jindal's conversion was ""genuine"" and doesn't blame Jindal for his initial opposition. Instead, activists claim that Republican governors were duped by a massive public relations campaign and pressure from the National Governors' Association urging them to sign onto Common Core to secure funding for their cash-strapped states. ""I don't really blame the governors,"" Arthurs said. ""They heard an informercial... and they were all picking up the phone and ordering the product before it really ended. ... They didn't stop to ask the question: has this been tested?"" Jeb Bush isn't saying 'Common Core'","Just a few years ago, the governor of Louisiana was an enthusiastic supporter of Common Core .
Now, Bobby Jindal is leading the charge against the program .
Why the switch? ""It wasn't what we had been promised"""
"Another debris field, another new and so-far futile focus in the search for Flight MH370. More than three weeks after the Malaysia Airlines jet disappeared, one thing has been made clear: the ocean is full of garbage, literally. ""It isn't like looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Conservation International senior scientist M. Sanjayan said of the difficulty in finding the Boeing 777 aircraft. ""It's like looking for a needle in a needle factory. It is one piece of debris among billions floating in the ocean."" ""One piece of debris among billions"" Environmentalists like Sanjayan have warned for years that human abuse of the planet's largest ecosystem causes major problems for ocean life and people that depend on it. With the world's eyes now scouring Asian waters for any trace of the plane that was more than 240 feet long and weighed more than 700,000 pounds, the magnitude of the ocean debris problem has become evident. New Search: Nothing Yet . Two objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean, including one nearly 80 feet long, initially were called the best lead to date when a satellite detected them last week. So far, though, search planes have yet to find them or any other plane debris, with speculation mounting that the larger item was a shipping container lost at sea. No definitive records exist, but estimates for how many containers go overboard range from about 700 to as many as 10,000 of the roughly 100 million that the World Shipping Council says get shipped each year. Most ocean garbage comes from land . Lost containers are only a minor part of the problem. While ship waste also adds to ocean pollution, most of the garbage comes from land, Sanjayan said. More than a third of the world's 7 billion people live within 60 miles of an ocean coast, and their waste inevitably reaches the water -- either deliberately or indirectly. Estimates from various sources, including the Japanese government, indicate that more than 10 million tons of debris -- including houses, tires, trees and appliances -- washed into the sea in the 2011 tsunami. No answers yet as ships, planes search vast stretch of Indian Ocean . In addition, discarded plastics -- including countless bags like the kind routinely provided by retail stores and fast food restaurants until a movement in recent years to decrease their use -- form huge, churning garbage fields in the rotating currents of ocean gyres. One in the north Pacific is estimated to be at least 270,000 square miles, or an area larger than Texas. Sanjayan said the plastic breaks down in the saltwater to form a kind of ""plastic soup"" that gets ingested by marine life. Millions of sea turtles die from the plastic each year, he said, and one in 10 small bait fish has plastic in its stomach. That happens in the same waters that provide roughly 15% of the animal protein consumed by people. The world's ""toilet"" ""The world does use the ocean as its toilet, and then expects that toilet to feed it,"" Sanjayan noted. Many island nations and coastal cities lack infrastructure sophisticated enough to deal with all the waste produced, he said. In addition, much of that waste -- such as plastics -- now is so durable that it lasts for decades or longer in any environment. Sanjayan cited Dhaka, Bangladesh, as an example. Considered the fastest growing city in the world, the capital of 15 million people could expand to more than 20 million people in the next decade, according to the United Nations. Such growth far exceeds the capacity to deal with the garbage and sewage, Sanjayan said, adding: ""All that waste in countries like that -- low-lying, prone to flooding -- periodically flushes into the ocean.""

"(CNN)Myanmar has stripped away temporary voting rights given to the country's embattled Rohingya minority only a day earlier, following protests by Buddhist nationalists. About 1.3 million Rohingya, a Muslim minority, live in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are regarded as foreign interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, and face widespread prejudice. Hundreds of thousands instead hold temporary identity papers known as white cards. On Tuesday, a bill was enacted with a clause that would give white card holders the right to vote in a proposed referendum on the country's constitution. The move prompted protesters, including many Buddhist monks, to take to the streets of Yangon Wednesday, demanding that the law be revoked. ""You played the white card stupidly,"" read one protester's banner. That evening, the office of President Thein Sein issued a statement saying that the white cards would expire at the end of March, canceling the holder's newfound voting rights, the state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported. READ MORE: 'Caught between a hammer and an anvil' The statement said that white card holders would have two months from the expiry of their cards on March 31 to surrender them to authorities, who would then assess their citizenship status under the country's citizenship laws. The president's office also said it would establish an advisory commission to look into the question of white cards, which it noted had ""been an issue among the public."" In December, the United Nations passed a resolution urging Myanmar to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are subject to extreme discrimination. Following waves of deadly communal violence in 2012, more than 100,000 people in Myanmar's impoverished Rakhine State are trapped in squalid internment camps which they are forbidden to leave of their own volition -- officially for their own protection. When the U.N.'s Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Kyung-wha Kang, visited Rakhine's camps in June, she described witnessing ""a level of human suffering in IDP camps that I have personally never seen before."" Buddhist nationalists have been accused of stoking much of the anti-Rohingya sentiment, with a prominent monk recently calling a U.N. official a ""whore"" for her comments in defense of the minority. READ MORE: Top U.N. official slams monk over 'whore' comments . On the urging of the international community, Myanmar has outlined a pathway for delivering citizenship to the Rohingya. But critics say while it has the potential to provide some Rohingya citizenship, it is likely to define hundreds of thousands as illegal aliens, to be eventually deported. Myanmar is expected to hold a referendum on the country's constitution ahead of the general election scheduled for October or November. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy is favored to win at the polls, has been campaigning to change the constitution. In its present form it allocates a quarter of parliamentary seats to the military, which ruled the country for nearly half a century.

"(CNN)Barely 20 minutes into our 4WD trip and a leopard nonchalantly crosses the sand road some 10 meters ahead of our vehicle. Any more carefree and it'd have walked up to the jeep and casually asked for the time of day and a cigarette. The leopard is the latest surprise on a surprise-filled long weekend in Sri Lanka. The encounter is eyebrow-raising because our guide, Manjula, has passed Managing Expectations 101 with high honors. ""There is a good leopard population at Yala,"" Manjula said, ""but it's hard to see them as they tend to want to keep away from us. ""I can't promise you'll see any on this safari."" Rack one up for the guide. Rack up another for the leopard. The cat's appearance temporarily silences the far-too-frequent coos from the couple sharing the 4WD with me. They congratulate themselves over every bird we spot in Yala National Park. That's a lot of congratulating. Call me fussy, but unless a bird is remarkably colorful or remarkably massive or doing something massively colorful, I fail to get as interested as I probably should. Lions, tigers, bears -- big stuff, that's what I want to see. Even if they're just lying about scratching themselves. Biodiversity hotspot . One of the biggest surprises of the day is the layout of Yala National Park. Located about 300 kilometers southeast of Colombo, Yala is packed with dense scrub, bushes and forest broken up by watering holes and crisscrossed by sand and dirt roads that might render a lot of GPS systems useless. Thank God for Manjula. The park is divided into five blocks; three of them lack basic infrastructure for visitors and are under development. The main block for visitors, Block 1, spans some 20,000 hectares. Into this area Yala packs an impressive list of inhabitants. There are no lions or tigers, but there are about 130 bird species (including six species endemic to Sri Lanka), as well as leopards, elephants, crocodiles, deer, mongoose, Macaque monkeys, wild buffalo and the sloth bear. Other parks in Sri Lanka, such as the north-central Minneriya National Park, are better known for higher Asian elephant populations. Elephant herds can also be seen at nearby Udawalawe National Park. Yala gets its reputation for its leopards, something Javana Fernando, owner of Kulu Safaris, says is both good and bad. ""Our leopard subspecies is completely unique to Sri Lanka and marketing of the park is often too heavily focused on the leopard,"" he says, echoing the false warning Manjula had given us. ""That means some visitors are disappointed if they don't see one. ""But the true value of Yala is the diversity. It is a biodiversity hotspot."" Eventually I begin reaching for the bird book to study the Ceylon Grey Hornbill and White-bellied Sea Eagle  -- even this non-birder can be turned and that's saying something for the colorful birds here -- but it's the leopard that wins the day. Soon after the leopard crosses our path -- on a section of road that resembles the parking lot at the end of a rodeo -- a traffic jam of 4WDs packed with clicking cameras forms. Time to hand over our prime leopard-watching real estate to other safari goers. The beast turns out to be the first of several we spot on the day. (For other highlights and more information on the park, see the gallery above.) Curry for breakfast, lunch and dinner . Back at the camp on the outskirts of the park, dinner is followed by a well timed gin and tonic that helps wash away the layer of park dust that has attached itself to our faces and throats like a bad souvenir. Like the safari, Sri Lankan curry is highly photogenic, though considerably less dusty. A Sri Lankan curry meal is a combination of many curries and dishes, which may or may not consist of plates of things like chicken black curry, prawn curry, lady's finger curry, dhal, beetroot curry, sambol rice and papadum. According to Aman Resorts chef Sumit Batra, the options are endless. ""Potato, pumpkin, beetroot, jackfruit, breadfruit, cashew nuts, mukenwela, gotukola, banana blossom, mango, pineapple to name a few,"" Batra says. ""Of course, never forget dhal, which is always included. ""In addition, there are various spice combinations. Chili, curry leaves and cinnamon are the most commonly used, along with coconut milk and freshly grated coconut. ""There's generally one protein-based curry of either fish or chicken, and a range of vegetable curries. ""There's a combination of wet and dry vegetable curries and a range of vegetables and herbs from potato and pumpkin to the more exotic gotukola and mukunwela. Plus chutney and pickle."" The result of all this is a kaleidoscope of color, a mighty large food coma and dinner clothes that need a vigorous washing afterward. Curry is eaten at every meal, though the accompaniments vary. Breakfast features one or two curries, eaten with egg, plain or string hoppers or pittu. (See the gallery for images.) For the inexperienced, eating three square curries a day is a journey in itself. The many variations allows locals to eat curry every day and brand each a different meal -- not unlike Mexican food in this respect. Resort break . Batra's employers run Amanwella in the fishing village of Tangalle on the south edge of the island. The resort, 30 luxurious suites -- each with a plunge pool and terrace -- is the beach-side choice for accommodation. About 90 minutes from Galle (to the west of Tangalle) and a similar distance from Yala to the east, it's a perfect location to either stick about or explore the coast. Connecting all these spots are new smooth roads that make traveling (either in a rental car or by hiring a driver and car) and navigating traffic surprisingly easy -- quite a different experience from nearby countries like Myanmar, India, Thailand and Indonesia. The southern edge of the island, between Galle and Tangalle, is full of beaches, good surf and at the right season, whale watching. (See CNNGo's Sri Lanka episode for more on whale watching.) About a 15-minute drive inland from the Tangalle shoreline is Maya, a 19th-century manor house turned five-suite villa with a large garden that backs onto a rice paddy and is surrounded by forest. Dinner (surprise, Sri Lankan curry) and a look-see visit are highly recommended. Surfing Sri Lanka's southern coast . While Amanwella has a private beach (and serves a private candlelit dinner on its beach), nearby Nilwella is more surf friendly. With so many other beaches within reach, this bay is rarely crowded -- good news for uncoordinated and curry-induced flabby surfers. Shallow and with little to no rip, it's great for beginners who like to stay closer to shore; advanced surfers paddle further out. ""Sri Lanka is a good destination for surfing, with many hidden surfing spots,"" says local surfing instructor Bandula Gardiyawasam. ""The temperature of the sea is ideal all year and there are no shark or jellyfish threats."" Diminutive and patient, Bandula, 40, began surfing in 1991 and describes himself as the first professional surfer in Tangalle. ""There is only one person who surfed in Tangalle before me and he was my teacher,"" he says. ""Now he is too old."" Bandula recommends Cobra Point and U Point as top surf spots in Tangalle. Further afield he lists Arugambay, Hikkaduwa, Mirissa and Medigama as must-surf spots. Like the tourism industry, Sri Lanka's surf scene is in its relative infancy. But with clean beaches, good transport infrastructure and few others to drop in on your wave, the coastline is gaining popularity not only as a surf destination but for its other natural offerings. And hey, even its bird life. Getting there . Many international air arrivals and departures at Colombo's Bandaranaike International Airport come between 8 p.m. and 3:30 a.m. Sea planes from Colombo serve Tangalle. If you're dealing with an inconvenient arrival time, you may want to spend one or two nights in the Galle upon arrival. The city's fort area is well worth a day at least. Amanwella's sister hotel, the Amangalla, occupies the historic building that once housed the New Oriental Hotel in Galle Fort. The colonial-era building makes for an ideal base for exploring the 17th-century fort. Amangalla, 10 Church St., Galle Fort, Sri Lanka; +94 91 223 3388; rooms from $500 per night (rates depend on season).

The task force condemned alleged Boko Haram attacks going back to July 2012 in a statement, calling them ""incessant callous, brutal, barbaric and impious killings."" These included attacks on mosques, churches and businesses. Human Rights Watch said the militant group has killed more than 2,800 people in all. On Christmas Eve, attackers raided two churches, killing 12 people and setting one of the churches alight.  Six days later, suspected Boko Haram fighters killed at least 15 Christian worshipers, slitting some of their throats, according to Nigerian authorities. Read more: 22 killed in three attacks in Nigeria . Boko Haram carried out its largest known massacre in January 2012 killing 211 through coordinated bombings and gun assaults in the northern city of Kano, a popular target.  The group often attacks Nigerian police stations. The name Boko Haram means ""Western education is sacrilege."" In the past, they have attacked other Muslims they felt were on an immoral path but have increasingly killed Christians. The U.S. State Department has accused Boko Haram of attacking mosques and churches to incite tensions between the two religious groups, hoping to drive a wedge between them. It has condemned some of the group's leaders for alleged ties to al Qaeda. Read more: Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it .","One soldier is killed in the gunfight .

"Debaltseve, Ukraine (CNN)Debaltseve is a ghost town. Once a bustling railroad hub, its streets are normally empty. The remaining people only come out to board a bus or car that will carry them to safety, or when relief workers arrive to hand out rice, pasta, canned foods and other supplies. The Ukraine crisis: Everything you need to know . Bundled up against the raw winter weather, they line up to receive rations and scurry back inside their homes, hoping they won't be killed by the near-constant shelling. This strategically located town in eastern Ukraine is one more casualty of the fighting that has intensified in recent weeks between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. Separatists are trying to encircle the town while government forces maintain posts on the outskirts. A spokesman for the government's military operation, Vladislav Seleznyov, said the militants were consistently shelling Debaltseve -- and that it's currently the most dangerous place in the country. ""The city infrastructure is increasingly devastated,"" he said. ""Ukrainian armed forces are holding their lines of defense and are not going to leave their positions."" Only 3,000 to 4,000 of Debaltseve's 25,000 residents remain. Most have fled to safer places. Civilians are suffering. At least 224 were killed and more than 540 others injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said last week. The numbers may actually be higher. Who's left? Most of them are elderly with no family to take them in. Some seniors are so old they remember the horrors of World War II, such as a woman who stayed inside her apartment for two weeks, simply lying on her bed. Children are few and far between. Their families have moved them to safety. ""We don't care about Russians,"" one woman said. ""We want to live regular lives."" About one third of the houses have been hit by artillery. Dozens of people huddle in dank underground bunkers and sleep on cots and old beds carried in. Piles of sandbags protect the entrances to the bunkers. Others, like a group sticking it out in an old apartment building, are elderly but vehemently pro-Russian. ""We're just waiting for the Russians to come in and liberate us,"" one said. Scenes of exhaustion are everywhere. While people mill around the City Hall lobby, an old woman wraps herself in a quilt and stretches out on three side-by-side chairs to sleep. Most Debaltseve residents have fled to government-controlled towns, but leaving is risky. Shells rain on Debaltseve at all hours. The people who are left don't have transportation of their own. They collect their belongings in suitcases and plastic bags and gather at the train station or the city center. They wait for for cars, small buses or full-sized buses driven by relief workers to arrive and carry them to safe havens. They stare ahead blankly or break into tears while standing on the pavement. Once they're in a car or on the bus, danger still lurks. The road leading out of the battle zone into the closest safe town, Artyemovsk, is often shelled by separatist forces. And once they reach a shelter, they wait, wondering if they'll ever be able to return to their home. Jonathan Alpeyrie reported and photographed from Ukraine and Ralph Ellis wrote the story in Atlanta.","Only 3,000 to 4,000 of Debaltseve's 25,000 people remain .

Quicker than you could say ""total eclipse,"" the moon that is part of the ""Conan"" backdrop spoke up to say he would like to join Tyson's new project. Shortly thereafter, the man himself strode out. He was soon courting Conan's right-hand man, Andy Richter, asking whether he'd like a job on the show. ""Andy may be small in time and space, but he is a universe unto himself, comprised of atoms whose origins can be traced back to the stars that exploded billions of years ago,"" Tyson said before leading Richter offstage.

"(CNN)There is an old saying among soldiers and correspondents who cover them that when two people drink from the same canteen in some desert, jungle or other war zone they have a bond for life. This came to me in the middle of the night last night as I failed to make sleep come hours after learning that my friend and long-time colleague Bob Simon had lost his life. Death took him in a car crash in New York City. Bob and I had drunk from the same canteen more than once during the 48 years we had known each other, 38 of those working together at CBS News. Once, in South Africa I think it was, we were talking over an adult beverage or two in the shank of an evening about dangerous assignments, a subject about which Bob was experienced and expert. With a piercing look and a hint of that slightly off-center smile he sometimes had, he said something along the lines of, ""More correspondents are injured getting out of the shower and more are killed in automobile accidents than probably anywhere else."" The irony of that memory mixed with how death took him is painful and lingers. I've been trying for a long while to come up with an adequate way to describe how devastating Bob's loss is to those of us who knew him, to CBS News and to quality journalism.  But words are failing me.  They never failed Bob.  He was one of the best writers ever to work in television journalism.  He was a master of expressing so much with so few words, perfectly chosen and ordered. But Bob's words were more than just pretty or evocative. They were not there to stand on their own ceremony.  They were chosen to convey information, important information, and lots of it.  Bob could and often did write like a poet, but his every fiber was that of a journalist.  He was old school, in the style of Edward R. Murrow: notepad, shoe-leather, play no favorites, pull no punches and go where the action is. To look at Bob's roll call of overseas postings is to see the embodiment of a foreign correspondent.  From Vietnam to Northern Ireland to his specialty, the Middle East, Bob thrived on difficult and dangerous assignments.  His bravery was matched only by his unwavering professionalism.  And yet, even here Bob's story is incomplete. He didn't just witness history, he strived to understand it.  Yes, he was fearless when bullets were flying, but he also never blinked when staring down a despot or thug in an interview.  He was always prepared.  He knew when he was being lied to or toyed with, and rather than shirk from the challenge, he would embrace it and become more determined to expose the truth, or as close to the truth as possible. Bob was sophisticated, one of the few genuine ""scholar correspondents"" in television. He was extremely well read, urbane and poised.  He also had a good sense of humor and sometimes was downright funny.  There was no issue he couldn't cover, no story he couldn't tell.  Television is of course a visual medium, but with a Bob Simon piece, if you closed your eyes and just listened, that was often enough. His words and his voice had that power. It was a privilege to know him, an honor to have worked with him. My deepest condolences go to his widow Francoise, and their beloved daughter, Tanya, herself a very accomplished journalist.  I also mourn with the rest of the CBS News family. Bob was the very best of that network's news traditions. He had unbounded curiosity and uncommon compassion.  He searched out stories that he felt were important, and then brought them to light with an elegance and intuition that will be sorely missed everywhere that good journalism is valued. And within the ""60 Minutes"" offices, his absence will be felt especially keenly: the twinkle in his eye, the joke, the story, just Bob being Bob, all of that gone in an instant.  Now, only memories remain. That and the example he set. Godspeed my friend.  May you continue to inspire those of us left behind.

"(CNN)The 2022 World Cup should be played in November and December, but don't worry -- the final won't ruin your Christmas holidays. A FIFA task force has recommended that the tournament in Qatar be moved from its traditional June and July slot, but the organization's secretary general, Jerome Valcke, has told CNN that the final won't take place on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Football's global governing body has been exploring ways to avoid playing the World Cup in the Gulf state during its scorching summer months. The task force, headed by Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa, also suggested the 2022 competition should be shortened. A final decision on when the tournament will be staged will be made at a meeting of FIFA's executive committee between March 18 and 19. The proposal to move football's showpiece event to the European winter is likely to be met with disapproval by the continent's top club teams. ""Yeah, very disappointed that's the word, I think, on behalf of the all the European leagues and particularly the European clubs who provide most of the players for this World Cup,"" said Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the English Premier League. The month of December is traditionally hectic in the English Premier League with games scheduled throughout the month, but even in Spain's La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A and France's Ligue 1, those leagues' winter breaks don't begin until well into December. Those European winter months are also when the continent's premier club competition, the Champions League, plays its group stages. But UEFA, European football's governing body, has supported the task force's recommendation and said it would accommodate the proposed change by adjusting its competitions . ""We are very pleased that, after careful consideration of the various opinions and detailed discussions with all stakeholders, we have identified what we believe to be the best solution for the 2018-2024 international match calendar and football in general,"" Al-Khalifa said in a statement. ""It was a challenging task and I want to thank all members of the football community for their productive input and constructiveness in helping to find a solution that we believe can work for everyone."" Across the pond, rescheduling the Cup also promises to create conflicts, as Fox has the TV rights to the 2018, 2022 and 2026 World Cups. November and December mark the latter parts of the extremely lucrative college and professional American football seasons, and Fox is one of three networks with rights to the National Football League through the 2022 season. The network has also been home to various college football games since 1998. The National Basketball Association and college basketball seasons will also just be getting underway in November.

"(CNN)With Carnival under way and Fat Tuesday on February 17, it's high season for reflecting on the virtues of New Orleans. The city rolls at a different pace during Mardi Gras, with parade routes blocking access to certain neighborhoods at outwardly mysterious times and businesses closing or amending their hours to accommodate the season's unique needs. Flexibility, a strong sense of adventure and a costume on Fat Tuesday will help Mardi Gras visitors make the most of it. While the Crescent City is never entirely predictable -- and a good dose of whimsy is always the best preparation for a trip to New Orleans -- the following must-do list could serve as a guide for visitors arriving after the final Carnival parade rolls down St. Charles Avenue. While we could write an encyclopedia on the city's food and music options alone, these 15 suggestions will help you start to experience the heart of this low, lovely, lyrical place. Eat with your hands . Among the benefits of dining in a shellfish culture is that silverware is frequently optional. Eating with your hands is the only way to get through a bowl of buttery, pepper-spiked BBQ shrimp at Pascal's Manale Restaurant, where the iconic dish was first conceived. Boiled crawfish is the seasonal delicacy from roughly January through May, and it's arguably best eaten on a park bench with a cold one. Big Fisherman in Uptown and KJean in Mid-City are reliable crawfish takeout spots. And locals tend to tip oysters on the half-shell up to their lips rather than mess with those awkward, tiny forks. At Bourbon House Restaurant in the French Quarter and Casamento's Restaurant in Uptown, no one expects you to use those forks for anything besides squeezing the juice from lemon wedges over your catch. World's most colorful carnivals . Browse a supermarket . Especially at locally owned grocery stores like Rouses Supermarkets and Langenstein's, you can stock your suitcase -- and, later, your pantry -- with Louisiana dry goods staples like Camilla red beans, Cajun Country rice, Zapp's Potato Chips (try the Cajun Crawtator), Creole-style coffee, crab boil and boxed jambalaya mix. Even if you can't find room among your boas and beads for smuggling food products home, it's worth a wander down the spice aisle to observe in what amazing quantities New Orleanians stock up on bay leaves and cayenne pepper. Cool off with a sno-ball . New Orleans' best ammunition against the subtropical heat of its eight-or-so summer months is, perhaps counter-intuitively, not alcoholic. Sno-balls (not snow cones) are simple but culturally important treats of finely shaved ice drenched in sugary syrups. They come served in cups or Chinese take-out containers and are generally sold from trucks, takeaway windows and small sweet shops. Your favorite sno-ball vendor is generally the closest sno-ball vendor, though our pick is Uptown's Hansen's Sno-Bliz, where the syrup flavors range from the traditional (nectar, chocolate, cream of strawberry) to the uber-contemporary (satsuma, cardamom, ginger). Get your bounce on . Miley Cyrus might have brought twerking -- a dance move that involves shaking one's rump at the speed of a hummingbird's wings -- to a popular audience at MTV's Video Music Awards in 2013, but New Orleans dancers have been ""popping"" since the late 1980s. In a NOLA.com/Times-Picayune article, local music writer Allison Fensterstock even presented evidence that Miley learned to twerk to New Orleans bounce music while filming a movie here in 2010 and 2011. Check in at http://nolabounce.com for bounce news and up-to-date club listings. Take a literary tour . New Orleans collects literary ghosts, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and Eudora Welty among them. Besides reading works penned while writers were encamped in the city, the best way to channel the city's literary life is by touring the French Quarter's numerous and wonderfully atmospheric used and new book stores. Call it antiquing for the mind. Our favorites include Crescent City Books, Librairie Book Shop and Kitchen Witch, a store specializing in used cookbooks. Local author Susan Larsen's book, ""The Booklover's Guide to New Orleans,"" is a great resource for unpacking the city's literary dimension. Eat beignets . The centenarian, open-air coffee and beignet spot Café du Monde might be the most obvious tourist attraction in the French Quarter, if not the entire city. As we're in the business of steering visitors to New Orleans' more genuine experiences, you might expect us to avoid such clichés. On the contrary. A beignet-free trip to New Orleans would be a travesty of the first order, and Café du Monde has a high batting average for serving a consistently hot and well-sugared product. The queue can be excruciating, though, so keep the nearby Café Beignet, as well as the City Park location of Morning Call Coffee Stand, in your back pocket. Marvel at the Mississippi . In a city surrounded by water -- the Great River, Lake Pontchartrain, the ever-encroaching Gulf of Mexico -- it's sometimes surprising how infrequently you encounter water views. Woldenberg Park, adjacent to the French Quarter, is an exception; it's also a wonderful place to pass a breezy hour or two. But for a birds-eye view of the winding Mississippi and its workings, take the elevator at Canal Place (located at the foot of Canal Street) skyward. Alternately, ""The Fly"" at Audubon Park, just behind the Audubon Zoo in Uptown, is an expanse of ball fields and green space from which you can watch magnificent barges push down the river at eye level -- and practically at arm's length. See Treme off-screen . Experience the real-life companion to David Simon's HBO series ""Treme"" by exploring what is sometimes referred to as America's oldest African-American neighborhood. You could begin just across Rampart Street from the French Quarter at Armstrong Park. Then make your way to Backstreet Cultural Museum for a Mardi Gras Indian history lesson, worship at a jazz-filled Mass at St. Augustine Catholic Church and lunch on Creole gumbo, seafood platters and po-boys at Li'l Dizzy's Café. Take a Katrina tour . Katrina tours are touchy, and with good reason. Cruising in air-conditioned buses or vans through previously flooded neighborhoods where the worst possible scenario occurred -- and where, more than nine years later, life is hardly back to normal -- is inherently controversial. But seeing the altered neighborhoods with a knowledgeable guide is also the best way to unpack the natural and human-wrought causes behind Hurricane Katrina's remarkable losses of life, land and property. Drink a Sazerac . New Orleans had a cocktail culture long before ""mixologist"" entered the popular lexicon and specialty cocktail bars augmented the nation's bar topography. Though it's also drunk in other cities, New Orleans has laid claim to the Sazerac, a stiff drink of rye whiskey, bitters, sugar, absinthe or pastis and a twist of lemon. Mixologists make reputable versions in their cocktail bars around town, but the best places to drink Sazeracs are where they've always done well -- in historic hotel bars like the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone or the Sazerac Bar in The Roosevelt New Orleans; and in the city's oldest restaurants, like Tujague's and Galatoire's. Go to Mardi Gras . If you can't make it down for the actual holiday, you can still peek at the pageantry. Tours at Mardi Gras World offer spectacular behind-the-scenes looks at float production and costumes, as well as off-season tastes of king cake. Lunch on fried chicken in the Seventh Ward, twice . Just two blocks apart, the kitchens at Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase's Restaurant arguably put out the city's most consistently fine fried chicken, though only at lunch. The restaurants and their 90-plus-year-old matriarchs are not at war, but instead coexist peacefully, with differences in ambiance and chicken-frying styles. Willie Mae's is a more casual restaurant with chicken cooked to order, while Dooky Chase is a white-tablecloth establishment with a lunch buffet. Turn on the radio . Wherever you listen to 90.7 WWOZ community-supported radio (you can stream online from anyplace), it sounds like Louisiana. Horns. Accordions. Carnival tunes. Listen long enough and you'll find your favorite DJs and shows -- for us, it's Bill DeTurk's New Orleans Music Show on Fridays and the back-to-back Gospel and bluegrass programs on Sunday mornings. Local food media personality Tom Fitzmorris hosts a three-hour radio show about New Orleans food every weekday afternoon on 1350 AM. It also airs on 105.3 FM on Saturdays. And the local NPR station, WWNO 89.9 FM, is rife with local programming. Find some brass . Especially in the spring, around Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, it's nearly impossible to walk down a New Orleans sidewalk without eavesdropping on some school kid practicing his trumpet or her trombone. Music begins in the schools and in the neighborhoods. Second line parades, which include brass bands, roll every Sunday during the cooler months. And in-between the beads and masks in Carnival parades are junior high and high school marching bands high-stepping and getting the crowds moving. For nighttime brass sounds year-round, you can count on clubs like Blue Nile, Hi Ho Lounge and Maple Leaf Bar, where the Rebirth Brass Band raises the roof every Tuesday night. See some art, and eat some too . New Orleans has a centrally located arts district, commonly called the Warehouse District, which is a little-known relative to the city's more historic and heavily toured neighborhoods. The Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) is the district's anchor, though it's no longer the only attraction. Additionally, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the National World War II Museum, the Louisiana Children's Museum and numerous galleries and art spaces have built a neighborhood where you could easily spend a couple of days. To sweeten the pot, the Warehouse District happens to be a culinary hotbed, with top-tier restaurants like the Link Restaurant Group's Cochon and Peche, Emeril Lagasse's flagship restaurant Emeril's New Orleans, Adolfo Garcia's steakhouse La Boca and American Sector at the World War II Museum.

"(CNN) -- The face of 15-year-old Aziza says it all. Her mouth slightly agape, tears stream down her face as she glances around the inside of a helicopter with confusion in her eyes. She looks completely exhausted, overcome with emotion. She cries the whole flight to safety. The Iraqi air force and fighters with the Kurdish peshmerga carried out a dramatic rescue mission Monday at Mount Sinjar, taking supplies to desperate Yazidis and ferrying a handful of people out, including Aziza. A CNN crew was on the flight that took diapers, milk, water and food to the site where thousands of people have been driven by ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Map: Where is ISIS? CNN's Ivan Watson, who was on the chopper, described the mission as ""heroic."" Teams hurled out bags and boxes of food from as high as 50 feet before approaching the ground. ""We landed on several short occasions, and that's where -- amid this explosion of dust and chaos -- these desperate civilians came racing towards the helicopter, throwing their children on board the aircraft. The crew was just trying to pull up as many people as possible,"" Watson said. Soon, some of the trapped families -- including babies and the elderly -- were packed into the flight. A man held a water bottle for a woman trying drink, her head propped up on his shoulder. Others didn't make it and were left behind as the helicopter pulled away. ""It was chaotic. It was crazy, but we were able to then lift off with about 20 civilians,"" Watson said. Iraq's Yazidis trapped, hiding from ISIS in the mountains . Kurdish official warns of genocide . Yazidis, among Iraq's smallest minorities, are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, they have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshippers. More than a week ago, they fled into the surrounding mountains when ISIS fighters stormed the town of Sinjar. Now, trapped without food, water or medical care in the summer heat, thousands of families are in desperate need of help. A senior Kurdish official warned Monday of the potential of genocide against the Yazidi people. Speaking to CNN's Watson, Fazil Mirani repeatedly called for a humanitarian intervention. He estimated that as many as 70,000 people remain trapped on Mount Sinjar, and that at least 100 people have died so far from dehydration and the heat. CNN could not independently confirm those estimates. Who are the religious and ethnic groups under threat from ISIS? 'They flew in shooting; they flew out shooting' The United States on Monday conducted airstrikes on four ISIS checkpoints and ""multiple"" ISIS vehicles near Mount Sinjar, according to U.S. Central Command. ""Our aircraft remain positioned to strike any terrorist forces around the mountain who threaten the safety of these families,"" President Barack Obama said the same day. ""We're working with international partners to develop options to bring them to safety."" Back on the helicopter, the relief of those already rescued was palpable. The crowd on board burst into tears as the chopper took off. Young and old, women and men, civilians and servicemen -- all cried with the intensity of the moment. Gunners had to open fire at the ground in order to make it away from ISIS. ""They flew in shooting; they flew out shooting,"" Watson reported. ""There was not a dry eye on the aircraft."" Who are the Yazidis? Why does ISIS want to kill them? CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","The United States conducts airstrikes around Mount Sinjar .

"(CNN)Huge campaign rallies, posters plastered across the country, and expensive advertising and social media strategies -- Nigeria's two main presidential candidates are fighting for voters across all mediums, except one: There will be no live presidential debates in this election. But on Wednesday evening, many Nigerians got the closest to seeing their two main choices fight it out over the airwaves. Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan addressed the country by one of his irregular ""media chats"" broadcast on NTA (the National Television Authority), and his challenger Muhammadu Buhari spoke to Christine Amanpour on CNN. ""In six weeks, serious advances will be made but I'm not saying we will wipe out Boko Haram,"" said President Jonathan when asked a question about one of the most pressing issues for many Nigerians -- national security. In recent months, the Islamic militant group Boko Haram has made significant territorial gains in northeast Nigeria, but a recent offensive by Nigeria and neighboring countries, Chad and Niger, hopes to roll back these advances. However, on Amanpour, the opposition candidate Buhari dismissed such claims and blamed the government for repeated military setbacks: ""The misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the Nigerian military is unable to beat Boko Haram."" Nigeria's upcoming election is set to be the closest since the country returned to democracy in 1999. The major issues many Nigerians want addressed include: security, the economy, corruption and electricity. There are also significant concerns about the run-up and conduct of the elections themselves. Voting day was postponed after the Nigerian military said they could not provide security for the elections due to the ongoing offensive against Boko Haram in the north. The U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, released a statement saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" by any ""political interference"" by the military, and Buhari's opposition party has called the postponement a ""setback for democracy."" President Jonathan insisted the delay was not a ""big deal"" during his media chat, but made clear what is at stake in this election: ""If the Electoral Commission conducts this election poorly, it's on my head.""","Nigeria's presidential candidates fight for voters on all media -- except live presidential debates .

"Washington (CNN)Boy, that escalated quickly. A collection of Democratic PACs meant to give the party's presumptive front-runner Hillary Clinton a solid foundation for launching a campaign is experiencing its first fracture in what has been so far a unified front. One of the group's central figures, David Brock, resigned Monday from a super PAC board with a scathing email accusing his colleagues of ""specious and malicious"" attacks on his credibility. The Priorities USA board has long been seen as the hub of pro-Clinton group coordinating and the rift gave Clinton opponents fresh ammunition to remind the public of campaign infighting from 2008 and worried supporters who feared the return of staffing turmoil that led to the last campaign's implosion. The public dispute between super PACs is an anomaly for five political groups that, until now, have presented a largely lockstep march behind Clinton, sliding into place since she left the State Department in 2013. And while the web has not always been harmonious -- some close to Priorities USA tried to sink Ready for Hillary early on in the group's founding -- it has worked effectively and helped ice some of the field that could challenge Clinton. But the now public rift put that into question causing some Democrats unaffected by the fighting to question why these seasoned operatives let things play out so publicly. A key problem for the pro-Clinton groups -- and by extension Clinton -- is that each of these organizations were conceived to play a specific role that relied on each other to do it's job. For example, American Bridge, a Brock run group, is compiling a wealth of opposition research on Republicans that are likely to run for president in 2016. That information was going to be used in the fundraising and ad buying efforts run by Priorities. But with still simmering tension, it is unclear how those roles will continue to be filled. The split between Brock and Priorities USA began after The New York Times published a story last week examining Brock's fundraising practices. The piece questioned his relationship with Mary Pat Bonner and the fact she receives over 12% of all money she raises for Brock-tied groups. In the letter Brock defended his fundraising practices and called the Times story ""an orchestrated political hit job."" The issue is that Brock's resignation from the Priorities board doesn't mean he is no longer involved in the pro-Clinton movement. He still leads two of these groups: Correct the Record, a communications and rapid response organization, and American Bridge, an opposition research firm that tracks Republican candidates and builds research books to help the Clinton effort. Then there is Priorities USA, the big money wing of the web, with deep ties to Clinton, and plans to use large sums of money to run ads against Republicans. The two groups that were seemingly left out of the recent infighting were Ready for Hillary, the grassroots arm of the pro-Clinton outside group world, and Emily's List, a group focused on electing women candidates and, by extension, Hillary Clinton. The meeting point for all these groups was supposed to be the Priorities USA board, which brought together stakeholders from each pro-Clinton group and operated as a forum to coordinate efforts. ""If you look at our board, the Priorities board, that is coordination incarnate,"" said a Priorities USA source in early 2014. ""That is coordinating."" Some operatives inside the pro-Clinton world tried on Tuesday to stress that things were on the mend, even if Brock and his former Priorities USA board were still separated. ""Bumps in the road happen,"" said one Democratic source with knowledge of the super PAC fall-out. ""At the end of the day, the top focus is getting Hillary elected to be the next president and all the groups are going to keep working together."" ""We are moving forward,"" the source reiterated. But that doesn't seem to be the whole story as bad blood between Democratic operatives played out in major news outlets on Tuesday and Wednesday. The rift comes down to money and the jockeying for positions that was expected to take place as the all-but-certain Clinton campaign began to kick into gear. As part of the fallout, sources have begun to talk about fundraising woes at Priorities USA and concerns that the group will not be able to compete with the fundraising prowess on the right -- a claim a source at Priorities USA vehemently disputed. While it's not just Democrats that experience staffing shake-ups especially in the early days of the campaign -- Jeb Bush's PAC Chief Technology Officer resigned Tuesday -- the Clinton-land break up, and attempted public makeup, left some Democrats questioning whether the pro-Clinton groups were truly united and gave many political watchers flashbacks to the quarreling that defined Clinton's failed 2008 run. What's more, the infighting reminded many political watchers of Clinton's 2008 campaign, when public squabbling among top-level operatives defined the former first lady's fall from frontrunner to failed candidate. From the start of the 2008 campaign, Clinton advisers were at odds with how to portray the candidate. Should she be tough and go after then-Senator Barack Obama, who quickly took over the second place slot behind Clinton in polls? Or does she take a softer side to combating the rising challenger? Strategists on the campaign disagreed and the rifts, which as first played out in private, went public quickly. Just like seven years ago, the right seized on the discord this week. On Monday, conservative outlets painted the fighting as yet another chapter in Clinton-land drama and the Republican National Committee peppered reporters with links to stories about the fighting. ""Left Cracks Over Clinton Cash,"" blared the Drudge headline. Recognizing the message war, Brock and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, co-chairwoman of Priorities USA, issued a joint statement on Monday, hours after the letter went public, that pledged to work on their issues. Democrats close to the situation said the conciliatory statements were honest, and both Brock and Granholm, but tensions are still simmering. Despite all of the friction, many Democratic operatives said day-to-day operations between the groups will continue as planned. ""Everything will still happen the way it is supposed to happen,"" said one Democratic source with knowledge of the situation. ""On a day-to-day level, those two groups work well together."" ""People aren't going to let a working relationship not be good,"" the source added hopefully, ""when the stakes are so high."" Despite public makeup, pro-Clinton groups are very much at odds .

"(CNN)There's a new scavenger hunt on the weekends in Johannesburg. Cars snake around the blocks as drivers slow down to peer through what could be the windows of an abandoned warehouse covered in graffiti. Or it could be the doorway to one of the city's gourmet food markets, havens of organic produce, Seussian cupcakes and fresh roasted coffees. Three major markets have turned into anchors of redevelopment in the city, driving Johannesburg's renaissance as the surrounding blocks become magnets for restaurateurs, artists, students and increasing numbers of tourists. The Neighbourgoods Market (73 Juta St., Braamfontein, Johannesburg; +27 11 403 0413) is a place people hear before they see it. On Saturday mornings, artisanal food and hipster fashion fill the second and third floors of a parking garage. The entrance is down an alley off DeBeer Street and then up a ramp, but the way is marked and decorated with lights. It shouldn't be a struggle to find the entrance, just follow the crowds of Beautiful People who come every week for lunch. For shoppers, there are cured meats, rustic breads, endless cheeses, cut flowers and raw chocolates. For diners, it's a straight shot toward the back for a tray of raw oysters with champagne. Those who prefer their food cooked can head across the way for the best fried chicken in the city (served over watermelon and fries). On chilly days there's a potjie, a cast iron cauldron brimming with stew. Up the stairs is an open-air level with seating that overlooks the neighborhood's pricey new condos and the tangle of train tracks leading to South Africa's main rail hub. A bit higher up is the fashion level, where racks of leather jackets hang alongside children's dresses printed with Nelson Mandela's beaming smile. The Braamfontein neighborhood pulls a curious mix of people. One of the country's most prestigious universities is nearby, along with the Joburg Theatre complex (158 Civic Boulevard St., Johannesburg; +27 11 877 6800) and the headquarters of some of the country's biggest corporations. A decade ago, Braamfontein felt like it had slipped irretrievably into urban decay. Now it's one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the city. The people who pack into the market are the lifeblood of the small shops and galleries on the surrounding streets, which now do most of their business on Saturdays selling photos taken by street kids, vintage clothing and high-design furniture. On the east end of downtown, the weekly market at Arts on Main (268 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 334 5947) opened five years ago in a century-old building that was originally a liquor warehouse. Inside there now, there are craft beers and cocktails to sip every Sunday while shoppers wander aisles of food as cosmopolitan as the city itself. There's the option of sitting on a stool in a sunny courtyard and enjoying Ethiopian coffee, then moving on to an Argentine barbeque and Italian gelato. If that doesn't suit, keep walking to find paella, burritos, dim sum and crepes. This is also one of the city's best places to sample food from around South Africa. The traditional bread known as roosterkoek cooks on the braai barbecue, waiting to be stuffed with vegetables and meat. Nearby is a table of curries from Durban, which can be served as ""bunny chow"" inside the hollowed end of a loaf of bread. There's freshly sliced biltong, the dried meat that could be beef or game. Out on the sidewalk, there's a braai shack where fresh meats are grilled on the street and served with chips or pap, finely ground corn meal served thick like mash potatoes. When the eating's done, the rest of the building and neighborhood make for a great walk. Artists have set up studios and galleries around the warehouse where visitors can buy super-enlarged copies of iconic ""Drum"" magazine covers from the 1950s, see how prints are made or pick up a gorgeously illustrated art book. The surrounding streets host independent shops and cafes, as well as the city's only art house cinema, the Bioscope (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 039 7306). Staying the night is an option. There's Curiocity Backpackers (302 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 728 80 9583), run by the charismatic Bheki Dube, who also organizes walking tours and volunteer experiences. A step above the backpacking circuit is the nearby 12 Decades Hotel (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +1 866 332 3590), offering boutique-style lodging in 12 rooms decorated by artists to reflect each decade of Johannesburg's history. At the opposite end of Fox Street, The Sheds (1 Fox St., Ferreirastown, Johannesburg; + 27 84 057 0015) is the newest of the markets, housed in a complex of former mining warehouses. From the doorstep visitors can see the offices of the mining companies and banks built on Johannesburg's gold wealth. Inside, well-tended urban farm beds lead to a dizzying expanse of shopping and dining. Indigenous plants like Kalahari melons are transformed into body creams, while old packets of laundry detergent and potato chips become purses and makeup bags. It's the food, and drink, that draw in the crowds. Bartenders pull pints of craft beers, next to an American-style barbecue stand and a taco stall. There's a curious Latin infusion in many of the food stalls, with an emphasis on spicy salsas and novel chocolate sauces. And there's the full range of traditional South African market fare, including biltong and fantastic cheeses, but also a surprising selection of bubble teas -- the milky drinks often filled with tapioca pearls or fruit jellies that originated in Taiwan. The driving force behind The Sheds is Gerald Garner, whose passion for Joburg history has turned into a beloved series of walking tours, books and now this market that aims to turn into more than a weekend event. They're currently open Thursday through Sunday, with a busy calendar of live music and performances. Griffin Shea is a writer and traveler based in South Africa. His latest project is a travel app for African cities for iPhone and Android.","Gourmet food markets are revitalizing Johannesburg's most depressed neighborhoods .

"(CNN)England has banned smoking in cars where children are present -- a law that will come into force from October 1, with offenders facing a fine of £50 ($77). The law states that it will be an offence to smoke in a private vehicle with someone under age 18 in the car, and to fail to prevent smoking under the same circumstances. The legislation applies to enclosed, private vehicles but not to anyone driving alone. ""Three million children are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars, putting their health at risk,"" the Public Health Minister Jane Ellis said. ""We know that many of them feel embarrassed or frightened to ask adults to stop smoking, which is why the regulations are an important step in protecting children from the harms of second-hand smoke."" The British Lung Foundation said more than 80% of second-hand smoke contains cancer-causing toxins, which are more concentrated in the confines of a car. Children are more susceptible to the harmful effects because their lungs are smaller, they breathe faster and have less developed immune systems. Wales introduced a similar ban last year and the law is in addition to the prohibition of smoking in workplaces and enclosed public places, which was enforced in England in July 2007. The ban also exists in a number of jurisdictions in Canada, the United States and Australia, while other countries are considering the move. South Africa and Bahrain do not allow smoking in cars with children present and Mauritius has banned smoking in all cars carrying any passenger. The British Heart Foundation welcomes the regulation as well as future plans to discourage young smokers. ""Parliament will shortly vote on introducing standardised packaging -- a key measure in helping to stop children from smoking,"" said Chief Executive Simon Gillespie. ""By ridding cigarette products of their distinctive designs we'll reduce the appeal of this uniquely lethal product damaging the heart health of future generations."" Mixed views are being expressed on Twitter.","England has banned smoking in cars where children are present .

"(CNN)The cries from family members and shocked Muslims are clear: Call it what it is, a hate crime. They say Craig Stephen Hicks hated religion and that he was riled at the sight of his Muslim neighbors: two of them young women who wore hijabs. The deaths of Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; Yusor Mohammad, 21; and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, had the hallmark of a summary execution: shots fired to the victims' heads. But police in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said the Tuesday evening shooting appeared to be fueled by rage over a parking space. Hicks' wife said it was a dispute between neighbors. The FBI has opened a preliminary inquiry into the killings to look into whether the slayings violated federal hate crime laws or other federal laws, a U.S. law enforcement official said Wednesday. But the official also said so far investigators haven't found any indications of a hate crime, and evidence suggests the slayings resulted from a confrontation over a parking dispute. Some allege there's a double standard at play here. They say that if the situation was reversed, law enforcement and the media wouldn't hesitate to call it a hate crime or a terrorist act. It's a hate crime when violence is tinted with discrimination. The FBI defines it as ""a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias."" That bias can go, among other things, against race, gender, sexual orientation or disability. ""To qualify as a hate crime, all that matters is that the crime was motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias,"" CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. It also applies in cases of mistaken identity -- for example, it someone attacks a person because he thinks they're gay, but they're not. After the 911 attacks, some Sikh men, who typically wear turbans, were mistaken for Muslims and attacked. In the justice system, the old adage that words can never hurt you is dead wrong. Labeling something a ""hate crime"" can make the law come down much harder on a defendant. It adds a new serious charge that can come with a heavy additional sentence. In 2013, a Mississippi judge sentenced Deryl Dedmon -- a white man who killed James Craig Anderson, an African-American, in a clearly racist attack -- to two concurrent life terms. He and friends had expressly set out for a night of targeted hassling of black people, screaming racial insults and yelling, ""White power."" Though it's the states that try hate crimes as a rule, federal authorities can push forward their investigation and prosecution. Take Dedmon's example. He caught the wrath of the federal government as well. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to 50 years in a federal prison. ""The defendants targeted African-American people they perceived as vulnerable for heinous and violent assaults -- hate crimes, motivated solely by race, that shook an entire community and claimed the life of an innocent man,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Finally, even if a defendant is acquitted on a state level, the Justice Department can prosecute a case as a ""hate crime."" Case in point: In 2011, a federal court convicted two Pennsylvania men of a hate crime after the state acquitted them of murder. Derrick Donchak and Brondon Piekarsky had repeatedly kicked a Mexican man in the head while hurling racist slurs at him. The man died. That, too, has legal ramifications, and is not applied lightly. The feds have a very specific definition of when something is an act of domestic terrorism. It has to have three characteristics: an act that takes place in the United States, that's dangerous to human life, and is intended to intimidate civilians or affect government policy by ""mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping."" Probably the best example is the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. To the victims at the Texas base, it was an act of terror, when Maj. Nidal Hassan opened fire on his fellow service members. But federal authorities never used the terrorism label. It met some of the criteria, but it was a legal move. Avoiding the label made it easier for them to pursue the death penalty. There's not much concrete evidence of bias, police in North Carolina say. They're searching Hicks' computer and so far have not come up with anything that points in that direction, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Hicks' wife, who is in the midst of divorce proceedings, told journalists she's convinced religion had nothing to do with it. Her divorce lawyer, Rob Maitland, said the shooting ""highlights the importance of access to mental health care services."" He declined to provide any details about the suspect's mental health history, but said, ""obviously it's not within the range of normal behavior for someone to shoot three people over parking issues."" On what is believed to be his Facebook page, Hicks is quite vocal about his atheism. Those alleging it's a hate crime are passing around a post attributed to him: . ""When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the post. By itself, it's thin, said CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara. It's ""one piece of evidence that suggests that he had a hatred or dislike for the Muslim community -- potentially. If that was the only piece of evidence, I don't think it's enough, quite honestly,"" he said. Contrast this case with the Kansas City shooting last year in which Frazier Glenn Cross is accused of opening fire at two Kansas Jewish centers. The three people he killed were Christian. Organizations that track hate groups described Cross, who is also known as Frazier Glenn Miller, as a long-time white supremacist. Another indication of his mindset were the words he shouted from the back of the patrol car after his arrest: ""Heil Hitler."" Soon afterward, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said  investigators had ""unquestionably determined ... that this was a hate crime."" Mohammad Abu-Salha, who lost both of his daughters in the slaying, is sure the women's hijabs had something to do with it. When his son-in-law lived alone in the condominium complex, the family never had any problems. But once his daughter moved in, wearing a head scarf that clearly identified her as Muslim, trouble started, Abu-Salha said. ""Daddy, I think he hates us for who we are,"" Abu-Salha said his daughter Yusor Mohammad told him. It has been two days since the attacks, and the investigation is far from complete. As details about the case are still emerging, a lot of questions persist. The FBI is assisting police. And Chapel Hill authorities aren't ruling out any options. ""We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,"" Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue said. But in the end, does a motive really matter? Barry Saunders, writing in the News and Observer, put it best. ""If the deaths resulted from a hate crime, it is an international tragedy. ""If the deaths came simply because a man was consumed with a general hate for all humanity -- heck, then it's still an international tragedy. Because people all over the world have now been deprived of the services Deah, Yusor and Razan would have rendered unto them."" Opinion: 3 slain college students strived for a better world . CNN's Evan Perez and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Official: An FBI inquiry is looking into whether federal hate crime laws were violated .

"(CNN)St. Valentine's Day is upon us, Pope Francis recently placed more people on the path to sainthood, and I got married a few months ago. That conjunction of events has sparked a question: I wonder if my wife and I could ever be named saints, as a couple? I'm not being egotistical: I am far from saintly (my wife, Angelika, is closer). But, in any case, the church instructs Catholics to aspire to sainthood. Unfortunately, the odds for us married folk seem terrible. Of more than 10,000 formally recognized saints, only about 500 have been married, even though many billions of married people have roamed the Earth over the centuries. And things look really bleak for couples hoping to clear the sanctity hurdle together. Mary and Joseph, the parents of Jesus, attained sanctity as a couple; so did Mary's parents, John the Baptist's parents, and a handful of other couples. But what about more accessible role models than the Biblical era titans? Let's see. Saints Isidore and Maria, a simple Spanish farmer and his wife, have made the cut, recognized for their piety, charity, devotion to each other, and hard work on behalf of their community. Bravo for them and for the church, because they embody Catholicism's fundamental claim: Every person is equally dignified, and sanctity has nothing to do with connections, eye-catching exploits, or prominent church office. Rather, each life presents equal opportunities for exemplary holiness. Still, I confess some queasiness about them as role models of conjugal love. According to some accounts, Isidore and Maria eventually began living in separate houses in order to abstain from sexual relations. And, Isidore's wife is sometimes known as Santa Maria de la Cabeza, St. Mary of the Head, because her well-preserved head is revered as a relic. Though enamored of traditional Catholic devotions and desirous of sanctity, I would prefer to spare my beloved Angelika the dubious posthumous honor of having her head set aside as a relic. Besides, they lived in the 12th century. Are there more recent role model couples, both canonized saints, to inspire Angelika and me on our married journey? I could find none. I consulted John Fink, author of ""Married Saints,"" and Bert Ghezzi, author of ""Voices of the Saints,"" and they weren't aware of any either. Really? My church has been unable to find any couples from the last nine centuries who have together, ""practiced heroic virtue and lived in fidelity to God's grace,"" as our Catechism defines sanctity? Heck, my parents would seem to fit that definition, and a few of their contemporaries also leap to mind. In fact, if an exemplary life of heroic virtue is the criterion, married couple saints must surely abound. How many impoverished couples over the centuries, for starters, have remained deeply faithful to each other and to God, while sacrificing heroically to raise children and support neighbors in war zones, amid inner city chaos, despite religious persecution, or amid chronic famine. If that's not heroic virtue, what is? Some may nitpick my argument, uncover some sainted couple I overlooked, or call attention to two beatified couples now on the sainthood path -- thankfully! Or, they may note that Catholicism considers all those in heaven to be saints (regardless of whether they have been formally canonized), or point out that married couples were surely among martyrs the church remembers in groups like the 120 martyr saints of China, or the 124 Korean martyrs). But the Catholic Church, perhaps more than any other institution, knows the power of symbols. We worship beneath stained glass windows, amid candlelight and incense. And the practice of having recognized so incredibly few married couples by name is a terrible symbol that contradicts what we Catholics preach about married love. After all, Pope Benedict XVI called marriage, ""the icon of the relationship between God and his people."" Could we not find a few more real-life icons who incarnated Benedict's beautiful image? Pope Francis has thrilled me and the world by his ability to present Catholicism's truths and beauties in new ways. I would humbly ask the Holy Father to fix our skewed saint-making process by offering dozens more exemplars of fun, blissful, holy, married love. Under Pope Francis' enlightened leadership, we are trying to become ever more a church that is ""poor, and for the poor"": let's confront the fact that the saint-making process inordinately favors those with connections and resources. There are religious orders that staff a full-time position to support the canonization cause of one or more of their deceased; the New York Archdiocese recently shipped a 20,000-page dossier to Rome to support one religious sister's sainthood cause. Such investments of time and effort are unthinkable for most of us who fondly recall holy and loving parents, grandparents or ancestors. A change could not be timelier: Pope Francis has launched the Synod on the Family, a yearlong reflection on the joys and struggles of married couples and their loved ones. The Synod's interim report cautions against, ""proclaiming a merely theoretical message,"" and, as Pope Paul VI famously observed, ""Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers."" So, Pope Francis, with Valentine's Day upon us, please instruct the Vatican bureaucrats to elevate more witnesses, flesh-and-blood saintly icons of married love from centuries past! In the meanwhile, my wife Angelika and I are loving each other and our married life, and we welcome all saints and sinners, whatever their spiritual or religious tradition, to share their advice for a happy, holy marriage.","It's been nearly 9 centuries since the Catholic Church formally canonized a married couple .
The saint-making process inordinately favors those with connections and resources, Chris Lowney argues ."
"(CNN)Elizabeth Warren's populist supporters are finding inspiration from an unlikely source: Antonio Weiss. Weiss, the head of investment banking at Lazard and President Barack Obama's pick for a top spot at the Treasury Department, was forced to withdraw his nomination last month after facing an onslaught of public opposition led by Warren, the popular liberal Massachusetts senator. If this was a remarkable defeat for the Obama administration, it was a moment of glowing achievement for some of Warren's fiercest backers, including Wall Street reform advocates and progressive grassroots leaders who aggressively criticized Weiss's work at Lazard. Emboldened by their successful thwarting of his nomination and Warren's growing clout, liberal activists are energized about their role in Washington this year. Despite Democrats being relegated to minority status in the House and Senate, these groups still think they can make a big splash. They're preparing to publicly clash with the administration on future presidential nominees and big-ticket items such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. They're also looking to pressure Obama to take a tougher stance on expansion of overtime pay and developing stricter rules for brokers on Wall Street. By simultaneously mobilizing supporters from the ground up and seizing on Warren's rise in national politics, the Massachusetts senator's backers are determined to make Weiss just the first of many casualties. ""This was a really important part of us building momentum against the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party and really supporting the Warren wing,"" said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America. ""What was exciting about Antonio Weiss is we took our first victim."" The monthslong crusade against Weiss captured how progressive activists are using Warren's star power to elevate their core issues. Warren is the subject of persistent rumors that she'll run for president in 2016. She insists she's not running for higher office, but her stature among progressives is immense. After Obama nominated Weiss, 48, to be Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance in November, groups such as MoveOn, Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee quickly mobilized. They blasted out emails to supporters, launched online petitions and took to social media to oppose Weiss's nomination. Their single most important tool for mobilizing mass support? Warren. Progressive groups didn't just call on supporters to oppose Weiss; instead, they insisted that protesting his nomination was a way of showing solidarity with Warren. ""Stand with Elizabeth Warren and say no to a Wall Street banker for Treasury undersecretary,"" read a MoveOn petition against Weiss's nomination, which garnered more than 30,000 signatures. Democracy for America urged its members to call the White House and say no to the Weiss nomination -- not just because Weiss was too friendly with Wall Street, but because blocking his nomination was an important mission for Warren. ""Sen. Warren is leading the charge against the nomination of Antonio Weiss,"" the group said. ""She needs your help to stop him."" It wasn't a complete victory -- when he eventually withdrew his nomination last month, Weiss was offered the role of adviser to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. But for Warren's supporters, sinking Weiss's nomination was validation of the progressive movement's sway in Washington. It was also proof of how much Warren's popularity with voters can help maximize the progressive wing's influence. A Warren spokesperson declined to comment for this story. With the 2016 presidential election looming, liberal activists are eager to piggyback on the continuing buzz about a Warren White House bid and make the senator a mascot for some of their top policy and legislative priorities. For starters, they are prepared to sound the alarm if another presidential nominee doesn't meet their approval. The Federal Reserve's Board of Governors has one vacancy in need of a nomination, and it's unclear when the administration plans to nominate someone new for the undersecretary for domestic finance role. If the administration were to handpick another nominee perceived as being too close to Wall Street, financial reform groups can expect to have a powerful ally on their side: community banks. Cam Fine, the CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America who opposed Weiss's nomination, said his group's view is simple: ""We don't want all the nominees to be straight out of Wall Street."" ""We're looking for nominees that have experience with midsized and smaller institutions,"" Fine said. ""The litmus test is: How well rounded are those nominees?"" Progressive groups are also taking issue with one of the President's top priorities for his final years in office: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge trade agreement proposal between the United States and 11 countries. Groups such as MoveOn have opposed these talks, taking issue with what they say are ""secret"" negotiations and the unfair advantages that large corporations would reap from the pact. Warren agrees. ""To protect consumers and to address sources of systemic financial risk, Congress must maintain the flexibility to impose restrictions on harmful financial products and on the conduct or structure of financial firms. We would oppose including provisions in the TPP that would limit that flexibility,"" the senator wrote  in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in December. Liberal activists also have their sights set on unilateral actions the Obama administration could take and bypass the GOP-controlled Congress, such as expanding overtime pay and creating stricter oversight of Wall Street brokers. On both of these issues, they also have the support of their favorite Democratic senator. ""Our members love her,"" said Anna Galland, executive director of civic action at MoveOn.org.","The progressive wing of the Democratic Party feels like Sen. Warren has muscle to flex .
Being able to thwart President Obama's Treasury nominee has emboldened them .
Progressives take issue with one of Obama's high priorities: the Trans-Pacific Partnership ."
"(CNN)The U.S. Air Force is sending its ""tankbusters"" back to Europe. The service's European Command said this week that 12 A-10 Thunderbolts would be deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which was formed after Russia's intervention in Ukraine over the past year. ""The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority,"" Lt. Gen. Tom Jones, vice commander, United States Air Forces in Europe -- Air Forces Africa, said in a statement. The Air Force said besides operating in Germany, the A-10s will be forward deployed to other partner nations in Eastern Europe. U.S. forces have operated out of bases in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Poland, among others, in the past year. The A-10, also known as the ""Warthog,"" was designed in the 1970s to support ground troops in Europe against the tanks and armored vehicles of the then-Soviet Union. Though the jets can carry a variety of bombs and missiles, they are best known for their nose-mounted, seven-barrel 30 mm Gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute, enough to quickly blow apart a tank. The planes are also durable, with the pilot protected from ground fire by a wrapping of titanium often called ""the bathtub."" And they are designed for easy maintenance in battlefield areas, with interchangeable parts for the right and left sides of the aircraft. Those capabilities have been battle-proven in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Late last year, A-10s were deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in January that the A-10s had flown 11% of the Air Force's missions against ISIS despite coming into the conflict more than two months after initial U.S. involvement. Despite its current usefulness, the A-10 is on the Defense Department's chopping block, with the Air Force wanting to turn over the jet's ground support mission to its newest fighter, the F-35. Critics of the move say the A-10 can do better than the F-35 because it can get lower and slower, allowing pilots to get real eyes on targets. And they say it is way cheaper than the F-35, with a flight hour for the A-10 costing roughly half of what it costs to operate the F-35, according to numerous reports. The Air Force says it just doesn't have the money to support the A-10, which will be more than 40 years old at its planned retirement in 2019, and its newest, more advanced aircraft. ""It's not about not liking or not wanting the A-10. It's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an Air Force for the threat 10 years from now,"" Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said in January. The dozen A-10s, along with 300 personnel from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, are expected to be in Germany by the end of February, the Air Force said. The deployment is expected to last about six months. A-10s have not been deployed to Europe since May 2013, when 21 A-10s that were stationed at Spangdahlem were removed, according to a report from Stars and Stripes.","A-10s are going to Europe for the first time since May 2013 .
The planes were designed to combat Soviet armor during the Cold War .

"(CNN)Get ready, binge-watchers: There's a new candidate for your consideration. ""Bosch"" is set to debut Friday and will be Amazon's first foray into the world of original dramas. The streaming giant has found success with the transgender comedy ""Transparent,"" which won Golden Globes for best TV series, musical or comedy and best actor for star Jeffrey Tambor. But ""Bosch"" enters into the territory more familiar to competitor Netflix, which has several dramas, including the critically acclaimed ""House of Cards."" The Amazon series centers on Harry Bosch, the fictional LAPD homicide detective who is the hero of Michael Connelly's series of dark crime novels. The series is a bit of a gamble for Amazon and Connelly, but he calls the project a ""no-brainer."" He said officials at the online retailer first approached him, saying they liked the synergy of having both the TV series and the books on the site. Amazon sells thousands of books written by Connelly. His latest, ""The Burning Room,"" debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in November, so Amazon believes it's playing to a built-in audience. Connelly has waited more than 20 years to bring ""Bosch"" to the screen. After he sold the TV and movie rights to the character in the 1990s, the project languished for years in turnaround, Hollywood's version of purgatory. Connelly finally bought back the rights and started working on his own vision of ""Bosch."" Then Amazon came calling, offering Connelly the creative freedom he wanted, and a partnership was formed. ""I didn't need the money,"" the author said. ""I had this resolve that I'm either going to do it right or or I'm not going to do it all, because Harry Bosch is too precious to me."" Connelly said he oversaw every aspect of the series, hiring the creative team, helping write the scripts and even giving his say on the cast, which includes Titus Welliver, Jamie Hector, Amy Aquino and Lance Reddick. Connelly said he's ""extremely happy"" with the result, adding, ""If you like the books, you're going to love the show."" Connelly doled out special praise for Welliver, who fills the title role. A veteran character actor, Welliver has played supporting parts on hit shows such as ""The Good Wife"" and ""Sons of Anarchy."" Viewers might remember him best as ""The Man in Black"" from ""Lost."" Connelly said Welliver was the perfect actor to play the moody detective, bridging the gap between page and screen. ""Titus can portray internal conflict just through his eyes, his look or a moment,"" the author said. ""When you see a vein pulsing in his temple, you know this is a guy who can pick up that slack for you."" And he said he likes the idea of Harry Bosch ""joining the new wave"" of streaming series. Connelly -- an admitted insomniac -- rarely goes to the movie theater or watches prime-time TV but does stream shows when he can't sleep. Among his favorites are ""House of Cards"" on Netflix, ""Alpha Dogs"" and, yes, ""Transparent."" For now, Connelly is eagerly awaiting the series' premiere, working on his next novel and hoping Amazon green-lights a second season. Whether ""Bosch"" is a blockbuster or a bust, Connelly said, ""If the show is great or bad, it's going to be my doing, and I'm happy to make that gamble."" The 10 episodes of ""Bosch"" will be available for streaming on Amazon Prime on Friday.","Author Michael Connelly says the time is right for show about homicide detective .

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)The man accused of killing Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend told a detective after the shootings that he was worried about his own mental state. According to a police body camera video played in court Thursday, Eddie Ray Routh was sitting in Kyle's stolen truck when he told a detective: ""I don't know if I'm going insane."" Routh also spoke of voodoo, hell and the apocalypse in the video. The defense, which is mounting an insanity case, focused on those remarks. The prosecution asked Lt. Michael Smith of Lancaster, Texas, police whether he thought Routh was being metaphorical during their conversation. Smith said he could not tell. A medical examiner with the Southwest Institute of Forensic Sciences was the last witness on the second day of the double-murder trial. Dr. Jeffrey Barnard testified that two of the six bullets that hit Kyle would have been ""rapidly fatal."" A prosecutor asked Barnard several times whether the other victim, Chad Littlefield, had wounds consistent with someone lying on the ground or in a kneeling position, but the doctor couldn't say. The prosecution appeared to be attempting to establish that Littlefield and Kyle were defenseless when shot. Both men were shot multiple times at a Texas firing range in February 2013. Kyle and Littlefield were wearing loaded handguns in their waistbands when they were found, an investigator testified Thursday. Michael Adcock with the Texas Department of Public Safety said he also found shell casings, ammunition and several firearms on the ground when he arrived at the Rough Creek Lodge firing range outside Dallas. The guns on Kyle and Littlefield's bodies were loaded, but two ""old-style Western"" revolvers were lying on the ground with all the bullets fired, Adcock testified. The slain men had fired these pistols at targets, the prosecutor has said. The two men took Routh, a veteran with mental problems, to the firing range as a kind of therapy, lawyers have said. After the killings, Adcock said, Routh drove Kyle's pickup to a Taco Bell off Interstate 35 and purchased two bean burritos, leaving a restaurant receipt in the driver's side door of the truck. Another witness was Flavio Salazar of the police department in Lancaster. Salazar said during a 30-minute standoff between Routh and police, he crawled to the truck and put ""stop sticks"" in front of the rear tires. Stop sticks have metal spikes that puncture tires. Routh drove to I-35, stopped soon because of flat tires and was arrested, Salazar said. The trial began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle's own words to bolster an insanity defense. But Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash told the jury that Routh told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning. He admitted that he killed the two men and said he ""knew what he was doing was wrong,"" the prosecutor said. Routh used two guns, Nash said. Routh shot Kyle five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head, using a .45-caliber pistol, and shot Littlefield with a 9mm pistol four times in the back, once in the hand, once in the face and once in the head, Nash said. A different .45-caliber pistol with all its rounds fired was found on the ground near Kyle's head, Nash said. ""(Kyle) had shot all the bullets in his gun when he was shot in the back,"" said Nash, referring to the fact that Kyle had just fired at a target. The trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. The film, directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed more than $280 million, the most ever for a war movie, and the autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. Kyle had already risen to fame through his book when he died. He'd been doing charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated, authorities said. Frank Alvarez, resident manager of Rough Creek Lodge, testified Kyle had ""exclusive access to the range when he came out."" Kyle had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes, Alvarez testified, but ""about 5 p.m. I got a radio call that said I had to go to the shooting range. Something had happened."" A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived.  Routh, an unemployed former Marine reportedly diagnosed with PTSD, was gone, and so was Kyle's black Ford pickup truck, police said. Routh drove up in Kyle's truck at his sister's house 65 miles away, police said. She called 911, telling the operator he claimed to have killed two men. ""They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy,"" Routh's sister told authorities. Routh got back into the truck and hit the road again, police said. Officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a Dallas suburb. While talking with police, he jumped back into the truck and sped off again, police say. They gave chase and stopped him after spiking his tires. He did not struggle when they arrested him, police said. Relatives of Routh, 27, and those close to him declined interview requests from CNN. Since July 24, 2013, when a judge filed a gag order in the case, nobody associated with Routh's trial has been permitted to speak to the media. Before that order was issued, a reporter asked Capt. Jason Upshaw of the Erath County Sheriff's Office what could have driven Routh to the alleged murders. ""I don't know that we'll ever know,"" Upshaw said. Routh served in the Marines from June 2006 to June 2010. His time in the military included a 2007 tour of duty in Iraq and a humanitarian mission to help the victims of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Jason Morris and Chris Lett reported from Stephenville, Texas, and Steve Almasy, Ralph Ellis and Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Federal prosecutors are bringing charges in one of the fires in riots that destroyed businesses after the Michael Brown grand jury decision. A federal grand jury indicted Antonio Whiteside, 26, charging him with the arson of the Ferguson Market, the spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in St. Louis said. The market was the scene of a reported strong-armed robbery by Michael Brown shortly before his fatal confrontation with police officer Darren Wilson. Police from St. Louis County, Ferguson and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives circulated surveillance camera pictures of a suspect wearing a camouflage jacket in connection with the fire. Whiteside is that suspect, prosecutors allege, according to a U.S. law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Investigators said he was seen using an accelerant to set fire to the market, the official said. He was arrested in January and the indictment was brought on Wednesday. The Ferguson Market survived disturbances in August after the Brown shooting, but burned after the grand jury decision was announced in November. It continues to operate.

"(CNN)In his CNN opinion piece, ""The Big Dangers of Big Data"" , Konstantin Kakaes of New America raises some  interesting points about the ways that designing certain types of Big Data projects could lead to bad societal results. Unfortunately, Mr. Kakaes' column appears to be part of a larger narrative that is skewing the perception of the importance of advanced data analytics to economies, societies and families around the world. Big Data is not merely the accumulation of vast amounts of information, but a collection of interconnected and interrelated data points that, when analyzed carefully, helps business leaders make decisions that lead to increased profitability and job creation, assists doctors and scientists in understanding critical factors about health care, helps policymakers better protect the public from potential terror attacks, and much more. To be clear, advanced analytics techniques go beyond merely describing the data that is available. If you want to make better decisions you decide what important data you need to know, collect it in ways that operations researchers can analyze, and think: What assumptions must I make before I proceed? Mr. Kakaes' examples summon up the long discredited time-and-motion studies of Frederick Law Taylor, whose observations of people at work led to horrid visions of people forced to act like machines feeding an assembly line. Modern analytics are far different. For example, every year, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) holds an international analytics conference that includes a competition for best work in analytics, Big Data, and the applied mathematical field of operations research. If you want to examine an outstanding example of the way that Big Data saves lives, look at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which won the 2014 competition for their quest to eradicate polio. In 2001, with massive amounts of data about polio cases around the world, the CDC (working with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and consultants at Kid Risk, Inc.) faced an important choice: Direct $100 million in funding dollars and settle for controlling the outbreak of polio, or attempt to completely stop all new cases of polio? By developing sophisticated mathematical models that leveraged the best available scientific evidence and field knowledge, CDC officials became confident that it would be possible to prevent any further cases of wild polio viruses from emerging. By coincidence, the CDC accepted its award in 2014 shortly after India celebrated three years in which its population of 1.27 billion people had not experienced a single instance of polio. As we contemplate the never-ending threats of terrorism, policymakers in the United States and around the world wrestle with constant questions about the optimal resources needed to prevent attacks and keep people safe. Yale School of Management Professor Edward H. Kaplan (and INFORMS president-elect) explained in a recent blog post on the website of Oxford University Press how to examine data using the same staffing models used for telephone call centers. He then combined this sophisticated math modeling technique of queueing theory with a study he conducted of all jihadi terror plots detected in the United States over a 10-year period, resulting in a determination that an optimal staff level of only 2,080 counterterrorism agents are needed in the United States. (The last publicly available FBI staffing figure available in 2004 showed that 2,398 agents were dedicated to counterterrorism at that time). Professor Kaplan's recently published policy recommendations show that using advanced analytical methods is a compelling and objective way to make major public policy decisions about staffing homeland security and, by extension, the many other departments and programs that can benefit from strongly grounded decision making given limited taxpayer dollars and the goal of effective government. These are but two of the countless examples of how advanced analytics and operations research can appropriately leverage Big Data to achieve tangible results and benefits. As with any field of study or any profession, poor methodologies and wrong assumptions can skew outcomes and perceptions. That's why it is important to continue to educate leaders in business, government and even the media about the benefits of utilizing well-designed analytics projects and the importance of promoting well-educated and trained operations research and analytics professionals in business, government and academia.","A CNN Opinion piece discussed the misuse of Big Data .

"(CNN)Taiwanese airline TransAsia has grounded 10 pilots for failing an oral flight test, as divers continue searching for the final victim of the crash of Flight GE235 which killed at least 42 people earlier this month. The failed pilots will undergo retraining before being allowed to fly again, the airline said, adding that each had an average of 6,900 flying hours, not a insignificant number for a commercial pilot. The 39 pilots who passed the oral test will have to sit a simulator test -- if they don't pass, they too will be grounded, TransAsia said. Nineteen other pilots have yet to take any of the tests, but they won't be assigned any duties until they do so. The testing was recommended by Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration for pilots at the controls of ATR turboprop aircraft, the type involved in the February 4 crash. Meanwhile, rescue workers continue to search the muddy depths of the Keelung River in Taipei, where the flight went down, for the last unaccounted passenger. Two bodies were found around 600 meters downriver from the crash site on Tuesday, taking the final death toll to 42. Officials said the bodies found were still strapped in their seats. Fifty-one search boats, three helicopters, and more than 450 people are working to find the remaining passenger, according to a statement from the Taipei City mayor's office. Excavators are being used to dig the river bed amid theories that the final victim may be stuck in mud. TransAsia Flight GE235 crashed minutes after takeoff in the Taiwanese capital after the pilots struggled to correct problems with both engines, according to preliminary investigations by Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council. The agency said the aircraft's engines stopped producing power, one after the other, leaving the plane flying without thrust for more than one minute. Dashcam video taken by cars on a nearby highway showed the plane turning sharply left, before the wing hit the overpass and crashed into the river. Fifteen people survived the crash after being pulled from the submerged wreck. After the crash, Taiwan's aviation authorities ordered special checks on all ATR 72s in the fleets of local carriers. TransAsia was involved in another deadly disaster last July. Forty-eight people died after an ATR 72 aircraft crashed as it was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands during bad weather. Journalist Annie Liao in Taiwan contributed to this report.","10 TransAsia pilots grounded after failing flight test .

"London (CNN)You could call it the other ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" effect. Firefighters in London are concerned that there could be a ""spike"" in emergency calls from people stuck in handcuffs and other sex toys after watching the new ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" film, released worldwide this week. It would seem that E L James' bestselling erotic novels have inspired more people to experiment sexually with sometimes embarrassing -- and painful -- results. London Fire Brigade says that incidents where sexual adventurers get trapped in cuffs and rings have been steadily increasing year-on-year since the first ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" book was released in 2011. The ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy, which has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into 50 languages, tells the story of the S&M-flavored relationship between a virginal college graduate and a billionaire CEO. The books have also been credited with boosting sales of sex toys, driving women to hook-up sites and fueling a craze over sexual domination. Now, firefighters in London are asking the public to exercise caution if they feel like spicing up their sex lives after watching the movie. ""We hope film-goers will use common sense and avoid leaving themselves red faced,"" said Third Officer, Dave Brown. 'Fifty Shades of Grey': What the critics say . The service said that crews have been called out to 393 incidents they believe are related to sex since April 2014, including 28 incidents involving people trapped in handcuffs. In November 2014, firefighters had to come to the rescue of a man who had a pair of metal rings stuck on his manhood for three days. ER doctors were unable to remove the steel rings so two firefighters had to snip them off using hand-held hydraulic cutters. On another occasion, a crew was called by a woman whose husband had become locked in a chastity belt. In the past, reports the brigade, crews have also been called out to incidents involving toasters and vacuum cleaners. But it's not just embarrassing, it's expensive. The brigade reports that each incident costs British taxpayers at least $452 (£295) and estimates incidents have cost a total of nearly $615,000 (£400,000). To avoid awkward incidents, London Fire Brigade advises people that if they are going to use handcuffs, keep the keys handy.

"(CNN)The widow of Paris kosher supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly has linked up with ISIS, the terror group claims. The second issue of an ISIS French language magazine, which began circulating on pro-ISIS Twitter accounts Wednesday, contains a purported two-page question-and-answer story with Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to have disappeared into Syria before the January 9 attack. The magazine, entitled Dar al Islam, claimed Boumeddiene safely reached the Islamic State, but offered no pictures or any other proof to corroborate the claim. French terrorism expert Jean-Charles Brisard told CNN the magazine appears to be an official ISIS publication and is a sign that Boumeddiene has reached ISIS. In the article, she was asked how Coulibaly felt about ISIS's announcement it had established a caliphate, or Islamic state, in territory spanning Syria and Iraq. He wanted to go to Syria or Iraq to fight, she reportedly answered. Boumeddiene, 26, claimed in the purported interview that she encountered no difficulties reaching ISIS territory and she felt good to be on ISIS soil. She did not provide any details on her role in the Paris attacks. She also gave a lengthy response to what advice she would have for Muslim women. Search for woman linked to Paris hostage-taker goes global . The new issue of Dar al Islam magazine was entitled ""May Allah Curse France"" and featured on its cover a picture of the Eiffel Tower being guarded by French soldiers. It also included several pictures showing the aftermath of the Paris attacks, praised Coulibaly and called for more attacks against those ""insulting the Prophet."" It claimed an associate of Coulibaly who had reached Syria had provided them a report of his positive qualities. The first issue of Dar al Islam magazine was published on December 23 and was posted on ISIS's official Twitter account, according to Memri, an organization tracking jihadist websites. Boumeddiene is believed to have crossed into Syria from Turkey around the time Coulibaly started his terrorism spree in Paris. Coulibaly pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video he emailed out before the kosher grocery store attack in which four people were killed. The recording was posted on pro-ISIS Twitter accounts. In January, CNN obtained surveillance video that purportedly shows Coulibaly and Boumeddiene outside a Jewish institution in Paris. A source familiar with the investigation into the Paris attacks said there was a high degree of confidence that the video shows Coulibaly and Boumeddiene. The video was recorded at the end of August or beginning of September and stored on a security camera. The source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before Coulibaly, who is also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier, launched his attack against the kosher supermarket. Coulibaly was shot to death when police stormed the market. The video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location, says the source.","Hayat Boumeddiene was married to the gunman who killed four people in a Paris market .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The captain of the first South Korean coast guard ship sent to rescue passengers from the doomed Sewol ferry has been sentenced to four years in prison for negligence. Kim Kyung-il was sentenced in the Gwangju District Court for professional negligence and making false reports, court officials said. More than 300 people died after the ferry capsized off the southwestern coast of South Korea in April, the majority of them high school students on a field trip. On arriving at the scene, Kim failed to broadcast an evacuation order through his ship's loudspeakers and made no effort to induce passengers to abandon ship, which constituted professional negligence, a court spokesman said. He was also found guilty of making a false report by saying that he had broadcast an evacuation order when he had not. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in the country over lax safety standards and the botched rescue attempt, prompting President Park Geun-Hye to promise an overhaul of national safety standards. The ferry's captain, Lee Joon-seok, was slammed by victims' families for leaping to safety while hundreds remained inside the sinking ferry. He was acquitted of murder in November, but found guilty of violating ""seamen's law"" and abandonment causing death and injury. He was sentenced to 36 years in jail.

"(CNN)It's the albatross which has hung around the neck of world football for the past five years -- so what next for Qatar and the 2022 World Cup? The question about when the tournament will be held was revealed in Doha Tuesday with a November/December timetable proposed. Having been cleared of any wrongdoing by Michael Garcia's investigation into alleged corruption into the bidding process surrounding the 2022 tournament, Qatar and world governing body FIFA must now negotiate the minefield of placating a host of parties by playing a World Cup outside of the traditional June/July schedule. When Qatar won the bid in 2010, its opponents thought they were all bidding for the same tournament -- but it turns out that's not quite true. The intense heat in the Gulf state during June/July is considered potentially too dangerous for the players to play in, meaning this World Cup will take place in the Qatari winter -- and hugely inconvenience the world's biggest domestic leagues. ""The prospect of a winter World Cup is neither workable nor desirable for European domestic football,"" an English Premier League (EPL) spokesman told CNN ahead of the announcement. So what's happening this week? A FIFA task force, that's a committee to the rest of us, has had plenty to consider in making its recommendation over the World Cup's date. A tournament held at the starf of 2022 would represent huge problems for broadcasters, with the U.S. sporting schedule already packed in January with the NFL playoffs, while the 2022 Winter Olympics are set to take place the following month. Sepp Blatter, the FIFA president, has already said that he wanted the tournament to take place in the final two months of the year, but the European Clubs Association, which lobbies on behalf of the continent's biggest teams, is opposed to such a plan. It had wanted the competition held in April/May,arguing those dates would mean less disruption to domestic seasons. FifPro, the players' union, is keen on a winter World Cup on health and safety grounds but still expresses reservations surrounding a number of human rights issues associated with staging the tournament in Qatar. But wasn't the bidding process supposed to be for a summer World Cup? Well, that's what everyone else thought -- but it seems like the goalposts have been moved. Australia, one of the countries to lose out to Qatar, was outspoken in its criticism of the tournament being switched to winter and even threatened legal action. Originally, Qatar said it would use air conditioning to cool the stadiums but concerns still remain. Harold Mayne-Nicholls led the FIFA inspection team which examined each of the bidding countries for the 2022 World Cup before delivering his report in October 2010. Mayne-Nicholls concluded that Qatar was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. And wasn't Qatar was under investigation? Not anymore -- in fact, Qatar was cleared of any wrongdoing by Garcia, the man who led FIFA's investigation into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The Gulf state, and Russia which will host the 2018 tournament, were both found not guilty and hence allowed to keep hold of the tournaments. While the full report has not been published, and Garcia has since quit his role as ethics investigator after a falling out with Hans-Joachim Eckert, FIFA's chief ethics judge, there appears little chance of the investigation being re-opened. Garcia's report failed to uncover a 'smoking gun' despite allegations of wrongdoing being published by British Newspaper, The Sunday Times. As far as FIFA is concerned, that's that. Time to move on. But what about the plight of the migrant workers? According to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), 1,000 workers have already died in Qatar with the figure expected to rise to 4,000 by the time the tournament kicks off. The so called Kafala system -- which ties employees to a specific employer -- has, according to Human Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation, been open to systematic abuse and created a de facto form of slavery for the more than one million migrant workers living within its borders . A report commissioned by the Qatari government and compiled by law firm DLA Piper called for the Kafala system to be abolished, harsher penalties for employers who withhold passports from employees and a review into why so many workers were suffering cardiac arrests. According to the report and confirmed by the government, 964 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013. The Qatari government says there are over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country. In a statement released in November 2014, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months. ""A new sponsorship law, currently under review, that will replace the outdated 'Kafala' system will be announced by next year,"" said the statement. ""We are also working on laws to cover domestic workers. ""As in every country in the world, change does not happen overnight. Significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar. ""Our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year."" What will the decision be? Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, who is head of the Asian Football Confederation and also leads the task force, had stated his belief the 2022 World Cup would take place in November/December. Speaking to reporters at the Asian Cup last month, Salman said: ""The period best suited for hosting the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be in November and December because for sure it needs to be played in the winter."" The decision by the task force is, in essence at least, a mere proposal, though it is unlikely to be overturned when the FIFA executive committee meets on March 19 and 20. It is there that the committee will ratify the proposal, although in theory, it could also reject it but that's not expected to happen. What happens with broadcast deals if the tournament gets moved? U.S. broadcaster Fox signed a $425 million deal to show the 2018 and 2022 back in 2011. ""You go into buying a World Cup and you believe it's going to be in the same time frame it's always been,"" Fox Sports President Eric Shanks said last year. ""Clearly in America there's much more competition for ratings points."" Shanks has a point. A winter World Cup would be a catastrophe for Fox with the tournament set to clash with the NFL playoffs. Except earlier this month Fox secured the rights for the 2026 World Cup without a bidding war -- a tournament which is likely to be held in North America. It remains to be seen how much of a fuss other broadcasters will make if the tournament is moved to November/December. What will happen to club competitions? There are still seven years to go until the World Cup in Qatar so domestic leagues will have time to make plans to avoid as much disruption to their season as possible, but a switch to November and December is likely to provide a major headache for top-flight leagues and clubs. Notably for the EPL, which doesn't have a winter break -- unlike most other European leagues. That potentially presents issues for its English teams as to how best to prevent their players from suffering burnout. Likewise European governing body UEFA, which runs the Champions League and Europa League, will also have to work out how its prestigious competitions, fit around a winter World Cup. At the moment it's a case of ""wait and see"" but this one looks set to run and run.","The 2022 World Cup is set to be held in November/December in Qatar .

"(CNN)Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating. In fact, the Chinese are so committed to the day they celebrate it twice. There's qixi, China's equivalent to Valentine's Day, which takes place in August, as well as the global version coming up on Saturday. Both are embraced with gusto by couples across the country. In the spirit of the season, we've put together a tongue-in-cheek guide to getting a date in China that also aims to shed a little light on the pursuit of love in the Middle Kingdom. 1) Head to a park. They're a real-life Tinder . Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children. They bedeck the park's trees with their offspring's college photos and sheets of paper listing their key dating characteristics. Why not visit your local stretch of green this Saturday then? It's the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone -- meet your future love and your future in-laws. 2) If you're from Beijing, work it . Remember that 1990s film ""Green Card"" starring Andie MacDowell and Gerard Depardieu? It did raise one key dating point -- passports and permits matter. Nowhere else is this more so than in China, where one of the top assets people look for in a lover (after the oft-cited house and car) is whether they have a permit to the city they wish to live in. The hukou, as it is known, is tied to a host of social benefits. With it, your life is easy. Without it, not so much. If you happen to have a hukou that allows you to live in one of China's premier cities, be sure to let lots of singles around you know. 3) Parents are a useful resource. They might even join on a date . The family remains the cornerstone of Chinese life -- and love. Therefore, it stands to reason that parents/siblings/aunts/uncles/pets are very involved in everyone's dating destiny. When not found in a park trying to ""pimp"" people out, they will be gossiping with neighbors, friends and co-workers about said person's single status and how to change it. You can fight this centuries-old tradition or you can embrace it. The major catch? They might join you on a date. It's not uncommon for relatives to chaperone their children on romantic soirees in China. 4) If you're a single female, head to the countryside! You've probably heard that China has more men than women (118 boys to 100 girls, to be precise). Then there's the common cliché that Chinese women ""marry up"" and Chinese men ""marry down."" The result is that supposedly ""second-rate"" men are being left out of the dating world altogether. These guang gun (bare branches), as they have kindly been named, typically reside in the countryside. Alpha males, by contrast, make their way to the city. The silver lining (if you're female, that is)? There are now entire villages full of Romeos waiting for their Juliets. 5) If you're a single man, head to the cities! Following on from the above point, China's alpha females reputedly struggle in love. If they're single and over 27, they're derided as sheng nu -- leftover.  If they have a PhD, they're not even regarded as a true woman. Instead, they go by the putdown ""third gender."" If you see through these labels and the propaganda surrounding them, you'll appreciate that China's cities are full of some of the most savvy, intelligent and interesting women on the planet. 6) Go online! By the end of 2014, 649 million Chinese were registered as online.  Plenty see the Internet as love-line number one. China now has the largest number of online daters. The nation's singles can peruse a buffet of sites, from those that promise to find you the one, to others that are more wired towards one-nighters (although the trend is much more towards the former than the latter). 7) Rent a boyfriend/girlfriend! Yep, you can do that online too . The pressure to wed has become so extreme in China that an entire industry has sprung up around faux dating. Take a tour of Taobao, China's most popular online marketplace, and vying for your attention against countless cyber flower stalls and jewelry brands that emerge for Valentine's Day are the stores that offer something more unusual -- fake partners. For a price, your fake boyfriend/girlfriend will accompany you back to your parents, to the cinema, to dinner, anywhere you want really. They'll play the part in every way except going all the way. 8) If you still feel unsure, call up a love guru . Do not despair -- there are now love gurus in China, who, taking their cue from American TV show ""The Game,"" will offer men advice on how to successfully chat up women. Walk slightly in front and to the side of the person you wish to court -- that's just one tip taught in these classes. Other jewels include dressing better and spending less on the object of your affection (yes, you read that correctly).","Chinese are so committed to Valentine's Day, they celebrate it twice.
Parks and parents play a big role in the Chinese dating scene.
Single men should head to the cities, women to the countryside."
"Berlin (CNN)Fans and film critics battled to be the dominant voice at the international premiere of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" in Berlin Wednesday night -- and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day. The scene was apparently different at the two press screenings earlier in the day, after which many critics were eager to pour out their abhorrence -- not at the movie's sado-masochistic sex scenes but to the causes of greater offense in the critical mind  -- script, plot and performance. Some traumatized refugees of these screenings stood alongside me at the red carpet outside Berlin's swanky Zoo Palast cinema, awaiting the arrival of the stars for the film's international premiere. Their sense of outrage had not been cooled by the chilly evening air. ""It was Fifty Shades of sh*t!"" exclaimed one appalled journalist. But on the other side of the carpet a different story was playing out. Several hundred fans huddled together for warmth, spurred on by a shared devotion to the books of E.L. James and the anticipation of catching an eyeful of Jamie Dornan, the handsome actor who plays her bondage-loving billionaire, Christian Grey. They had come from Germany, of course, but as far afield as the United States. A man from Uruguay was in attendance with his wife and daughter. Had he read the book? ""I read some of it,"" he told me rather sheepishly, ""but then I gave it back to my wife. She loves it and my daughter does too."" Male opinion was relatively hard to find among a crowd in which women outnumbered men by about 20-1. Some fans had come along as couples, revealing different approaches to ""Fifty Shades."" ""I'm Fifty Shades of sex,"" offered a young German man, to which his girlfriend countered: ""And I am Fifty Shades of romance."" Meanwhile, a few hundred miles away in the UK, London firefighters are anticipating an increase in call-outs when the film hits general release in a few days. London Fire Brigade says it is ""concerned"" that the event could lead to a ""spike"" in people being trapped in handcuffs or genital rings. Pandemonium broke out when the stars arrived, as fans went into ecstasy at first sight of their heroes. The camera crews and reporters bawled out equally hysterically, not in delight but frustration as the enormous entourage of minders and PR managers accompanying the cast obscured all but a glimpse of them. Scuffles broke out between camera crews defending their inadequately-allocated space. I was wedged between a sharp piece of camera equipment from a rival broadcaster to my left and my CNN colleague to the right -- and it was he who inadvertently provided the most jarring moment of the evening, catching me full in the face with the back of his camera as he gamely fought to hold the line against a brute on a stepladder. Not journalism's finest hour, perhaps. For Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who plays submissive Anastasia Steele to Dornan's dominant Grey, it's been a long road from the film's notorious bondage dungeon, the ""Red Room of Pain,"" to the red carpet. Having been virtually gagged from discussing the movie for almost a year since filming ended, both seemed relieved to be able to talk about the film. Dornan addressed the mayhem surrounding him. ""We knew how many people read the books and how many cared about the film and we were kinda ready for this in a way, I'm not shocked, I mean it's a little bit shocking but I was aware there'd be a lot of heat, so this is kinda mad."" The ""Fifty Shades"" books have sold over 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 50 languages -- the film's forthcoming Valentines Day release is this year's hot ticket. But it's not everyone's idea of pleasure. Voices have been raised in concern that the film could be seen as glamorizing domestic violence. That was denied by the film-makers on the carpet. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson told me: ""I think they haven't seen the movie because I feel like I empower this woman and I give her the final word and the message is very strong and the message is really 'No,' when someone crosses the line, so I'm really hoping that people won't feel that, of course, and that they'll see it very differently."" Her leading lady Dakota Johnson agreed. ""Everything that Anastasia does, it's completely her choice and consensual and no person is abused in the movie and I think it's kind of a closed-minded outlook (to say it glamorizes domestic violence)."" Author and director are reported to have indulged in a few verbal lashings on-set but their creative partnership could tie them together for several more years with unofficial reports of sequels in the works. Could Taylor-Johnson make those reports official? ""It's not official, no, but they are waiting to see how this does, so you can imagine it might do well enough for them to consider it."" At the box office, first signs indicate that it might indeed do well. Some online ticket sites have reported record advance sales for an R-rated movie, with a $60 million opening weekend predicted. It will likely fare less well with most critics. During the screening which followed the red carpet there were several muted expressions of derision but they were more than matched by applause. Unscheduled moments of laughter punctuated Grey's post-coital visits to the piano but there were also moments of well-crafted mirth, notably a scene in which Christian and Anastasia sit at opposite ends of a business meeting room table and discuss the contract intended to govern their relationship. A series of kinky clauses are discussed with admirably straight faces as Ana instructs Christian to strike out those concerning some more extreme sexual acts. It's one of several scenes which support Taylor-Johnson's claim to have empowered her heroine. Dakota Johnson's Anastasia may not hold the key to the cuffs but she does hold the key to the relationship and what she may or may not consent to. The sex scenes account for little more than ten minutes in a film approaching two hours and I'd be surprised if many considered them shocking. One scene involving the erotic deployment of an ice cube could have been cut straight out of ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" that other notorious S&M movie which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke, whose character would have kicked Christian Grey's butt. We do get to see the Grey butt in action, but no full-frontal nudity, a modesty which is not afforded to Dakota Johnson. Sure it has its cheesy moments and its flaws -- but it's not aimed at winning Best Picture. (""American Sniper"" on the other hand won a nomination despite its shockingly obvious fake baby scene). Just as the books have been derided for literary inadequacies there's plenty here to allow critics to take pot-shots. But if you're a fan of the books, chances are you may well love it. And when a movie becomes an ""event movie,"" drawing crowds in vast numbers for a fun night out, the cheers of ""Fifty Shades"" fans may effectively pop a gag into the mouth of the most po-faced critic.","Hyped movie ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" premiered Wednesday at Berlin Film Festival .

"(CNN)The manhunt for the suspected ringleader of a terror cell in Belgium has gone cold, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter, is believed to have been the head of the terror cell that was in a deadly shootout with police during a January 15 raid in the Belgian town of Verviers. The gunbattle, days after the terror attacks in Paris, triggered an international manhunt. Three suspected members of the terror cell have been arrested, but the others, including Abaaoud, remain at large. ISIS has published what it claims is an interview with Abaaoud and says that he escaped to Syria, the counterterrorism official told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. ISIS put out a photo of Abaaoud with two gunmen who were killed in last month's raid. Belgian officials are aware of the claims that the suspected ringleader fled to Syria, the official said, but they cannot confirm that is where he is. The official said it is believed that Abaaoud  was never in Belgium, but coordinated the terror cell from Greece. One line of inquiry being looked at is whether Abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with ISIS in Syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of Western intelligence services. In October, his family in Brussels received word he had been ""martyred,"" his sister told a Belgian newspaper. Belgian investigators believe Abaaoud, rather than dying on the front lines, traveled to Greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there.","Suspected ringleader of a terror cell is now in Syria, ISIS claims .

"(CNN)It's been five years since a 14-year-old Alabama girl with special needs said she was persuaded by a teacher's aide to act as bait to catch an accused sexual predator. The girl's life was changed forever, she said, when the accused predator, a fellow student, allegedly sodomized her in a school bathroom. ""I just felt like I was set up by the teachers. They gave me a word that they couldn't keep,"" said the woman, who asked CNN to call her ""Jaden."" In 2010, Jaden's father filed a lawsuit against Madison County Schools and its officials, and after years of legal battles, Jaden, now 19, will have her day in federal court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has agreed to hear oral arguments in the case. ""We look forward to discussing this case with the Judges who will be deciding it and ultimately letting a jury decide this matter,"" said Eric Artrip, the attorney representing the girl and her father. ""It has essentially devastated her life."" According to court records, a 16-year-old student approached Jaden in the hallway of Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, on January 22, 2010, and asked her to meet him in a bathroom for sex. It was not the first time the boy had propositioned her, said Jaden, who was enrolled in the school's special education program. Usually, she ignored him, but on that day Jaden told a friend, who suggested she tell a teacher's aide what was happening. The aide, June Ann Simpson, knew of other girls whom the boy had tried to lure into a bathroom for sex, according the lawsuit. Simpson told the school's principal, Ronnie Blair, about the allegations. According to a 2012 deposition, Blair told Simpson the boy would have to be proven guilty to be punished. In response, Simpson crafted a plan to prove the allegations, using Jaden as bait. The idea was to have the girl agree to meet the boy in a bathroom. Simpson would watch surveillance video, and teachers would intervene before anything happened. ""I told her no. I didn't want to do it,"" Jaden told CNN. She acquiesced later that day, she said, explaining,  ""I just wanted it to stop."" Key questions in her case center around who knew what, and when. Jaden and Simpson claim they went to the office of vice-principal Jeanne Dunaway, and when Simpson told Dunaway about the plan, she said, Dunaway did not respond. During a deposition, Dunaway denied the conversation happened. Jaden then left Dunaway's office and found the boy in the hallway to tell him they could ""do it,"" Jaden told CNN. Simpson stayed behind to watch surveillance monitors, hoping to catch the two walk into the bathroom. She never saw them. According to Jaden's written statement after the incident, the boy made a last-minute change. Instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy allegedly told the girl to meet him in the sixth-grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school. Once there, Jaden says she tried to stall the boy, hoping a teacher would rush in. She told him she didn't want to have sex, and she tried blocking him, according to her 2012 deposition. Nothing worked. The boy sodomized her, Jaden said. ""I thought they were going to do what they said they were going to do -- and be there and stop him -- just get him in trouble,"" Jaden told CNN. The alleged attacker was never charged, and the case was never presented to a grand jury, according to Madison County District Attorney Robert Broussard. The incident was characterized as ""inappropriate (sic) touching a girl in boys bathroom,"" according to school disciplinary records. The boy was suspended from school for five days and sent to an alternative school for a short time. The alleged attack was at least the 13th incident of sexual or violent misconduct in the boy's file, all within two academic years. While at the alternative school, the boy was suspended for sharing pornographic images on a cell phone. He was eventually allowed to return to Sparkman Middle School, where Jaden was still enrolled. ""He just gets away with it, I guess,"" she told CNN. June Ann Simpson resigned shortly after the incident. ""My client has gone from being a teacher's aide to being a scapegoat,"" attorney McGriff Belser III told CNN. Dunaway is now the principal at nearby Madison County Elementary School. In 2013, a district court judge allowed the father's claims of state violations, including negligence, against Simpson and Dunaway. The judge tossed out the federal claims -- that the school district violated Title IX and that Simpson and school administrators deprived the girl of her civil rights. Title IX is a federal law aimed at ending sexual discrimination in education. In part, it dictates how schools that receive federal funds must respond to claims of sexual harassment. Both sides have appealed. ""(Judge T. Michael Putnam) found the board of education's policies were proper. He found that the school administrators took appropriate action and complied completely with federal law as soon as they were notified of this unfortunate incident,"" attorney Mark Boardman told reporters in 2014. Boardman's firm represents Madison County Schools and the administrators named in the 2010 lawsuit. The firm has not responded to numerous calls for an interview. CNN reached out last year, when it first reported the story, and this week, as the network sought comment on the federal court agreeing to hear the case. In 2014, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division submitted a 126-page amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, disagreeing with the district judge's order. The brief, submitted jointly with the U.S. Department of Education, argues the school, in its capacity as a recipient of federal funds is ""liable for (its) deliberate indifference to known acts of peer sexual harassment."" ""If Title IX imposes any responsibility on school officials to prevent sexual harassment, it surely requires a response when they learn, as here, that a 14-year-old special needs student is about to be used as bait to catch a 16-year-old student with an extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct,"" federal attorneys wrote in the brief. On the same day the federal brief was submitted, the Women's Law Project, joined by 32 national and local organizations, submitted a brief supporting the family's lawsuit. The National Women's Law Center and Artrip, the family's attorney, have also submitted a brief to the Eleventh Circuit. ""It means a lot. It says that people actually care about what happens,"" Jaden told CNN . Months after the incident, the teen transferred to a school district out of state, but eventually dropped out of school before graduating. Jaden continues to struggle, she said. ""It's hard for me to have good days,"" she told CNN. ""I have days to where I just want to sit there by myself. I get angry faster, and I get insecure."" Asked what might help her, she stressed the importance of justice and closure. ""By actually having our day in court and letting everything be known, so that it won't happen again,"" Jaden said. A date for her case has not yet been set, but the court will likely hear oral arguments within three to five months, according the clerk's office.","Federal appeals court says it will hear case of girl, then 14, used as rape bait .

"Washington (CNN)An emotional John Kitzhaber announced his resignation as governor of Oregon on Friday, acknowledging he had ""become a liability"" to his state but asserting his innocence of any wrongdoing in a scandal surrounding his fiancee's consulting and policy work. ""I have always had the deepest respect for the remarkable institution that is the Oregon Legislature; and for the office of the Governor,"" Kitzhaber said in a recorded message. ""And I cannot in good conscience continue to be the element that undermines it. I have always tried to do the right thing and now the right thing to do is to step aside."" The resignation will take effect next Wednesday, at which point Democratic Secretary of State Kate Brown will take over as governor. Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT rights organization, trumpeted her promotion Friday as the ascension of the nation's first openly bisexual governor. Kitzhaber's decision to step down came as little surprise, as he had faced mounting calls to resign this week over reports indicating his finacee, Clivia Lynne Hayes, advised the governor and state employees on energy policy while getting paid by a group advocating on the issue. The state Attorney General opened a criminal investigation into the case on Monday, and on Thursday night, state troopers gathered outside his Portland-area home, leaving after a fruitless hours-long stakeout with no sighting of the governor. The resignation came as the Oregon Department of Administrative Services served criminal subpoenas on Kitzhaber and Hayes. The subpoenas seek emails, letters and financial information concerning a wide range of activities, including state business. Kitzhaber said Friday, however, ""I am confident that I have not broken any laws nor taken any actions that were dishonest or dishonorable in their intent or outcome,"" and asserted that the AG and ethics investigation into his fiancee's work would ultimately exonerate him in the eyes of Oregonians. But he also acknowledged that the questions dogging his administration over his fiancee's policy work, ""and the escalating media frenzy that has stemmed from this, has clearly reached the point of no return."" And, voice wavering, he expressed a love for Oregon, ""its people, its rivers, its mountains and its landscapes, with every fiber of my being."" It was a dramatic end for a governor that made Oregon history just three months ago by winning an unprecedented fourth term in office. But it was one, Oregon political observers say, that was not entirely unexpected. RELATED: 'Greek tragedy' leads to governor's resignation . The latest scandal wasn't the first time Kitzhaber's fiancee had caused the governor trouble. Questions surrounding her role as an adviser to the governor, while still doing consulting work on the side, dogged them both during his 2010 reelection campaign. Many in the state suggested the governor may have let his relationship cloud his judgment. ""Love is blind â€” that's all I'm going to say,"" Oregon Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader told CNN in Washington on Friday. The reports that prompted Kitzhaber's resignation emerged before he was reelected, but Kitzhaber was largely able to ignore them, riding Oregon's heavily Democratic electorate and a flawed Republican challenger to victory last fall. But details surrounding the scandal continued to trickle out over the past few months, and the situation came to a head last week with the state's largest paper, The Oregonian, calling on him to resign. On Monday, the Oregon attorney general opened up an investigation into the situation. And Kitzhaber stoked the controversy this week by reportedly deciding to resign by Tuesday, and in a move his secretary of state called ""bizarre and unprecedented,"" changing his mind by Wednesday afternoon. Brown outlined her experience during the saga in a statement, saying she received a call from Kitzhaber late Tuesday afternoon asking her to return to Oregon from Washington ""as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone."" When she returned, late Wednesday afternoon, Brown said things had changed. ""I was escorted directly into a meeting with the governor. It was a brief meeting. He asked me why I came back early from Washington, D.C., which I found strange,"" she recounted in her release. ""I asked him what he wanted to talk about. The governor told me he was not resigning, after which he began a discussion about transition."" Brown added: ""This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation."" She said she told the governor she and her staff would be ready if he resigns. And the call for him to do just that grew louder into Thursday, with state Treasurer Ted Wheeler becoming the first Oregon elected official to publicly call for Kitzhaber to step down. In a statement, Wheeler said the governor ""has accomplished many great things during his long career, and history will be kinder to him than current events suggest."" ""Unfortunately, the current situation has become untenable, and I cannot imagine any scenario by which things improve. Oregon deserves a Governor who is fully focused on the duties of state,"" Wheeler said. On Friday, the overarching consensus in Oregon was that Kitzhaber had done the right thing, and that his resignation would, as Sen. Ron Wyden put it in a statement, let the state ""refocus"" on its goals. . ""Oregonians have a right to expect the highest ethical standards from their government, and today's announcement by Governor Kitzhaber acknowledges that reality,"" the Democratic senator said. ""In the days ahead, we will refocus with our new Governor Kate Brown on the goal all Oregonians share - making the best state in America even better."" Read Gov. Kitzhaber's resignation letter .

"Cairo (CNN)Two Al Jazeera journalists who'd been imprisoned in Egypt for more than a year were granted bail Thursday, with a court telling them they can await retrial away from jail in a case that has outraged journalists and activists around the globe. An Egyptian court Thursday ordered journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed freed ahead of their retrial on charges that they supported the banned Muslim Brotherhood. However, the men were still in custody Thursday night, and with government offices closed on Fridays for weekly prayers, their release might not come until Saturday. News of their pending release comes less than two weeks after Al Jazeera correspondent Peter Greste, a colleague who was convicted with them, was released and deported to his native Australia. Bail for Fahmy, an Egyptian-Canadian citizen and former CNN producer, was set at 250,000 Egyptian pounds ($32,750). Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen, is not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country ahead of the retrial. Fahmy's family paid the bail Thursday. The case is scheduled to resume on February 23. Fahmy, who says he recently surrendered his Egyptian citizenship under coercion to facilitate his ultimate release, addressed the court Thursday, reasserting his innocence and brandishing an Egyptian flag. Al Jazeera applauded the two journalists' bail but called for their full exoneration. ""Bail is a small step in the right direction, and allows Baher and Mohamed to spend time with their families after 411 days apart,"" an Al Jazeera spokesman said. ""The focus, though, is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally."" Fahmy, Mohamed and Greste were arrested in Egypt in December 2013, accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and broadcasting footage -- including video of clashes between police and protesters -- that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down. The journalists have said they were just doing their jobs, covering all sides of the stories in Egypt. All three were convicted last year on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security, but they have maintained their innocence. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and Mohamed to 10 years. The three appealed their convictions, and in January their attorneys announced that Egypt's highest court had granted them a retrial. Amnesty International and other observers have long held that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the time of their arrest, Egypt was mired in political turmoil surrounding the coup of President Mohamed Morsy in his Muslim Brotherhood-backed government. After Morsy's ouster, the military, which had staged the coup, declared the longstanding political party a terrorist organization. The deportation of Greste and Thursday's bail for Fahmy and Baher Mohamed follow a recent improvement in Egyptian-Qatari relations. In December, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met with a Qatari envoy. Days after that, Qatar shut down an Egypt-based Al-Jazeera affiliate, Mubasher Masr, which Cairo accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed didn't work for that affiliate, but accusations against the channel were featured in their trial. Shortly after Mubasher Masr closed, the journalists' retrial was announced. Greste was released as part of a new Egyptian law allowing the President to deport defendants. Defense lawyers also asked Egypt to deport Fahmy. In court Thursday, Fahmy said that an Egyptian official told him he would have to renounce his Egyptian citizenship first -- something that Fahmy said he had initially rejected. ""Then I got a call from a leading official in the country, and they told me: 'Mohamed, nationality is not a piece of paper, but it is in the heart. And you can visit Egypt as a tourist and apply for the citizenship again.' "" Fahmy said he surrendered his citizenship reluctantly, adding that it was difficult for him in part because his family has long had proud ties to the military. He again denied having any connection with the Muslim Brotherhood. ""Our reports were balanced, and had no fabrication or violation,"" he said. His brother, Adel Fahmy, said Fahmy was ""almost tormented"" by having to drop his Egyptian citizenship to be granted a deportation decree from Egypt's President. Earlier this month, Fahmy's family appealed for his release in part on grounds of his health, saying in a statement published by an Egyptian news outlet that he was ill with hepatitis C and had an injured shoulder. Fahmy injured his shoulder before his arrest and has complained about not getting proper treatment for the injury while in prison. Greste described in a January 2014 letter how he and his colleagues were detained, saying that Interior Ministry officials burst into a hotel room that he and producer Fahmy were using. Officials rushed Mohamed's home, he said. Egypt is the sixth-leading jailer of journalists in the world, according to a tally conducted in December by the nonpartisan Committee to Protect Journalists. The jailing and sentencing of the Al Jazeera journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world. A campaign led by Al Jazeera declared that ""Journalism is not a crime."" Many tweeted under the hashtag #freeajstaff and journalists, including Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent, who held up a sign with the campaign on her show. On Thursday, International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney released a statement after Egypt's Supreme Court issued its reasons for overturning the original verdict and sentence in the case of Fahmy. ""I am encouraged by the Supreme Court's findings that the trial was unfair, and by today's ruling granting Mr. Fahmy bail. At the same time, there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that Fahmy deserves. It may also take several months to complete,"" Clooney said. On February 2, Clooney gave CNN a statement regarding Fahmy, who also used to work for CNN. ""I have been in touch with the Fahmy family and we are all delighted that Peter Greste has been released,"" it said. ""As Mr. Fahmy's counsel we are doing all we can to ensure the same outcome for Mr. Fahmy, who has suffered the same injustice."" Amal Clooney to push  Egypt to free Al Jazeera journalist . Fahmy's fiancee, Arwa Emara, told CNN in December that she had hoped, before Fahmy's arrest, that they would have a ""very simple life."" ""I was very happy when I first met Mohamed,"" she said. ""I felt that he's the one. And after his arrest, I found myself doing things that I never expected that I'm able to do."" Emara said they can now relax after the court has granted Fahmy bail. ""I am so exhausted and he's exhausted. And now we want to just go out ... enjoy life,"" Emara said. CNN's Ian Lee and journalist Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo. CNN's Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Catherine E. Shoichet and Slma Shelbayah contributed to this report.","Despite bail order, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were still in custody .
