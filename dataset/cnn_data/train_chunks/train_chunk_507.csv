These shocking images show the terrifying moment when a family were confronted by knife wielding thugs who stole cash and valuables. Two thieves, wearing scarves and masks to cover their faces, entered the back garden of the property in Doncaster, South Yorkshire while a 44-year-old man, his wife and three children were innocently enjoying the last few days of summer. The father immediately confronted the men who threatened his children before forcing the family into the house and making them empty the safe. Horror: Suspect is seen pointing the knife as he approaches the man who is holding his arm out in defence . Terror: Both suspects with knives are then seen attacking the man while his wife runs towards the children . Before fleeing the property the two callous thugs punched the protective father in the face and got back into the black Audi A5 they arrived in. It is believed they then left the car before being picked up by a passing white Ford Transit van which dropped them off outside the Sun Inn pub also in Doncaster. Local businesses in the town have raised a reward of £5,000 for any information that leads to the conviction of those responsible. Scared: The children and mother then run away and the suspect in black on the left holds out the knife . Frightening: The suspect is seen holding the knife towards the wife and children who are out of view .

Bill Belichick may have been fined for his on-field conduct over the weekend, but at least the New England Patriots coach has some cash to spare thanks to the sale of his New York love nest. The NFL slapped a fine of $50,000 on Belichick after he grabbed a replacement referee during the game Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens. But the fine came amid a report that the crinkle-browed coach is parting with his townhouse in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, and making bank on it - a total of $550,000. Punished: Bill Belichick was fined after he grabbed a replacement official during Sunday night's game against the Baltimore Ravens . Love nest: Belichick reportedly dished out $2.2million for this townhouse in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, when he was with Shannon Shenocca . High-priced pad: The townhouse includes five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a backyard . The New York Observer reported that Belichick recently sold the house, complete with its five bedrooms and three bathrooms, for $2.75million. Belichick reportedly purchased the high-priced pad for $2.2million in 2007 as a love nest to share with his then-girlfriend Sharon Shenocca, who was the receptionist for the New York Giants, after his marriage to Debby Clarke crumbled. He has since been romantically linked to Linda Holliday, a correspondent for WCVB-TV’s StyleBoston. Belichick grabbed an official's arm at the end of Sunday night's game after the Ravens kicked a game-winning field goal. Quaint: Belichick reportedly bought the house in 2007 for $2.2million when he was dating Shenocca, a New York Giants receptionist . Let there be light: The house is adorned with chandeliers and lots of windows . Moneymaker: Belichick reportedly made $550,000 on the Brooklyn townhouse, right, after selling it for $2.75million . He first claimed he was just looking for answers when he grabbed the official. 'So when the game was over, I went out and I was really looking for an explanation from the officials as to whether the play was under review,' he said, 'and I did try to get the official's attention as he was coming off the field to ask that, but I really wasn't able to do that.' But by Wedneday, Belichick changed his tune and accepted the punishment. 'It was inappropriate for me to contact the official. I take responsibility for what happened,' Belichick said in statement released by the team. Acceptance: Belichick called his behaviour at Sunday's game 'inappropriate' and accepted the fine . 'I accept the discipline and I apologize for the incident Sunday night in Baltimore.' Also, the NFL said Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh won't be fined for making contact with a game official during Sunday's 31-30 win over New England. Ray Anderson, the NFL's vice president of football operations, said Harbaugh did not violate the rule regarding abuse of officials. The Belichick fine was one of many that have been handed out by the NFL this week as a result of interactions with replacement refs. Anger: Belichick was one of several coaches to be punished by the NFL for actions directed at replacement refs . Washington Redskins assistant Kyle Shanahan was fined $25,000 on Wednesday for his conduct toward replacement officials. Shanahan, the son of Redskins coach Mike Shanahan, was called for unsportsmanlike conduct for berating officials in the final seconds of the Redskins' 38-31 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. He also confronted an official in a stadium tunnel after the game. On Monday, the league fined Broncos coach John Fox $30,000 and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio $25,000 for berating officials during a loss to Atlanta on September 17.","Patriots coach reportedly bought Park Slope, Brooklyn, townhouse for $2.2million in 2007 .

Rape and sex crimes on U.S. military bases have risen alarmingly in recent years, with many survivors afraid to come forward for fear of ruing their career or facing retaliation. In an interview with NBC’s Rock Center With Brian Williams, several servicemen and women, including former Marine Claire Russo, spoke out about their ordeals with trying to find justice within the military. The 32-year-old former intelligence officer said that she was sexually assaulted in 2004 at a Marine Corps ball after a fellow Marine allegedly drugged her. Though she begged him to stop, she said he continued to sodomise her on the bathroom floor. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Former Marine intelligence officer Clair Russo, pictured, recounted the story of how she was raped by a fellow Marine in 2004 to NBC . Desire: NBC spoke to several military women who had been assaulted, all of whom said they still wished to serve their country . The special, which aired in full Thursday at 10pm on NBC, looks at the growing epidemic of rape and sexual assault in the military. According to Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, there were over 19,000 cases of abuse or rape in 2010 alone. Russo told NBC’s Natalie Morales that she attended the Marine Corps Ball in San Diego in 2004 with her cousin. While at the gathering, she met Doug Dowson, another Marine. She said that he offered her a drink, but then things began to get hazy for her. Though a drug test was inconclusive, Russo was convinced that she had been drugged. She said the next thing she remembered was Dowson taking her to the bathroom and sodomising her. ‘At that point, I was just crying and begging him to stop,’ she said. Russo said that the day after the rape, she was at the military facility waiting to get a rape kit done, but her cousin told her to instead go to a civilian hospital instead, saying the military establishment lacked equipment, skill, and personnel to handle running a rape kit. Spiral of silence: Victims of sex crimes in the military are often afraid to report the attacks for fear of retribution . Staggering: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that there were more than 19,000 sexual assaults in the U.S. military in 2010 alone . According to NBC, the military declined to charge Dowson, despite forensic evidence and testimony, as well as photos corroborating Russo’s story. She said the Marines discouraged her from taking her case to the D.A. The .

In most cases, a rape . victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her . commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the . officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute.

Christopher Tappin, 65, always maintained his innocence, saying he was a victim of an FBI sting. He has since pleaded guilty . A retired British businessman who was extradited to the U.S. earlier this year has pleaded guilty at a court hearing to selling surface-to-air missile parts to Iran. Christopher Tappin, 65, had pleaded not guilty but changed his plea at a hearing in El Paso, Texas, this afternoon in an agreement with US prosecutors. His guilty plea, to one count of the indictment, calls for a 33-month sentence which prosecutors have said they will not oppose him serving back in the UK. U.S. District Judge David Briones will sentence Tappin, of Orpington, Kent, on January 9. Tappin is on bail after being extradited to the US in February. The former president of the Kent Golf Union has previously denied attempting to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles which were to be shipped from the US to Tehran via the Netherlands, saying he was the victim of an FBI sting. His wife Elaine, 62, said ahead of today's hearing that 'however upsetting' a plea deal was, it marked the beginning of his 'swift and safe return' to the UK. Tappin's lawyer, Dan Cogdell, said he expected him to serve several months in a US prison while authorities in Washington and the UK decide whether to extradite him. He was originally thought to have faced up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. The case followed an investigation which started in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags. Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies.Two other men have already been sentenced.

The average British adult has just seven years of complete financial freedom to look forward to, a report revealed yesterday. Researchers found the majority of us will only enjoy a brief ‘window of wealth’ between the ages of 58 and 65. This is the point at which debts have been cleared, kids have left home and a full-time wage still lands in the bank every month. 'Wealth window': The average Briton has just seven years of complete financial freedom and it is not before the children have left home and while they are still earning a full-time wage . But just seven years later regular income ceases and we will be forced to live on a reduced retirement income. The figures emerged in a detailed study carried out by Skipton Building Society. Skipton’s Head of Corporate Communications, Tracy Fletcher, said: 'This study offers a glimmer of hope for those hard-working young people who are currently strapped for cash and can’t see light at the end of the tunnel. 'As an adult there will be financial commitments throughout your working life, but you can get to the point, albeit potentially quite brief, where things ease up and you finally have a little money to spend on yourself. 'The mid to late 50s can be the point where you stop forking out for your children’s education, cars, weddings and rent. 'If you are tied into a 25 year mortgage this might also be the time when you’ve cleared the balance. 'But our findings also highlight the fact that, particularly in the current climate, it’s more important than ever for people to get on top of their finances when they are younger, in order to boost their chances of achieving more comfortable later years.' Three quarters of the 1,000 people over the age of 55 who were polled claimed they had very little disposable income during their 20s, 30s and 40s. Little disposable income: During people's 20s, 30s and 40s most most money went towards paying the bills, supporting the children, payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans . During this time, most money went towards paying the bills, supporting the children, payments towards the mortgage or rent and loans. But four in 10 anticipate being richer towards the tail end of their career as they finally start to enjoy their hard-earned cash. The study shows the average 55-year-old embarked on their first full time job at age 18, settled down with a partner by 24 and started a family two years later. A house was purchased at age 27 and the mortgage finally cleared by age 53. By the age of 52 the children finally flew the nest for good and most parents stopped supporting them a year later. Healthy savings: The average person was able to save £20,335 by the age of 50 but 61 per cent wished they had saved more . The average respondent believes all . their debts - loans, credit cards and store cards - will be cleared by . age 58, and they intend to retire at 65. When . asked how they intend to spend their money during their ‘window of . wealth’, six in 10 plan to go on holiday, while 45 per cent will spend . more money on doing up the house. A further three in 10 would like to eat out more, while 22 per cent will socialise with friends. The survey shows that more than half of those polled did save during their 20s, 30s and 40s despite other financial commitments. The average person managed to save a healthy £20,335 by the age of 50, but 61 per cent still wish they had saved more by this point. Only three per cent of people over the age of 55 are currently supporting elderly relatives, and those who are helping out financially anticipate doing so until they turn 65. Tracy Fletcher added: 'The 1,000 adults we polled have been relatively sensible with the spending and savings habits over the past 30 or 40 years, but despite this are left with just a small window of spending at the end of it all. 'There is a clear message that regardless of there being a time at which you might not have so many financial commitments, it is imperative that you start saving as early as possible to help prepare for a more comfortable future. 'And there is always the chance that by making sensible financial decisions, this window of wealth can be extended into the retirement years.'","Researchers found that most Britons will only have a 'window of wealth' between 58 and 65-years-old .

But when it comes to meetings, it seems Vince Cable doesn’t have quite the same vigour. Some mischievous Lib Dems have claimed the 69-year-old Business Secretary is not fit to be a future party leader because he falls asleep at work. Ageism? Allies of Nick Clegg have accused the sexegenarian Business Secretary of falling asleep during meetings . Allies of Nick Clegg made the withering attack on the party favourite after he ran a campaign in recent weeks positioning himself as Mr Clegg’s successor if the Lib Dem leader were to ‘fall under a bus’. He has publicly flirted with Labour leader Ed Miliband, provoking talk that Mr Cable would become Chancellor in a future Lib-Lab coalition. Mr Cable, who will be 72 at the next election, insists that he is not too old for the job. Irritated by Mr Cable’s self-promotion, Mr Clegg’s friends have cast doubt on that claim. One told the Mail that Mr Cable’s diary of meetings is too much for him. The source added: ‘Vince will find it hard to even mount a leadership campaign, let alone be leader. He struggles to stay awake all day as it is.’ Earlier this week Mr Cable, a keen . dancer who appeared on the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special in . 2010, said: ‘I’ve got one of the toughest jobs in government, I work . hard, I’ve got plenty of energy, I’ve got good health, I don’t see my . age as being a problem.’ His allies say that he ‘cannot envisage circumstances’ under which he would challenge Mr Clegg for the leadership. But they are adamant that he would not stand aside for a younger man if Mr Clegg went. He is likely to have at least three rivals for the job. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has let it be known he would challenge Mr Cable for the leadership. And the Mail can reveal that Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne has also decided to stand if his mentor quits. They are likely to be joined by party president Tim Farron. Mr Cable’s supporters believe he could command respect as a caretaker leader. A friend hit back by saying: ‘What a pathetic smear.’ Mr Cable’s spokesman said: ‘There aren’t many people who could do his job and still have the energy for ballroom, salsa and tango.’",Vince Cable will be 72 by the time of the next election .

A daughter who stole her disabled mother's savings to buy 'basics' for her new home, including an iPad and a washing machine, has been jailed. Theft: Blenkinsopp said she stole her mother's savings to buy 'basics' for her new house, including an iPad . Kerry Blenkinsopp, 34, stole a total of £2,600 from her mother Rosina, who was saving the money for adaptations to her home, which  she needed after suffering a stroke and being confined to a wheelchair. When the devious daughter was rumbled, she said she spent the money on 'basics' for her new home - a £200 iPad, cooker, washing machine and a car. Teesside Crown Court yesterday heard Blenkinsopp stole from a safe under a bed and helped herself to £800 because she wanted to move out and furnish her home. Days later, as her mother was at hospital for physiotherapy, she took a further £1,800 before attempting to cover her tracks by calling the police to report a burglary. Jailing her for eight months, Judge John Walford told the unemployed Blenkinsopp: 'In a dreadful betrayal of trust, you took advantage of her circumstances to steal money and then covered what you had done by a deception.' Blenkinsopp, of Craven Street, Middlesbrough, has been disowned by her mother and family since the thefts in July. They have also secured a restraining order to keer her away from her mother. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Blenkinsopp, who sobbed in the public gallery during her daughter's sentencing, said: 'I want nothing more to do with her.' Judge Walford told Blenkinsopp: 'To do anything other than impose an immediate custodial sentence would outrage the family - the victims of your criminal activity. 'The effect on your mother and your family as a whole has been profound. 'The effect has been both financial and emotional. 'Basics': Blenkinsopp also spent the money on a new washing machine and cooker, such as these pictured, for her house . 'The money was earmarked for adaptations and improvements to her home, which the loss of the money means your mother can no longer afford.' In mitigation Andrew Teate said Blenkinsopp wanted to reconcile with her family but accepted their wishes. He said: 'It is her intention to fully repay her mother and make best the situation.' Prosecutor Sharon Elves said Blenkinsopp quickly owned up to the police about the sham burglary because she felt as though they knew she was behind it. Blenkinsopp admitted two charges of theft and one of causing wasteful employment of police time at an earlier court hearing.","Kerry Blenkinsopp stole £2,600 from her mother to buy luxuries, claiming they were 'basics'

It means he will not be able to watch his team, Colchester United, play at home when upon his release.

In the letter, Kelvin also denied there is a rift between his mother and refuted claims by half-brother Marcus Southernwood who said the brothers had been physically violent towards him.

We get on well and she has always helped me out when she can. The thing about Marcus is all made up as I have not seen him for up to seven years. Me or my brother have not hit him and I do not know why he is coming out with that. I am going to go to my solicitors to see what I can do about this injunction. I am hoping to get back to Colchester as I have a brother, Jason, there and we get on well. He helps me keep off the drink. I bet Colchester Chief Inspector Paul Wells is happy, the joker. He is getting too old for the job. I know I get drunk but the police keep coming over to me and my brother, Ashley, when we are doing nothing. It is not like we cause trouble day-after-day. You would think that the courts would help people like me and my brother but no, they just bang people up. It is bad when I have to come to prison to get help for my drinking. PC David Hirst does not know what he is talking about. He is a joke and I have always had trouble from him. He did not like me or my brother but that goes two ways. It is not right for the courts to do this. I am a lot better now and have been off the drink for five weeks. Prison does help some people. I would like to stop because I know I upset a lot of people, but when I am drunk I do not think about what I am doing. I have not got into any trouble when not drunk so yes, I will have to stop or go to places to get help - and I can do it.

Rare: Elvis wrote the poignant letter in 1958 - while he was on national service in Germany, pictured . He had just lost his mother and was living thousands of miles from home in a foreign country. So it’s fair to say that Elvis was feeling genuinely lonesome the night he wrote an emotional letter to his friends. Aged 23 and doing his national service in Germany, he  sent the rare note home in 1958 telling them how homesick he was and how much he missed his mother Gladys who had died three months earlier. He also spoke of his frustration at having to postpone his burgeoning singing career for the two years he spent in the US military. The two-page handwritten letter was addressed to a 15-year-old girl called Frances Forbes, but was meant for a whole group of friends back home in Memphis, Tennessee. It has been in the hands of a private collector from Hertfordshire for many years, but has now come up for sale. Richard Davies, of International Autograph Auctions, said: ‘Elvis’s cousin once said that if Elvis had written ten letters in his lifetime, then that would have been a lot. ‘This is the first handwritten letter by Elvis that I have ever come across. They are like gold dust. 'The content of this letter is superb. It is very personal to him and shows him to be quite vulnerable in the aftermath of his mother’s death. Letter: The sad note reflects what the Elvis felt privately while he was in Germany and away from his friends and loved-ones . ‘He wrote about being lonely and homesick, about his mother’s death and about getting home  to Gracelands. ‘It does reveal a vulnerable and . tender side to him. We have had a lot of interest in it and we expect it . to go for more than the pre-sale estimate of £3,000.’ Crestfallen: Elvis was beside himself after his mother Gladys, pictured, died . Elvis’s reluctance to put pen to paper . was reflected in the opening line of the note. He wrote: ‘Well I don’t . know what ever made me decide to write a letter but I guess it’s because . I am so homesick and lonely. ‘I just want to tell you that I miss . and love you all very much and I am just counting the hours untill [sic] . I can return and we will all be together again. ‘I can hardly wait till I am back . singing and making movies, and above all seeing the old gang again. 'I . guess I miss mother more over here than anything because I am just now . realizing that she won’t ever be here anymore.’ He went on to ask his friends to pass . on his regards to ‘everybody at Gracelands’ and finished by saying: ‘I . just wanted you all to know that I am thinking of you.’ Although he was eight years older . than her, it is thought Elvis had a relationship with Frances Forbes at . the time she received the letter in November 1958. She held on to the note for many years and provided a letter of provenance when it was sold to the English collector. Although Elvis’s loneliness was clear at the time he wrote the letter, it did not last long. In September 1959, he met Priscilla . Wagner, the 14-year-old stepdaughter of a US Air Force officer based in . Germany. The pair fell in love and eventually married in 1966.

The Crown and Anchor used to be the regular Monday night watering hole for Albert Warren and Edward Basting, as the pair had been drinking there for about a year. This came to an abrupt end after the pub's manager said he had received several complaints about the personal hygiene of one of the men. Disappointed: Albert Warren (left) and Edward Basting (right) who were regulars at the Crown and Anchor before being banned for bad hygiene . Both men were told they could not return to the pub until they addressed the issue. Mr Warren, 67, said: 'He practically said we stank. It’s a bit of a cheek and a bit of an insult. Nobody had ever complained before and we had never had any problems with that pub before.' His 69-year-old friend Mr Basting added: 'It is not really good enough because I cannot see how he can accept us the previous Monday but then the following Monday he says that to us. 'I find it an insult and defamation of character. I was shocked when this happened, it is not a nice thing to have happen.' Tom Smith, owner of the pub in Bromley, south London, says Mr Warren and Mr Basting are both good customers and his staff tried to deal with the issue as sensitively as they could. Out: The manager of Crown and Anchor said he had received several complaints about one of the men's hygiene . He said: 'The manager spoke to the two guys outside and did not embarrass them in front of customers. 'We do not wish to exclude people from the premises and all that was said is you must try and do something about your personal hygiene. 'We are not barring them but they need to do something about their personal hygiene and then they will be welcome back in the pub. 'We like the customers we have got to be happy in the setting that we provide.' However, the offended pair have taken their custom elsewhere. The two pensioners have since started drinking in another pub on Monday nights and visit other pubs in the area, including the Chatterton Arms.","Albert Warren, 67, and Edward Basting, 69, were barred from Crown and Anchor in Bromley, London .

Keeva and Ceira, were born in June last year to their mother Sara Jones, 33, from Southport, Merseyside. The babies have increased her brood to ten, as she also has four other children. As a family they get through eight pints of milk and two loaves of bread per day as well as two bulk-size packs of nappies a week. But despite her unusually - and unpredictably - large family, Sara, who has a pair of identical twin sisters herself, says her home life could not feel more normal. Triple the trouble: Sara Jones holds the latest additions to her brood, Keeva and Ceira. Her first twins were Niamh, far left, and Liam, far right, both ten, and Shay and Aoife (centre), both two, are now two. 'For most families having twins is something out of the ordinary ... [but for me] it would almost be weird for me to fall pregnant and not have twins,' she told the Sunday Mirror. Her story began 10 years ago when she gave birth to Liam and Niamh. She then split from their father Rhys before beginning a new relationship with her current fiance Craig Morgan, 31. Then in 2010 she learned she was pregnant with more twins - Shay and Aoife, now two. And as if that were not enough, she also has children Brogane, 16, Siobhan, 13, Calam, 12, and Sean, four. 'They keep me on my toes,' she said. 'Some families can’t have . children, so I see every single one as a blessing.' While she said the second pair's arrival was' a bit daunting', by the time Keeva and Ceira were born, she 'knew what [she] was doing'. But it is not always easy. Craig is an unemployed furniture maker while, for her, bring up the children is a full time job so it can be a strain to make ends meet. 'We have to budget very strictly,' Sara added. 'I try to get . everything for about £100 a week, but every day I go to the supermarket . and spend ­another £15 to top up.' And because each of her children is 'unique', she says, she refuses to make the youngest wear hand me downs. In spite of the pressure to feed and clothe each child separately, Sara says she would not want it any other way and believes each one of them will 'have a best friend for life'. 'And I’m hoping they’re all going to look after me when I’m a pensioner,' she added.","Sara Jones beat odds of 500,000 to one when her latest pair, Keeva and Ceira, were born in June last year .

The most energetic laser shot in mankind's history was fired at the stadium-sized National Ignition Facility in California this month. On March 15, an array of 192 lasers fired a shaped pulse of energy that generated 411 trillion watts of peak power - 1,000 times . more than whole of the United States uses at any one moment. The pulse is a historic moment for the 'fusion' facility, which aims to generate power using a nuclear fusion reaction - similar to what happens in hydrogen bombs. An artist's impression of a reaction using the 192-laser array at NIF. The pulse fired this month was not aimed at a target, but scientists will eventually aim the lasers at a 1mm pellet of hydrogen to ignite a fusion reaction . A worker inspects equipment at California's National Ignition Facility: The stadium-sized NIF aims to be the first plant to 'break even' with a fusion reaction, generating as much power as the lasers put in . The huge high-energy facility will attempt laser fusion within the next two years. The technology is seen as a 'Holy Grail' of clean energy . The pulse only lasted for 23 billionths of a second. The laser array was not firing 'at' a target - but within two years, scientists will fire the 192 lasers at a 1mm pellet of hydrogen. The NIF scientists hope that it will 'light the fuse' for a fusion reaction - the reaction that powers stars - which will release more energy than the lasers put in. 'Controlled' nuclear fusion - the . reaction in a hydrogen bomb is uncontrolled - is a Holy Grail of clean . energy that scientists have sought to crack since the Fifties. Because of the incredibly short duration . of the pulse, the total amount of energy required is not as huge as it . sounds, and is stored in huge battery-like capacitors at NIF. ‘This event marks a key milestone in the . National Ignition Campaign's drive toward fusion ignition,’ said NIF . Director Edward Moses. ‘While there have been many demonstrations of . similar equivalent energy performance on individual beams or quads . during the completion of the NIF project, this is the first time the . full complement of 192 beams has operated at this sound barrier.’ Ignition would be a self-sustaining reaction that would release vast amounts of energy far surpassing the 'break even' point. Equipment at the National Ignition Facility: The result on March 15 shows scientists could be close to the goal of 'fusion ignition' The lasers only fire for 23 billionths of a second, but produce 1000 times as much power as the entire United States uses in any given moment . The facility uses pellets of the . hydrogen isotopes deuterium - found in 'heavy water' - and tritium, and . fires lasers to compress the pellets to a few hundredths of its starting . size. The reaction fuses the atoms into . helium atoms, and releases fast-moving subatomic particles called . neutrons which can be used to heat water and drive steam turbines. Fusion is not, however, . uncontroversial. The NIF is also associated with weapons programmes in . the US - the process of fusion is also used in hydrogen bombs,  and NIF . works with America's Stockpile Stewardship and Management programme, . designed to ensure its nuclear arsenal stays active.

In two of the three tests, the birds ¿ Eurasian jays ¿ did just as well as the seven-year-old children . IT’S a suggestion that will give pause for thought to even the proudest of parents. For no matter how bright they believe their son or daughter is, until the age of seven, children are, at least in some respects, no brainier than birds. In simple experiments, birds did just as well as children up until the age of seven. Researchers pitted birds against boys and girls using tests inspired by the Aesop’s fable in which a thirsty crow is able to drink from a pitcher after using pebbles to raise the water level to within its reach. In two of the three tests at Cambridge University, the birds – Eurasian jays – did just as well as the seven-year-old children. After this, the human mind proved superior to the bird brain. The experiments built on earlier work in which jays quickly learned that adding stones to a cylinder half-filled with water would bring a tasty treat floating on the surface within reach of their beaks. In a second task the jays – colourful members of the crow family and about the same size as jackdaws – realised it was better to use pebbles, which sink, than corks, which float. When Cambridgeshire children, aged four to ten, were set similar tasks, they did as well as the jays on the first, up to the age of seven. Brainy boy? Up until the age of seven, children are, at least in some respects, be no brainier than birds . From the age of eight, the pupils . learned more quickly than the birds. The pattern was similar with the . second task – except four-year-old children did worse than the jays. However, a third, more complex, task separated the youngsters from the birds. It again involved dropping objects . into water to raise its level. But this time, a U-shaped tube was used, . with the join at its bottom hidden, giving the impression it was two . separate tubes. It meant dropping a stone into one ‘tube’ led to the water rising in the ‘other’ – a counter-intuitive result. This appeared to confuse the birds. However, the children did as well as before, the journal PLoS ONE . reports. The researchers said this shows children are better at putting . preconceptions aside. Lucy Cheke, a PhD student, said: ‘It . is a child’s job to learn about the world. They can’t do that if they’re . limited by a preconceived idea about what is or is not possible. ‘For a child, if it works, it works. The birds, however, found it much harder to learn what was happening . because they were put off by the fact it shouldn’t be happening.’","Eurasian jays outperform 7-year-olds in logic tests .

Senator Schumer said he wanted to make . sure the companies 'understand the significance of our concerns over . the potential publication of images captured in people's backyards and . other private settings.' The lawmaker wrote to the rival . Silicon Valley corporations on Monday accusing them of 'an unprecedented . invasion of privacy' by using technology capable of imaging objects as . small as 4in. In his letter, Senator Schumer raised . concerns over Apple's and Google's reported 'digital mapping plans that . use military-grade spy planes with enough precision to see through . windows, catch detailed images of private backyard activities, and . record images as small as four inches.' Google and Apple each unveiled new 3D . mapping services this month at separate events. The maps let users . navigate around an aerial view of a city that appears much more . realistic than the flat, top-down satellite-based images currently . available. The two companies are racing to . complete the new maps which will be a key feature as they compete to . attract users to their rival smartphone offerings. Big brother: Google and Apple have been warned about the potential for breaching privacy with their maps . Google said in a statement it does not . currently blur aerial imagery taken by the camera-equipped planes . because the resolution of the images isn't sharp enough 'for it to be a . concern.' The company added that it takes privacy 'very seriously.' Apple’s spy planes are believed to be equipped with technology developed by defence agencies to guide missile strikes. Each . plane is equipped with multiple cameras taking high-resolution . photographs of buildings and landmarks from every possible angle, which . are then compiled to make three-dimensional images. The military-grade images are taken . at a height of around 1,600ft, meaning people below are very unlikely to . realise they are being photographed. The . cameras can be installed on planes, helicopters or even unmanned . drones, although there are safety restrictions about the use of the . latter in Britain. A small plane carrying the cameras can photograph up to 100 square kilometres (38.6 square miles) every hour. Apple said it does not display . personally identifiable details such as faces or license plates, and . that 'we create optimised pictures taken from multiple shots and remove . moving objects such as cars and people from the final image.' By the end of the year, Google said it . expects to have 3D map coverage for metropolitan areas with a combined . population of 300million people. At an event demonstrating the new maps . this month, Google said it was using a fleet of airplanes owned and . operated by contractors but flying exclusively for Google. Equipped with custom-designed cameras, . the planes fly in 'a very tightly controlled pattern' over metropolitan . areas, taking pictures from 45-degree angles, Google executives . explained. The photographs are then used to build 3D computer-generated models of the buildings and cityscapes. Google has used planes to collect . aerial photos in the past, such as following the 2010 San Bruno, . California, gas-line explosion.

Yes, that furry mechanical friend, which resembles a malevolent hamster crossed with a chimp, has had its first makeover in six years. Makers Tiger Electronics aren't giving anything away, just this image of the next generation friend called Taboo. Whether the company can keep the spoilers away from this newfangled Internet age - and whether the toy will cause the same check-out chaos as it did in 1998, when online shops like Amazon were still building their brands in the UK, is up for debate. Until then, the Furby world is ready to speculate. Toy expert Peter Jenkinson of www.toyology.com said: 'The image suggests that the moving facial parts have been entirely replaced by an LCD screen. 'This will prompt lots of talk, not all of it intelligible, on Furby forums.' Other experts are predicting WiFi connectivity, allowing Furbys to livestream children's video content and interact with other friends' Furbys online. The original, which sold 40million in three years, is a collector's item. When it first went on sale for around £24 in 1998, it was in such short supply that it could be resold for as much as three times that. The Furby's appeal was attributed to its ability to learn English. It started off speaking a form of gibberish, called Furbish, which could be deciphered with the help of a dictionary that came with it. Flashback: A sales clerk holds a Furby toy as shoppers wait in line at 6am in the morning to get one of the last Furbys . More from 98: Furbys almost wiped out every other toy from the shelves - and perhaps they will do the same again this Christmas .

Infants are prone to sickness due to under-developed immune systems - but scientists say it may be possible to activate crucial cells to help them fight off diseases from an earlier age. Researchers at the University of Michigan Health System suggest the natural ability to fight infection is there early on - but key cell signals inhibit the growth of essential immune cells early in life. Blocking this signaling could lead to improving an infant's response to infection, according to the study published in Nature Immunity. Study author Yasmina Laouar, an assistant professor in the U-M Department of Microbiology and Immunology, said: 'What happens at early age is that natural killer cells, like many other immune cells, do not complete their functional maturation until adulthood. 'During this time we are left with an immature immune system that cannot protect us against infections, the reason why newborns and infants are more prone to infection.' There is a large gap in understanding infant immunity, specifically why the natural killer cell responses are deficient. The study by immunologists at the U-M demonstrates the role of a cell called transforming growth factor beta that can explain why. The study showed the production of natural killer cells is controlled by TGF-β, which is produced in the bone marrow. In infant mice, the maturation of natural killer cells progressed faster in the absence of TGF-β signaling. By adulthood, mice had 10 times more mature natural killer cells if TGF-β signaling was blocked. 'Our overall goal was to determine the factors that constraint the production and maturation of natural killer cells early in life,' said Laouar. 'To our surprise, we discovered that natural killer cells can complete maturation as early as 10 days of age if TGF-β signaling is blocked.'

Smart foods that tell the brain you have eaten enough could hold the key to beating obesity, researcher have claimed. A Dutch team has already started work on the intelligent foods that could one day help the world beat obesity. They hope the foods will contain a special chemical that mimics the message our gut sends the brain when it is full. Intelligent food: Scientists hope to create snacks that can trick the brain into thinking the gut is full after just a few bites . By sending the message earlier, the brain can be fooled into not overeating. 'We know nutrients interact with gut cells, which dispatch chemical messengers – hormones– to the brain to signal 'stomach full',"" endocrinologist Jens Holst of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, told youris.com. This messaging from our food to gut to brain is now being decoded to fight obesity. Holst discovered a small molecule in the gut, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which acts on parts of the brain that regulate appetite. He is now involved with an EU funded research project, Full4Health, to try and find out exactly how the gut tells the brain when it is full. A big problem: Scientists hope smart food could help deal with the global obesity crisis. 'There is a raft of hormones, which are all satiety hormones, which will tend to help terminate a meal,' said project coordinator Julian Mercer, obesity scientist at the University of Aberdeen, UK. 'We don’t know much about which nutrients are involved and whether we can manipulate how food interacts with those signalling systems and how those systems are integrated at different levels in the brain.' The team hope their research could lead to drugs which mimic the message, and hope to eventually make food that can also contain the messages. 'It would be even better if we could come up with smart food,' says Mercer. Recent research found Britain has one of the most sedentary populations on earth, with almost twice the proportion of people defined as 'inactive' as in neighbouring France. The global figures reveal that even the Americans put Britain to shame when it comes to taking exercise. In the UK, 63.3 per cent of the population fails to meet recommended levels of physical activity, increasing their risk of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. By comparison, 40.5 per cent of US citizens are inactive, despite more than 30 per cent of them being obese.","Dutch researchers hope to develop food that tricks the brain into thinking we are full .

A dramatic plan to transport humans beyond the solar system within 100 years today received the backing of former President Bill Clinton. The 100-year Starship project, which was set up with US military seed funding, plans to develop huge 'starships' to send humans far into space. Next week it will meet to discuss the plans and begin the huge task. Project Daedalus, the first serious attempt to design a ship capable of travelling to the nearest stars. Weighing 50,000 tonnes, powered by nuclear fusion, travelling at 12% of the speed of light, the journey time would be close to 50 years. It has already received large amounts of funding, and former President Bill Clinton has even stepped in to serve as the symposium's Honorary Chair. In a statement, Clinton said: 'This important effort helps advance the knowledge and technologies required to explore space, all while generating the necessary tools that enhance our quality of life on earth.' The astronuat who became the first black woman in space in 1992 has been chosen to skipper the '100 Year Starship' project. Mae Jemison will lead the project to explore what it would take for a multigenerational mission beyond the solar system. 'The 100 Year Starship will make the capability of human travel beyond our solar system to another star a reality over the next 100 years,' she said. The massive craft needed to escape our solar system next to St Pauls cathedral . Conceived by the British . Interplanetary society, Project Daedalus was a thirteen member . volunteer engineering design study conducted between 1973 and 1978, to . demonstrate that Interstellar travel is feasible in theory. The basis of this belief was the . demonstration of a credible engineering design just at the outset of the . space age that could in theory, cross the interstellar distances. Project Daedalus demonstrated that with current, and near future, technology, interstellar travel is feasible. 'We will embark on a journey across time and space. 'If my language is dramatic, it is because this project is monumental. And our team is both invigorated and sobered by the confidence DARPA has in us to make interstellar flight a reality.' The project began with an award by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of a $500,000 contract to study what is needed for long term projects such as interstellar space missions. The group has teamed with Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development. Adam Crowl, director of Icarus Interstellar, said: 'Project Icarus will be producing designs and doing basic research with the common goal of building the technical foundation required for eventual successful interstellar flight.' However, the team has not underestimated the task. It has already produced a list of what needs to be done . 'A venture to the stars will require the creation of revolutionary energy generation, storage and control systems, advanced propulsion systems, radical advancements in closed-loop, life-support systems, and new insights into human development, health, behaviour and training, as well as advances in robotics, automation, intelligent systems, and manufacturing techniques,' it says on its website. 'Programs to establish a human presence on the moon, Mars, or elsewhere in our solar system will be stepping-stones to the stars.' The 1970s project planned an entire mission, and found a two stage spacecraft was the best option. Weighing 50,000 tonnes and powered by nuclear fusion the journey time would be close to 50 years. The 1970s plans could now be re-examined thanks to the 100 year starship project .","Project has received the backing of Bill Clinton, who is set to chair the project's symposium next week .

After traveling eight-and-a-half months and 352 million miles, NASA's most high-tech rover will attempt to make a landing on Mars.. The Curiosity rover zeroed in on the red planet where it will attempt a tricky celestial gymnastics routine during a 'seven minutes of terror' plummet through the atmosphere on Sunday. It was poised to hit the top of the Martian atmosphere at 13,000 mph. If all goes according to script, it will be slowly lowered by cables inside a massive crater in the final few seconds. Scroll down for video . Preparation: Engineers work on a model of the Mars rover Curiosity at the Spacecraft Assembly Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., Thursday, Aug. 2, 2012 . Is there anybody out there . NASA was ready for the 'Super Bowl of . planetary exploration,' said Doug McCuistion, head of the Mars . exploration program at NASA headquarters. 'We score and win or we don't . score and we don't win,' he said. If all goes well, mission control at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory should hear a signal at 10:31 p.m. Pacific. The space agency warned that confirmation could take longer if an orbiting spacecraft that's supposed to listen for Curiosity during the descent is not in the right place. Curiosity's trajectory was so accurate that engineers decided to wave off a last chance to tweak its position before atmosphere entry. 'We're ready to head in,' said mission manager Brian Portock. Not ones to tempt fate, flight controllers planned to break out the ""good luck"" peanuts before Curiosity takes the plunge as part of a long-running tradition. One scientist who can relate to the building anxiety is Cornell University planetary scientist Steve Squyres, who headed NASA's last successful rover mission in 2004. This time around, Squyres has a supporting role and planned to view the landing with other researchers in the 'science bullpen.' 'Landing on Mars is always a nerve-racking thing. You're never going to get relaxed about something like landing a spacecraft on Mars,' he Squyres. Sunday's touchdown attempt was especially intense because NASA is testing a brand new landing technique. Due to the communication delay between Mars and Earth, Curiosity will be on autopilot. There's also extra pressure because budget woes have forced NASA to rejigger its Mars exploration roadmap. Artist's impression of Nasa's Curiosity Rover on the surface of Mars . 'There's nothing in the pipeline' beyond the planned launch of a Mars orbiter in 2013, said former NASA Mars czar Scott Hubbard, who teaches at Stanford University. Curiosity was launched to study whether the Martian environment ever had conditions suitable for microbial life. The voyage to Mars took over eight months and spanned 352 million miles. The trickiest part of the journey? The landing. Because Curiosity weighs nearly a ton, engineers drummed up a new and more controlled way to set the rover down. The last Mars rovers, twins Spirit and Opportunity, were cocooned in air bags and bounced to a stop in 2004. The plans for Curiosity called for a series of braking tricks, similar to those used by the space shuttle, and a supersonic parachute to slow it down. Next: Ditch the heat shield used for the fiery descent. And in a new twist, engineers came up with a way to lower the rover by cable from a hovering rocket-powered backpack. At touchdown, the cords cut and the rocket stage crashes a distance away. The nuclear-powered Curiosity, the size of a small car, is packed with scientific tools, cameras and a weather station. It sports a robotic arm with a power drill, a laser that can zap distant rocks, a chemistry lab to sniff for the chemical building blocks of life and a detector to measure dangerous radiation on the surface. It also tracked radiation levels during the journey to help NASA better understand the risks astronauts could face on a future manned trip. After several weeks of health checkups, the six-wheeled rover could take its first short drive and flex its robotic arm. Monitoring: Nick Lam, data controller, monitors the Mars rover Curiosity from the Deep Space Network's control room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., Thursday, August 2, 2012 . The landing site near Mars' equator was picked because there are signs of water everywhere, meeting one of the requirements for life as we know it. Inside Gale Crater is a 3-mile-high mountain, and images from space show the base appears rich in minerals that formed in the presence of water. Previous trips to Mars have uncovered ice near the Martian north pole and evidence that water once flowed when the planet was wetter and toastier unlike today's harsh, frigid desert environment. Curiosity's goal: To scour for basic ingredients essential for life, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur and oxygen. It's not equipped to search for living or fossil microorganisms. To get a definitive answer, a future mission needs to fly Martian rocks and soil back to Earth to be examined by powerful laboratories. The mission comes as NASA retools its Mars exploration strategy. Faced with tough economic times, the space agency pulled out of partnership with the European Space Agency to land a rock-collecting rover in 2018. The Europeans have since teamed with the Russians as NASA decides on a new roadmap. Despite Mars' reputation as a spacecraft graveyard, humans continue their love affair with the planet, lobbing spacecraft in search of clues about its early history. Out of more than three dozen attempts - flybys, orbiters and landings - by the U.S., Soviet Union, Europe and Japan since the 1960s, more than half have ended disastrously. One NASA rover that defied expectations is Opportunity, which is still busy wheeling around the rim of a crater in the Martian southern hemisphere eight years later.

The specimens - one fly and two mites - were found in millimeter-scale droplets . of amber from northeastern Italy. They are about 100million years older than . any other amber arthropod - invertebrate animals that include insects, arachnids, and . crustaceans - ever collected. The finding has echoes of Jurassic Park, in which dinosaurs are cloned from DNA found in blood from a mosquito preserved in amber. Scroll down for video . The specimens, one fly and two mites, were found in millimeter-scale droplets of amber from northeastern Italy. The group's findings, which are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, pave the way for a better evolutionary understanding of the most diverse group of organisms in the world. 'Amber is an extremely valuable tool for paleontologists because it preserves specimens with microscopic fidelity, allowing uniquely accurate estimates of the amount of evolutionary change over millions of years,' said author David Grimaldi, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Invertebrate Zoology and a world authority on amber and fossil arthropods. In the hit 1993 film, Richard Attenborough hires scientists use dinosaur DNA taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park. Even though arthropods are more than . 400 million years old, until now, the oldest record of the animals in . amber dates to about 130 million years. The newly discovered arthropods break that mold with an age of 230 million years. They are the first arthropods to be found in amber from the Triassic Period. These photomicrographs are of the two new species of ancient gall mites in 230-million-year-old amber droplets from northeastern Italy, taken at 1000x magnification. The gall mites were named (left) Triasacarus fedelei and (right) Ampezzoa triassica. Globules of fossilized resin are typically called amber. Amber ranges in age from the . Carboniferous (about 340 million years ago) to about 40,000 years ago. It is produced by myriad plants, from tree ferns to flowering . trees, but predominantly by conifers. The amber droplets, most between 2-6 millimeters long, were buried in outcrops high in the Dolomite Alps of northeastern Italy and excavated by Eugenio Ragazzi and Guido Roghi of the University of Padova. About 70,000 of the miniscule droplets were screened for by a team of German scientists. Two of the specimens are new species of mites, named Triasacarus fedelei and Ampezzoa triassica. They are the oldest fossils in an extremely specialized group called Eriophyoidea that has about 3,500 living species, all of which feed on plants and sometimes form abnormal growth called 'galls.' The ancient gall mites are surprisingly similar to ones seen today. 'You would think that by going back to the Triassic you'd find a transitional form of gall mite, but no,' Grimaldi said. 'Even 230 million years ago, all of the distinguishing features of this family were there—a long, segmented body; only two pairs of legs instead of the usual four found in mites; unique feather claws, and mouthparts.' The ancient mites likely fed on the leaves of the tree that ultimately preserved them, a conifer in the extinct family Cheirolepidiaceae. Although about 97 percent of today's gall mites feed on flowering plants, Triasacarus fedelei and Ampezzoa triassica existed prior to the appearance and rapid radiation of flowering plants. This finding reveals the evolutionary endurance of the mites. 'We now know that gall mites are very adaptable,' Grimaldi said. Life imitating art? Richard Attenborough in Jurassic Park, with (left to right) Laura Dern, Arianna Richards, Martin Ferrero, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill . Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Laura Dern and Sam Neill on the set of Jurassic Park in 1993. Now, it could become reality thanks to an Australian billionaire. 'When flowering plants entered the scene, these mites shifted their feeding habits, and today, only 3 percent of the species live on conifers. 'This shows how gall mites tracked plants in time and evolved with their hosts.' The third amber specimen, a fly, cannot be identified because, outside of the insect's antennae, its body parts were not well preserved. But now that the researchers have shown that amber preserved Triassic arthropods, they are eager to find more specimens. 'There was a huge change in the flora and fauna in the Triassic because it was right after one of the most profound mass extinctions in history, at the end of the Permian,' Grimaldi said. 'It's an important time to study if you want to know how life evolved.'","Insects are 100 million years older than .

Nokia has unveiled the handsets it hopes will help it take on Apple and Google in the smartphone war. The firm launched two new handset running Microsoft's software, and also unveiled a recharging 'pillow' that does away with the need to plug in a cable. However, the ailing firm saw its share price plummet before the announcement had even finished. Scroll down for video . Nokia's Lumia 920, which was launched today, is the phone the firm is banking on to help it take on Apple and Google. Phone expected to go on sale later this year, price TBC . 'This is the most innovative smartphone . in the world,' said Jo Harlow, Senior Vice President of Smart Devices, . as she held up the Lumia 920. 'This is Lumia, and it’s time to switch,' she told an audience in New York in a clear encouragement for users to desert their iPhone or Android handsets. However, investors seemed to disagree. Nokia's share price dropped by over 10 percent during the firm's announcement as investors remained unconvinced by the firm's mobile strategy. An hour after the event began the share price was down 11.48 percent to $2.51 per share, suggesting the tie-up with Microsoft was poorly received. The firm also revealed a midrange handset, the Lumia 820. Styled to match the current Lumia 900 flagship, the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 both have a glossy polycarbonate frame that’s light and described as 'comfortingly warm to the touch'. On the 820 the case is swappable for other colours. The screens (measuring 4.3ins on the 820 and a palm-stretching 4.5ins on the 920) are both pin-sharp and high-resolution. They even had a new app to offer effects like shop and restaurant names floating in the street as you look at the screen. Nokia also boasts they can be used with gloves on. Capacitive touchscreen displays respond to the electric conductivity in the human hand, so gloves have always been a no-no. The Lumia 920, however, has Super Sensitive Touch which is designed so you can use it with ski gloves on your hands. Nokia's Lumia 920 uses a pillow to charge, meaning no cables have to be plugged in . The Lumia 920 comes with wireless charging so you don’t need cables – just plonk it on a wireless charging mat like the Fatboy Charging pillow. Nokia is using a popular standard of wireless charging so that multiple devices will work with these chargers. When software updates, music and video can all be downloaded to the phone over the air, one day you may never need to plug it in. The Lumia 920 includes PureView technology – Nokia’s name for its camera system. The phone doesn’t match the 808 Pureview launched in the summer with its 41MP sensor and chunky profile, but at least this 8.7MP model is slim as a result. Jo Harlow stressed that the Lumia 920 uses 'revolutionary camera technology' that it’s claimed will collect between five and ten times the light of many cameraphones. 'It’s better than most digital SLRs,' she insisted. New camera software also made it easier to add extra effects as you shoot – very like Instagram. Jo Harlow executive vice president of Nokia introduces the new Lumia 920 phone with Microsoft Windows 8 operating system at a launch event in New York . There’s a very neat feature called Smart Shoot which is ideal when someone walks in front as you’re taking a shot. The camera takes multiple snaps and allows you to remove moving objects like a careless passer-by. Other effects allow you to add video elements to still shots and image stabilisation helps guard against blur. The Lumia 920 also has NFC – Near Field Communication – the contactless data system used in door entry systems and the London Underground’s Oyster cards. Though this technology has still to be widely used in mobiles, the plan is it will turn the phone into a wallet. It can also be used with suitable speakers and headphones to transfer music playback with one tap. The handsets revealed this afternoon are . slim, slick-looking devices with features to bring about the end of the . charging cable. They look great: eye-poppingly bright . with high contrast and deep blacks and vivid colours. The screen also . promises blur-free scrolling of text and improved visibility in bright . sunlight – something that defeats many smartphones. The big question remains – will all this . be enough to drag people away from Android and iPhone? The hardware is . certainly deeply attractive, the processor seems nimble and responsive, . the new screen is immersive and the camera has many neat features. But . Nokia may find the lure of the iPhone is hard to beat, especially with . the iPhone 5 announced next Wednesday. But just as important as the hardware is the software that powers the phones. Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system was launched two years ago as an alternative to the all-conquering iPhone and Android systems. But it has failed to dent their massive market share, capturing under 3 per cent of smartphone sales, according to research firm Gartner. So today’s launch also showed off the new version of the software, called Windows Phone 8. Microsoft’s mobile phone plans are dependent on the success of today’s launch, too. Windows Phone 8 is strikingly different from Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android systems. On the iPhone, to move from one app to another you need to quite one, return to the home screen and launch the other. It’s a bit like walking from your bedroom to the bathroom but having to go via the front door. With Windows Phone, the screen is populated with a ribbon of squares called Live Tiles which constantly refresh. So the People Hub shows your Facebook and Twitter contacts, say, while one with your personal details updates every time a relevant addition arrives, like a text message, status update and so on. Today’s announcement revealed more about the new version of Windows Phone, and Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer claimed today as an important . milestone, with a user interface that’s 'truly unique' in what he claims . will be 'the year for Windows'. The tiles are now resizable and capable of displaying more information such as how many messages are waiting from particular people in tiles dedicated to them. All 100,000 Windows Phone apps will work on the new phones, but some yet-to-be-released apps may utilise new features incompatible with earlier models. There are still dedicated Nokia Windows apps like a neat Nokia Drive program that turns the phone into a satnav with turn-by-turn directions but, unlike most others it works without costly data charges when used abroad. The sister app Nokia Maps now has maps which can be downloaded in advance, and also used without data costs. These apps can even calculate how long your commute will take. So you’ll have no excuse for being late. New today is Nokia City Lens, which adds Augmented Reality effects. Point the phone at a city street to see shop and restaurant names that seem to float in the air, overlaid on the display’s image. These highly attractive effects can also be used in the maps apps. Other new features include a much-demanded screenshot function, handy if you want to upload what’s on your screen to Twitter, say, or save the contents of the display so you don’t lose the information when going into a network-free area.","Share price dropped by over 10 percent during the firm's Lumia 920 announcement as investors remain unconvinced .

Clinging to the edge: Cavia intermedia (left), otherwise known as Santa Catarina's guinea pig, is only found on the small island of Moleques do Sul - which is only 26acres in size. Meanwhile, there are just 170 of these albatrosses - Diomedea amsterdamensis - on . their breeding spot of Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean . Ardeotis nigriceps: Hunted for food or sport, there are less than 250 left in Africa - and these are isolated in small groups across a wide area . They range from the Jamaican rock iguana - originally reported extinct, but now found to be clinging on with two small populations, to the suicide palm of Madagascar, which dies exhausted after producing tiny yellow flowers on a stem up to 5 metres (16 ft) long. Many on the list, such as the Ethiopia's liben lark, or the Seychelles . sheath-tailed bat, may not be as familiar to us as lions or whales, but each adds something to the planet which, once lost, is gone forever. The report, 'Priceless or Worthless?', says all the species need to be much better protected or face extinction by 2020. In the UK, a small area in Wales is the only place in the world where . the brightly coloured willow blister (Cryptomyces maximus) is found. Populations of the spore-shooting fungi are currently in decline, and a . single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction. Cryptomyces maximus occurs only on willows, as a weak parasite of twigs. In . this highly specialised habitat, Cryptomyces maximus does not seriously . threaten the tree. It produces extensive irregular black crusts below . the bark, characteristically surrounded by a bright orange or yellow . halo. When ripe and moist, the fruit body expands, breaking through the bark, and splitting the crust to reveal the fertile layer. Ascospores (sexually produced microscopic fungal spores) are released violently from this surface and are dispersed by the wind. Only four sites, on the North West coast of Wales, are known. The 124-page report will be presented at the . IUCN World Conservation Congress in South Korea this week, and hopes to . push the conservation of 'worthless' creatures up the agenda that is set . by NGOs from around the globe. Professor Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation at ZSL, said: 'Over half (of the 100 most endangered species) are receiving little or no attention. 'The donor community and conservation movement are leaning increasingly . towards a 'what can nature do for us' approach, where species and wild . habitats are valued and prioritised according to the services they . provide for people. 'This has made it increasingly difficult for . conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet. 'While the utilitarian value of nature is important conservation goes . beyond this. Do these species have a right to survive or do we have a . right to drive them to extinction?' Co-author of the report, ZSL's Ellen Butcher says: 'All the species . listed are unique and irreplaceable. 'If they vanish, no amount of money . can bring them back. However, if we take immediate action we can give . them a fighting chance for survival. 'But this requires society to . support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent . right to exist.' The IUCN said the report 'hopes to push the conservation of 'worthless' creatures up the agenda that is set by NGOs (non-governmental . organisations) from around the globe.' 'We need a fund to prevent extinction, resourced by governments, that is . in the billions, not millions,' the report said, without specifying a . currency. Measures such as an expansion of protected areas or hunting bans were particularly needed, it said. Antilophia bokermanni: In 2000, there were believed to be just 50 of these birds left in the wilds of Brazil. This increased to 250 - until a theme park was built in the region, decimating the population again . Psammobates geometricus has lost 97 per cent of its habitat, thanks to building work in South-Western Cape of South Africa . Baillie said people may have gone too far in recent years in judging . animals and plants by the economic value of the services they provide, . including food, medicine or as tourist attractions. 'We need to keep the appreciation for the wonderful diversity of life on . Earth as the key message, and then other utilitarian arguments have to . be additional,' he said. Governments agreed in 2010 to a plan to protect life on earth that . included the goal: 'By 2020 the extinction of known threatened species . has been prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those . most in decline, has been improved and sustained.' The IUCN said that all species had value. 'Although the value of some species may not appear obvious at first, all . species in fact contribute in their way to the healthy functioning of . the planet,' said Simon Stuart, Chair of the IUCN Species Survival . Commission. The list of the 100 most endangered species included others such as the Cayman Islands ghost orchid, and the Javan rhino. A ban on hunting had helped the recovery of the humpback whale, now . estimated to number 60,000. Captive breeding meant that Przewalski's . horse, once almost extinct, now numbered more than 300 in the wild from . Ukraine to China. The pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus) is one of the animals . facing a bleak future. Escudo Island, 17km off the coast of Panama, is . the only place in the world where these tiny sloths are found. At half . the size of their mainland cousins, and weighing roughly the same as a . newborn baby, pygmy sloths are the smallest and slowest sloths in the . world and remain Critically Endangered. Similarly, the saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) is one of the most . threatened mammals in Southeast Asia. Known as the Asian unicorn because . of its rarity, the population of these antelope may be down to few tens . of individuals today. In the UK, a small area in Wales is the only place in the world where . the brightly coloured willow blister (Cryptomyces maximus) is found. Populations of the spore-shooting fungi are currently in decline, and a . single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction. Professor Baillie said: 'If we believe these species are priceless it is . time for the conservation community, government and industry to step up . to the plate and show future generations that we value all life.'' Whilst monetising nature remains a worthwhile necessity for . conservationists, the wider value of species on the brink of extinction . should not be disregarded, the report states.","From a fungus in Wales to a guinea pig which lives only in a small 20acre patch in Brazil: Plea goes out to save the unknown 'at-risks' from extinction .

"By . Charles Walford . PUBLISHED: . 11:23 EST, 7 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:44 EST, 8 June 2012 . Thousands of commuters had their journeys thrown into chaos after blundering workmen flooded a Tube line with two million litres of water as they tried to fix a leaking pipe. Hundreds of passengers were stranded for up to two hours yesterday, before having to escape along the tracks. The chaos continued this morning, with the Central Line part-suspended and engineers desperately battling to reopen it for the evening rush hour. Nightmare scenario: Passengers became stranded in a tunnel after tracks were flooded with two million litres of water . Ordeal: Staff help a woman off the train after it became stuck in a tunnel when the tracks flooded . One of London Underground’s biggest safety scares ever was caused by Thames Water engineers. A senior Tube source said: 'We are usually to blame when things go wrong but this time we can put hand on heart and say, ""It wasn’t our fault guv"". It was 100 per cent down to Thames Water. 'This has caused one of the biggest safety scares ever. There was so much water pumping in that there were genuine concerns of a tunnel collapse or the water flooding along the tunnel and affecting other lines.' The crisis happened between Stratford and Bow stations at 1.39pm yesterday as workmen were lifting a 24in main to try to plug a smaller leak. But the above-ground pipe cracked, sending 440,000 gallons of pressurised water pouring down a ventilation shaft near Wick Lane. Today the beleaguered utility firm, which has frequently attracted Transport for London’s anger for its 'pointless' and badly co-ordinated road- works, admitted responsibility for a 'tricky' operation going badly wrong. A spokesman said: 'The pipe was encased in concrete and as the crew was working it broke.' Water from the burst caused signals to short-circuit and bring Central Line trains to a halt. Flood on the tracks: Passengers are helped from the tube tracks at Stratford, east London after they were stranded on a Central Line train . Thames Water, which boasts of its role as a supplier to the London Games this summer, now faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill after cars in streets and a housing estate near the Olympic Park were flooded. Transport for London will also expect compensation after services this morning were suspended between Leytonstone and Stratford, causing massive overcrowding during the rush hour. London Underground’s chief operating officer Howard Collins said the crisis was a 'nightmare scenario' for the Olympics, with just 50 days until the opening ceremony. He said: 'As the person responsible for operational readiness, this is obviously something I do not want to happen during the time of the Olympics.' One engineer told the Standard that water was flowing 'like Niagara Falls' onto the dual carriageway leading to the Blackwall Tunnel. 'I have never seen anything like it before,' he said. 'It was a massive incident. There was a river in the street.' Cars parked in Wick Lane were flooded up to their bonnets, while a housing estate that has been earmarked for an anti-terrorist missile system was also affected. Relief: Passengers including young children are glad to see daylight after being trapped in a tunnel . Resident Neil Midgley, 43, said: 'The gym, swimming pool and car park were closed due to flooding.' Tube passenger Kenneth Thurtell, 27, who was travelling from Holborn to Leytonstone, said: 'I spent four hours trying to get home. I felt suicidal, quite frankly. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like during the Olympics.' Jennifer Hazel, 38 — stranded at Mile End as she tried to get home to Leyton — said: 'If this is what happens when something goes wrong on a quiet day, then good luck during the Olympics.' The Central line is one of two principal Tube routes for the Olympics, with the Jubilee, connecting London’s heart directly with the Stratford stadium. Yesterday the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines each suffered two breakdowns, with the Jubilee suspended through central London. Two broken-down trains caused Victoria line delays. Thames Water, which has been heavily criticised for causing roads gridlock with its lengthy repairs, said: 'We were doing exploratory work on the pipe in Wick Lane yesterday having identified it as a potential weak point on the network ahead of the Olympics. 'This is a 24-inch pipe which is more than 100 years old and when we dug down to investigate a suspected leak, the earth around the pipe moved causing it to burst. 'This has highlighted how weak the pipe was and the potential for it to burst at any time, so we are glad we can now get it replaced before the Olympics. We're really sorry for the disruption that has been caused.'","Described as one of the Tube's 'biggest safety scares ever'

When Maia Norman pulled into the driveway of a Hollywood hotel ten days ago after a 3,000-mile rally across America, onlookers might have expected her to be greeted by her long-time partner Damien Hirst, the father of her three children and the world’s richest artist. Instead, the crowd of more than 150 journalists and car enthusiasts saw California-born Norman, 49, leap out of her black Dodge Charger – complete with Hirst’s skull design on the side – to passionately embrace debonair Tim Spicer, a former mercenary who is ten years her senior and has a controversial past. Today, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Hirst, who has a £215 million fortune, has been left ‘devastated’ after Norman confessed the affair to him in the last week of May, before leaving for America to take part in Gumball 3000, an annual ‘supercar’ road race. Item: California-born Maia Norman leapt out of her black Dodge Charger - complete with Hirst's skull design on the side - to passionately embrace debonair Tim Spicer, a former mercenary . The 47-year-old artist and his partner of 19 years are understood to have broken the news of their split to friends and confidants. It is unclear whether Norman will now move out of the couple’s main home, a 300-year-old Grade II listed farmhouse in Devon. Ten days ago, she grinned as she greeted 59-year-old Spicer, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Scots Guards who now runs Aegis Defence Services, a security firm that has won multi-million-pound contracts with the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan. The pair kissed tenderly outside Hollywood’s landmark Roosevelt Hotel before Spicer helped to unload bags from Norman’s vehicle. The scene was played out in front of photographers taking pictures of glamorous Norman and her three female team-mates, named ‘Team Mother of Pearl’ in honour of her London-based fashion firm. She embraced her lover for a second time before the pair walked arm-in-arm into the hotel lobby. One onlooker said: ‘They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.’ When approached and asked whether she was leaving Hirst for Spicer, Norman confirmed ‘yes’ before declining to speak further. Twice-divorced Spicer, the father of a teenage son, remained silent. A spokeswoman for Spicer later said: ‘He has no comment to make.’ One onlooker said: 'They looked incredibly comfortable and happy to see each other. You got the feeling this was the real thing, not just a fling.' The end of Hirst’s relationship will shock the art world, where it was considered one of the most stable, despite the couple never marrying. And Norman’s decision to replace Hirst with a one-time mercenary is certain to raise eyebrows further. In interviews to promote her fashion line, Norman told how she met Hirst in 1993 when she was dating his friend, art dealer Jay Jopling. Romance blossomed when she and Hirst bonded over their mutual lack of a father figure and humble beginnings – he in Leeds and she in Los Angeles. She said: ‘When I met Damien, he had a mattress on the floor of a rented room in a council block. We talked about art and books and he made me laugh.’ In the early days, she worked as his assistant, accompanying him to maggot farms and abattoirs to collect items he would incorporate into his art. Among his best-known works are a shark preserved in a tank of formaldehyde and a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million. Throughout the Nineties the pair led a hedonistic lifestyle, mingling with stars such as Elton John and Bono. Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt, a close friend, described Norman in her younger days as ‘absolute trouble in the best possible way’. Bond and Hirst bonded over their mutual lack of a father figure and humble beginnings. She initially worked as his assistant. One of Hirst's best-known works is a diamond-studded human skull that sold for £50 million . Talking about this period, Norman has admitted: ‘I punched him [Hirst] in the dark once. We were on mushrooms.’ Of their ‘quieter’ life post-children, she has said: ‘It’s complete role-reversal. He’s the cook and I’m the driver. He does cuddly stuff and I teach the boys to ride their quad bikes.’ They have three children aged 16, 12 and seven. Regarding their decision never to marry, Norman has said: ‘We both come from divorced families, which doesn’t exactly boost your faith in the institution.’ Hirst’s love rival’s background is as colourful as the artist’s works. Spicer has been described as devastatingly charming and the ‘doyen of action men’. At Sandhurst, he won the Sword of Honour in 1976 for most promising cadet. Throughout his Army career, and particularly in Northern Ireland when he commanded the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, he inspired great loyalty in his men. For his service in Ulster he was awarded the OBE. Serving in the Falklands, he earned the nickname ‘Tumbledown Tim’ after narrowly avoiding an exploding shell on Mount Tumbledown. After leaving the Army in 1994, he set up a military company, Sandline International, and came to public prominence in 1997 when he was paid £22.5 million by the government of Papua New Guinea to suppress a rebellion. Arriving back in Britain, Spicer told how he was detained by a breakaway element of the country’s defence force and had a pistol put to his head several times. Hirst, pictured with his famous shark in formaldehyde, has a £215-million fortune. He has been left 'devastated' after Norman confessed the affair to him in the last week of May . A year later he hit the headlines again during the arms-to-Africa scandal. Spicer was accused of shipping weapons to Sierra Leone in breach of a UN embargo. It led to his London home and the offices of Sandline – which  he set up with fellow mercenary Simon Mann – being raided by Customs & Excise. Spicer has said: ‘I was doing something that I believed, both publicly and privately, to be in the public interest and I had had extensive discussions with government representatives. ‘You can imagine that it was pretty irritating to be treated like a criminal.’ He always denied that he or Sandline did anything illegal. Sherborne-educated Spicer, who has a son by his second wife, Caroline, chronicled his exploits in a book, An Unorthodox Soldier: Peace And War And The Sandline Affair. When it was published, he said: ‘We can help stop the killing in Sierra Leone and Rwanda when nobody else is prepared to do it for political or logistical reasons. But, of course, we are also a private commercial organisation, so we do expect to get paid for putting ourselves in harm’s way.’ His post-Army career has made him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams and he enjoys the spoils of success: fine wine, fat cigars, shooting in Scotland. ‘I’m not a danger junkie,’ he once said. ‘I like doing active things, but I’m equally at home pottering about in an art gallery.’ In 1999, Spicer left Sandline and three years later set up his current military company, Aegis Defence Services. After the Iraq war, Aegis won a £153 million US government contract to help secure the country and protect aid workers and officials. However, a Pentagon audit found that it had failed to  provide adequate weapons training or properly vet guards. A 2007 article in Vanity Fair dubbed him ‘Iraq’s Mercenary King’. Further contracts in Afghanistan and elsewhere have taken the firm’s earnings from the US government to £275 million. While her new boyfriend is rich, Norman is potentially walking away from a vast property portfolio. It includes the £3.5 million farmhouse in Combe Martin, North Devon, set in 24 acres; a houseboat in Chelsea; a house in Thailand; and a beach home in Mexico. Then there is Toddington Manor, a magnificent 19th Century Grade I listed 300-room country pile in Gloucestershire. It has been under renovation since Hirst bought it in 2005 and it is where he intends to  display his private art collection, including works by Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol. It is unknown how Spicer came into Hirst’s orbit but neighbours in Devon have speculated he could have helped to arrange the security guards who monitor the entrance to Hirst’s home. One resident who has met Hirst socially said: ‘He pays top dollar and that buys loyalty. He treats his  people well but if they breathe one word about any aspect of his life then they know it’s potentially a sackable offence. He’s a hands-on father. He cooks the kids’ meals, takes them to the beach. I can always tell when he’s home because I spot his helicopter coming in to land.’ Friends of Hirst say he has accepted that his partner’s relationship with Spicer is serious and, while devastated, he is determined to maintain cordial relations.  A source said: ‘The welfare of the children is their main priority.’ In a recent interview to promote a current retrospective of his work at London’s Tate Modern, Hirst said: ‘When you are young, you’re invincible, you’re immortal, or at least you think you are.’ He added: ‘I’m getting older. I’m not the mad bastard shouting at the world any more.’ Sadly, it is a world that he is now facing alone.","Maia Norman, 49, confirmed to reporters she is leaving Hirst for former mercenary Tim Spicer .

Sitting on a fence and drinking Guinness, just two days ago David Cameron was back chillaxing at the pub where he left his eight-year-old daughter - and this time he remembered to take her home. Obviously happy about having a Sunday drink, the Prime Minister was snapped in the garden of the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, where in a blunder two months ago he had driven off without his eldest Nancy. Mr Cameron was there with wife Samantha, and children Nancy, Arthur, six, and 22-month-old Florence, just a few miles from his country residence Chequers. Full view: Mr Cameron, seen in the background, was surrounded by friends and his children earlier this month . In a casual shirt, trousers and trainers, Mr Cameron is pictured standing surrounded by friends, children and his staff, including protection officers. Rambler Robert Stone spotted Mr Cameron and decided to grab a picture when he and his wife stopped for a well-earned drink. 'We were about a quarter of the way through them and I turned to my missus and said, ""That's David Cameron"". He put down his rucksack and his missus turned up with the kids and it was clearly him,' he told the Mirror. 'There were some adults and a few more kids who sat near where we were sat and Mr Cameron was sat on the fence drinking his pint of Guinness.' Yesterday it was revealed David Cameron mistakenly left his daughter in the pub and only realised she was missing when he . arrived back at Chequers. Family atmosphere: Mr Cameron stands by a Land Rover at the pub where families were enjoying drinks . Packing up: Samantha Cameron collects belongings at the pub after drinks in its garden . As they went to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them. The . Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the . pub, with protection officers in one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their . other children in another. Mr . Cameron presumed that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she . thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister. An insider said: 'It was a case of ""Oh crikey I thought you had her"" and ""Oh crikey I thought YOU had her.' A spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened. Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy. ‘Thankfully . when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman . said. ‘The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’ When . Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub he found his daughter happily . helping the pub staff. It is understood she had been left by herself for . 15 minutes.

The World Health Organisation is investigating the cause of a mystery disease which has killed at least 60 children under seven years old, within 24 hours of them being admitted to hospital. The children had been admitted to hospitals in the capital, Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap in the north since April with high fevers and signs of encephalitic or respiratory symptoms, or both. Most were under three years old, and all the children affected were under seven-years-old. Many of the children who suffered from the disease died in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh (pictured) The World Health Organisation said the mystery disease has affected children in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, as well as the Siem Reap province (pictured) The WHO said all but one of the 61 children admitted had died, with 'rapid deterioration of respiratory function,'. 'At this point in time, the cause and source of the disease in Cambodia is still under investigation,' it said in an email to Reuters. It said it was investigating with the Cambodian health ministry and other partners. The mystery illness has swept through parts of Cambodia just three months after a separate disease which medics also struggled to identify, was found in east Africa. The condition known by locals as the 'nodding disease', turned children into a zombie-like state across northern Uganda, Sudan and Tanzania. Some children with 'nodding disease' discovered three months ago are abandoned by their families because they are too difficult to look after . Children suffering from the 'nodding disease' condition are withdrawn and have no interest in eating . The condition gets progressively worse and can cause affected children, generally aged between five and 15, to fall and injure themselves. The UN agency said in a report on 30 June that the clinical signs 'appear unusual,' with patients suffering from fever and a rapid deterioration of respiratory functions, although platelet counts, liver and renal functions were found to be normal. No other hospital patients or staff in Phnom Penh had fallen ill with similar symptoms, the report said.","Most of those who died were under three years old .

Mr Kraft bizarrely enters the audition after Ms Lander introduces herself with a wink, and reads lines alongside her. ‘Hi, you were really good up there,’ he begins. ‘I didn’t mean that in a sexual way, not that it wasn’t erotic.’ Ms Lander puts a hand up to her face, and says, ‘I am so embarrassed.’ All the while, she wears a half-smile and keeps her other hand firmly planted on her hips. ‘No offence,’ she says, ‘but I get guys like you in my classes all the time.’ Scene two: In the next take, Lander takes offence at Kraft's character asking for a lap dance . Planting a punch: Kraft 'punches' the other man in the scene while Lander reacts . The scene goes on, with varying degrees of acting prowess, until a change in scene in which Mr Kraft, in character, asks for a lap dance. ‘Sorry, not now,’ she says. ‘Sweetheart, I don’t know who this loser is,’ Mr Kraft says, gesturing to the other man, ‘but I’ve dropped a lot of cash here. I’m a Yahoo exec.’ When the other man pretends not to know the business, Mr Kraft yells, ‘F*** you, p****!’ before throwing a fake punch. The 32-year-old’s acting credits, which begin in 2006, include small, often unaccredited and typecast roles on shows like The Class and Ugly Betty, where she plays ‘Stunning Woman’ and ‘Model,’ respectively. In 2008’s Iron Man, she plays a sassy flight attendant who offers Robert Downey Jr's character a drink of hot sake, and more recently, she was seen as a Servant Faerie on the HBO series True Blood.

Love triangle: Katie Gilmore, pictured, has admitted she played her two lovers off against each other . The women at the centre of a love triangle with a Doctor Who actor today claimed he had ordered hitmen to murder his rival before he was killed. Former prostitute Katie Gilmore, 27, was having a relationship with actor Gary Suller, 45, when he was allegedly murdered in his home in Pontnewydd, Cwmbran, south wales, by her lover Barry Bowyer. Bowyer, 38, from Croesyceiliog, has admitted burglary and manslaughter but denies his murder. Today Miss Gilmore, who admits playing both men off against each other, claimed it was Mr Suller who was so jealous he hired men to kill his love rival Bowyer. She told Cardiff Crown Court: 'I blame myself for Gary’s death. I played them off against one another. 'He knew for a long time that I had been unfaithful to him. Gary was jealous and would do anything to stop me seeing Barry. 'I was told he was going to pay three men to murder Barry. Barry was in the bath when they kicked the flat door down and attacked him. 'He lost so much blood and should’ve died.' Mr Suller, whose roles included small parts in Doctor Who and Casualty, met Ms Gilmore in a brothel in 2010. Ms Gilmore said: 'He was infatuated with me and bombarded me with flowers, wrote lover letters and promised to look after me financially.' The court heard family members hoped MS Gilmore, who took Valium at the age of seven, smoked cannabis at nine and began using heroin aged 11, would clean up after she started dating Mr Suller. Tragic: Father-of-two Gary Suller, left, had hired hitmen to kill his love rival, right, before he was himself killed in . a bitter love triangle over Katie Gilmore, Cardiff Crown Court was told . But Ms Gilmore claimed Mr Suller had . encouraged her to take drugs and one occasion following her release from . prison had driven her to a dealer’s house. She also claimed Mr Suller was a pimp, . saying a piece of paper that police found in his home with girls’ names . on it was a list of prostitutes he 'picked up' for jobs. In love: Miss Gilmore said Barry Bowyer, who has admitted manslaughter, is the love of her life . The jury also heard details about how Ms Gilmore and Bowyer had met during a drug rehabilitation programme in September 2010. She told the jury: 'He got me off heroin and prescription drugs. He’s the love of my life and will love him until the day I die. 'With Gary, my drug addiction escalated and increased. He had an unlimited supply of money.' But the court was told how Bowyer's head 'became screwed up' after Ms Gilmore continued to flit between Bowyer and Mr Suller. Four days before Mr Suller died, Bowyer wrote a letter to Ms Gilmore speaking about how he had felt manipulated. He wrote: 'If you loved me you would . have the decency to tell me the truth. I’m your bitch and I have got to . take it or simply lose you. 'You know this very well and play it . to your advantage. When I first met you... [I realised] you were a . dangerous lady who would bring me life or death.' The court heard Bowyer broke into Mr .

For the sign has been voted the hand gesture most likely to irritate us. Irritating: A model performs the . inverted speech marks hand gesture intended to display irony. It was voted the most annoying nonverbal communication of all time . Talk to the hand! The Americanism was voted the second most annoying gesture, while the 'none of your business' nose-tapping sign was the third most irritating . Blah, blah, blah: Making an imaginary mouth with the hand is the fourth most annoying thing to do when talking with people, according to a survey of 2,000 people . Second place in the poll – which . didn’t include obscene gestures – was the American-style ‘talk to the . hand’ signal, intended to stop someone speaking to you.

Rounding off the top five was ‘the pistol’ – where two fingers and thumb are used to form a gun. The research found that a quarter of us actively try to stop ourselves using gestures. But not all hand signals received the . metaphorical thumbs down. Wiggling an imaginary pint glass to ask for a . drink or shushing someone with a finger to your lips were seen as . useful. It was also found that the average . person uses four hand gestures a day, yet one in five feel embarrassed . at how often they rely on them.

The most irritating gestures also . included the traditional ‘call me’ motion, where the hand is used to . represent a phone; putting the fingers to the eyes to signify ‘I’m . watching you’; ‘zip it,’ where a person pretends to zip up their mouth . to tell someone to stop talking; and rubbing fingers and thumb together . to denote cash. A spokesman for iPhone game Goggle .

"By . Martin Delgado . PUBLISHED: . 18:54 EST, 14 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:54 EST, 14 July 2012 . Private messages: Mr Justice Mostyn is accused of making 'disobliging remarks' One of the country’s top judges has caused controversy by making disparaging private remarks about a barrister involved in his own divorce battle. Mr Justice Mostyn criticised Charles Howard QC, who represented the judge’s former wife during their acrimonious split. He made the comments after Mr Howard appeared before him at the High Court in an unrelated divorce case involving Mark and Jennifer Evans, who were battling over their £50 million fortune. Following Mr Justice Mostyn’s remarks, Mr Howard pulled out of the case – and warned that his withdrawal would have ‘serious consequences’ for Mrs Evans in her legal fight. Mr Howard also suggested the judge’s comments were motivated by a ‘personal animosity’. It is not known exactly what Mr Justice Mostyn said to upset the QC. But court papers show that Mr Howard claimed the judge ‘remarked disobligingly’ on his conduct and that of London firm Hughes Fowler Carruthers, who are also on Mrs Evans’s team. After the comments, which were made in messages to Mr Justice Mostyn’s ex-wife Lucy on April 5, Mr Howard and his team withdrew from the case. Mr Howard said this left Mrs Evans ‘without representation in relation to the finances’. Following an appeal, Mr Justice Mostyn’s £26 million settlement  in the Evans case was set aside  by the president of the family division of the High Court, Sir Nicholas Wall. At the time of the controversial remarks, Mr Justice Mostyn and Lucy were still thrashing out their own divorce, which was finalised in May. It caused shockwaves in the legal world in 2010 when Mr Justice Mostyn left his wife of more than 30 years for divorce lawyer Elizabeth Saunders. Mrs Saunders’ alcoholic husband Mark, who was also a barrister, was shot dead by police marksmen in 2008 after he drunkenly fired a shotgun from the couple’s £2 million Chelsea home. The extraordinary discord between Mr Justice Mostyn and Mr Howard was laid bare in a written submission to the court made by Mr Howard, supporting Mrs Evans’s attempt to block her divorce being finalised until a  ruling has been made on how much she should receive. In his submission, Mr Howard stated: ‘The remarks were later described to the wife [by her solicitor] as “indicating that Mr Justice Mostyn had personal animosity towards Charles Howard QC, my firm, and possibly me”. Still waiting: Jennifer Evans, left, and her estranged husband Mark, right . ‘As a result of the actions of Mr Justice Mostyn .  .  . she [Mrs Evans] will be placed in a materially  different position at the retrial, namely that she will be an ex-wife of the husband. That might have serious consequences for her.’ The Evans case received widespread publicity last week when Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Thorpe accused the couple of ‘almost puerile’ behaviour. Mr Evans, 47, and his wife, 46, were penniless when they wed in 1985 but made a fortune from a computer software company. They separated in July 2010 and in April last year, she was awarded assets of £26 million. But as a result of Mr Justice Mostyn’s ruling being overturned in May, they are still waiting for the courts to decide how their financial assets should be split. Mr Justice Mostyn was nicknamed ‘Mr Payout’ because of the huge settlements he obtained as a divorce lawyer for celebrity clients such as Sir Paul McCartney. His own divorce was finalised on May 8. Mr Howard withdrew from the Evans case on April 17, according to his submission. He has since returned, however, and last week represented Mrs Evans in her Appeal Court bid. A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office, which represents judges and magistrates, said an agreement had been in place since July 2011 which meant ‘there would be no conflict of interest’ if Mr Justice Mostyn heard other cases which involved ‘the solicitors and barristers acting for Lady Mostyn in their divorce proceedings’. The spokesman added: ‘The private remarks about Mr Howard and Hughes Fowler Carruthers were made after he had heard and given judgment in the case of Evans v Evans.’ Mr Howard and Hughes Fowler Carruthers declined to comment.","Mr Justice Mostyn criticised Charles Howard QC .

David Cameron has ruled out George Osborne giving up his political strategy role to focus on being Chancellor. Despite fierce criticism of Mr Osborne for grim economic figures, the Prime Minister told colleagues that Downing Street and the Treasury working hand in hand was a ‘strength, not a weakness’. But Lord Ryder, a former Tory chief whip, has claimed both men are ‘obsessed with management of 24-hour news’ and called for there to be a ‘full-time’ Chancellor. Rivals: Vince Cable says he would 'probably' make a good replacement for George Osborne, right . Conservative backbencher Brian Binley . said he would ‘rather George concentrated on running the economy’ and . Nadine Dorries, a persistent backbench critic of the party leadership, . called for Foreign Secretary William Hague to be made Chancellor. Senior Government sources said the . idea that Mr Osborne would be moved from the Treasury in a September . reshuffle was ‘completely absurd’. Mr Cameron is also determined that the Chancellor should not step back from helping decide political tactics. ‘It is a strength, at a time of . economic crisis, to have a Chancellor who regularly attends meetings at . Downing Street,’ said one ally of the Prime Minister. George doesn’t . have some second job doing strategy so there is nothing for him to give . up. He and David have always been very close, and they work in lockstep, . which is a strength of this Government. ‘Look back to Blair and Brown if you . want an example of what happens when a prime minister and a chancellor . work against instead of with each other.’ Mr Cameron is however expected to . appoint a powerful new party chairman in the autumn, with housing . minister Grant Shapps favourite to take the job. The current chairman, Lady Warsi, is . tipped to be made International Development Secretary or Northern . Ireland Secretary in the reshuffle. Vince Cable, who prompted uproar on . Wednesday night by agreeing he ‘probably would’ make a good replacement . for Mr Osborne, yesterday denied pushing for the job. Knives out: Nadine Dorries, right, has said that George Osborne should be sacked for the good of the country and the Conservative party . Rivals?: David Cameron and Nick Clegg walk with Vince Cable and Chancellor George Osborne . Tipped: Darling of the Tory party William Hague has been touted to take the Chancellor's job should George Osborne go . Vince Cable, who prompted uproar on . Wednesday night by agreeing he ‘probably would’ make a good replacement . for Mr Osborne, yesterday denied pushing for the job. ‘We are part of a team, we have a . collectively agreed policy, and I’m delivering on my bit of it, which . centres particularly on the area of industrial strategy, and I’m not . proposing a radically different approach,’ said the Liberal Democrat . Business Secretary. ‘I would be building on what George . Osborne has already achieved.’ Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, . meanwhile, also rejected the suggestion he could be in line to take over . as Chancellor. Lord Ryder, who was John Major’s chief . whip in the 1990s, insisted: ‘He [Osborne] can’t be de facto chairman . of the Conservative Party and Chancellor at the same time.’ He claimed Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron . were ‘obsessed with management of 24-hour news, they are news editors, . news managers, they are no strategists’. The partnership formed between David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne is a strong one. Not only are they from privileged backgrounds and former members of Oxford's infamous Bullingdon Club, they have stuck together ever since both reached the ranks of the Tory party. They are so close they made one another godfathers to each other's children. Mr Osborne was campaign manager for David Cameron's leadership campaign in 2005. They have worked side by side ever since. But in 2009 the Prime Minister was asked if he would sack his friend if things were going badly, despite their firm friendship. 'With George, the answer is yes,' he said, 'He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there.' In 2010, when asked again he said: 'Yes. He is a good friend, but we’ve has that conversation a number of times over the past four years. To be fair to George he said ""If ever you want to move me to another job, it is your decision and it is your right"".' And following intense pressure from his own party, it appears that Mr Cameron may soon face the toughest decision of all - whether to fire his friend to protect his own career. ‘It is important the Chancellor steps . away from the immediate picture and tries to build a bigger one,’ he . added. ‘The Treasury deserves the Chancellor to be there on a full-time . basis and to ensure it develops a proper economic strategy.’ Following official figures showing the . economy has slumped by another 0.7 per cent, Mr Osborne won a welcome . boost when the head of the international economic watchdog, the . Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, gave his . strategy unequivocal backing. Angel Gurria, in London for the . biggest investment conference ever held in the UK, urged Britain to . persevere with austerity measures that have helped deliver record low . borrowing costs. ‘You are now sowing the seeds of what . will be the elements for recovery,’ said the OECD boss. ‘You have to . have credible public finances before you start moving on growth.’ Mr Osborne, speaking at the event in . London’s Lancaster House, insisted he had a relentless focus on the . economy: ‘We’re dealing with our debts, we’re creating the most . pro-business tax regime in the developed world, and we’re making the . long-term structural reforms to secure a more productive future.’ At the same conference, Mr Cameron . vowed to ‘finish the job’ of deficit reduction, despite calls to change . course in the face of the worst double-dip recession in half a century. He said there was no question of . abandoning the ‘tough decisions’ it had made. ‘Be in no doubt,’ he said. ‘We will finish the job.’ The Prime Minister said ministers were . making the reforms needed to make Britain competitive, including . shaking up the planning system and investing in infrastructure. But he faced tough questions from . international business leaders, who voiced concerns that the Coalition’s . immigration cap could be a barrier to recruiting the best staff. Pledge: Speaking at the British Business Embassy conference in London this morning, Mr Cameron said the Government was trying top drum up business, a day after figures showed the country's economy is in a deeper recession than previously thought . Damning: Since the Coalition took over in Q2 of 2010, GDP, despite encouraging initial figures, has shrunk by 0.3% overall . After a dire day yesterday George Osborne and pressure to resign he has received a welcome boost. The head of a major international economic organisation, who urged the Chancellor to 'persevere' and 'stay the course'. The . support came from Angel Gurria, right, secretary general of the Organisation . for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), who said austerity . being imposed in Britain  now was 'sowing the seeds of what will be the . elements for recovery'. The . OECD chief told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I would say to the . Chancellor ""Stay the course"", I would say to the Chancellor that the . cost of wavering or looking like you are wavering or looking like you . are weakening your resolve today because of what is happening in the . markets - because of Spain and Italy and Greece and everything else - is . very high indeed. 'I . think we have to give very strong signals here, and the Chancellor, the . Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are all really quite intent . in staying on course and staying on message. 'This . is very important, this is why the UK adjustment programme cleared the . markets, this is why you have very low borrowing costs, this is why I . think you should persevere. 'You . are now sowing the seeds of what will be the elements for recovery. You . have to have credible public finances before you start moving on . growth.' Mr Gurria, will today meet Mr Osborne at a global investment conference at London’s Lancaster House. He . rejected suggestions that the Chancellor’s growth schemes had failed, . saying: 'The programmes need time to produce results... I think we . should give it time.' And . he dismissed speculation that the double-dip recession was putting the . UK’s coveted Triple-A credit rating at risk: 'I don’t think that’s the . case. References to that were not made by rating agencies. 'I think what the rating agencies are looking for is consistency and coherence and that today is at a very big premium. 'They are the first ones who will turn on you if they see you are not performing.” Mr Gurria agreed with Mr Osborne’s analysis that UK growth had been held back by the crisis in the eurozone. 'If . the neighbourhood is in such bad shape then predictably, because this . is a large open economy which is dedicated to exporting, it will have an . impact,' he said. 'You can’t be isolated, you can’t vaccinate yourself against the weakness of your major trading partners.' But Labour say he is wrong. Labour Treasury spokeswoman Rachel Reeves said: 'It would be very unwise of George Osborne to take false comfort in the assurances of the head of the OECD. His loyal support for the Government today is the exact opposite of what his deputy has been saying for over a year and what the IMF said last week.'","Nadine Dorries is the first Tory to speak out .

Holidaymakers visiting a beach where at least 1,000 bombs have been found called yesterday for the sands to be closed to the public until the missiles have been removed. Unsuspecting families were sunbathing on what has been dubbed Bomb Alley Beach as experts prepared to blow up more of the Second World War ordnance which tumbled out of the cliffs three-quarters of a mile away during a landslide on Saturday. Fifteen controlled explosions were carried out on Sunday by the Royal Engineers, less than 24 hours after the rockets, grenades, and 20lb bombs were spotted by a dog walker at Mappleton, East Yorkshire. A bomb disposal team has been called in to an East Yorkshire coastal landslip that revealed hundreds of Second World War munitions . The weapons, including rockets, mortars and 25lb (11kg) shells, could take days to clear . The missiles had buried themselves in . the earth cliffs after missing their target when the area was used as a . practice bombing range from the war until the early 1970s. Although many are practice rounds . they still contain explosive detonators and coastguards fear they may be . highly volatile after being buried in the cliffs for so many years. A cordon was lifted yesterday morning . by Humberside Police who planned to seal off the beach again when the . tide went out and the clear-up operation could resume. Families heading for the beach yesterday morning said they had no idea there was any danger. Joyce Nicholson, 65, who was with her . grandson Jack, 11, said: ‘I did not know anything about this.

Cori Angelique, from the Netherlands, . who planned to take children Bella, five, and Lany, three, to the . sands, said she was also unaware anything was wrong. Retired publican Steve Poppleton, 72, . who lives near the beach, said: ‘I have seen a few bombs at odd times . but never anything like this.’ Humber Coastguard has warned the public to avoid the area and said anyone finding anything should dial 999. A dog walker stumbled across the . deadly find on Saturday afternoon but the emergency measures were only . put into place yesterday when the tides allowed full checks of the . beach. The fins of many of the bombs have been left sticking out of the mud and rock which has fallen onto the beach. With . holiday crowds flooding to the coast, coastguards are warning visitors . thinking of grabbing a souvenir that the bombs may be 'highly volatile' and capable of 'causing serious injury or worse'. Coastguards say the odd item of explosives often turn up in dribs and drabs after being embedded in the cliffs for decades. But over the weekend, a landslip caused by the combination of heavy rain and coastal erosion exposed at least 1,000 weapons. Coastguards say that most of them are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosive to cause terrible injuries. A 24-hour guard has been placed on the beach by Humberside Police amid fears that children may be tempted to pick up a 'trophy' during the school holidays. An Army Bomb Disposal team from North . Yorkshire’s Catterick Army Base has also been called in to clear the . beach over the next few days. The . Army experts are hoping to remove some of the smaller items for some . will have to be blown up on site in controlled explosions, Humber . Coastguard said. Danger: Coastguards say that most of the devices are probably dummy or practice rounds – but they still contain enough explosives to cause terrible injuries. The devices include rockets and mortar bombs . They include rockets, mortar bombs and 25-pounder bombs which were all fired into the cliffs by RAF aircraft during the war years and have been there ever since. Mike Puplett, watch manager at Humber Coastguard, said: 'It’s an old firing range from World War Two and an area where we do get explosives and grenades. A bomb disposal officer holds one of the explosives revealed by the landslip at Mappleton beach . 'When the cliff sinks it is a fairly regular occurrence that we get one or two. But there has been a fairly significant landslide occurred due to the erosion and bad weather which has caused it to slip. 'It is a conservative estimate of more than 1,000 items, a mixture of explosives. It is going to take two to three days if not longer to transport the less harmful explosives out of the way while those which are more dangerous or live are detonated in controlled explosions.' There was no evacuation of the beach which was empty at the time of the landslip, he said, adding that the Coastguard were notified at 1.30pm on Saturday. The beach can be approached along the sands from Hornsea or down a cliff top path but both points of access have been cordoned off. 'The explosives have been fired into the cliff for target practice during bombing runs in World War Two,' Mr Puplett continued. 'Most are practice rounds but the Army have advised us that the amount of explosives even in Low Explosive rounds make them highly dangerous to handle. 'Because they have been in the cliff so long they may have become volatile and dangerous after being expose to the fresh air. 'They have actually fallen in the landslip down onto the beach and are sticking out of the mud and rock and sand. The East Riding beach of Mappleton, near Hornsea, was used as a practice bombing range during the Second World War . 'Because there is such a great number of them what we do not want is people wandering around picking up the odd trophy to put on the mantel piece. 'They are all highly dangerous and should not be touched at all.  It is highly dangerous at the moment. I am no explosive expert but the Army have told me these things could cause serious injury if not worse and even Low Explosive rounds are dangerous. 'Even the dummy or practice rounds have some explosives in them. Anyone who finds anything like this should dial 999.' Police said they located several hundred old shells, some measuring approximately 15ins long with fins on them on the beach, which lies just below the village of Mappleton. The shells were found along the shoreline on Saturday at 4.45pm by a dog walker who called police. Humberside Police said unfortunately due to high tide the area could only be partially checked by officers, and subsequently the shells were located by Bomb Disposal officers on Sunday. The EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) from Catterick were asked to attend at 12 noon, and carried out approximately 15 controlled explosions on the beach. Other devices were removed by MOD staff at Leconfield, near Beverley, and further devices remain in situ, which are not considered an immediate risk, to be dealt with today once the tide is low again. Cordon: . Fifteen explosions were carried out at the East Riding beach of . Mappleton, near Hornsea, after a dog walker stumbled across the arsenal . yesterday which has been embedded in the cliffs for more than 60 years . Weapon: A missile shaped bomb found after being embedded in the cliffs for decades . Insp Mark Coulthard, of Humberside Police, said 'Although not live munitions, they do pose a danger as they have flash charges in them. 'I would advise any member of the public finding such an item to ensure that they leave it alone and phone the police to notify us, so that we can arrange the necessary measures to make them safe. 'On no account, should any person pick these items up and take them home. 'The likelihood of more finds is high, as coastal erosion washing away some of the cliffs, and unearths more munitions.'","Bad weather led to ground movement which exposed the huge arsenal at Mappleton, East Riding .

"Ed Balls has said George Osborne risks permanently damaging the economy . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:43 EST, 29 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:33 EST, 29 July 2012 . Chancellor George Osborne has been accused of permanently damaging the economy. The UK could suffer a triple dip recession next year . Britain could suffer a triple dip recession next year because of the ongoing Eurozone crisis. Leading economists have warned a Greek exit from the EU could plunge the UK into financial chaos next Spring, following a brief recovery from the Olympics. The triple dip would be unprecedented and could threaten Britain's AAA credit rating. The news will no doubt pile more pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who has been criticised for making too many cutbacks and crippling Britain's ailing economy. Azad Zangana, from leading investment company Shroders, said he believed the country's GDP would increase by 0.5 per cent in the current quarter. He predicted it would continue to grow until March before two consecutive quarters of negative growth, he said to the Sunday Times. The growth predictions come following the shocking 0.7 per cent decline in the country's GDP which was announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week. Michael Saunders from Citigroup said he believed the GDP would only grow by 0.3 per cent in 2013 and confirmed the risk of a triple dip recession. 'My guess is that for the next few quarters, after a technical bounce in the third quarter, the economy will be roughly flat, which I would describe as a disastrously bad outcome compared with previous cycles,' he said. These GDP figures show how the economy has changed since 2007 . Vince Cable, left, is being invited to create a new national consensus on the economy by shadow chancellor Ed Balls. It is hoped the move will drive a wedge between him and George Osborne, right . Meanwhile shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Osborne's refusal to change the Coalition's budget meant he risked permanently damaging Britain's economy. He said in an interview with the Independent on Sunday that Mr Osborne's . Ed Balls has said George Osborne risks permanently damaging the British economy . approach of a 'sit on your hands strategy' was dangerous and would leave families and businesses paying a 'long-term price'. Mr Balls also said it was wrong for the Government to sit and hope that the Olympics would save the country from recession. 'As the IMF (International Monetary Fund) said last week, the long-term impact on the underlying strength of the British economy will be more young people unemployed and businesses investing in other parts of the world,' he said. 'All of those things add up to an economy which ends up permanently weaker, not just temporarily weaker.' He also appealed to business secretary Vince Cable to join him in creating a new way forward for the economy. Mr Balls invited the Lib Dem to joine him in a 'new national consensus' which would put Britain on the right track because its what the 'country needs and deserves'. 'I would love there to be a new national consensus on the right way forward, and I would love the Lib Dems to want to be part of that.' The move will no doubt drive a wedge between defecting Lib Dems and the government. Concerns for the Eurozone crisis have also deepened following rumours that Spain is considering asking for a £235 billion bailout. However, officials have denied the reports.",Ed Balls has said George Osborne risks permanently damaging the economy .

A devout Catholic mother, her 11-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter have been found shot dead in their home in what police suspect was a murder-suicide - while her businessman husband read downstairs. Officers arrived at the large house in the affluent suburb of Glendale, Missouri after 11 a.m on Monday and found the bodies of Cathy Murch and her children in different parts of the home. Investigators believe Mrs Murch shot her children before turning the gun on herself, Glendale police Sgt. Bob Catlett said. Torn apart: Mitch Murch II, right, told police he heard a gunshot and found his wife, second right, and their two children dead . The victims’ husband and father, Mitch Murch II, had alerted authorities after finding the bodies. He said he thought the gunfire was 'coming from outside, so he ran to his front door and saw that his wife was laying in the kitchen, his son was laying in a side room and his daughter was on a bed in the second story of the home,' Catlett told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Yellow crime tape cordoned off the family's $520,000 four-bedroom home, which is located on what one neighbor described to Fox2Now as the 'primo street in Glendale' – an affluent community about 10 miles from St. Louis. People close to the family said the parents were devoted to their children and the Catholic Church, and that the mother never showed signs of mental illness. Site of tragedy: The Murches lived in a well-appointed two-story brick house situated on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Glendale . Devastating scene: The body of Cathy Murch was discovered on the floor in the kitchen, while her children's bodies were found in a side room and in a second-floor bedroom . Sad sight: When first responders arrived at the house, they found Mr Murch performing CPR on his fatally wounded son . According to police, the father called and reported one gunshot at 10:57 a.m. He then called back sometime later and told a dispatcher that his wife was dead and he thought it was a murder-suicide. When EMS arrived on the scene, they found Mr Murch performing CPR on his 11-year-old son, Mitch Murch III. The boy and his sister, Mary Claire, were taken to area hospitals where they were pronounced dead. Cathy Murch was pronounced dead at the scene. Police recovered a weapon from inside the home, but said no apparent suicide note was found. Mitch Murch II has been taken to police headquarters, where he is being questioned. However, he was not named a suspect. Neighbors who gathered outside the . family's home surrounded by a manicured lawn and nestled in lush . shrubbery and flowers were shocked by the scene. Happier times: People who knew the Murches described them as devoted to their two children and their church . Hidden problems? The Murches' acquaintances described them as devout Catholics who seemed happy, although one person said the mother appeared distraught just days before the tragedy . 'We . have a very nice neighborhood; no problems at all, but then you hear . this and it hurts that this close it happened,' Phillip Henderson told . the station KMOV. Henderson . and his wife, Pat, said their neighbor talked to Mrs Murch just days . before the incident and something seemed not right. 'She . did say she recently talked to the mother and asked well how are things . going, she said, ""Ugh, well you know"",' said Henderson. 'So maybe . something's going on there she didn't know.' The family was involved at Mary Queen of Peace Church in nearby Webster Groves, where the mother helped parents of incoming students in the parish elementary school where her two children went. The father also headed an anti-abortion initiative called the Respect Life Apostolate at the church, and the pastor said the family appeared to be a happy one. Killed: Young Mitch was found shot in a downstairs room while Mary Claire was found dead upstairs . Picture perfect: Friends and relatives flocked to an impromptu prayer service for the family on Monday night where they expressed their shock at the deaths of Cathy, left, Mary Claire, right, and young Mitch . Rev. Bob Reiker added: 'We’re just trying to piece it together and come to grips.' Following the tragedy, the church staff . said in a statement: ‘We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic . loss of life involving a family in one of our parish communities. 'Mary Queen of Peace Pastor Fr. Bob . Reiker and Associate Pastor Fr. Craig Holway are working with grieving . family members and the MQP parish family to cope with the aftermath of . this tragedy.' Since December, Mr Murch has worked . in business development for a St Louis building services and cleaning . firm, Centaur Building Services; his LinkedIn page names him the 'Growth . Guy'. He has also previously worked as vice president to facilities management firms, and for Mitch Murch's Maintenance Management - a facilities company founded by his father and run by his brother. Mrs Murch trained as a nurse and . aided with clinical trial research. She was working as a Treatment . Educator at Special Design Healthcare, according to her LinkedIn page. Religious: The Murches were involved in Mary Queen of Peace Church, where the husband headed a pro-life initiative . Strong connection: Both Murch children attended the Mary Queen of Peace parish school where their mother helped parents of new students . Hundreds turned out for an impromptu hour-long prayer service at Mary Queen of Peace in Webster Groves held for the family on Monday night. Rev. Bob Reiker thanked the crowd during the service, adding: I thought we'd have maybe a dozen people or so. 'But this is proof how much people in our community care. May the Lord be with Mitch and his family and all those who are grieving.' Craig Avery and his children attended the service and knew the family; Avery said his children attended camp with Mary Claire last week.

The former cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students has spoken out after more internet slurs have been made against her to say she is 'not the female Sandusky'. Sarah Jones, former high school teacher and captain of the Cincinnati Ben-Gals cheerleading squad, is accused of sexually abusing a student and unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual activities. Despite prosecutors putting a request to the court for a gag order to stop her talking about the case, Jones told ABC today: 'I read on a blog that I was the female . [Jerry] Sandusky. To read those things and not be able to comment, not . be able to stick up for myself is not fair. Scroll down for video . Not fair: Sarah Jones spoke to ABC about being called the female Sandusky which she said is really hurtful and not true . She said of her mother Cheryl Jones: 'It's almost kind of a guilty feeling that she is even involved in this because what has happened to her is not fair. My goal is for her charges to be dismissed' 'People don't know the real me. There's blogs and postings out there that I have slept with numerous people. I married my high school sweetheart. 'I just asked the general public to maybe hold their judgment a little bit longer until the truth comes out.' Jones went on her lawyer's radio show earlier this month to speak about the charges against her. She also appeared on the Today show and spoke of how she was dying inside. Prosecutors asked the judge for a gag order on Monday to stop her from speaking out so much about the case so the 'truth could come out in court'. Leland Hulbert, spokesman for the Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney's Office, said: 'We won't be sending out motions, we won't be going on radio shows. You will be hearing our arguments about the evidence in court.' The judge said she would make a decision in the coming days. Struggle: Sarah Jones, a former NFL cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students, previously spoke to the Today show to reveal her daily struggle dealing with the accusations . Last November, the married . 27-year-old Dixie Heights High School teacher was arrested and charged . with the offenses as was her mother, Cheryl Jones, who was accused of . tampering with evidence in connection with her daughter's case. Sarah . Jones resigned from her position. Both pleaded not guilty in April, . when they were joined by dozens of supporters in court, including the . alleged victim's family. 'The hardest thing has been having not only me go through it, but to have my mom go through it with me. 'It's . almost kind of a guilty feeling that she is even involved in this . because what has happened to her is not fair. My goal is for her charges . to be dismissed.' Jones is currently under house arrest. Earlier this month she again dispelled the claims as mere rumors and admitted she was dying inside because of them. 'I'm taking it day by day,' she said of the charges. 'Sometimes I take it minute by minute.' When asked how she was coping and if she . was 'dying inside,' she added: 'Yes, I am. I call my parents on a . regular basis and I say, ""What can I do just to get through just this . minute?""' Jones, a five-year veteran of the NFL's Ben-Gals cheerleading team, refused to discuss the details of the case, only saying the rumors were started by the alleged victim's bitter ex-girlfriend. 'Just because it’s a rumor, it can be very disruptive to a career,' she said. She admitted there were 9,000 pages of photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student, but it 'does not mean that every single page has something that is going to prove this case'. 'Torture': Jones, pictured with her mother Cheryl, said she looks at every article written about her . Accused: Jones was head cheerleader and five-year veteran of the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals . 'Rumours': She also taught high school English but quit last November for 'personal reasons' Case: The prosecution said it has 9,000 pages of photos and messages between Jones and her 'victim' Arrests: Jones, left, was charged with sexual abuse and her mother Cheryl, right, has been charged with covering for her daughter by asking a witness to 'destroy' a phone allegedly containing evidence . Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a 'slut' with 'two STDs'. When she emailed the site to plead they take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with Bengals players. Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have to do.'

Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts today announced that she is taking a medical leave for her bone marrow transplant, but will be gone longer than initially expected. Roberts, who was not supposed to take her leave until late August or early September, announced last month that she has MDS, a blood and bone marrow disease once known as pre-leukemia. She told viewers today: ‘A full disclosure here – I’m not feeling too well. In fact, I’m going to leave and let you all do the rest of the program on your own. I’ll see you in a couple of weeks.’ In time: Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts, pictured on Monday, announced that Tuesday was her last day at the show until after her bone marrow transplant, scheduled for late August . Filling in: Lara Spencer, second from right, will help fill in for Roberts in the top-rated morning show . She later said on her Twitter account that the additional time off was to prepare for her bone marrow transplant and to have some time away. She also wrote: ‘Momma needs a vacation! Going to finish strong!’ Though she said she was feeling ill, the long-time host looked spectacular just a day before in a knee-length orange Michael Kors dress, pumps by Jimmy Choo, and jewellery by John Hardy. In her absence, the top-ranking morning show will be hosted instead by Amy Robach and Lara Spencer, according to The Hollywood Reporter. And during her absence from the ABC morning show, she'll be getting a little help from her friends in the news business. Roberts, 51, listed Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric among her 'wonderful, wonderful friends at ABC News' who will be subbing for her. Others mentioned: talk-show host Kelly Ripa and panellists from the ABC talk show The View. So long for now: Robin Roberts called it a 'terrific Tuesday,' and reiterated that she was taking time off ahead of her already scheduled medical leave . Last week, the ABC anchor told reporters gathered for the Television Critics Association conference in Beverly Hills, California, that her leave would 'most likely' start at the end of August or early September. 'It's fascinating-slash-scary how to prepare yourself for something like this,' she said, appearing by satellite from ABC's studios in New York. And when asked how she's feeling, she replied, 'I do go through moments of fatigue.' But citing the continuing resurgence of Good Morning America against its long-dominant NBC rival Today, she brightened. A little help from my friends: ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer, right, and bubbly variety show host Kelly Ripa, right, will fill in during Roberts' absence . Blonde ambition: Katie Couric, seen speaking at a panel last week, will also help host . 'The run that we've had has truly energized me,' she said. 'It's pretty good medicine, I gotta say, to be taking!' In particular, ABC was crowing Thursday that, for the first time in 17 years, GMA had seized first place among total viewers (almost 4.6 million vs. 4.25million for Today) as well as tying Today for first place in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic, each with 1.74million. ABC News President Ben Sherwood was inspired to frame the victory in Olympic terms. 'For 852 straight (weekly) races, the Today show won the gold medal, going back to 1995,' he said. Then, several weeks ago, GMA snapped the Today winning streak, 'and stood there alone for the first time in 16 years to get its own gold medal.' 'And after 879 weeks running behind in younger viewers, 25-to-54,' Sherwood went on, 'GMA' is 'standing there at the gold-medal podium, unbelievably in an actual statistical tie with the previous champs.'","Good Morning America host diagnosed with pre-leukemia last month and left ahead of scheduled time off, saying she wasn't feeling well .

Facebook has been dealt yet another blow as three of its top executives have announced they are quitting the social networking company. Director of platform partnerships, Ethan Beard, director of platform marketing, Katie Mitic, and mobile platform marketing manager, Jonathan Matus, have handed in their resignations.

Resignations: Three more Facebook execs have quit, including director of platform partnerships Ethan Beard (left), and Katie Mitic (right), director of platform marketing. Both are starting new ventures . Their announcements - shared on their Facebook pages - come after the high-profile exits of chief technology officer Bret Taylor in June, and Open Graph product manager Carl Sjogreen last month. 'It is with mixed emotions that I'm . letting you all know that I've decided to leave Facebook to seek my next . adventure,' Beard wrote on his Facebook page. 'I'm exceptionally proud of the team . we've built and the work we've done and I'm incredibly enthusiastic . about the future of Facebook... and know that I'm leaving it in the good . hands.'

I'm so grateful to have met, . learned from and worked with the incredible people here.' Out the door: Jonathan Matus (left), Facebook's mobile platform marketing manager, has also handed in his resignation. It comes two months after Bret Taylor (right), chief technology officer quit . Farewell: Facebook's director of platform products Carl Sjogreen, pictured unveiling the social networking site's Timeline Apps in January this year, left the company in June . The resignations, which come as Facebook struggles with plummeting share prices, will only serve to rattle the company further. It lost a staggering $157 . million in the second quarter of this year and saw shares, which were . released in a highly-anticipated IPO in May, fall to $20.72 from their . $38 starting price. Last week, shares hit an all-time low of $19.82 after the company posted its disappointing earnings. Facebook's initial valuation has plummeted from $100 billion to $43.5 billion, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw his personal fortune collapse from $13.7 billion to $10 billion over the last fortnight. But the company has defended the drain of talent, pointing out that new employees are joining the company on a weekly basis, which constantly helps the development of ideas. 'We're fortunate to have many, many . talented people join the company each week, and we believe this will . serve us well over the long run,' Facebook spokesman Larry Yu said in a . statement.

Plummeting: Last week, Facebook share prices hit an all time low of $19.82 - down from its original $38 . Social-media analyst Greg Sterling warned that Silicon Valley is rife with start ups, and many Facebook employees are going on to begin their own companies. 'Start-up junkies get restless after a . few years,' Sterling told USA Today. 'This is not a . time to lose top talent. That is Facebook's challenge.' These fledgling departures are definitely true of Facebook; Beard worked at the company for four years, yet Mitic was there for two years and Matus only lasted one. Mitic and Matus likely received stock before the IPO and will keep it despite their departures; they could be betting the stock will not gain so much value over the next couple of years that they will miss out on a large payout, USA Today reported. Concerns: These latest resignations of top-ranking employees will only serve to shake Facebook further . While Facebook has suffered devastating losses, the day most investors are bracing for is November 14, when more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for trading. The imminent lock-up expiration also means that Wall Street analysts who participated in the Facebook IPO will once again go quiet, for a 30-day period, potentially creating more uncertainty. 'The sentiment on this thing is so negative,' said Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony. 'I think this thing may continue to tick down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately may not show until third-quarter earnings.'","Director of platform partnerships Ethan Beard and director of platform marketing Katie Mitic quit last week 'to start new ventures'

Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio . A housemate of the victim testified on the sixth day of Drew Peterson's murder trial that former Illinois policeman once broke into their shared home in SWAT gear and threatened his ex-wife at knife point. 'I could kill you and make it look like an accident,' Kristen Anderson reportedly testified Wednesday of the words Peterson related to Kathleen Savio during that chilling episode in the long-running saga. Only moments before rendering that crucial bit of testimony, Anderson broke down in sobs on the stand - and had to be ushered out of court. Meanwhile, Judge Edward Burmila,handed the prosecution a key victory in allowing Anderson's account of that fateful night, since it is hearsay - which is typically not admitted during trial proceedings. Anderson never actually heard Peterson articulate the knife-point threat to Savio, who was found dead in her bathtub in 2004, but said that the victim told her about the incident after it occurred. Burmila initially appeared as if he would bar jurors from hearing Anderson's account, but then did an about-face, as the usually mild-mannered Will County State's Attorney prosecuting the case implored him to admit it. 'This evidence should have life!' shouted James Glasgow to the judge. The jury was not in the room at the time. Earlier days: Former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson talks to the media as he leaves his home in Bolingbrook, Illinois in 2007 . Another judge who had formerly heard portions of the case previously barred the same testimony from being admitted at trial. The . ruling is especially important, as legal observers have long noted the . dearth of actual physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death, . despite the preponderance of hearsay suggesting he did, indeed, kill . her. Defense attorneys . tried gamely to rebound from the stunning ruling, which an . obviously-thrilled Glasgow characterized to reporters after Wednesday's . proceedings as, 'historical' and a crossroads in the case. During . cross-examination, defense attorney Joe Lopez raised his voice, . pressing Anderson repeatedly about why - if she now found aforementioned . threat so unsettling - she didn't move out of Savio's house. You . didn't move out, did you? ... You did nothing ... because you didn't . believe her, that's why,' The Associated Press reported Lopez shouting . over the objection of angry prosecutors. 'Sir, no one listened to Kathy,' Anderson added later. Meanwhile, . retired Illinois State Police sergeant Patrick Collins told jurors he . permitted Peterson to sit in on his official interview of then-wife . Stacy - who notably provided the former policeman with an alibi for the . day of Savio's death. Peterson married Stacy, who has also disappeared, . after divorcing Savio.. Collins said he made the unorthodox decision because Peterson asked that he be allowed to do so as, 'a professional courtesy.' Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide . The . retired state policeman then regaled the jury with an account that . overtly suggested the accused manipulated Stacy Peterson's answers to . his questions regarding where he was on the day of Savio's death.' 'He sat very close to Stacy as we proceeded to ask questions,' Collins recalled. 'She was very distraught.' 'There was one particular question . where he did have to refresh her memory,' Collins recalled, according to The Chicago Tribune. 'He leaned over to Stacy and said, 'You remember . what you cooked for breakfast.' He said, 'bacon' or 'sausage' and that . was it.' Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . 'She became shaken . and started to cry,' Collins said. 'And (so) we shut the interview . down.' He said he did not interview her again. Stacy Peterson, who police presume . dead, initially provided Peterson with an alibi, but later changed her . tune to confide in friends that she believed her husband had, indeed, . killed his third and former wife, Savio.

A football referee made history last night by becoming the first woman to officiate an NFL game. Shannon Eastin served as the line judge for the San Diego Chargers' 21-13 preseason victory over the Green Bay Packers, making her the first female referee in the NFL's 97-year history. All went well on the night for Eastin, who was only selected because an ongoing dispute with regular referees meant the NFL had to draft in replacements. Wearing Number 27 on the back of her black-and-white striped uniform and with her hair tucked under her cap, Eastin seemed dwarfed by the players, but remained calm as she made history within the San Diego stadium. Run to it: Shannon Eastin takes her place on the field during an NFL preseason football game between the San Diego Chargers and the Green Bay Packers . The 42-year-old, who is from Arizona, also seemed to get the thumbs up from the coaches for her performance on the night. 'She was confident and in control,' said Chargers coach Norv Turner. Packers coach Mike McCarthy added: 'I thought she did a good job of . communicating. I was focused on the . Packers, but there was communication before the game.' Though she wasn't involved in many calls until late, Eastin appeared to stay steady among the giants and worked well alongside her seven-man crew. The trailblazer got her shot at making history as a replacement official following a dispute between the NFL and the regular referees, who are now locked out. The disagreement marks the first time in 11 years that the NFL has had to draft in replacements, who are scheduled to work 16 games over the weekend. Hearing of the decision to use Eastin for last night's game, the locked out NFL Referees Association said that she should be barred, because she once took part in a World Series of Poker tournament. The NFL has strict rules on its employees taking part in gambling. History in the making: Line judge Shannon Eastin has become the first woman in the NFL's 97-year history to officiate a game .

Minute by minute: Eastin checks her watch during the game . Regrouping: The trailblazing referee waits for the ball . However, the league vetted and accepted Eastin for the game and it seems she does have all the credentials to take her place on the NFL field. She has 16 years' of experience and works as a referee in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I's Football Championship Subdivision. Eastin joins a small group of women to crack the officiating ranks at the highest levels of sports. Violet Palmer, one of Eastin's inspirations, began officiating NBA games in 1997 and is still in the league. Bernice Gera became the first woman to . work in baseball's minor leagues, serving as an umpire in a New . York-Penn League game in 1972. Pam Postema umpired major league . spring training games in 1989 and, thanks to a push by commissioner A Bartlett Giamatti, made it up to Triple-A for six seasons. But she was fired . a few months after Giamatti's death. She filed a sex discrimination suit . against the baseball organisation and settled out of court. A multiple national judo champion as a child, Eastin also  owns a company called SE Sports Officiating, which trains officials in football and basketball. Just before the game, Eastin seemed to fit right in and appeared relax as she chatted with the other officials, members of the chain crew and players. Chargers tackle Jeromey Clary and . linebacker Antwan Barnes sought her out, shaking her . hand and saying a few words before she ran down the sideline for the . first time. She spent most of the first half . straddling the line markers and keeping track of the time, without much . action on her side of the field. But things picked up in the second . half, when she had to break up a small skirmish between players and . whipped her flag to the middle of the field for a holding call late in . the third quarter . Eastin heard a few boos early in the . fourth quarter from the hometown fans for a pass interference call on . San Diego's Corey Lynch -- a call she appeared to get right -- and later . signaled touchdown when Green Bay's Marc Tyler dived in from one yard . out. She also gave a . touchdown signal on a one-yard run by San Diego's Curtis Brinkley and . was on the spot for a fumble recovery by the Chargers near Green Bay's . bench in the closing seconds, although she did not have to climb into . the pile to make the call. Charges . coach Turner said afterwards: 'I think it's exciting for her. It's the . first female official ever in the NFL.

Failing eyesight: Dr Turner Waddell, 90, drove the wrong way along the A30 and crashed into Neil Colqhuhoun's car, killing him . A 90-year-old driver with failing eyesight, who caused a fatal car crash with another car while driving on the wrong side of the road, was given a nine month suspended sentence today. Retired doctor Dr Turner Waddell took a wrong turn on the A30 between Hook and Basingstoke in Hampshire, and ended up travelling south on the northbound carriageway. About a mile down the road, he . smashed into Neil Colqhuhoun’s Vauxhall Vectra, killing him as his car . collided with another vehicle and burst into flames. The day before the accident, Waddell had . visited a doctor who reported that Waddell's eyesight was below the legal driving standard but did . not tell him not to drive because he assumed Waddell was not driving, . Winchester Crown Court heard. Horrified drivers told police how they had flashed their lights and hit their horns in an attempt to warn Waddell as he drove his Volvo at 60mph in the wrong overtaking lane on March 11 last year. Mr Colquhoun had just passed a car in the overtaking lane while another car in front of him moved into the inside lane . when Waddell’s Volvo came around a bend and the collision occurred. Mr Colquhoun’s car then hit another a BMW convertible and burst into flames. He was killed instantly by the collision and not the . flames, the court heard. Waddell . and his wife, who were on their way to the theatre in Basingstoke from . their then home in Andover Down, Hampshire, were also seriously injured . and dragged from their smoking car by other motorists. One dead: Dr Waddell travelled south on the northbound carriageway for about a mile at 60mph before colliding with Mr Colqhuhoun's car (left). Waddell's car is on the right . Killed: Mr Colqhuhoun died after Waddell collided with his car on the way home from work . The man, who had a clean driving . licence, had also suffered a subdural haematoma he was unaware of before . the accident and had been confused prior to the crash. The prosecution accepted this could have affected his judgment on whether he should drive. He had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing. In . mitigation Charles Gabb said: ‘For a man who has dedicated his life to . saving the lives of others, to be instrumental in the taking of one is a . shattering blow for him.’ Road markings unclear: Prosecutor Neil Sawyer told the court it was unclear how Waddell made the wrong turn but said road markings were 'adequate but could have been better' A third vehicle: After Waddell hit Mr Colqhuhoun's car, it hit a silver BMW convertible (right) travelling in the same direction before it burst into flames . Neil Sawyer, prosecuting, said: ‘It’s . not clear how the defendant came to be on the wrong side of the road as . his recollection of what happened is hazy.’ The barrister explained the best . possibility was that the doctor had turned the wrong way at what is . known locally as the Red Lion Pub junction onto the A30 where the road . markings although ‘adequate, could have been better’. These road markings have since been improved, the court was told. Mr Gabb explained that on at least six other occasions, motorists had been confused by the road markings at the junction and had gone the wrong way - including in daylight - and that it was lucky no one else had been injured. He said: ‘At first blush you think this is a case of an old man not paying attention but there is a fundamental problem here.’ Should not have been driving: Mr Colqhuhoun's family, (from left) brother Ross, mother Patricia and father Les Colquhoun appeared outside court today. Patricia said their son's life had been 'cruelly robbed' Mr Gabb said Waddell, who had to be helped into the dock by his granddaughter and was using a zimmer frame, had found it difficult to come to terms with what he had done. He said: ‘Having spent all his life in the service of others, the last thing he wanted to do was a result such as this.’ Confused prior to crash: Waddell was unaware that he had suffered a subdural haematoma which caused him confusion before the accident . Even so, the court heard that Waddell, . now living in Porthcawl, near Bridgend, ignored no entry signs, road . markings and the flashing lights of other motorists and drove for more . than a minute on the wrong side of the road. Judge Keith Cutler suspended the sentence for two years and disqualified Waddell from driving for life. He said that Waddell’s eyesight was very worrying and added that if there was a message to come out the tragedy it was that doctors and relatives ‘look very, very carefully whether elderly people can drive’. Speaking outside court, Mr Colquhoun’s mother Patricia said that the doctor should not have been behind the wheel. She said: ‘When a driver reaches 70 all that he or she has to do is complete a form to say that they are medically fit and a driving licence is issued for another three years. ‘Though I acknowledge that there are many safe elderly drivers on our roads there are some who are not, and families are sometimes too afraid to confront their elderly relatives as to their failing abilities. ‘Through this lack of foresight my son, who had a wealth of friends and family who loved him dearly, and who had just started a new job with such high hopes and plans for the future, has been so cruelly robbed.’ Waddell moved to Wales to be near his wife, who has dementia and he visits her every day. Shattered: As he was driven from court today Waddell is said to be shattered by his actions after dedicating his life to helping people .","Dr Turner Waddell drove south on the northbound A30 carriageway for about a mile before the crash .

Wearing a fluorescent jacket and chopping wood with an axe, the man in this photograph may look an unlikely star as he carries out his community service. But this photograph captures the moment when a young drug dealer facing a grim future turned his life around and began his journey to becoming an Olympic champion. Only nine months after this picture of Anthony Joshua was taken, the 22-year-old won a gold medal in the boxing ring at London 2012. Learning the hard way: Anthony Joshua chops wood at an allotment in North London in November last year while completing his community service. Nine months later, he was an Olympic champion . Joshua, born in Watford, Hertfordshire, to Nigerian parents, won the Olympic super heavyweight title by beating Italian Roberto Cammarelle in front of 10,000 fans at the ExCeL centre. It was Team GB's 29th and final gold at the Games. Joshua was suspended from Britain's boxing squad after he was arrested for possessing cannabis and intent to supply the drug in March last year. He appeared destined for jail but a judge gave him a second chance and he was sentenced to a 12-month community order and 100 hours’ unpaid work. Joshua posted the picture of him chopping wood on his Twitter account last November after he worked at the North Finchley Allotment in London, close to the Finchley Amateur Boxing Club where he trains. Champion: Boxer Anthony Joshua celebrates after winning the gold medal in the men's super heavyweight division at the ExCeL centre in London . Gill Saunders, secretary of the North Finchley Allotment Society, said: 'We remember him very fondly. We knew him as Josh though. “He was extremely popular and charming. He was a good steady worker and kept his head down, which is unusual on the scheme, because we get a lot of difficult, reluctant people. 'He never picked on anyone or bullied any of the other people on the programme, which can happen.' Small groups of offenders help out at the site, carrying out maintenance work, clearing paths and gardening. The scheme has been running for two years and has been credited with transforming the site from a state of neglect to a thriving community allotment. Ms Saunders said: 'He (Joshua) was very engaging and got on with everyone, you could tell he had something about him, something different. 'He was modest and self-effacing but also had a sort of personal invincibility that all good boxers have, without being cocky. Changed fortunes: Joshua has turned his life around after being convicted of possessing cannabis with intent to supply . 'One funny thing I remember, was when we got him to sort out the woodpile and he was wielding this massive axe, but he was useless at chopping. 'We teased him that he had all these big muscles but he couldn’t do it. 'He was very good at taking a joke though. We taught him in the end.' Joshua has admitted that the community service and the shame felt by his family, friends and his boxing colleagues at his conviction helped convince him to change his ways. ‘I could have seen it as a badge of honour,’ he said earlier this year. ‘I could have taken the rap, seen it as a slap on the wrist and done it again. But I didn’t. It wasn’t so much the actual charge that had the effect. Prize fighter: Anthony Joshua, wearing the blue vest, lands a blow on his way to winning Olympic gold at the ExCeL centre in London . 'It was all the grief afterwards, from my friends, from my family – especially my mum – and from boxing. ‘I was just like a lot of young lads. It was all about how I looked, my clothes, clubbing, girls. I wasn’t with the best group of people. ‘The arrest changed a lot. It forced me to grow up and to respect my responsibilities. ‘I’m not happy that I did what I did and there’s no way that kind of thing will ever happen again, but in a way I’m glad it did because it woke me up. ‘I go running on Saturday nights now, not clubbing. I understand that if I’m to fulfil my potential then it’s all about hard work. 'It took me a while to realise this, but since last March I’ve never looked back. And you know what? I’m so much happier as a person, too.’","Photograph shows boxer chopping wood on a London allotment nine months before he became Olympic champion .

Poised on the diving board  in the tiniest of trunks, he could not have looked in better shape. But Tom Daley nearly missed out on a medal because sweets and ice cream were making him too fat, he revealed yesterday. The 18-year-old, who won a bronze medal in the diving on Saturday, had to go on a diet to be in with a chance at the Olympics. So he cut out his two vices, losing more than a stone. Achieved his dream: Bronze medallist Tom Daley of Great Britain poses with the national flag after the medal ceremony . After a shaky performance last night Daley was ecstatic to claim bronze . Jumping for joy: A relived Tom Daley jumps in front of the media cameras . Daley started his new regime after his . coach, Alexei Evangulov, the director of British diving, said his . Chinese competitors were ‘working three times harder’ than him and he . would have to take his diet more seriously. ‘At the beginning of the year he was . saying I was fat,’ Daley said after winning his medal. ‘I’ve lost seven . and a half kilos (1st 3lb). I can’t wait to go and eat what I like!’ Daley, who began competing in . international diving championships when he was 13, said he had started . putting on weight after he stopped growing. ‘When you get to a certain age you can’t get away with eating like a growing kid,’ he said. ‘It got to the stage where I just . needed to cut out the sweets, cut out the not so good stuff, and then . cut down a little bit on portion size so that I got down to my fighting . weight. ‘I made sure that I was eating healthy . balanced meals, which I was anyway but just cutting out the snacks in . between. 'I love ice cream just generally, any flavour, I used to have . one every weekend, so that’s the main thing that I had to cut out. 'It’s . worked out for me. I was glad I did it.’ Tom Daley put in a strong performance to win bronze in the 10m platform diving final, ultimately missing out on a gold medal by the slimmest of margins . Here we go: Tom Daley is thrown into the pool after winning his bronze medal . Well earned splash: Daley celebrates in the pool with teammates after winning a bronze medal . The roar from supporters as they screamed, clapped and cheered whenever he appeared on the platform seemed likely to raise the roof . But after returning to the athletes’ village following his victory, the first thing he did was ditch the . diet. ‘I had a tub of chocolate ice cream,’ he grinned. Hours earlier Daley leapt into the pool in delight after it was announced that he had won bronze in the individual diving. He dedicated his medal to his father . Rob, who died last May from a brain tumour, saying: ‘I really wish my . dad was here to see me do that performance, because we had such a long, . tough journey together.’ At a press conference yesterday, Daley added: ‘The bronze was really a gold for me after the tough 18 months I’ve had. Tom Daley pictured with his father Rob Daley who died in May last year, said he wanted to do his proud . ‘I’m over the moon that I’ve come home with a medal, it was something I’ve worked so hard for since I was a young kid.’ In his father’s last few days, Daley would hold his hand and tell him how much he wanted to do him proud at the Olympics. But he cut short just one training session throughout his father’s long illness – on the day he passed away. That was exactly as his father would have wanted it. Realisation: Daley gestures to team GB after he realizes he has won a medal in the Men's 10m Platform Final diving competition . As his scores were displayed on the board they waved Union flags and chanted 'Team GB, Team GB' Even after undergoing surgery, Daley . senior cooked breakfast for his sons, drove them to their various . training sessions and waved a giant Union Jack at the poolside every . time Tom competed. Following his father’s death, however, . Daley came under fire from critics – including his coach – who said he . was spending too much time promoting his lucrative sidelines instead of . training. In February, after a poor performance, Evangulov went public . with his anger. ‘Nobody will listen to me,’ he said. ‘If Tom stopped all his media work now, I might be able to get him up to . the third-best diver. Winner: Tom Daley of Britain settled for the bronze at 556.95 after leading going into the final dive in front of a raucous home crowd . Worrying: It was a tricky start for Britain's poster boy - his first dive ended with a splash and he was scored a 75.60. Tom Daley and coach Andy Banks complain to an official regarding a re-dive after flash photography from spectators interfered with his dive . 'I don’t mind what he does if he gets the medal. He can become a rock star.’ While Daley’s success this weekend . will help to silence his critics, it seems unlikely to stop his . ambitions outside diving. There are already rumours that he has signed a . deal with an independent production firm to launch his TV career. ‘Going into TV presenting is actually . what I want to do when I finish diving or maybe alongside diving,’ he . said yesterday. ‘But I don’t know what’s going on to be honest. ‘I haven’t had any meetings with my . management people since the Games so I don’t know what they’ve got . planned for me but I’d be excited to try something like that in the time . that I’ve got off.’ And, of course, there’s Rio. ‘An .

But this camera's owner surely takes the prize for being the most forgetful photographer. Atmospheric photos offering a snapshot into life in post-war Britain have been discovered on a vintage camera that has survived against the odds for sixty years. The find was made by Emma Jacks of Southend, Essex, when she snapped up an old Rex camera which had been donated to a charity shop in her home town. Kodak moment: One of the photographs from the camera shows this smiling couple . Peek into the past: Emma Jacks from Southend, Essex is desperate to the find the boy in this picture . After splashing out a measly £3 for the camera, she was intrigued to find it still held an undeveloped film. The 23-year-old took the camera to a local company who warned her that it was highly unlikely that any pictures would even survive the development process. But Emma was thrilled when she returned to find that six black and white images dating back to the early 1950s had survived. Although some of the photos from the roll of film were too blurry to see, the six remaining provide a nostalgic flashback of how life was in post Second World War Britain. On your bikes! This surviving picture shows a green and pleasant Britain which cyclists enjoyed . Bucolic: Despite being a little blurry, this snap shows what appears to be a village cycling race, watched by keen spectators . And what makes Emma’s find even more special is the fact that an undeveloped film left on a camera normally survives a maximum of 20 years before it is rendered useless. The pictures feature a couple enjoying a day out in the countryside, smiling as they pose for the picture. Another image shows a young boy of about eight - most probably the couple’s son - stood in shorts and a polo neck shirt. Rolling green fields, undisturbed skylines and a village watching a bicycle race portray an idyllic, quiet life - one that is a far cry from the urban lifestyles many lead today. The photos were taken in the Essex area as one picture shows Southend Pier. Now Emma hopes that she might be able to trace the young boy who she hopes will still be alive today, believing he would now be retired. She said: 'When I took the camera home from the charity shop I saw there was a roll of exposed film so I put it in for developing. 'The developers were very dubious about whether anything would still be on there and the chap said ‘I doubt anything will come out due to its age but let’s give it a go’. One for the album: The rolling hills of Britain are showed in this snap, where two cows peacefully chew grass . Memory lane: One of the old photographs showing Southend Pier - a typical British seaside resort . 'I was just interested to see if anything would come out and amazingly six really clear pictures were on there. 'I don’t know who was more surprised, me or the man from the shop. Snappy Snaps, Southend' In a bid to trace the people in the photos Emma posted two of them on Twitter. And although no-one has come forward yet, a local historian came back to her to say that the photos, based on the fashions as well as the houses in one of the images, date back to the early 1950s. They don't make them how they used to: Emma with her lucky find . Two of the images show a bike race in action- one with four young men lined up at the start whilst the other is captured mid-race. The final photo is of two cows stood in a field. Emma added: 'The one of the bike race has the most historical information in it because you can see the council homes in the background and can see what people were wearing at the time. 'But, I am really hoping that the little boy might still be alive today and will get in touch when he sees the pictures, that really would be lovely - he would be into his 60s by now. It would be amazing to hear from him.' Emma, who works as a digital retoucher on modern photos, has a large collection of vintage cameras.","Idyllic, green Britain captured on camera .

A British psychic who shot to fame on TV shows stabbed his four-year-old twin daughters then leapt out of a window, it is claimed. Graham Bishop, 58, has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly attacking his daughters with a kitchen knife then stabbing himself at a hospital in Denmark. Bishop’s wife, who is her 20s, called police who kicked down the door in the room where his daughter Natalie, who has a long term illness, was being treated. The psychic, who has appeared in Danish TV shows, then jumped out of a window at Rigshospitalets paediatric centre, in Copenhagen and suffered injuries in the fall. British psychic Graham Bishop, left, who is accused of stabbing his four-year-old twin daughters including disabled Natalie, right . Natalie, now four, was born with aneurisms in her stomach and suffered paralysis on her left side and blindness. She was in a critical condition after the alleged attack . Bishop, who emigrated from Swindon, Wiltshire 12 years ago, was today being kept under police guard at hospital where he is being treated. His two daughters were in a critical condition in intensive care but they are now improving, police said. Police inspector Lau Thygesen from Copenhagen Police told the Copenhagen Post after the incident: ‘We are treating it is a family tragedy.’ Bishop claims to be a psychic healer who can cure people when he is possessed by the spirit of a German physician called ‘Dr Karl’. He has appeared on Danish television shows such as ‘Klarsyn’, ‘Åndernes Magt’, ‘Troldmandsskolen’ amd ‘Ånderne vender tilbage’. Bishop claims that Dr Karl is his ‘main spirit guide’ who uses the psychic’s body to help heal people in need. He claims to have healed his daughter of blindness, and cured large numbers of people across the world by laying his hands on them. Bishop emigrated from Swindon to Copenhagen, pictured, where he became famous on TV shows and is alleged to have stabbed his two twin daughters . His website gives a profile of his daughter, which describes how seven aneurisms were found in her stomach after she was born. She had emergency treatment and had suffered brain damage, causing her to lose her sight and movement down her left side. Bishop . writes on his site: 'After no improvement with these, I asked Spirit . for help, even that it was a risk my own life (I was in a very bad state . of health myself), but what father would not do that for his child ?  I . went into trance and Spirit Dr Karl was able to restore her sight and . correct the paralysis, unfortunately he was not able to repair the . kidney.' Alter-ego: The 19th century German physician called 'Dr Karl' Bishop claims he can channel . It continues: ‘The . first time Spirit Dr Karl undertook healing using my body was in 1992, . since which time he has helped many thousands of people across Europe . and the USA. ‘He told them . his name was Dr Karl and he was born in 1848 into a family of doctors in . Prussia (now part of Germany). He showed a keen interest and skill from . a very early age and performed his first ‘’unofficial’’ operation on a . person at the age of 12 years.’ ‘Since I ‘’woke-up’’ to my own awareness and realised the depth of spiritual knowledge and abilities I have, my whole life changed in ways I could never have imagined. ‘For many years the spiritual things were second place to my successful career in computing, over the years the balance shifted and in 1995 the spiritual became the focus of my work and life. ‘All of my life I felt a bit of an outsider and I have experienced many things that seemed to have no practical explanation.’ A Foreign Office spokesman told the Mail Online: ‘We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British national in Copenhangen on August 12. ‘We stand ready to provide consular assistance if necessary.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Graham Bishop starred in Danish TV shows as psychic .

Painful: Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, has admitted watching his company's share price tumble has been hard . Mark Zuckerberg has admitted Facebook's tanking share price is 'painful' to watch, as the stock fell to $19 - half its IPO price - this afternoon. The uncomfortable milestone came a day after a lock-up period expired, meaning early investors have been able to ditch their shares in the social network for the first time since May. The stock, which closed on its first day just above its initial public offering price of $38, plummeted 87 cents, or 4 per cent, to $19 in Friday afternoon trading. It closed at $19.05. Zuckerberg has kept quiet about his brainchild's sinking stock price but revealed his disappointment at a company-wide meeting earlier this month, according to The Wall Street Journal. The 28-year-old conceded that it may be 'painful' to watch as investors continue to retreat from Facebook's stock, people familiar with the meeting, held as part of a new effort to boost morale, told the newspaper. The current slump has seen Zuckerberg's personal fortune dwindle to around $10 billion, down from a peak of $20 billion in May. But the co-founder wasn't the only one expressing disappointment. Critics have begun calling for Zuckerberg to be replaced as CEO amid the slump in the share price, claiming he may not be cut out for the job. 'Mark Zuckerberg resign as $FB CEO immediately,' one user said on Twitter this morning, after a Los Angeles Times article questioned his place at the helm. On Thursday, Facebook's stock . plunged 6.3 per cent to an all-time low as company insiders were allowed to begin dumping hundreds of millions of shares for the first time. Diving: Mark Zuckerberg has admitted Facebook's tanking share price is 'painful' to watch, as the stock, pictured, fell to $19 - half its IPO price - in today's trading . Awe Zucks!

Partners to Goldman Sachs, Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Facebook board . members James Breyer, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman are among those free . to now sell stock they own after a lockup expired. The . world's largest social networking site closed at $19.87 -- shedding . $1.33 a share from the day before and losing at $2.8 billion in market . value. With Thursday's sell-off, Facebook has lost $40 billion, or just under 50 per cent, of its market value since its IPO on May 18. The stock, which debuted at $38, hit a session low of $19.69 on Nasdaq, before trading down 5 per cent at $20.13 early Thursday afternoon. Zuckerberg himself lost nearly $670million on Thursday morning alone. A massive sell-off became clear almost as soon as markets opened. Within the first hour, about 64million shares of Facebook changed hands. The daily average trading for the company is 30million. By the end of the day the volume of trading of five times normal -- 157 million shares -- as panicked shareholders looked to ditch the company. It's not yet . known whether the investors who were in a lock-up until Thursday were the ones fueling the sell-off. The stock price decline could . reflect investors' anticipation of such a move. More than 270 million shares have been unlocked -- more than one-half of the 421 million that were in the market after the initial public offering of the social networking company. Thumbs down: Facebook shares have lost half their market value since its May public offering . Losses: If shares of Facebook reach $19, the stock will have lost fully half of its value since the initial public offering . 'Pressure will be back on the shares now that liquidity is back in the market,' said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York. 'If (the value of) your holdings has been cut in half, are you going to sit around and risk the rest of that?' It's conceivable no one . would sell those extra shares, but if too many do, Facebook's stock would decline even more because the market would be flooded with additional . shares . It's been a rough run for . Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook . suffered what may be the most-botched public offering as trading . glitches marred its first day. Lock-ups prevent company insiders from selling their shares in a newly-floated firm. They usually start to expire 90 days from the initial public offering (IPO). They are designed to prevent the share price from fluctuating wildly if too many investors decide to sell their shares all at once. The lockup expired for initial investors on Thursday.

One of the holiest sites in the Christian faith is battling a financial crisis and could even face closure. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is said to be the site of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and burial, is struggling with a 9million shekel (£1.4million) unpaid bill owed to the Jerusalem water company. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem - which holds valuable Holy Land property and has a headquarters in the ancient church - has had its bank account frozen, water company Hagihon said. Water issues: The Holy Fire ceremony is performed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City . The Patriarchate was threatening a protest of shutting the doors of the church, which is a major pilgrimage site for millions of tourists, a report in Israeli newspaper Maariv said today. 'The church is completely paralysed,' a Patriarchate official told Maariv, reported the Guardian. 'We can't pay for toilet paper. Nothing. Hagihon has declared war on us.' The church lies deep inside Jerusalem's Old City walls. It encompasses Golgotha, or Calvary, where Jesus is believed to have been crucified and the tomb where he was buried and resurrected. A church was first built there in the 4th century under Roman emperor Constantine the Great, whose mother, Queen Helena, had visited the site and identified it as the place of Jesus's resurrection. The General Secretary of the Patriarchate, Archbishop of Constantina Aristarchos, had no comment on the Maariv report. He said the church was willing to pay water bills from now on, but that the accumulated debt, stemming back years, would be problematic. Debt: The General Secretary of the Patriarchate said the Patriarchate has sent letters to Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right).

Maariv said that for decades there had been a tacit agreement between the church and a former mayor of Jerusalem, exempting the Patriarchate from paying for water piped to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. But a spokesman for Hagihon said the law did not permit the company to make such exemptions. Talks with the Patriarchate have been going on for years, he said. The company had refrained from taking lawful enforcement steps, such as shutting the water off at the church, in order not to disrupt prayers and tourist activity at the site. The Patriarchate is jointly responsible for managing the church with other Christian denominations.","Jerusalem Old City church said to be site of Christ's crucifixion and burial .

Desperate gardeners will try every trick in the book to prevent their lovingly tended plants being obliterated by the scourge of slugs. But those who use a popular organic method to protect their vegetables could be hit by a secondary pest – the EU. Brussels bureaucrats have ruled that gardeners who sprinkle coffee grounds around their cabbages to kill slugs are breaking the law. Garden pests: There is a chance you may be fined for using coffee to get rid of slugs . The home-made solution contravenes regulations on pesticides, say officials. It means there is a chance – albeit a slim one – of vegetable growers receiving a visit and a heavy fine from the police. Gardeners say the caffeine in coffee keeps slugs out of the vegetable patch. Many coffee shops let customers take the grounds home for free, which can then be used as a mulch or to improve compost. But the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has warned that any gardener using coffee granules to deter slugs falls foul of EU regulations. The rules say that any active ingredient or chemical used in  gardening must be explicitly approved and placed on an EU list of pesticides. This aims to stop people using ‘home-made remedies in a dangerous manner’. Breaking law: Sprinkling coffee beans over your flowerbeds contravenes regulations on pesticides, say EU officials . But caffeine has never been tested for its effectiveness as a pesticide, its impact on the environment, gardeners and other creatures. This means its use as a slug deterrent is not allowed. Dr Andrew Halstead, principal  scientist of plant health at the RHS, said it was easier for the EU to list chemicals that had been tested and approved and impose a blanket ban on all other pesticides. He said: ‘Anything that has  not been through the system is  illegal to use as a pesticide, however safe that chemical is  perceived to be. ‘If you were to use coffee grounds around plants with the intention of providing some organic matter in the form of a mulch, rather than as a slug control or deterrent, then the regulations relating to pesticides would not apply. ‘This may all sound rather daft, but the intention of the pesticides legislation is to prevent people from applying untested dangerous chemicals. ‘However, the chances of being prosecuted for scattering coffee grounds in a garden are, I suspect, remote.’ Bob Flowerdew, a panellist on Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time and author of several gardening books, said: ‘Regulations are an ass, but they haven’t led to prosecutions. I cannot recommend that anyone breaks the law, but I can point out that, in other countries, people do use coffee grounds.’ Mr Flowerdew said some gardeners used soft soap on plants to kill aphids, although this would also be technically illegal. ‘As long as you say. “I’m not killing the aphids, I’m giving them a wash, but oh dear they seem to have died accidentally”, it’s okay. ‘It’s the British way: we work our way around the regulations.’",Using coffee beans breaks EU policies on pesticides .

Comfort: Amanda Medek (left), whose sister Micayla was killed in the Aurora shooting, is hugged by her grandmother during the press conference . Families of the Colorado theater shooting victims have come together to voice their pain and anger at the way the millions of dollars raised since the tragedy are being distributed. At an emotional news conference Tuesday in Aurora, group spokesman Tom Teves, whose son was killed, criticized fundraisers for not giving victims a voice in how the money is distributed, even though it was raised using the pictures and names of 'our murdered loved ones'. So far, just over $5 million has been raised and $450,000 distributed. Of that, $350,000 went to the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance in order to provide $5,000 each going to the families of 70 victims to meet their immediate financial needs. The other $100,000 has gone to 10 non-profit groups, according to the Community First Foundation website. Teves accused fundraising groups of . being unresponsive and unsympathetic to victims' needs. He also . questioned the commitment of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to helping . the victims, noting that the governor had attended the funerals of those . who died in the shooting. 'You pledged 12 times that ""We will remember"". Are you a man who is true to his words, or were they just words?' Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown, . said the governor understands the families' frustration and is . advocating for them to have more say. He also praised the generosity of donors and said the victims would get more money. Scroll down for video . Outrage: The families voiced their pain and suffering, led by Tom Teves, right, angry at how funds are being distributed . Comfort: Thomas Teves, right, kisses his wife Caren Teves, center, at the press conference . 'Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation,' Brown said. Victims . and their families crowded on the platform behind Teves, some dabbing . their eyes. Joshua Nowlan, who was wounded in the attack, used a cane . and had a splint up to his knee. Teves . said anyone in the theater or in the suspect's apartment building who . was affected by the 'coward's acts' should be eligible to receive help. 'I am certain that the public intended 100 per cent of those donations to go to the families of victims, and to use that money to help the healing process,' Teves said. 'Unfortunately that does not appear to be the case.' Emotional: Deidra Brooks, whose son Jarell was shot in the leg, joined the families calling on Colorado governor John Hickenlooper to make sure the families themselves saw more of the donated funds . He added that he was 'humbled by the generosity of the American public', the Denver Post reported, but outraged that the money had been 'solicited using the names and faces of our loved ones'. Teves' own family has not received any money. Chantel Blunk, whose husband was shot and killed, told ABC News she received a check for $5,000 and told she would not be getting any more. She said that COVA refused to pay for plane tickets for her young children to travel with her to Colorado from Reno, Nevada. Joker: James Eagan Holmes is accused in the shooting which took place at an Aurora movie theatre during a Batman screening . The suspect in the July 20 shooting, . 24-year-old James Eagan Holmes, is charged with multiple counts of . murder and attempted murder. Only . a handful of family members of the slain victims have spoken publicly, . and most of their comments came in the first few days after the . shooting. Marla J. Williams, president the Community First Foundation, charged by . Hickenlooper to operate the relief fund, said a gag order imposed by . Arapahoe County District Judge William Blair Sylvester made it difficult . to find all the victims and their families. She said a group has been set up to recommend how to spend the donations but no victims' representatives had been chosen yet. 'I don't know who represents the victims. There are a number of people who were involved,' she said, adding that the group at Tuesday's news conference did not represent all the victims. Nancy Lewis, executive director of the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, said the victims and the agencies involved want the same thing: 'They want healing for all the crime victims.' She said Sylvester's gag order prevented her from commenting further. Sylvester issued the order on August 16 barring the organization from releasing names and contact information for the victims. The order does not appear to place any other restrictions on the group. Police said Holmes was heavily armed and wearing body armor and a gas mask when he opened fire on the audience in a packed theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a showing of the latest Batman movie. In addition to the 12 killed, 58 were injured. Holmes is being held without bail and has not entered a plea. Defense lawyers have said he is mentally ill.

A couple have discovered they are sitting on a piece of history after uncovering a 33ft-deep medieval well under their sofa. But although Colin Steer, 61, is fascinated by the historic find, his wife Vanessa certainly isn’t and even made her husband wait more than two decades after it was first spotted to begin exploring it. The couple moved into their Victorian home in Plymouth, Devon around 24 years ago, when they first noticed a slight indentation in the living room floor. Enthusiastic Colin Steer and his less-than-impressed wife Vanessa from Plymouth, Devon, who have uncovered an old well in the sitting room of their Victorian home . Mr Steer, a former civil servant, said: ‘I was replacing the joists in the floor when I noticed a slight depression - it appeared to be filled in with the foundations of the house. ‘I dug down about one foot and saw that it was a well but my wife just wanted to me to cover it back up because we had three children running around at the time. ‘I always wanted to dig it out to see if I could find a pot of gold at the bottom so when I retired at the end of last year that’s what I did.’ With a helping hand from a local man Mr Steer spent three days clearing the well, which is around 30 inches wide using a bucket on a rope to pull up the debris. Plans of the site show that the well dates back to at least the 16th century, just after the end of the medieval period. And just five feet into the dig he made another discovery - an old sword. Mr Steer spent three days clearing the well which is around 30 inches wide and up to 33ft deep . Since clearing the well, Mr Steer has installed lighting and built a trap-door over it . He said: ‘It was hidden at a 45 degree angle and sort of just fell out. ‘It looks like an old peasant’s fighting weapon because it appears to be made up of bits of metal all knocked together.’ Having stopped digging at around 17ft Mr Steer believes the well is at least 33ft deep. He has since put lighting in the well, tidied it up and built a trap-door into the living room floor for easy access. Mr Steer said: ‘I’ve been doing lots of research into its history but I’d like to try and find someone to date it. The couple moved into their Victorian home in Plymouth 24 years ago, when they first spotted the well . ‘I’ve looked at old maps which showed Drake’s leat and illustrated the area was just woodland until this house was built in 1895. ‘I love the well and think it’s fascinating. I’d love to find out who was here before us. ‘I’ve got a piece of Plymouth’s history in my front room.’ But Mr Steer’s wife Vanessa, a former housewife, doesn’t share her husband’s enthusiasm. She said: “I hate the well. But I suppose it is quite a feature. ‘When we come to sell the house I just hope it’s not a white elephant in the room.’","Colin Steer first spotted the well 24 years ago but his wife Vanessa asked him wait to explore it .

Coal miners who attended a Mitt Romney rally last month in the critical swing state of Ohio are angry are being 'forced' to attend the event - and even missed out on a day's pay. Murray Energy's Century coal mine in Beallsville closed on August 14th - the day of the Republican presidential nominee's event - citing security concerns. Mr Romney held his event at the mine, as he effectively used it and the hoards of soot-faced miners in coveralls and hard hats as props during his speech about the financial and political benefits of increased coal mining. Grip and grin: Mitt Romney met with coal miners at an August 14th event in Beallsville, Ohio and their plant was closed for the day because of 'security' concerns . Pressured: After the fact, a number of the workers complained that they felt like they would lose their jobs if they did not attend, and they all automatically lost a day's pay because the mine was closed . A number of the miners called and emailed complaints to a local radio host who aired their grievances, which come as close connections have been revealed about the mine's owner and the Romney campaign. 'They took a roll call and took a list of who was there and who wasn't,' radio host David Blomquist said on WWVA News Radio 1170. It wasn't only the fact that by closing the mine for the event the workers lost out on a day's pay, but they also thought the nature of the event itself was insensitive considering their difficult economic situation. 'At the event there were jugglers, there were rides there was a brand new golf carts- that a lot of expense had been put out and they felt that with the layoffs at one of the other mines, they thought it was uncalled for,' Mr Blomquist said. The Los Angeles Times reports that when asked to comment, the mine's chief operating officer Robert Moore said 'Attendance was mandatory but no one was forced to attend'. 'We are talking about an event that was in the best interest of anyone that's related to the coal industry in this area or the entire country,' Mr Moore continued. Mutual interests: Tomney is a strong supporter of coal and the mine's owner has contributed heavily to Republican campaigns over the past several elections . Insensitive: The workers also complained that a lot of money was put into the activities at the event which seemed inappropriate since so many mines are struggling to keep their workers employed . He added that workers lose a day's wages when the mine is closed for whatever reason, including bad weather or power outages. The radio host stood by his decision to read some of the emailed complaints he received, which paint a picture of the forced compliance that the company exerted on its employees over both events like the August 14th one or other campaign dinners in the crucial electoral college state. 'Just for the record if we did not go, we knew what would happen: then we would have to make up time or pay was short. There are lists that go around if you are the good people or the bad people, that means if you go to these dinners or not,' one email read. 'At this point I need my income, jobs are hard to find, but it is wrong what we are made to because of the outcome if we don't.' Mr Blomquist agreed, telling The Cleveland Plain Dealer: 'If they shut the mine down, why should they lose a day's pay? There are some guys that just want to go to work, feed their family and go home.' Robert Murray, the owner of Murray Energy's Century and parent company Pepper Pike, and his wife have contributed the federal limit of $5,000 each to Romney's campaign, not to mention $471,185 to a plethora of Republican candidates and politicians since 2008. And those contributions are only a fraction of the total donated to various Republican political action committees by Murray Energy subsidiaries, who the Center of Responsive Politics reports gave a total $1.5million during the same time span. Given Romney's strong support of coal and coal expansion as a part of his proposed plan to make America energy independent by 2020, the monetary ties to the Republican campaign come as little surprise. True support in Ohio is going to be critical come November, as the latest poll released Sunday by the Columbus Dispatch has the President and Romney tied at 45 per cent of the respondents.","Mine closed for Romney event in Ohio and workers lost a day's wages .

A stunning Edwardian wedding dress is about to be auctioned after being kept in pristine condition by the bride's family for more than a century. But while it may have survived being bombed twice by the Luftwaffe and 104 years in storage unscathed, it appears the changing shape of modern women could mean the magnificent wedding dress is never again worn down the aisle. The delicate Brussels lace was worn by petite Ethel Dalziel when she married Ronald Cooper in Glasgow, and is smaller than today's UK size 4. Stunning: Ethel Dalzeil, left, wearing the dress on her wedding day in 1908, may be the first and last bride to wear the garment down the aisle because it is so tiny even the most petite of women would struggle to fit into it . Over a century after it was worn the size of the average bride has grown so much it could almost certainly never fit a bride today. It is being sold by Ethel's granddaughter and amazingly the Brussels' lace frock comes with the original satin shoes, which are a Size 1. All the accompanying accessories have incredibly remained with the dress, carefully looked after by the family. Ethel's family moved to London during World War II where they were unluckily twice bombed out of their homes in Cheam and Enfield. It also comes with a pair of cream ribbed lace-effect stockings, orange blossom wax headdress and a full length veil. Exquisite: Auctioneer Phil Traves delicately arranges the 104 year old wedding dress which twice survived being bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War Two and will be auctioned on September 5 . Ethel, who wore the dress, stood about five feet high with a waist of about 18 inches. Her granddaughter Elizabeth Hoare said she thought about wearing it for her wedding when she weighed six-and-a-half stone, but couldn't get into it. The dress is expected to fetch several hundred pounds when it is sold at auction on Wednesday. Mrs Hoare, who lives in Somerset, said: 'It was my grandmother's dress and her family must have been quite well off. 'It is made from lace and still has all the accessories including the little shoes that are about a Size 1. 'She was a very small woman, just about five feet high and must have had a tiny waist. When I remember her she had filled out a bit, but was still very small. 'She married Ronald Cooper in October in 1908 at the Newlands UF Church in Glasgow with the reception at the Windsor Hotel. Delicate: Petite Ethel Dalziel wore the wedding dress and tiny size one slippers when she married Ronald Cooper in Glasgow in 1908 . Detailed: The Brussels lace wedding dress, which has an 18-inch waist - has miraculously survived more than a century in storage . 'The dress was obviously kept by her and then when she died my mother kept it in a box and since I inherited it I've kept it in tissue paper in the bottom of my wardrobe. 'I haev no children and I tried to give it to a museum but no one wanted it so I've put it in a sale and hope it will go to a new home. 'I thought about wearing it for my wedding when I weighed six-and-a-half stone but I couldn't get into it. 'I remember my grandmother as having an air of authoruty and a rather pompous Glaswegian accent. 'She settled in Bayswater and had a fixation about spuies and would look out of the window with her opera glasses. 'In later years she dressed like it was the 1920s and had a blue rinse with curls in her hair.' Keepsakes: The marriage service and invitation to the wedding of Ethel Isabella and Ronald Cooper has also survived the passage of time . Cherished mementos: The mementos saved by Mrs Dalziel family includes a newspaper announcement from 1908 . Deborah Doyle from Duke's auction house in Dorchester, Dorset, said the dress was in excellent condition. She said: 'It has done very well to survive in this condition; it is very rare. And it comes with all the other accessories. 'It is very tiny dress made from Brussels lace with a detachable bodice with short puff sleeves with silk decoration. 'The front silk bodice is overlaid with lace flowers and flounces of lace and it has a centre silk bow. 'The full-length two tier lace skirt has scallop edges, falling into a semi circular train at the back. 'The satin lining is edged with a deep boarder at the hem with tight concertina pleats which is duplicated with a skirt of fine silk .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:50 EST, 31 August 2012 . It took them five months but authorities have finally concluded that elderly twin sisters found dead at their South Lake Tahoe home in February passed away from natural causes. Police launched an investigation into the deaths of 73-year-old sisters Joan and Patricia Miller after welfare officers discovered their decomposed bodies in the house several weeks after they died. But only yesterday did El Dorado County sheriff's deputies announce that Joan Miller died of hypothermia after her sister and best friend, Patricia, passed away from coronary artery disease. Natural causes: Authorities have finally concluded that elderly twin sisters Joan and Patricia Miller, pictured, passed away from natural causes . The women - former . television stars - died within a short time of each other at the . California property they shared for 40 years but authorities were perplexed as to what killed them. Lt. Tim Becker yesterday ruled out foul play, stating that a window was open at the home, and Joan Miller died from hypothermia. The woman was heavily dependent on her sister so when Patricia succumbed to heart disease, Joan was unable to care for herself and died shortly after. The twins' rotted bodies were found during a welfare check on February 26 but deputies were stumped because there was no blood or signs of struggle at the home where the women had lived together for decades. Officers struggled to find family of the reclusive 1950s entertainers, but after an 11-day search, three relatives - a cousin and two second cousins - came forward to tell detectives about the mysterious ladies, who never married. Becker said authorities were glad to bring the lengthy investigation to an end. The sisters briefly appeared in a U.S. TV show, The Hoffman Hayride, and posed with singer and actor Bing Crosby as children. But they often shunned their neighbours and police had to make a public appeal and enlist the help of dozens of strangers to locate their next of kin after their bodies were discovered . Emails and phone calls poured in and, assisted by amateur genealogists . who read media accounts of the sisters' deaths, investigators were able to trace the cousins, who said they had not heard from the sisters in years,  in March. Detective Matt Harwood, of the El Dorado County sheriff's office: 'They confirmed pretty much what everyone else told me. 'They were pretty reclusive and no one really knows why.' Detective Harwood said the cousins, . who do not share the sisters' surname, had told him they lost touch with . the women as other family members died. In one case, an amateur genealogist . had called one of the cousins to confirm their blood line before giving . the name to Detective Harwood. Harwood said the sisters deserved to . have their family know about their death, and he was pleased to complete . that mission with help from 'people from across the country, just your . Average Joe wanting to try their hand on genealogy.' He added: 'There's no way we could have done it . without you guys in the press and literally hundreds of people just . calling to help put the pieces together.' One of the second cousins lives in . the San Francisco Bay area, and the two other cousins live in Portland, . Oregon, where the twins grew up. Bing: Officers combed the women's home and found a photograph of them as young girls sitting on the lap of Bing Crosby, pictured . Harwood said he had yet to find a . will but planned to give some of the twins' personal items, including . their mother's furniture and family photo albums, to the cousins. The discovery of next of kin provides some answers to the twins' mysterious end, but their puzzle is far from being solved. Medical investigators had been . unable to determine how or when the women died, but their decomposed . bodies suggest they had been dead for at least several weeks when they . were found . Toxicology reports took months to come back with results. There was no blood, no signs of struggle . and nothing indicated that the women had persistent health . troubles. After a life in showbiz, dancing and . singing on TV as well as at several military bases with their mother on . piano, the twins spent their last decades as recluses who never married, . said police. Detectives said they found one of the sisters in her downstairs bedroom and the other in the hallway outside. They combed the home for information from documents and pictures. One photograph showed the women as young girls sitting on Mr Crosby's lap. Another showed them wearing tap dancing shoes. Their parents were 'heavily involved in their entertainment . business', police said. Detective Harwood said it was as if the two sisters, long each other's only companion, could not live without each other. 'My perception is one died and the other . couldn't handle it,' he added in March. 'It . appears purely natural, but we are still trying to piece it all . together.' It is unusual for police to release the names . of the dead without first informing their relatives, but the sisters' shrouded lives made that impossible, the detective said. 'The circumstance surrounding their . death is somewhat of an enigma,' he added. The deaths confused some residents . in the resort town of South Lake Tahoe, where homeowners tend to be . close-knit and the sisters' reclusiveness had long inspired questions . and concern. In the past year, there were hints that . something was amiss at the Miller home. A neighbour spotted an ambulance . at the house a year ago and assumed they had fallen ill. Someone asked . police to check regularly on the house. When someone arrived on February 25 for . a routine check, no one answered the door. The next day, police forced . their way in and found the bodies. Their longtime home was not disheveled or unkempt - potential . signs of mental or physical illness. Detective Harwood said he called a nearby centre for the elderly to see if the sisters were visitors, but no one there had heard . of them. He checked with Meals on Wheels volunteers, but the sisters did not appear to have received their services. The only relative he found . in his preliminary searches was the sisters' deceased mother. As news of the deaths spread, former . South Lake Tahoe residents called police to report that they had lived . near the sisters for decades in some cases, and had hardly seen them. One sent in a postcard that claimed the sisters were the only remaining . members of their family after their mother's death and their brother . died at war. Calls made to several longtime . residents and social groups in the area turned up little, as many . community leaders said they had never heard of the sisters. Joan Miller was a senior accounting . clerk in the payroll department at the Lake Tahoe Unified School . District from 1979 to 1984. Patricia Miller, who drove a white . convertible with red upholstery, worked in the El Dorado County's social . services office during that time. 'I never heard of anyone else being in . either of their lives,' said Betty Mitchell, 89, who supervised . Patricia Miller in the social services office and saw the twins around . town.

A boy of four cried 'Daddy's killed Mummy' and 'She's all red' after his soldier father murdered his mother in a frenzied knife attack at their home, a court heard. Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, is alleged to have kicked down the door to Leanne McNuff's home and stabbed her in the neck and arm before stamping on her face. As the 24-year-old lay bleeding to death on the landing, the boy begged his grandmother, who had just arrived at the scene: 'Can you help Mummy, Nana?' Family: Soldier Ian Lowe girlfriend Leanne McNuff, who he allegedly stabbed to death after finding out she had terminated their unborn baby, and their son Jaden . Yesterday Lowe  – who was due to be deployed to Afghanistan at the time of the attack – appeared in court charged with Miss McNuff's murder. The jury heard that the couple, who met in 2006 and had their son the following year, had a stormy relationship. Manchester Crown Court was told the pair finally separated in February this year, after which Miss McNuff found out she was pregnant. She called Lowe at his barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire where he was serving in the 1st Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment, to tell him the news. Lowe was allowed home by the Army and begged his ex girlfriend to take him back. However, an argument erupted and Lowe was charged with assault for trying to throttle her. A month later he told a friend he had discovered that Miss McNuff had had an abortion. The court heard Lowe went round to Miss McNuff's house in Droylsden, Manchester on March 11 in a rage and kicked in the door before stabbing her. Miss McNuff's brother, Ryan, who lived next door, and mother Margaret heard the disturbance and ran round to find the doors hanging off. They found the boy standing in the hallway, crying: 'Daddy's killed Mummy.' The four-year-old then asked his grandmother: 'Can you help Mummy, Nana?' Father figure: Ian Lowe with his son Jaden when he was just three months old . Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Lowe, a lance corporal with 1st Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment, had discovered that Leanne had aborted their second child after hacking into her Facebook account. It is also alleged that he discovered on the day she was killed that Leanne had started a relationship with another man. Lowe, who had been in a stormy was on bail at the time of the murder after being charged with the assault in February. He has admitted a charge of manslaughter but denies murder, claiming Leanne lunged at him with the knife and he wrestled it from her grasp. Victim: Leanne McNuff was killed in March this year after her ex-boyfriend learned that she had an abortion, a court heard . Neil Flewitt QC said: 'When Ryan McNuff stepped inside he saw Jaden to the right of the front door, crying and screaming ‘Daddy’s killed Mummy’. 'Ryan McNuff checked the living room and, on discovering that it was empty, ran quickly upstairs where he discovered the body of his sister lying on the landing.' The jury was told that Leanne’s mother, Margaret McNuff, then ran inside and found her grandson standing at the top of the stairs wearing his pyjamas. The court heard that a neighbour, Sheila Holland, ran to help and agreed to take care of the child before police and paramedics arrived. Mr Flewitt said: 'Once inside Jaden said to Sheila Holland, ‘Sheila, do . you know my Daddy? He has killed my Mummy and she is all red’.' The . jury was told that Lowe, who was based at Army barracks in Catterick, . North Yorkshire, and had started a relationship with another woman, ran . to the home of his mother, Lorraine Lowe, and confessed. Mr Lowe . is alleged to have told Mrs Lowe: 'I booted the front door in.He was . in the front room and Leanne was at the top of the stairs, shouting at . me to get out. I ran up, stabbed her four times and I stamped on her . face.' The jury was told of Leanne’s horrific stab and stamp injuries, including marks on her hands where she fought to save her life. Mr Flewitt said ‘patterned bruises’ caused by the impact of the sole of a shoe were found on her face. Killed: Leanne McNuff was repeatedly stabbed and stamped on by her former boyfriend, Ian Lowe, after he discovered she had terminated their unborn baby, a court was told . He . added: 'Although it is not likely that these blows accelerated Leanne . McNuff’s death, they could have rendered her unconscious or dazed, . making her less capable of defending herself from attack.' The court heard that, when the pair . met at Miss McNuff's home to discuss the pregnancy on February 18, a . violent row broke out during which Lowe called Miss McNuff a . 'prostitute' and accused her of 'sleeping around'. Break up: Leanne McNuff and Lowe had been dating since 2006 but broke up a month before the killing in March this year . As Miss McNuff tried to force him out . of the house, Lowe is said to have grabbed her by the thoat and begun . 'shaking her from side to side'. In a statement given to police at the time, Miss McNuff recalled: 'He’s shaking me from side to side and I’m almost on the floor. 'I’ve lost my footing but being held up by Ian gripping my clothing and he’s shaking me about. 'Somehow, whilst he’s still ragging me about, I’ve twisted and he’s got hold of my hair. 'Now he’s got a grip of my clothing and a grip of my hair and he’s still shaking me about. 'At some point he’s let go of my jumper and his left arm has come around my throat choking me and making it hard to breathe for a few seconds. I was frightened to death. 'I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was scared wither he’d really hurt me or I’d lose the baby. 'Then Ian’s released me and pushed me to the floor. He’s gone to kick me. 'At first I think he was going to kick me hard but he held back and it wasn’t a very hard kick in my back. 'Then he’s picked up his bag and ran out of the gate.' Lowe was later arrested and charged with assault and was ordered not to contact Leanne under his bail conditions. But the court heard that, only an hour later, Miss McNuff rang police again to claim that Lowe had called her. The next day, February 20, Miss McNuff went in secret to an abortion clinic for a consultation. Scene: Police at the house in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, where Leanne McNuff's body was found . She terminated the unborn baby on March 1. Lowe found out about the abortion on . March 10 - the day before the killing - when he hacked into Leanne’s . Facebook account, the court heard.

The star is pictured leaving court after being banned from driving . Football icon Patrick Vieira tried to escape a driving ban by claiming he and other Premier League stars living in an upmarket village were not getting their post. The former Arsenal and Manchester City star was caught doing 61mph in a 50mph zone on the M60 near Stockport in his Bentley Continental Supersports. The World Cup winner admitted he had been driving the £160,000 supercar at the time. But he said he did not receive the original prosecution notice at his £2.2 million home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. His lawyer claimed that should have rendered the case null and void. Vieira, 36, said he and other City players living nearby - including Sergio Aguero, Adam Johnson and Emmanuel Adebayor - often had mail delivered to the wrong house. But magistrates in Stockport booted out his defence - and banned him for six months, with a £1,000 fine. The punishment was suspended after he lodged an appeal. Vieira already had nine points on his licence after being caught speeding three times in less than four weeks in September 2009. The former France international, who still works for City, claimed he only knew of the speeding case after receiving a final notice on December 15 - six weeks after the initial letter was sent out on November 3. His solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, said that meant a 14-day time limit to start legal proceedings had been breached. Vieira said he and other City players and staff living nearby in the millionaires’ row were often forced to deliver each other’s post because of Royal Mail mix-ups. He said: 'We have lived there for around two years and we’ve had things go to the wrong address three or four times. 'Often the neighbours would have to bring round my mail. I had Adam Johnson, David Platt, (Sergio) Aguero and (Emmanuel) Adebayor all living next door and we all had similar problems.

Professors at an Alabama university described James Holmes as an excellent candidate for their neuroscience program in February 2011, but rejected him anyway after his behaviour raised concerns. The University of Alabama at Birmingham on Thursday released the application of the man accused of the Colorado movie theatre shooting rampage, including interview forms from his visit to the school. Professors described him as a top-notch student and shy. One professor doubted whether he wanted Holmes in his lab, noting that 'he may be extremely smart, but difficult to engage.' Rejected: The University of Alabama at Birmingham has revealed they rejected James Holmes, pictured earlier in court, from their PhD programme because of his strange behaviour . Gunman: Holmes is accused of shooting dead 12 people in a Colorado movie theater in July . Another wrote: 'His personality may not be as engaging as some applicants, but he is going to be a leader.' A message left for Scott Wilson at the school's neurobiology program was not immediately returned. The application was obtained from the school. According to admissions experts, federal privacy laws do not cover graduate student applications. Holmes graduated from the University of California, Riverside in June of 2010 while earning a 3.94 Grade Point Average out of a 4.0 scale, according to newly released transcripts. Furbishing his GPA, Holmes received A+ grades in biology, chemistry, economics and Spanish. In a course taken titled Ethics and the Meaning of Life, he received an A. Following his rejection and withdrawal of another graduate application to the  University of Kansas, Holmes later enrolled as a first-year Ph.D. student in a neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Denver. Concerns: Holmes' rejection by the University of Alabama at Birmingham is the second for the accused shooter whose interview for their neuroscience programme raised concerns . He withdrew about six weeks before the July 20 attack in Aurora, a Denver suburb. Prosecutors say the 24-year-old . opened fire during a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie, 'The . Dark Knight Rises,' killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Holmes also raised concerns at CU . where university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton said she contacted police in .

Top student: Holmes achieved a 3.95 GPA while attending the University of California Riverside and graduating with honors in 2010 . 'James Holmes: Do NOT offer admission under any circumstances,' wrote Tranel, a professor of neurology. Psychology professor Mark Blumberg followed up with a separate email to say he agreed.

University of Iowa President Sally Mason said on Thursday she had 'no idea' whether Holmes raised red flags or why he was rejected. But she said the case illustrates the critical significance that interviews play in evaluating prospective graduate students, and how candidates who appear strong on paper might not measure up in person. 'Getting to know someone, hearing them, meeting them face-to-face can tell you a lot about an individual,' she said. Michael Reilly, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said graduate applicants are not covered by federal student privacy laws and there are no reporting requirements if somebody raises a concern. Reilly said the graduate candidate interviews are more detailed because the programs involve working with a research professor in a close lab setting for a number of years. 'They want to read a little more closely the responses of applicants that this is somebody who is not just bright, but sane and focused,' Reilly said. He said screening applicants who are intelligent but socially awkward could be a topic for a study session at the organization's convention. Members of the organization include most of the major not-for-profit and public universities that include the University of Iowa, University of Colorado and the University of Alabama.","Both the University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Iowa rejected Holmes' applications despite determined to be 'extremely smart'

Busted: After being cleared of any involvement in the bomb hoax Christopher Shell was arrested on outstanding warrants for drugs charges . A 29-year-old bomb hoax victim was arrested on Thursday, hours after being led from an aircraft in handcuffs, then released, over a phoney tip-off he was carrying a bomb. Christopher Shell was believed to be the victim of a 'nasty prank' at the hands of his ex-girlfriend after the allegations forced the US Airways plane he was on to do a u-turn en route from Philadelphia to Dallas, Texas. But later that day he found himself back in police custody on outstanding drug warrants held for two drug-possession charges — less than 2 ounces of marijuana and less than 28 grams of a controlled substance. He was jailed on Friday morning on $3,000 bond in Collin County near Dallas. 26-year-old Kenneth W. Smith Jr. has since been arrested, accused of making the hoax threat. He has been charged with conveying false and misleading information. Police . were led to Smith by Shell who, during questioning, told authorities of . a feud involving him, his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend 'Kenny'. He said he had recently traded 'hostile messages' on his cellphone with his ex-girlfriend about the situation. Shell . gave officers the name of Smith's workplace, where he was questioned. Authorities said Smith admitted he made the call from a payphone to . 'avenge' the ex-girlfriend, because Shell had posted a compromising . picture of her on Facebook. He was scheduled for an initial . appearance in federal court on Friday afternoon. If convicted, he faces a . maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and . possible restitution. As the investigation continues Smith is due for an initial apprentice in federal court on Friday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Victim? Police said Christopher Shell (pictured) was not considered to be a suspect in the bomb hoax, hours before he was arrested on outstanding warrants . Emergency u-turn: Christopher Shell was removed from the craft while it was searched . If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and possible restitution. The drama began for Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday on board the aircraft. He and his fellow passengers about a third of the way into the flight when the anonymous tipster called airport police, at around 7.30am, claiming he was carrying 'dangerous substances'. At first believed to be a . birthday prank, police and the airline nonetheless took the allegation . seriously and re-routed the plane, sending it back to Philadelphia . International Airport, half an hour into the journey. The plane returned to Philadelphia where it was met by a slew of law enforcement vehicles and personnel. Passenger Steve McNeal said he was sitting next to Shell when five heavily armed officials boarded the plane. 'They . turned the gun and pointed it at the guy sitting right next to me. I . was shocked,' McNeal said after the flight eventually made its way to . Dallas. 'I had been talking to him on the way out for the first 15 minutes of the flight. Nothing seemed abnormal.' Brag: Christopher Shell quickly recovered from his shock to offer up his story in exchange for cash . Rant: Shell moaned about the flight on Facebook . Another passenger, Lisa Flanagan, . from Philadelphia, said it looked as though Shell 'was in shock. He . didn't know what was going on.' Shell was led from the jet wearing . handcuffs after the craft made return to Philadelphia . International Airport. He was put him in the back of a police car and . taken off for questioning, apparently very surprised to be caught up in . the midst of the emergency. 'He was obviously very alarmed, as I would be if heavily armed police officers entered a plane to take me off,' Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Joseph . Sullivan said. 'And he was certainly stunned. And that's why this is no joke, this is no laughing matter.' Bomb technicians and specially trained dogs searched the plane but found nothing illegal or hazardous, Sullivan said. Police believe the scare was a practical joke, played on Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday, NBC reported. Shell did nothing wrong and was the victim of 'a pretty nasty trick,' Sullivan said. He made a swift recovery, however, taking to Facebook to offer up his story in exchange for cash. 'If u have questions or want an interview with me, it will cost u $$$ until then,' he wrote. 'Sry. Message me your offers as I'll go with the most $$$!' Earlier on he had posted: 'Im not going to lie, I'm pretty disappointed in US Airways currently. We just spent a half hour in the air to be notified that the plane, ""has technical difficulties"" and had to fly back! Flight 1267 CANCELLED. Gay!' Nasty hoax: The US Airways plane was searched after being ordered back to Philadelphia International Airport following a report of explosives onboard . Briefing: Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan talks about the threat after its investigation by police . Sullivan stressed that Shell is not a suspect but added that police are treating the hoax seriously because it had resulted in a heavy police response and a significant hassle for all those on board, he said. 'It's just an incredibly foolish and irresponsible thing to do and, bottom line, it's criminal,' Sullivan said. Two people have since been taken into custody for questioning, according to NBC. Earlier, an FBI spokesman said the flight was diverted because of a call reporting liquid explosives were on board. Sullivan declined to discuss the content of the call. A pre-departure Facebook post from Shell described how someone he knew at the airport allowed him to go 'through security with a breeze'. Sullivan said social media posts would be part of the investigation. Shell's hometown is Fort Worth, and he works in Philadelphia for 2020 Companies, a sales and marketing firm, according to his Facebook page. Various posts and public records indicate he turned 29 on Thursday and planned to spend the weekend in Texas. Police in Fort Worth and nearby Dallas didn't immediately return messages from the AP seeking information about the Texas arrest, and a local FBI spokeswoman said the arrest wasn't an FBI matter. Shell isn't listed in online records for the jails serving either city. FBI special agent Richard Quinn said it was too early to speculate about what sort of charges could be filed against the caller but they could be severe. McNeal, who was sitting next to Shell, said he hopes whoever made the call 'pays for it'. 'Because in this day and age,' he said, 'it's not funny.' The airplane had 69 passengers and five crew members on board, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said.","Hoax victim Christopher Shell arrested on outstanding warrants for drugs charges, hours after police announced he was not being considered a suspect in bomb scare .

A woman in her 50s has given birth to her own grandchild after becoming a surrogate mother for her infertile daughter. Cindy Reutzel, 53, gave birth to a . healthy baby girl a week ago who will now be brought up by her . 32-year-old daughter Emily Jordan. The greatest gift: Emily Jordan with her pregnant mother Cindy Reutzel, who was a surrogate for her daughter . Special bond: Cindy holds her granddaughter Elle Cynthia Jordan less than a week after giving birth to her . Unconventional family: Six-day old Elle is cradled by both her mother and her grandmother, blissfully unaware of how she came into the world . Emily was 29 when she discovered two years ago she had cervical cancer. However, just as she was about to have a radical hysterectomy, Emily and husband Mike discovered she was pregnant. Faced with saving her own life or their unborn child's, the young couple made the excruciating decision to go forward with her surgery. It meant losing the baby, and forfeiting any chance at having their own children. Remembering the moment she discovered she no longer had a place where a baby could grow, Emily said: 'I can't describe what that was like after finding out you have cancer, after finding out your chance of ever carrying a baby is gone.' However, hope arrived in the form of mother Cindy, who offered to act as a surrogate for the couple. And last week, Emily and Mike waited patiently in the maternity wing of a downtown Chicago hospital to realise their dream of becoming parents. Just days after Emily's 32nd birthday, baby Elle Cynthia Jordan was born. New mother: Emily, who was left infertile after having a hysterectomy, feeding her newborn daughter Elle . 'Better than I could have imagined': Cindy holds her tiny granddaughter Elle after giving birth to her . An in-vitro baby boom began about 34 years ago when Louise Brown - the world's first 'test tube' baby - was born in Britain. What started with would-be mothers in their 20s and 30s, began to extend to older women too. Dr Helen Kim, director of the in vitro fertilisation program at the University of Chicago, said: 'Then people started pushing the envelope. 'If you could help a menopausal woman in her 30s, could you help a menopausal woman in her 40s? And then it became, ""Can you help a menopausal woman in her 50s?"" 'And the answer is yes.' Some older women were having their own babies. But more often, they were using egg donors to have their own children, or serving as surrogates or 'gestational carriers.' Proud father: Mike Jordan watches his wife Emily hold their six-day-old daughter Elle . Emily Jordan, left, examines the pregnant belly of her mother. Mike and Emily get used to being parents, right . A 51-year-old grandmother in Brazil . gave birth to her twin grandchildren in 2007, and there were other . stories of women giving birth in their 40s or 50s and even 60s. Cindy . had a vague recollection of those stories. So when doctors revealed . that they had been able to keep Emily's ovaries intact, she immediately . offered to help, asking: 'What if I carried your baby for you?' Emily and Mike didn't take it too seriously at first. 'We didn't really think that was a realistic option,' says Emily, who works in hospital administration. However, for a young grandmother in good health, like Cindy, it became a viable option. After a process that included psychological evaluation and hormonal manipulation to prepare their bodies, Kim eventually implanted Cindy's uterus with an embryo created with an egg from Emily and Mike's sperm. A woman's fertility falls after the age of 30 and even more sharply after 35. And the older you are when you conceive, the greater the risk that your baby could have a genetic anomaly. This could lead to miscarriage or to the birth of a baby with Downs Syndrome. Underlying conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure makes it more risky for you and your baby. Older women are more likely to have such a condition, making some pregnancies potentially more risky. Research also shows that, in mother of 40 or over, the proportion of babies born prematurely or with a low birth weight is greater. Source: NHS . It was no easy process, with a . regimen of hormonal shots. Work schedules were interrupted and vacations . postponed. But CIndy was committed. Cindy, . a executive director at a medical foundation in Chicago, said: 'The . thought of Emily and Mike not being able to have children and share that . piece of their lives with someone just broke my heart. 'I want Emily to have that connection with another human being like I had with her.' As her belly grew, people started asking Cindy about 'her baby.' However she was quick to correct them and reveal she was actually carrying her grandchild. While admitting she was worried about the physical toll a late pregnancy might take, Cindy said her body handled it better than she expected. She also wondered how well she'd bounce back from a Caesarean section. That's how she had delivered Emily and her older brother, but that had been three decades ago. Still, she reassured Emily and Mike throughout the pregnancy that the baby was fine, she was fine, everything would be fine. Humor helped. Mike often teased his mother-in-law each time they'd take her to dinner or do something nice for her. He asked: 'Are we even yet?', to which CIndy laughed and replied: 'Not yet.' In truth, Mike and Emily knew there'd really be no way to repay this kind of gesture. Emily added: 'This is a continuation of everything that she has done her entire life for me, which is to make sure that I have the best life possible.' Cindy with her daughter Emily. Despite the risks of older women having babies, the 53-year-old said she would consider doing it again . While admitting she was worried about the physical toll a late pregnancy might take, Cindy said her body handled it better than she expected . All they could do, they said, was to promise to raise their baby as best they could. And that was enough for Cindy. Cindy added: 'I know I gave a gift. But I'm also getting so much in return.' Last week, a few days after Emily's 32nd birthday, daughter sat next to mother, holding hands in the delivery room. And Elle Cynthia Jordan was born. 'She looks just like you! She looks just like you!' Emily shouted, running from the delivery room to introduce their newborn to Mike. Cindy, who is recovering well, even said she would consider doing it again. She added: 'When I watch both of them hold that baby and look into her face, it's like everything I could have imagined wanting for them - better than I could have imagined. 'This is what it was all about for me.'","Emily Jordan lost her chance of being able to conceive when she was forced to have a hysterectomy .

Two drivers in the notorious Cannonball Run have lost their licenses as French police clamp down on speeding and drink driving in the London to Paris race. Police stopped the drivers north of French city of Rennes after they were clocked driving at speeds of up to 99mph on a four-lane highway with a 68mph speed limit. Their licences were confiscated on just the second day of racing. Three other drivers were fined and another three were recorded as marginally exceeding the speed limit. Police clamp down: Two drivers in the Cannonball Run had their licenses' confiscated on just the second day of the annual race driving 99mph in a 68mph zone . Police also conducted drink driving checks on their route in France after the competitors had crossed the Channel by ferry earlier today. Fifty participants in crazy costumes and decked out super-motors took off yesterday for the annual Cannonball 2000, a 2,000 mile that takes drivers through five European cities. The race began in Portsmouth and participants were hoping to reach Barcelona by late today. A participant named David said: ‘We've had a briefing with the French police. Stopped en route: Many of the 50 participants were stopped by police at various spots such as the Bignon toll gates, near Nantes in western France . Day two of annual race: Spectators and photographers watched on as this Ferrari drove up to an alcohol control check in France . ‘They told us the speed limit on the highway is 130 km/h (80mph) and we shan't go faster. ‘That's what I'll do because I don't want to lose the car!’ Another participant called Robert, at the wheel of a black Ferrari, said: ‘It's going to be a very exciting day but we won't be in Barcelona before eight. ‘We can't go faster than the speed limits.’ Police clamp down: The police presence may reflect the criticism surrounding long-distance race events are dangerous . Waves while waiting: The driver of a Lamborghini waved for the camera as he is stopped by police near Nantes in western France today . The driver of a Maserati was more daring, saying Barcelona would be feasible ‘at this rate at 8pm, if no police at 4 or 5 pm’. The tour is named after the famous 1981 film Cannonball Run about a cross country race, starring Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore. Drivers travel from London to Barcelona and make their way through Monte Carlo and Milan before crossing the finish line on Paris’ Champs Elysees on Sunday. Long-distance race events, such as Cannonball, have received criticism after a driver in a rival event, Gumball 3000 Rally, was involved in a crash which killed an elderly Macedonian couple in 2007. Ready, set, go: The race began on Wednesday with 50 participants taking off from Portsmouth . Spidercar: Some drivers took the inspiration from superheroes like Spiderman when they dressed themselves and their car for the Cannonball 2000 race . Masked motorists: This pair donned Flintstones masks for the beginning of the race . Wealthy businessman Nicholas Morley was spared jail for his involvement in the accident which saw his Porsche 911 crash into Vladimir Chepunjoski, 67, and his wife Margarita’s Volkswagen Golf near the Albanian border in May five years ago. Based on the same principle as Cannonball 2000, each competitor pays £28,000 to enter Gumball 3000 which involves driving 3,000 miles from London to Athens and back, across Europe on public roads. Mr Morley was given a two-year-suspended sentence but the case raised questions about the safety risks of asking participants to drive long distances, sometimes 720 miles, in one day. Long journey: The race runs for 2000 miles through London to Barcelona and back via Milan, Monte Carlo and Paris . Gearing up: A participant decorates his car ahead of the start of the race in London yesterday . Cannonball 2000 Founder Gary Redman describes the cross-continent drive as a ‘pulsating five-day party with like minded people looking to enjoy some of the most amazing cities in the world'. The event sponsors children’s charity Dreams come True and donates a percentage of their proceeds to the charity which helps fulfill the wishes of terminally ill children. Well known participants included ex-boxer Ricky Hatton, Coronation Street actor Ryan Thomas and Emmerdale star Kevin Fletcher.

A woman has been killed and a man is fighting for his life after a horrific crash with their motorbike at a speed trials event. 38-year-old Charlotte Tagg, from Suffolk, was riding in the sidecar of a black Honda Asco when the motorbike crashed during the Brighton Speed Trials on Saturday. Witnesses said the bike failed to stop at the end of the track at the Dukes Mound end of Madeira Drive in the seaside town and smashed straight into a barrier. Under investigation: Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash in Madeira Drive, Brighton . The 64-year-old driver, from London, . was taken to Brighton’s Royal Sussex County Hospital following the crash . at 6.15pm and is said to be in a critical condition. Sergeant Huw Watts of Sussex Police’s Road Policing Unit said: ‘Although formal identification has not yet taken place we believe that the woman who tragically died at the Brighton Speed Trials is Charlotte. ‘Our thoughts are with her friends and family at this time. ‘We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision and would still like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police.’ Leonard Wooller vice chair of Brighton and Hove Motor Club said: ‘We don’t know what the cause of the accident was and we will have to wait for the results of the investigation. ‘We’ve not had a fatality at the event for many, many years. ‘It was a great event that unfortunately started slowly because police were investigating a stabbing in Madeira Drive and ended badly with this accident.’ Fatal crash: The female passenger of this black Honda Asco died and the male driver is in critical condition following the collision at the Brighton Speed Trials .

Deadly dispute: Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, 55, faces charges of murder, assault and seven counts wanton endangerment after allegedly opening fire inside Springdale Community Church on Thursday night . A long-running neighbourly dispute over a driveway turned deadly on Thursday night when a disgruntled doctor opened fire inside a local church. Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, a Louisville doctor who was recently told his driveway violated city zoning codes, fatally shot a neighbour and critically injured another at a homeowners association meeting inside a church, police said today. Hindi, 55, who was educated in Jordan,  faces charges of murder, assault and seven counts wanton endangerment after allegedly opening fire inside Springdale Community Church. There were 10 to 20 people inside the church,  including a bible group, when Hindi allegedly began shooting. None of the . bible group's members were injured, the church's pastor confirmed today. Police are investigating whether Hindi carried out the shooting after neighbors complained about his driveway and fence which led to city officials ruling that they violated zoning codes. Hindi also wrote a letter of complaint where he threatened to shoot 'any trespassers'. He wrote that if anyone doubted his intentions, 'try me and go ahead make my day.' In papers dated May 11, Musa Mahmoud Hindi, a family member living at the same residence, requested a waiver from the city to keep a driveway that had been constructed without proper permits. Spring Creek Homeowners Association attorney Mike Kelly said that the organization brought the zoning violation charges against Hindi. He said Hindi wrote him rambling letter in August 2011 that ranted about several neighbors in the high-end community that includes the most expensive private school in Kentucky. In the letter, Hindi cites the Quran, the theory of creationism, the idea that America has gone to Communism and accused neighbors of stealing his 'no trespassing signs' in the dispute over the fence. Hindi also wrote that he tried to make peace with the neighbors, but became frustrated. Kelly said he didn't know much about Hindi just that the association filed the action against him. Hindi's family members were surprised and puzzled by the shooting and arrest. Scroll down for video .

'Even his family does not know what happened,' Hindi Hassan said in a phone interview. 'What happened is still not clear.' 73-year-old David Merritt, died after being shot once in the head, said Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Jo-Ann Farmer. Farmer said the wounded man, whose identity was not immediately released, was hospitalized Friday at University of Louisville Hospital. Springdale Community Church is a popular community gathering place, hosting several youth sporting events.

Hindi wrote in the same letter to the association that he had been 'biting my teeth and exercising highest level of self-restraint' in dealing with the neighbors. 'As I always tell ... I will protect the sacred interest of my kids even if it comes to killing and even if I lose my own life in the course of doing so,' Hindi wrote. 'Thank God the house is paid off. I can pass away in peace with no concerns.' Hindi also referred to a letter from Kelly about the code violation issue as a 'stupid terrorist attempt.' 'If you ever dare to write my kids and pursue intimidation and harassment, you will be sorry; trust me,' Hindi wrote. The Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure lists Hindi as having been admitted to practice in Graves County in western Kentucky in March 2001. Hindi's license expired in February 2008.

A New Jersey congressman is under investigation for using campaign funds to cover personal expenses for a luxurious vacation in Scotland for his wife and two daughters. U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews (D-1st Dist.) splashed out more than $30,000 to attend the wedding of an unnamed donor - an expense that was vetted by his wife who serves as a volunteer compliance officer for the politician. The House Committee on Ethics ruled in early September there is 'substantial reason to believe' Andrews inappropriately used campaign funds for the family trip and the Committee will extend their investigation to fully review the matter. All in the family: Rep. Robert Andrews pictured in 2008 with his wife, Camille, (right, in red), his daughter Josie (right, in white sweater) and daughter Jacquelyn (far right) In June 2011, Andrews shelled out $7,725 for two rooms at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh for a three night stay. Additionally, his campaign covered $463 for a wedding gift from Bloomingdale's, $953 to cover incidentals like cabs rides, meals and tips and additional funds to pay for flowers and gifts. His leadership PAC had also covered the family's business class airfare across the pond, topping $16,575, and an extra $1,800 to cover airline change fees. But after the embarrassing expenses were reported in the local press last year, Andrews repaid $30,000 to his campaign. Nice digs: Andrews spent $7,725 for a three night stay at the posh hotel in Edinburgh . Andrews claimed the expenses were legitimate because the groom, who has not been identified for privacy concerns, was a donor. And though the donor did minimal volunteer work for the campaign and only donated $250 to the candidate, Andrews said he planned the trip to 'deepen his ties' to the friend of the campaign. But the federal panel disagreed. 'The facts do not establish that Representative Andrews’ relationship to Witness 1 [the unnamed donor] was of a bona fide campaign of . political nature that had a clear nexus to any political benefit, . illustrating that the trip’s purpose was for a family vacation to the . wedding of a personal friend,' the report, released on August 31, said. The use of campaign money for the Andrews family trip was approved by his wife, Camille, a lawyer and associate dean at the Rutgers-Camden law school, who is in charge of reviewing legal questions about her husband's political spending. But critics point to the clear conflict of interest that his wife would have in sanctioning the swanky hotel stay and covering other questionable costs. 'Having your wife as the compliance officer is just asking for trouble, Meredith McGehee, the policy director at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Daddy's little girl: Josie Andrews is an aspiring singer, who often accompanied her father to Los Angeles as she pursued her entertainment endeavors. The 17-year-old (right) is flanked by her supportive parents . 'She has a vested interest in the resources and in the benefits that were provided by the campaign as the spouse.' But . Andrews is standing by the integrity of his wife in the matter, telling . The Inquirer she has 'followed both the letter and spirit of the law in . all respects.' 'In a political world filled with . complex political and legal issues, it is entirely appropriate for me to . seek additional advice and guidance from a trusted and experienced . lawyer who also is the person I am closest to in life,' he said. After the Scottish nuptials, the Andrews clan stuck around Europe for a longer stay. 'We're convinced this is an appropriate expenditure to thank and support someone who has given us a lot of time and effort,' Andrews told The New Jersey Star-Ledger about using campaign money for the Scotland leg of their journey. 'We wouldn't have gone on the Scotland trip but for the fact that this person is an adviser and donor to us,' he added. Veteran politician: Rep. Rob Andrews, 55, has served in Congress for 21 years . But the swanky accommodations for their Edinburgh getaway are not the only expenses that have come under scrutiny. In June of last year, $10,000 from the congressman's campaign fund was used to cover catering expenses for a party thrown as a joint celebration of Andrews' 20th year in Congress and his daughter's high school graduation. The shindig, at the family home in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, was attended by 300 guests. Two separate invitations were sent out. The first inviting donors and those connected to the congressman and a second version was sent to celebrate the graduation of his daughter, Jacqueline, from the Baldwin School - an exclusive girl's prep school in Philadelphia. A member of Andrews' staff maintains that the majority of guests were connected to the campaign, saying only 10 per cent of those attending were connected to the high school grad. And expenses for the politician's other daughter, Josie, have also been called into question. The girl is an aspiring actress and singer and she frequently accompanies her father to Los Angeles, where he travels for fundraising events. These campaign events conveniently coincide with her acting auditions and recording sessions and according to the Twitter account for the 17-year-old, her home city is listed as Los Angeles. According to campaign filings, an investigation found that the congressman spent $97,000 on at least 18 trips to California from 2007 to 2011. 'She has come with me on trips to California to do some of her business, but she’s always part of my business as well,' the father said about covering costs for Josie in Hollywood. In addition to the Congressional investigation into his spending, Andrews faces a Federal Election Commission complaint that has been filed by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 'While the inquiry undoubtedly will drag on for months,' Melanie Sloan, the executive director of the nonprofit watchdog, said, 'it's hard to fathom a scenario in which Rep. Andrews walks away from this unscathed.'","U.S. Rep.

A 7-year-old girl who contracted the bubonic plague during a camping trip with her family is set to leave the hospital after nearly succumbing to the rare and extremely deadly disease last month. Seen taking her first steps this weekend, Sierra Jane Downing is said to be lucky to be alive after experiencing a series of unusual symptoms that left doctors in Denver, Colorado struggling for a cure. Just five days after that camping trip on August 19, Sierra's parents found her on the bathroom floor of their home after suffering a seizure that stopped her breathing. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Seen wheeled out of her hospital room earlier this week, 7-year-old Sierra Jane Downing is the latest survivor of the bubonic plague in the U.S. Rushing the child to a local hospital before airlifting her to Denver's Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, doctors were continually stumped on what was wrong with the girl, as her condition deteriorated. 'I thought, ""Oh my gosh, we're going to lose her."" I was very concerned,' her mother Darcy Downing told ABC News. 'I remember leaving that morning very scared that when I came back that night she wasn't going to survive,' Dr Jennifer Snow recounted to ABC. It was a paediatric doctor at the Rocky Mountain Hospital who got the first inkling that she had the bubonic plague, a rare disease that Federal health officials say is reported an average of seven times in the U.S. each year. Struck down: Doctors believe Sierra Jane Downing, pictured, contracted the plague from a dead squirrel while camping . Rarity: Showing the disease on a petre dish, infectious disease specialist Dr Wendi Drummond who treated Sierra said she's never seen it herself before until now . 'There's a saying in medicine: if you hear hoof beats, look for horses,' the hospital's infectious disease specialist Dr Wendi Drummond told ABC. 'But you don't want to forget about the zebras - the more unusual, uncommon diseases. And in this case, this is a zebra,' she said. The doctor figured it out using Sierra's symptoms, a history of where she'd been, as well as an online journal search. The bubonic plague hasn't been confirmed in a human in Colorado since 2006. Doctors believe Sierra Jane Downing contracted the disease, also known as the 'black death', from a dead squirrel while camping with her family in Pagosa Springs. Victim: Sierra Jane Downing, seven, from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, is pushed in a wheel chair by a nurse following a news conference about her recovery from Bubonic Plague . Success: Sierra is expected to be released from the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at St Luke's on Monday . In a news conference on Wednesday, . Sierra's parents recounted their daughter asking if she could bury the . squirrel that was found half-eaten in the woods. While her parents said no, the girl is said to have returned to the animal and after kneeling beside it, dropped her sweater to the ground. Fleas, most likely jumping onto that sweater her doctors reason, are common transmitters of the plague. 'She had a high heart rate and low blood pressure,' Dr Snow said. 'It all originally pointed to signs of what's called septic shock.' With the doctors’ fast thinking, they were able to set her on a course of gentamicin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Team: Seven-year-old Sierra Jane looks on while surrounded by medical staff and parents Sean and Darcy Downing during a news conference talking about her recovery from Bubonic Plague . Revelling in her daughter’s dramatically improved health this week, Mrs Downing praised the doctors for their help in saving her daughter’s life. 'They set her on my lap and she just melted into me and she said, ""Mommy, it feels so good to be held,"" her mother said. 'That was the best moment. The best.' Doctors say Sierra will make a full recovery and is expected to be released on Monday. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. 'It's . one of those things that you don't necessarily expect to see,' Dr . Drummond said. 'But, it's definitely one of those things you don't want . to miss.' Bubonic plague symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. The symptoms include: . Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive.

'Chaos': Police said the house resembled a 'World War I battlefield' after the boozy party (file photo) German lawmakers are stepping up their attempts to make Facebook pay for police and medical services after a weekend 'horror party' advertised on the social networking site saw an attempted murder, a man fall into a bonfire and a schoolboy needing treatment for alcoholic poisoning. The party took place in Lengdorf in . Bavaria after being posted on the Facebook site. Over 200 people . converged on the house of the host - who organised the event while his . parents were away - and chaos quickly ensued.An . 18-year-old youth was taken into custody after assaulting another . guest, 19, in the street outside with a lethal butterfly knife. Then an . ambulance had to be called to help a severely burned man who fell into . the bonfire in the back garden, sustaining injuries to his arms and . hands. As well as various fights, broken . glass and smashed furniture, an ambulance had to race another guest to . hospital with severe alcohol poisoning after downing a bottle of vodka. 'It . looked like a WWI battlefield rather than a house,' said a police . spokesman. 'The house was wrecked, just a giant mountain of rubbish.' The . boy who threw the party had expected 20 guests to turn up. But as is so . often the case with events posted on Facebook, strangers descended in . their dozens. Hundreds of miles away in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near the Baltic Sea, a major police alert was triggered after a man posted on Facebook that he wanted to murder the new boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend before taking his own life. He uploaded a photo of himself on to the site with a firearm to make his point. Police in Boizenburg moved in to arrest him and he barricaded himself into his apartment and pointed his rifle out the window at police. He threatened to blow up his apartment building if they did not leave but gave himself up after a tense one-hour standoff on Saturday night. Police said later he was found to be under the influence of drugs. 'He was psychotic,' said a police spokesman. The incidents have reinforced calls from politicians for Facebook to be accountable for the costs of such police and medical operations in the wake of postings on the site. In August police were forced to halt passenger trains after a party organised on Facebook turned into a riot. As roadblocks turned away more and more guests heading to the rave-up at Freiburg in southern Germany they spilled on to nearby railway tracks. Police had to halt trains as they cleared the lines - and pledged someone would pay. 'We have enough work to do as it without having to act as servants for some dumb social network,' said an angry police spokesman after officers endured abuse, dodged flying bottles and stopped fighting among the 400 guests who turned up to the party organised by twin sisters at their home while their parents were on holiday. Gatecrashers: Details of the party in Bavaria were posted on Facebook . Rail traffic to and from Freiburg - a major hub on the way to Switzerland - was delayed for 25 minutes as a result of the party.Reinhold Gall, interior minister of the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg - where Freiburg lies - is supporting a cross-party initiative to get legislation passed in Berlin for Facebook to cough up.He said: 'A commercial internet platform that makes something like this possible also carries a large measure of responsibility. Somebody must pay for this.' Rainer Wendt, chairman of the German Police Union, said: 'If you invite people to a Facebook party that sparks a police intervention, you will have to pay the costs. But politicians should create the legal basis for making Facebook share the costs.'The firm has made the platform available, and can't pretend it has nothing to do with it.' Student Jay Whiston died after being stabbed in the chest at a house party in Colchester, Essex, at the weekend. Around 200 people had descended on the party after word of the event spread on Facebook and Twitter. The 17-year-old was knifed as he tried to stop troublemakers stealing his friend's phone.","More than 200 people descended on house in Germany after party details were posted on Facebook .

A historic saddle used by Queen Elizabeth I and once owned by the late writer Miles Kington, who joked it holds a bizarre and terrible curse, is expected to fetch more than £10,000 at auction. The emerald green quilted saddlecloth, used by the Virgin Queen on a Royal visit to Bristol in 1574, will go under the hammer at auctioneer Dreweatts’ sale of militaria at Donnington Priory near Newbury, Berks, on September 26. It is elaborately decorated with gold lace and a gold fringe and has been an heirloom in the Kington family for generations. By Royal appointment: The saddle used by Queen Elizabeth I on her state . visit to Bristol in 1574. It was owned by Writer Miles Kington . who joked it held a terrible curse . Elizabeth used the saddle as she rode through the cobbled streets of Bristol in a spectacular procession in 1574 where she watched a three-day mock battle and received a £100 gift of gold from the city leaders. Kington, a brilliant columnist who wrote for The Times, The Independent and Punch was best-known for his hilarious Let’s Parler Franglais! books, before his death from cancer four years ago, aged 66. But the man who once sent an urgent telegram from Peru ‘Glenfiddich here very warm, please send ice,’ kept The Kington Saddle a closely-guarded secret - until now. The saddlecloth is estimated to sell for £8,000 to £10,000 when it goes under the hammer . And there will be an added bonus for the successful bidder. For . Miles Kington explained the untold story of The Kington Saddle, in his . own inimitable style, to his wife Caroline shortly before his death and a . copy will be included in the sale. Two former owners: The late wit Miles Kington, left, and Queen Elizabeth I seen in a 16th century portrait . Dreweatts’ militaria specialist Malcolm Claridge said: 'Queen Elizabeth I’s saddlecloth is an absolutely unique Royal artefact from the Elizabethan era. 'It is in extremely good condition considering it is 438 years old, and we are expecting a lot of international interest. 'It is mounted in a glass display case and bears a plaque which states ‘Queen Elizabeth’s Saddle, on which she rode on her State visit to Bristol 1574. Afterwards presented to a member of the Kington family’.' In the note to his wife, Miles Kington wrote: 'My dear Caroline, I . sometimes worry that I may pass on to the other side before I have . handed down to you the secret of the Kington Saddle. 'Ridiculous, I know, as the doctor has said given reasonable treatment . and a visit to the pub every now and then, there’s no reason why I . shouldn’t last another 40 years, but nevertheless I think perhaps the . time has come to tell the dread secret of the Kington Saddle. 'But it’s just a silly old priceless family heirloom sitting in an old glass case, I hear you laugh. 'There’s nothing secret about it at all .... Ah, would that it were so. History: The saddle, which was passed down from generation to generation of the Kington family, is expected to fetch more than £10,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction later this month . 'But this Kington Saddle has been handed down through eight or nine of . maybe seventeen generations of the Kington family, all of whom are now . dead. 'Yes, every single previous owner of the Kington Saddle is now in another place, and it’s not Saudi Arabia I’m talking about. 'Why do you think they were all struck down before they reached 100? Why . do you think nobody ever gets the Kington Saddle out and rides around . on it on a horse? 'Why, above all, do you think nobody ever wants to have it in their . house, and everyone whispers furtively: ‘Let’s give it to cousin . Laurence ... Let’s put it in a museum ... ?’ 'I’ll tell you. 'It’s because of the curse of the Kington Saddle. The curse which has . scattered the family far afield, from Wrexham to London, from London to . Bath, and from Bath to a crazy steam railway between Keighley and . Haworth only five miles long, for God’s sake.

Arrested: Sabrina Ann Howard, 40, was arrested on preliminary charges of causing suicide and neglect to her 16-year-old son Charles . A mother whose 16-year-old son committed suicide is accused of driving him to take his own life because he lived in constant fear that her drug addiction would lead her to a fatal overdose, court documents state. Sabrina A. Howard, 40, of Muncie, Indiana, was arrested on Monday on preliminary charges of causing suicide and neglect in the death of her son, Charles, who died of an overdose of prescription medication. According to a probable cause affidavit, Howard found her son, Charles, unresponsive on a couch in their home on July 10 after suspecting he had stolen her prescription pulls. She did not seek medical help. He died the next day, and his death was ruled a suicide attributed to high levels of prescription medications. She has not yet been formally charged but was being held without bond Tuesday at the Delaware County Jail. Relatives . told police that Howard was a morphine addict and her son 'was in great . duress' from confronting her over her addiction and his fear that she . might overdose, the affidavit says. Charles . Howard threatened to kill himself in January, the affidavit states, but . Howard told officers she ignored medical advice to sign him into a . treatment center because he 'didn't want to go.' Scroll down for video . Killed: Charles Howard, 16, died on his mother's couch following an overdose of her prescription medication, hours after she confronted him about taking her pills . Indiana has had a causing suicide law on the books since 1976, but it has been used rarely, if at all. Fran Lee Watson, an Indiana University law professor, said she can't recall any prosecutions for causing suicide in her more than 30 years of practicing law in Indiana. As written, the law applies to 'a person who intentionally causes another human being, by force, duress, or deception, to commit suicide.' Watson said that means prosecutors would have to prove Howard intentionally caused her son's death. 'They have to show that by duress she intended to bring about his suicide as opposed to failing to get him medical care when she should have reasonably assumed that he had ingested her medication,' Watson said. 'That's what intentionally means under Indiana law - that her intent was to bring about a specific result.' Similar charges have been rejected by courts over the last decade. In 2006, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Connecticut woman who prosecutors said kept such a messy home that it endangered her 12-year-old son's safety and mental health. The boy, Daniel Scruggs, killed himself in 2002, and the case sparked a national debate over what responsibility a parent holds for a child's suicide. Concerned: Family of the teen say he was depressed over his mother's drug use and her reluctance to quit that drove him to also attempt suicide in January . The court in the Scruggs case found prosecutors couldn't identify objective standards to determine when a messy house becomes a risk to a child's mental health. In Howard's case, prosecutors may still be weighing whether to proceed with the causing suicide charge, Watson said. Messages left for the Delaware County prosecutor weren't immediately returned Tuesday. Jail records listed no attorney for Howard. According to the probable cause affidavit, Howard told officers on July 10 that she thought her son had taken her pills - including 30 Xanax and 26 Lortabs - when she found him on the couch. In an interview with police days later, she said she confronted her son about 8.30 am on July 10 about drugs that were missing. She said he denied taking them but she suspected otherwise because he had slow speech and was 'groggy acting.' Ignored: Hours before his death the mother said she confronted her son on her couch about taking her pills and though he denied it she told police he appeared groggy . 'Sabrina even told Charles that what he consumed could kill him,' the affidavit says. But Howard allegedly did not seek medical help for her son. She told police she instead checked on him periodically during the day as he slept on a couch to make sure 'he was still breathing.' Howard called 911 about eight hours later, at 4.45 pm, after she checked on Charles and found him not breathing and with a grayish/white skin color. According to the affidavit, Howard told officers that she was a former intravenous morphine abuser. But officers said in the document they noticed what appeared to be 'fresh track marks on her left wrist/hand area' and relatives told them 'she is still using.' A relative who answered the telephone on Tuesday at Howard's parents' home said the family has been devastated by the charges and did not want to speak to media. Stephanie McFarland, a spokesman for Indiana's Department of Child Services, said the agency had contact with Howard's family 'recently.' But she said she could not comment further because of state and federal confidentiality laws. Watch the video here: .

Two factory fires which broke out in the Pakistan cities of Karachi and Lahore have claimed 216 lives and injured dozens more. Workers have revealed how they jumped from third floor windows to escape the blaze at a garment factory in Karachi, where many of the 191 victims were trapped in a basement. In Lahore, staff at a shoe factory claimed a faulty generator sparked the fire which killed 25 people. Blaze: Firefighters extinguish flames at the garment factory in Karachi . Rescue: The fire crews attempt to save workers within the Karachi factory . Grief: A woman mourns the loss of at least one relative outside the Karachi factory . Firefighters were still trying to subdue the blaze in Karachi this morning, as hospital staff revealed its morgue was full with 'around 30 bodies burnt beyond recognition all lined up'. 'People started screaming for their . lives,' said factory worker Mohammad Asif, 20. 'Everyone came to the window. I jumped . from the third floor.' Another worker, Liaqat Hussain, 29, spoke from his hospital bed where he was being treated for burns all over his body. He said: 'Within two minutes there was fire in . the entire factory. 'The gate was closed. There was no access to get out, we were trapped inside.' Doomed: Firefighters remove the body of one of the trapped Karachi workers .

Critics say Pakistan's government is too corrupt and ineffective to focus on the welfare of workers and a dizzying array of other problems, from crippling power cuts, to widespread poverty to a Taliban insurgency. In Lahore, workers at the shoe factory suspected that the fire was caused by a problem with a generator. 'We saw our colleagues burning alive, in flames,' said Shabdir Hussain, from his hospital bed. 'We could do nothing. We saved our lives by jumping from the roof.' Successive governments have been unable to provide a reliable power supply so factories have to have their own generators, powered by diesel or petrol, if they want to avoid regular, lengthy power cuts.","Simultaneous fires in Karachi garment factory and Lahore shoe factory .

A condemned Ohio inmate who weighs at least 480 pounds wants his upcoming execution delayed, saying his weight could lead to a 'torturous and lingering death.' Ronald Post, who shot and killed a hotel clerk in northern Ohio almost 30 years ago, said his weight, vein access, scar tissue and other medical problems raise the likelihood his executioners would encounter severe problems. He's also so big that the execution gurney might not hold him, lawyers for Post said in federal court papers filed on Friday. Big problem: Death row inmate Ronald Post, 53, who weights 480lbs with a scheduled date for execution set for January of 2013 claims he's too big to be easily and humanely killed . 'Indeed, given his unique physical and medical condition there is a substantial risk that any attempt to execute him will result in serious physical and psychological pain to him, as well as an execution involving a torturous and lingering death,' the filing said. Post, 53, is scheduled to die Jan. 16 for the 1983 death of 53-year-old Helen Vantz in Elyria who was robbed before found shot twice in the back of her head. The prisons department was not aware of the filing over his execution and could not immediately comment. Inmates' weight has come up previously in death penalty cases in Ohio and elsewhere. Breakable: A gurney is seen at a Virginia Correctional Facility, similar to one in Ohio which Posts claims he could also break if placed on due to his size . Vein trouble: It took executioners two hours to insert IVs into the veins of Christopher J. Newton in 2007, pictured, who weighed about 265lbs . In 2008, federal courts rejected arguments by condemned double-killer Richard Cooey that he was too obese to die by injection. Cooey's attorneys had argued that prison food and limited opportunities to exercise contributed to a weight problem that would make it difficult for the execution team to find a viable vein for lethal injection. Cooey, who was 5-foot-7 and weighed 267 pounds, was executed Oct. 14, 2008. In 2007, it took Ohio executioners about two hours to insert IVs into the veins of condemned inmate Christopher Newton, who weighed about 265 pounds. A prison spokeswoman at the time said his size was an issue. In 1994 in Washington state, a federal judge upheld the conviction of Mitchell Rupe, but agreed with Rupe's contention that at more than 400 pounds, he was too heavy to hang because of the risk of decapitation. Rupe argued that hanging would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. After numerous court rulings and a third trial, Rupe was eventually sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2006. Ohio executes inmates with a single dose of pentobarbital, usually injected through the arms. Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation . Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible . Medical personnel have had a hard time inserting IVs into Post's arms, according to the court filing. Four years ago, an Ohio State University medical center nurse needed three attempts to insert an IV into Post's left arm, the lawyers wrote. Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, according to his court filing. While at the Mansfield Correctional Institution, Post 'used that prison's exercise bike until it broke under his weight,' according to the filing. As an Ohio State diner, incarcerated for nearly the last 30 years, among the meals offered to inmates are options of non-pork and vegetarian meals, as well as a special alternative mixed loaf - the ingredients depending in the meal's time - for segregated inmates. Regular meals are said to cost $1.70 each. While Ohio's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction does offer a food package program available for purchase from outside sources, including everything from candy and pre-packaged pastries to pouched tuna fish, Post is ineligible for them. Upset about Post's delayed execution last year, the victim's son William Vantz published a letter with the Morning Journal expressing his family's need for closure through Post's own death, that has waited over 29 years. 'I am now 54 years old, a year older than my mother at the time of her murder. We, my family and friends have waited too long for the day that he is executed for this heinous crime. Some did not live long enough to see the day that justice is served.' Mr Vantz continues to resolve that no closure will come to him and his family from Post living out a life sentence behind bars.","Death row inmate Ronald Post claims his weight, vein access and scar tissue would prevent a humane execution .

A group of scouts thought their tired old hut was going to be completely transformed when it was accepted onto a popular TV makeover show. But the leaders of the 24th Abingdon Scouts in Oxfordshire claim the building was left an 'unusable shambles' with a leaky roof after a team from Channel Five's Operation Homefront had finished work on it. As soon as the cameras were switched off after filming of the show - presented by Suzi Perry - problems started to develop. Complaints: Scout leaders Gary Thorne (left) and David Grimes (right) claim their troop's hut was left unusable after the team from Operation Homefront finished work on it . Members of the Scout troop have been forced to hold meetings outdoors and their leaders have appealed for help to finish off a list of 100 jobs. The hut has been left with a leaking roof, incomplete electrics and plumbing and dangerous fire exits. The show sees groups of ex-servicemen transform projects struggling with manpower. Problems: The hut was left with a leaking roof and a list of other problems following filming of the show . A team from the programme carried out . the work over four days at the beginning of August with the programme . set to air next month. However, it seems the team may have . taken on more than it bargained for when it offered to demolish the old . 1940s building, then move and renovate the Scouts’ ‘Terrapin’ huts . nearby. Perry, who has hosted The Gadget Show and the BBC’s MotoGP coverage, tweeted during the renovation: 'The Scout hut rebuild is chugging along but we definitely took on a bit too much.' Soaked: The Scouts have asked for help with fixing the list of around 100 jobs that still need doing to the hut (Mr Thorne is pictured here next to more water covering its floor) Unhappy: Mr Grimes crouches next to a puddle of water which has seeped in from the hut's leaking roof . The Scout group, which has about 25 . members, returned from its summer break but was unable to use the . building and instead met at the nearby nature reserve. Scout leader David Grimes said the hut was unusable. 'Fair enough, they have achieved more in four days than we could in weeks but we can’t use it as it is,' he said. 'It is a shambles.' A spokesman for NorthOne TV, which produces the show, said: 'We brought in what amounted to tens of thousands of pounds worth of materials and manpower, as well as the complex project management behind it. Front woman: Suzy Perry presents Operation Homefront, whose team were slammed by scout leaders . 'There is always going to be what’s called a ‘finishing list’ of jobs which need to be completed when you undertake something of this scale - but the substance of what was achieved was phenomenal. 'One of the Scout leaders went as far as saying the original hut was lucky not to have been condemned - and the whole place amounted to ‘a prayer that needed answering’.' The spokesman added: 'We are in constant contact with the Scout group secretary and will continue to help them on a few jobs which need finishing. 'We agreed what we would do to the Scout hut and we feel we have delivered on it.' Opinions also appear to be divided within the Scout group over the work carried out by Operation Homefront. The troop's secretary Julie Mansbridge said she and others were 'hugely grateful for Operation Homefronts renovation.' 'They achieved in four days what would have taken us four years in terms of workload and tens of thousands in financial assistance,' she said.","Suzi Perry of Operation Homefront tweeted: 'We took on a bit too much'

The Met Office was criticised over inaccurate forecasts ahead of the Big Freeze winter two years ago. However, it now claims it is far better at predicting cold snaps weeks in advance. Forecasters have come up with a computer program which can track changes high up in the atmosphere, which are thought to be key to extreme cold spells. Got it wrong: The Met Office was criticised over inaccurate forecasts ahead of the Big Freeze in the winter of 2010, pictured, but now claim it is better at predicting cold snaps . This ‘high top’ system includes weather patterns called sudden stratospheric warmings – SSWs – which block warm air flowing across the Atlantic to Northern Europe and cause temperatures to plunge. It was found in a study by Met Office climate experts to perform better than the model used at the time and would have predicted the weather chaos with more certainty. When the new system was used the following winter, it was able to predict freezing temperatures two months in advance, it said. Forecasters insist they did warn about low temperatures in 2009-10 when the coldest winter for a century saw Britain blanketed in snow and the mercury plunge to minus 17.6C (0.3F). They installed the new model in late . 2010, and tested it retrospectively for predicting weather from the . previous October to February in a study published in Environmental . Research Letters. Co-author Jeff Knight said by October 2010 the high . top version of their computing system – named GloSea4 – was ‘indicating . an increased chance of a cold start to winter’. Better model: Forecasters have developed a computer program that can track changes high in the atmosphere, thought to be key to extreme cold spells . He said: ‘That year December was the second coldest in 350 years. It also highlighted the possibility that conditions in late winter were likely to be less harsh, which was indeed the case. ‘In 2011, GloSea4 predicted that a mild, westerly winter was likely. This turned out to be the case – only the first two weeks of February 2012 were cold.’ Ninety-day forecasts for the public were ditched in 2009 after a predicted ‘barbecue summer’ turned out to be a washout. The public can see a 30-day forecast and seasonal forecasts are only given to government and businesses. Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: ‘The public have said they don’t find three-monthly outlooks useful because they are not the kind of thing you can plan a day trip out on.’ The World Meteorological Organisation yesterday said the hottest temperature ever recorded – 58C (136.4F) at El Azizia in Libya 90 years ago – was incorrect. The record is now held by Death Valley in California at 56.7C (134°F) on July 10, 1913.","The Met Office claim to have developed a far better way of predicting cold snaps weeks in advance .

The Commons could sit in the Olympic Park or Birmingham while MPs are made homeless to allow major building work to be carried out on the Houses of Parliament. At least £1bn of maintenance is needed to remove asbestos, repair brickwork and upgrade water and electricity supplies. Commons officials claim trying to do the work in parts while MPs and peers are on holiday could take years, and cost billions more. Hitting the road: MPs will have to leave the House of Parliament for £1 billion of work to be carried out . Today MPs lined up to back the idea of hitting the road, and suggested alternative sites. John Thurso, speaking for the House of Commons Commission, said ‘all options can be placed on the table’. He added: ‘From my experience I have found it is usually better to leave for two years, or whatever, and get the job done, than be inconvenienced and unable to work properly for 10 years.’ It had been thought that if MPs did vacate the famous green benches it would be to a site nearby, possibly in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower or across the road the QE2 conference centre. The House of Commons chamber would stand empty while the repairs are carried out . One MP wants to move Parliament to Birminngham (left) which would be a change in style to the House of Lords . But Mr Thurso said he was willing to consider ideas from MPs that they look further afield. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who left government in last week’s reshuffle, said made a ‘shameless bid that if Parliament is going to decant, it decants to Birmingham’. The MP for nearby Lichfield added: ‘Why not, it's our second city?’But Labour Meg Hillier made a rival bid for her part of London, claiming the Olympic media centre in Hackneym, where she is MP, could be a ‘fantastic facility’ ‘While awaiting a tenant (it) could happily house Parliament in the interim while the work is done, with a seven-minute shuttle to St Pancras, City Airport on the doorstep, excellent transport links, 20 minutes to Westminster. ‘Would the House of Commons Commission consider a temporary relocation of Parliament to 'eastminster'?’ One idea being considered by Commons officials is moving Parliament to the International Broadcast Centre in the Olympic Park . MPs would be able to take a dip in the Olympic pool during breaks between debates if they moved to Stratford . A report into what work needs to be done – and how long it will take – is being finalised. Parliamentary officials are struggling to find a cost effective way of carrying out the repairs while Parliament continues to function on site. In the Commons today no MP spoke against the idea of a shipping out of Westminster. Asked about the final bill for the building work, Mr Thurso admitted it is ‘difficult at this stage to make a proper assessment of cost’. Major work has not been carried out on the building's interior since it was bombed in 1941. Lib Dem MP John Thurso (right) said major work had not been carried out since the building was repaired after being bombed in 1941 . He added: ‘What the commission will do is ensure it pursues the best value for money, being the combination of the lowest cost option with keeping Parliament functioning properly.’ The Houses of Parliament in Westminster cost about £30m a year to run. Each month the European Parliament relocates from its Brussels base to sit in Strasbourg.

A gipsy thrown off a  campsite after her son threatened other travellers with a gun suffered a breach of her human rights, European judges ruled yesterday. Maria Buckland and her family were evicted after being accused of causing a ‘very substantial nuisance’ and presenting ‘a risk of disturbance and violence’. Despite a series of appeals being rejected by Britain’s highest courts, judges in Strasbourg yesterday ruled the eviction was an ‘extreme’ interference with the 53-year-old’s human rights. 'Nuisance': Maria Buckland, 53, and her family were evicted from Cae Garw caravan park in Port Talbot, South Wales, a local authority site operated by the Gipsy council . They also ruled she should receive £3,400 to compensate her for ‘feelings of frustration and injustice’. The judgment by the European Court of Human Rights could now pave the way for other traveller families to use human rights grounds to fight eviction orders. The Buckland family first moved to the Cae Garw caravan park in Port Talbot, South Wales, in 1999. Six years later the Gipsy Council – the traveller-run organisation which operated the local authority-owned site – obtained a possession order claiming Mrs Buckland and five others were causing trouble. The family were, the Council said, ‘guilty of causing very substantial nuisance’. In November 2007, three Appeal Court judges headed by Lord Justice Dyson upheld a possession order against Mrs Buckland, saying that she had a ‘generally disruptive  family’ with a ‘culture of disrespect’ who ‘presented a risk of disturbance and violence’. The European judges admitted that, during another appeal, a Swansea county court judge ‘was satisfied that her son, who resided part of the time with her, had been involved in an incident in which he threatened someone with a gun, although it was not clear whether the gun had been real or an imitation; and had dumped garden refuse’. Ruling: The judgment by the European Court of Human Rights could pave the way for other traveller families to use human rights grounds to fight eviction orders . However they claimed that the only wrong committed by Mrs Buckland herself was the failure to pay a £95 water bill. They ruled that British judges had been wrong to claim the eviction order was beyond challenge, ruling it should have been considered in the light of Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees respect for a person’s home, private and family life. They said: ‘The loss of one’s home is the most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home. Any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal.’ In total Mrs Buckland - who left the site in May 2008 to live on land owned by her brother, which had no planning permission for residential use – was awarded nearly £7,000 in damages and legal costs. In past cases British courts have ruled against traveller families  who have protested that evictions break their human rights, especially when there has been evidence of their  disruptive behaviour. Mrs Buckland’s case is thought to have cost taxpayers around £80,000 in legal aid and local authority fees on its way through the British court. Legal aid is not paid by the taxpayer to support cases in Strasbourg.","Maria Buckland, 53, and her family were evicted from a local authority site operated by the Gipsy council .

Mrs Read was suffering from bowel cancer and they died by taking an overdose of the painkiller she had been given to cope with the pain. Her husband was suffering from the painful bowel condition Crohn’s Disease but was otherwise well and chose to end his life because he could not face living without his wife. The day before their double suicide pact they asked their children to move their bed into the living room of their waterside home so they had a view of the River Torridge as they lay in it. Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland recorded a verdict of suicide on the couple, who were found dead at Bideford in June. She told in inquest at Barnstaple: 'I am satisfied they took a cocktail of prescribed drugs to carry out a suicide pact. We have all been touched by this very tragic tale.' The couple’s son Duncan Read told in a statement how his parents were devoted to each other and said: 'They were completely united and the best of friends.' Police Sergeant Charles Morris, who was called to the house, said: 'The deceased were found in bed lying side by side with the male’s head leaning on his wife’s. His left hand was holding his wife’s.' The couple’s GP Dr Alison Stapley said she had spoken at length to Mrs Read, who told her she did not want treatment to prolong her life but gave no indication of considering suicide.

Japanese factories have been forced to temporarily close in China and expatriate workers advised to stay indoors after angry protests over ownership of islands in the East China Sea spilled on to the streets. Over the weekend in China there have been violent attacks on well-known Japanese businesses such as car-makers Toyota and Honda in the country's worst outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in decades. The dispute over the islands, known as the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China, now threatens to seriously damage trade ties between Asia's two biggest economies with Chinese state media warning that trade relations are in jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Protesters march during an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong province yesterday - they are angry about Japan's 'nationalizing' of the disputed Diaoyu Islands . The long-standing dispute erupted last week when the Japanese government decided to buy some of the islands from a private Japanese owner . 'I'm not going out today and I've asked . my Chinese boyfriend to be with me all day tomorrow,' said Sayo . Morimoto, a 29-year-old Japanese graduate student at a university in . Shenzhen. Japanese housewife and mother Kayo Kubo, who lives in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, said her young family and other Japanese expats were also staying home after being terrified by the scale and mood of the weekend protests in dozens of cities. 'There were so many people and I've never seen anything like it. It was very scary,' she said. China and Japan, which generated two-way trade of $345 billion last year, are arguing over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, a long-standing dispute that erupted last week when the Japanese government decided to buy some of them from a private Japanese owner. The move, which infuriated Beijing, . was intended by Japan's government to fend off what it feared would be . seen as an even more provocative plan by the nationalist governor of . Tokyo to buy and build facilities on the islands. A protestor hurls a tear gas bottle back at police during the weekend's violent scuffles which included attacks on well-known Japanese businesses such as car-makers Toyota and Honda . A demonstrator throws flowerpots towards the police as thousands of protesters take to the streets . A Chinese policeman emerges from a closed Japanese restaurant covered with Chinese national flags and banners saying 'it is Chinese-owned' In response, China sent six . surveillance ships to the area, which contains potentially large gas . reserves. Today a flotilla of around 1,000 Chinese fishing boats . were sailing for the islands and are due to reach them later in the day, . the state-owned People's Daily said on its microblog. The weekend's protests mainly . targeted Japanese diplomatic missions but also shops, restaurants and . car dealerships in at least five cities. Toyota and Honda said arsonists . had badly damaged their stores in the eastern port city of Qingdao at . the weekend. Toyota said its factories and . offices were operating as normal again today and workers were back in work, however, Japanese electronics group Panasonic . said one of its plants had been sabotaged by Chinese workers and would . remain closed through tomorrow - the anniversary of Japan's 1931 . occupation of parts of mainland China. Tokyo fears the date could . cause another dangerous outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment. Many Japanese schools across . China, including in Beijing and Shanghai, have cancelled classes this . week. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko . Noda, who met visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta today, . urged Beijing to ensure Japan's people and property were protected. Panetta said the U.S. would . stand by its security treaty obligations to Japan but not take sides in . the row, and urged calm and restraint on both sides in their dispute . over the islands. 'It is in everybody's interest ... for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to . avoid further escalation,' he told reporters In Tokyo. Tens of thousands of protesters gather outside the city headquarters of Communist Party in Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong province on Sunday . The angry protestors face-up to riot police as cans of tears gas are launched by officers against mob . Demonstrators surround a team of paramilitary police officers in the worst outbreak of anti-Japanese sentiment in decades . The overseas edition of the People's . Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, warned that . Beijing could resort to economic retaliation if the dispute festers. 'How could it be that Japan wants . another lost decade, and could even be prepared to go back by two . decades,' said a front-page editorial in the newspaper. China 'has . always been extremely cautious about playing the economic card', it . said. 'But in struggles concerning . territorial sovereignty, if Japan continues its provocations, then China . will take up the battle,' the paper said. Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said after talks with Panetta, that Tokyo and Washington agreed the disputed islets were covered by the Japan-U.S. security treaty. Chinese demonstrators protest outside the Japanese embassy in Beijing demanding the return of the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands from Japan . The dispute over the islands, known as the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China, now threatens to seriously damage trade ties between Asia's two biggest economies . Police walk past a closed Japanese restaurant covered with Chinese national flags as anti-Japanese protests continued outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing . 'I did not bring up the topic today, but it is mutually understood between Japan and the United States that (the islands) are covered by the treaty,' he said after meeting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in Tokyo. Japanese electronics firm Canon Inc has stopped production at three of its four Chinese factories for today and tomorrow, citing concerns over employees' safety, Japanese media reports said, while All Nippon Airways Co reported a rise in cancellations on Japan-bound flights from China. The dispute also hit the shares of Hong Kong-listed Japanese retailers today, with department store operator Aeon Stores (Hong Kong) Co Ltd falling to a seven-month low. 'All Japan-related shares are under selling pressure ...,' said Andrew To, a research director from Emperor Capital. The oil-rich islands in the East China sea are the cause of the violent dispute between China and Japan . China is Japan's biggest trade partner and Japan is China's third largest. Any harm to business and investment ties would be bad for both economies at a time when China faces a slowdown. Qingdao police announced on the Internet today they had arrested a number of people suspected of 'disrupting social order' during the protests, apparently referring to the attacks on Japanese-operated factories and shops there. In Shanghai, home to China's biggest Japanese expatriate population of 56,000, one expat said his family as well as other Japanese customers had been chased out of a Japanese restaurant on Sunday by protesters near the Japanese consulate. Guangzhou police said on an official microblog, that they had detained 11 people for smashing up a Japanese-brand car, shop windows and billboards on Sunday.","Violent attacks on Japanese companies such as Toyota and Honda .

French foreign minister Lauren Fabius, left, has spent £70,000 on artwork at a time when President Francois Hollande, right, is trying to make cuts . Despite being paid for with public money, only Mr Fabius and selected guests will be able to enjoy the masterpieces. The revelation comes as France's President Francois Hollande aims to slash spending on government departments. A french satirical newspaper which has poked fun at the irony of Mr Fabius's decision is said to have angered Mr Hollande who prides himself on living a normal life. The socialist President was seen as the antidote to Nikolas Sarkozy when he took charge of the country earlier this year. Sarkozy gained his extravagant reputation soon after coming to power when he was spotted holidaying as a guest of multi-millionaires and hanging out in glamorous restaurants. Impressionist paintings similar to this one by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir have gone on display at the Fench Foreign Office . The beautiful works of art are due to remain at the Quai d'Orsay until the end of the year, but only invited guests will get the chance to enjoy the work. When the exhibition opened to the public for just two days this weekend, only a few people turned up as it was given little publicity. The French Foreign Office revealed that £70,000 had been spent on preparations and security for the exhibition with £30,000 of that going on fittings and security measures for the priceless works. A further £3,000 went on producing a souvenir brochure for guests. According to the newspaper Le Canard Enchainé the remainder of the money was spent on 'unspecified items'.","Laurent Fabius spent the money at a time when the country's national debt is more than £1.3trillion .

Vanishing act: The 'Forest Boy' has been missing for three months but is thought to remain in Germany . German authorities will not be able to sue the 'Forest Boy' over his false claim to be an amnesiac orphan and needed expensive care - because he has vanished. Robin van Helsum, 20, turned up out of the blue in Berlin a year ago posing as a 17-year-old who had lived in a forest with his father for years until the man suddenly died. 'Ray' told the authorities that he had lost his memory after burying his father two weeks earlier. He then lived in the city at the taxpayer's expense for ten months, until he was exposed as a fantasist in June, when his photo was circulated around the world and he was identified by his stepmother from the Netherlands. Van Eslum had vanished from his hometown of Hengelo only days before his arrival in Berlin. German youth authorities confirmed they . would sue him for at least £20,000 - the cost of his care and . searches to find his family. Berlin social services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for the English-speaking Dutchman. They also gave him a staggering £200 a month in pocket money. However, he has now disappeared again, and has not been seen in nearly three months. Now neither his stepmother, his ex-girlfriend from Hengelo or the German or Dutch police know where he is. His stepmother Ellen told a Dutch . newspaper last week: 'A day after his unmasking he phoned me and asked . if he could come home because he needed to rest. f course I said yes, . you're welcome. 'He responded with the words: ""I'll call . you tomorrow or the day after."" 'But I have heard nothing more. 'I was . assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside, but . nothing.' Berlin's youth authorities believed he might have taken up with a community of . itinerant fruit pickers moving from village to village throughout the . summer. But that work has come to an end now autumn has arrived. His stepmother added: 'I think he is . still in Germany but I don't know for sure. 'There were rumours he was . sighted in Hengelo, but Robin is smart enough to know that he would have . problems if that was the case.' Friends said Van Helsum left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'. Expensive: 'Ray' was looked after for ten months after he walked into the city claiming to have lost his memory . Possessions: Van Helsum said his mother had died when he was 12 and cut contact with family and friends . Schoolmates in Hengelo, however, spotted him on the news when the pictures were published around the world. His step-mother identified him and asked him to come back home - but she has no clue where he is now . The service youth and the police of Berlin Tempelhof-Schöneberg suspect he is hiding in Berlin and its surroundings. A district judge in Berlin has issued a . decree that he has to pay back the money but there is little chance of . that happening while he remains on the run. 'We have no idea where he . is,' said a Berlin police spokesman. Police spokesman Michael Maass told . Die Welt at the time: 'It was a really frustrating case and took up a . lot of time. That will have to be paid for and that will eventually end . up at his door.' Accommodation: The tent which Ray was apparently using when he was in the woods . Left without a word: The house of the father of the 'forest boy Ray' in Hengelo, the Netherlands . 'It's no longer a joke. If the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools, and he could be liable for the costs.' Berlin social services were also angry after the 20-year-old failed to apologise for the hoax. Van Heslum said he had been living in a forest with his father Ryan for five years after his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 - but he insisted he did not know his last name or where he is from. In reality, he was an illegitimate child who simply wanted to disappear off the radar and start a new life.

Braving extreme temperatures as he pushes the limits of human endurance, Sir Ranulph Fiennes has few opportunities to worry about his appearance. But even famous explorers, it seems, want to look their best. In recent months the celebrated mountaineer appears to have acquired a toupee, concealing his receding hairline. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Sir Ranulph Fiennes pictured (left) in October 2009, and . (right) this month at The Royal Ballet School in Richmond Park, . south-west London . As these pictures show, three years ago, the former SAS officer was distinctly thinning on top. Speaking at the Cheltenham Festival in October 2009 - the year he became the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest - Sir Ranulph had no more than a few strands to keep him warm. He achieved all this despite having a heart condition, a fear of heights, . and a few missing fingertips after frostbite attacked his fingers so . badly he performed a DIY amputation in his garden shed. But it appears that feat was not enough to turn back time, and on Monday, at the announcement of his latest challenge, the sprightly 68-year old sported a full thatch of grey-brown hair. His thickened locks will do little to . keep him warm as he leads the first team on foot across the Antarctic . during the southern winter. Lustrous locks: The explorer unveils his route for the 'Coldest Journey on Earth' with his hair looking somewhat thicker than before . Brave: Sir Ranulph speaks during a press conference at the Royal Society in London on Monday, where he announced his latest challenge . Those on the expedition, billed as the . Coldest Journey On Earth, are expected to face temperatures as low as . -90C in some places. The team will carry out readings and measurements for scientists, providing data on marine life, oceanography and meteorology. Sir Ranulph was described by Guinness . World Records in 1984 as ‘the world’s greatest living explorer’. He said he thought of his wife, children and a 'hot bath' during arduous challenges. He is . hoping to raise $10million (£6.17million) for Seeing Is . Believing, a charitable initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around . the world. 'There is a huge, blank knowledge of the winter of Antarctica, what is happening to Antarctica during a period when the scientists can't normally get out there,' Sir Ranulph told BBC Breakfast this week. Bravery: Sir Ranulph was the first person to cross the Anarctic on foot and in 2009 he became the oldest Briton to climb Mount Everest - despite having a heart condition and a fear of heights . Natural look: Sir Ranulph in 1961, left, and in 1993, right, when he became one of the first men to walk unaided across the great frozen continent .

He also achieved a world first in 1992-1993 by completing the first crossing of the Antarctic Continent on foot with Mike Stroud, in what was the longest unsupported polar journey in history. A ship will drop the team off on the Pacific coast of the continent, where they will set off over the ice shelf when the equinox arrives on 21 March 2013. Sir Ranulph will then ascend 10,000ft (3,000m) on to the inland plateau, and head onwards to the South Pole. It will be hundreds of miles before the team drops 11,000ft back on to the ice shelf. After covering around 2,000 miles (3,200km) in total their journey will end at the Ross Sea. While Sir Ranulph and a skiing partner will lead on foot, the BBC revealed they will be followed by two bulldozers dragging industrial sledges. Inside three containers on the sledges will be the team's living quarters, supplies, and a science laboratory. Dragged behind this will be the fuel they need. Making it alive across one of the most inhospitable terrains in the world will be a challenge. On the same ice shelf 100 years ago, Capt Scott died after he was caught out by the start of the southern winter. Over 40 years the former SAS officer has carved a career as one of the world’s top explorers. He undertook several expeditions to the North Pole in the 1990s while striving to become the first person to reach it solo and unaided.

The man reported Miss Daley, 29, to management for bullying and sexual harassment, claiming his dignity was ‘violated’, an employment tribunal was told. It was also claimed she grabbed his genitals – which she strongly denied. 'Just harmless fun': Care worker Kelly Daley (pictured) was sacked after she undid the top buttons of a male colleague's uniform as a joke while another worker filmed it .

Miss Daley claimed unfair dismissal . against the owners of the privately-run home in Rotherham, South . Yorkshire, but lost her case. She had worked at the home for more than eight years and had a previously unblemished record. ‘I feel he has been treated far more leniently than me,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I feel I have been classed as a rapist.'

"PUBLISHED: . 23:25 EST, 21 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:18 EST, 22 September 2012 . A man accused of repeatedly stabbing a friend in 1984 after she rejected his romantic advances, then leaving her body to be found by her mother beside a blood-soaked bed, was convicted of capital murder on Friday by a Texas jury and sentenced to life in prison. Ryland Shane Absalon, 45, was accused of stabbing 18-year-old Ginger Hayden more than 50 times in her family's Fort Worth apartment. Prosecutors alleged that he confessed two years later during a drug-treatment program, yet he wasn't charged until almost 25 years later after the case was re-opened and DNA evidence was tested. Innocence lost: Ginger Hayden was just 18 years old when she was stabbed more than 50 times at her family's Fort Worth apartment . Absalon lowered his head as the verdict was read, and his wife began crying. She ran out of the courtroom sobbing loudly as the judge read the sentence of life in prison, which was automatic because prosecutors didn't seek the death penalty. Hayden's relatives cried quietly in the courtroom. Investigators said Hayden was attacked in her bed with a kitchen knife. She was found on the floor when her mother went into her room, wondering why her daughter's alarm clock kept ringing on what would have been the teenager's second day of college. She had dreams of becoming a physical therapist. 'I'm relieved that they finally put him away,' her mother, Sharon Hayden Harvey, said after the verdict. She said she has thought about the brutality of the crime every day, but 'now that he's in prison, I can let it go.' Defense attorney Gary Udashen declined comment after the verdict. Murderer: Ryland Shane Absalon, 43, was a teenager in 1984 when he stabbed Ginger Hayden more than 50 times . Ginger was murdered after her first day of college, she had dreams of becoming a physical therapist . During closing arguments, Udashen said Absalon falsely confessed because he was pressured and abused at the drug-treatment center and believed everything he said would be kept confidential. He argued that some of Absalon's DNA was found in Hayden's apartment because the teens were former high school classmates and neighbors who would hang out. Udashen reminded jurors that DNA found under Hayden's fingernails, as well as on a quilt and a sock, matched an unknown man. The attorney also noted that a rash of murders of attractive young women in the mid-1980s in Fort Worth prompted police to form a task force. 'It won't help Ginger or her mother for police to stop looking for her killer,' Udashen told jurors, adding that it 'does not appear to be the crime of a 17-year-old kid.' Absalon was arrested in 2010 at his home in Sierra Vista, Arizona, where he was working as a welder and living with his wife and young child. News of his arrest prompted some former participants in the drug-treatment program to tell police about his confession - more than two decades after they'd been told that everything said at the center must remain confidential. Ginger Hayden's mother says she has thought about her daughter's murder every day since 1984, but 'now that he's in prison, I can let it go' One former participant testified that about two years after Hayden's murder, Absalon said in a group therapy session in the drug treatment program that he fatally stabbed a young woman when he was high on heroin. Prosecutors said Absalon's 1986 confession in the treatment program supported the evidence and included details that only the killer would know: that he took a knife from the victim's kitchen, hid in the closet until she went to sleep and then stabbed her on the bed. Absalon told another participant that he killed Hayden because he was angry that she only wanted to be friends after he told her that he wanted a romantic relationship, according to testimony. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that one witness testified during the trial that Absalon said nobody would find out because he covered it up too well, washing his hands and cleaning up in the bathroom. Prosecutors said he used socks as gloves. Absalon's DNA was found in the bathroom on a towel and bloody sock, and a piece of wood from the knife that killed Hayden also was found on one of the socks, according to testimony.","Ryland Shane Absalon stabbed Ginger Hayden in her bedroom .

Sky TV boss James Murdoch is being lined up to take direct responsibility for New Corp's U.S. television businesses, it has emerged. The news that News Corp is looking to expand Mr Murdoch's role was revealed on the day he was censured by the media watchdog for his 'ill-judged' handling of the phone-hacking crisis. His role will be expanded to include responsibility for the Fox Networks Group following publication of the Ofcom report. James Murdoch's conduct as chairman of BSkyB was today described as 'ill-judged' by Ofcom . Mr Murdoch was heavily criticised in the report, with his record in the UK attacked by media regulator Ofcom. Sky was cleared to continue airing . programmes, as Ofcom today said BSkyb remained a ‘fit and proper’ broadcaster despite the phone-hacking scandal. It found no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged. BSkyB has been cleared as a 'fit and proper' broadcaster despite its parent company being embroiled in the phone hacking scandal . Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation owns a 39 per cent stake in BSkyB. News Corp had hoped to buy the rest of BSkyB but was forced to drop its bid as the phone hacking scandal erupted. The review was launched last year . after News International, also owned by News Corp, was forced to close . the News of the World after a wave of allegations of phone hacking at . the Sunday tabloid newspaper. James Murdoch was chief executive of News International and chairman of BSkyB when the scandal erupted. He remains a non-executive director at Sky and an executive director at News Corp. Ofcom said his failure to get to the bottom of the allegations sooner was ‘difficult to comprehend and ill-judged'. But it said there was no evidence that James Murdoch knew of widespread wrongdoing or that he was complicit in a cover-up. Sky welcomed the licence decision today, insisting it was ‘committed to high standards of governance’. ‘As Ofcom acknowledges, our track record of compliance in broadcasting is good,’ the firm said in a statement. But Ofcom was critical of James Murdoch’s failure to act. It said: ‘We consider James Murdoch’s conduct, including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions, to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged.' He was not involved with News International until the end of 2007, . almost a year after the sentencing of News of the World's royal editor . Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking. But after he took over as chief . executive, he received an email suggesting that criminal activities were . more widespread, although he claimed he failed to read the . correspondence fully. Rupert Murdoch dropped his bid to buy BSkyB outright in the wake of allegations about phone hacking . Ofcom added: 'We consider that the events set out above raise questions . regarding James Murdoch's competence in the handling of these matters . and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies . for which he was responsible.' Ofcom said its duty to be satisfied that a licensee is fit and proper is ongoing. 'Should further relevant evidence become available in the future, Ofcom would need to consider that evidence in order to fulfil its duty.' In July 2011, Ofcom announced it had a duty to investigate whether Sky was fit and proper to continue to hold its broadcast licences, in light of allegations about phone hacking. In a statement today the regulator said: 'Ofcom considers that, on the evidence currently available and having taken into account all the relevant factors, Sky is fit and proper to hold its broadcast licences.' Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said:  'While Ofcom has found Sky is fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence, its criticisms of James Murdoch are damning. 'His continued presence on Sky’s board casts a shadow over one of our most important national broadcasters.' James and Rupert Murdoch give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last July . In March James Murdoch wrote to the Commons Culture, Media, Sport Select Committee to apologise for his conduct. He . conceded he should have 'asked more questions, requested more documents . and taken a more challenging and sceptical view of what I was told.' Labour MP Tom Watson, a leading critic of the Murdoch empire, said he was 'disappointed but not surprised' by Ofcom's ruling. Mr Watson said: 'I do think it shows the flaws in Ofcom methodology. They cannot do deep investigations in the way that other organisations can. 'They also do hedge their bets, they say that the test can be applied at any time if there is new evidence, and were also critical of James Murdoch where they say his conduct wasn’t that becoming of a chairman or a chief executive. So they’re not entirely cleared by the report.' Mr Watson also suggested there could be more revelations in the future which could reopen the question of the Murdoch empire's governance. 'I think the share arrangements of News Corporation that’s two tiered and effectively means that Rupert Murdoch and his family effectively control the entire organisation, will ultimately come back and haunt both him and James Murdoch. 'I think there’ll be more revelations in the years to come that mean that Ofcom might have to apply that fit and proper person test in the near future and they might be regretting this report today.' News Corp welcomed Ofcom's decision but defended James Murdoch, saying he deserved credit for leading Sky to its outstanding record as a broadcaster. It said in a statement: 'We are pleased that Ofcom recognises BSkyB as a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence and remain proud of both News Corporation's and James Murdoch's distinguished record in facilitating the transformation of Sky into Britain's leading pay television and home communications provider. 'We disagree, however, with certain of the report's statements about James Murdoch's prior actions as an executive and director, which are not at all substantiated by evidence.'","Watchdog says it is 'difficult to comprehend' why Murdoch did not investigate hacking claims sooner .

Racing in petrol-soaked overalls and – with one unfortunate slip - seconds away from a fiery death, it was an age when health and safety hadn’t yet been invented. The 1960s was also a time when Formula 1’s best might earn in their entire careers what modern stars like Lewis Hamilton make in a month. Yet for the daredevils behind the wheel, it was a glorious age – because it was the glory that drove them on to keep risking their lives. Sporting hero: John Surtees was the first racer to win the world championship in motor racing and motor cycling . FI glory days: Drivers had little protection from crashes as they sat in their cockpits . Racing stars: Jennifer Summers (centre), Miss Motor Racing 1966, with drivers, left to right, Jack Brabham, John Surtees, Graham Hill and Jim Clark . Escape: Racing driver Jim Clark crashes during the Daily Mail Race of Champions at Brands Hatch. He walked away unhurt. John Surtees, the legendary British . driver who personifies the glamour of the age in these stunning black . and white images, was just one of a legion of stars whose impossible . feats make today’s spectacle look much more ordinary. Winning: John Surtees took the chequered flag at the 1963 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring circuit . The four-times winner of 500cc motorcycle-racing championships went on to claim the F1 crown in 1964. The 76-year-old remains the only person to have won World Championships on both two and four wheels. In . an engaging interview with the newly-published Official Formula 1 Opus – . a collector’s edition book costing upwards of £2,000 that charts the . history of the sport in 1,000 images - he said: ‘When you look at the . conditions I raced in, it all looks terribly fragile, but at the time, . you believed you were driving state-of-the-art cars. ‘In hindsight, you realise they were lethal machines. ‘When . I first joined Ferrari, I went to a place like the Nürburgring where . the car would jump and the chassis would flex so the fuel tank would . leak in a number of places. ‘In 1963, when I won my first Grand Prix there, the tank had leaked and my overalls were soaked in petrol. ‘But . we lived in a different age. If the fighter pilots of today were put . into a World War II aircraft, they might have second thoughts about it. ‘But it was a question of what was . available at the time. For certain, the 1960s were a little more . dangerous than other decades. Then and now: John Surtees agrees today that the cars he drove in back in the Sixties were 'lethal' Meeting: John Surtees, standing, listens as drivers including Jackie Stewart, sitting in striped T-shirt, and Graham Hill in check shirt talk about race issues . Posters: Publicity for the Monaco race in the Eighties and qualifying for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone . ‘The cars were technically more efficient than the type of cars that had raced in the Fifties, but the engineering was nowhere near as good. ‘You used bits of Triumph Herald uprights to build Formula 1 cars and that was all a little bit marginal. ‘You had these very small emerging companies coming along and their concepts were more efficient but the safety did not keep up with them.’ Indeed, the 1960s reads like a catalogue of sporting fatalities. No fewer than 14 drivers died in F1 races during the decade. Despair: A distraught driver leans against the circuit wall after a crash which left his F1 car wrecked . Ready for racing: World champion Nigel Mansell, who won the title in 1992, talks to his colleagues in the pit . Dangers: Dummies were used to test new safety features on F1 cars after injuries to drivers. Fourteen racers died during the Sixties . Medical man on the spot: Professor Sid Watkins was called in by F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone in the late seventies to lead the track side medical team to handle injuries to drivers . None . of this grim irony is lost on Mr Surtees, whose own son Henry was . killed at age 18 in a freak accident at Brands Hatch during a Formula 2 . race in 2009. ‘I never believed for a moment I would lose my son,’ said Mr Surtees as his red-rimmed eyes welled with tears. But, . back in the 1960s when drivers faced crashing against concrete walls . instead of cushioning gravel traps, deaths were accepted as part of . racing. All that began to change with the death of Scot Jim Clarke – perhaps the first driver truly to break the sport's heart. Powerful: F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and former president of the FIA Max Mosley . Terrible burns: Niki Lauder was given the last rites by a priest after a fireball crash at the Nürburgring in 1976 . Nicknamed Gentleman Jim, he was just 32 when, in 1968, his Lotus 48 hit a tree during a minor race and killed him outright. Killed: The death of Ayrton Senna in the Nineties shocked the racing world . Only the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994 brought a similar sense of devastation to Formula 1 and its millions of followers. From then on Mr Clarke’s great Scottish friend, rival and one-time flatmate Jackie Stewart dedicated himself to improving safety in motor racing. Mr Stewart himself quit five years later, sensing that he had pushed his luck as far as he dared. Also pictured in a Polaroid-style snap in the Official Formula 1 Opus - which is covered by silk-bound clamshell case and is the largest ever record of the sport with more than 852 pages tracing its history – is the scarred face of another racing great, Niki Lauda. He too diced with death – this time in 1976 – when he survived a horrendous fireball crash at Germany’s Nürburgring. While battling terrible burns in hospital, the now 63-year-old Austrian was given his last rites by a priest. ‘That stupid priest didn’t say a word to me because he thought I was unconscious and all but dead,’ he told the Formula 1 Opus. ‘I wanted to scream at him, ‘I’m not dead. I’m not f*****g dead yet’. But I couldn’t.’ Incredibly, a year after his near-fatal crash, he went on to win the world championship for the second time. Even more astonishingly, after retiring in 1977, the racer made a comeback and won the F1 title in 1984. By this time, there were still characters in the sport, including his French McLaren teammate Alain Prost, who is also pictured in the Formula 1 Opus. He won the title four times. Yet the simple pursuit of racing glory were bygone days, left behind in the 1960s. Lauda himself chiefly returned because salaries were soaring and he needed cash to fund his airline business. Yet an era where sporting heroes are not cut off in their prime is surely worth it and few of the greats from decades past would begrudge them this right… even if it does mean Pussycat Dolls on the track.","'When I won my first Grand Prix, the tank had leaked and my overalls were soaked in petrol' recalls John Surtees .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:48 EST, 23 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:50 EST, 23 September 2012 . George Osborne’s opposition to a plastic bag tax is the last remaining barrier to the introduction of a levy in England, Liberal Democrats claimed today as they voted to bolster their ‘weaponry’ against the Treasury’s resistance. The Lib Dem conference backed a motion demanding a levy on all single-use plastic bags, with proceeds to go to community food initiatives. Senior party figures said the move was designed to counter what they said was a Treasury ‘log jam’ which had repeatedly blocked the idea of charging for bags to encourage people to curb their use. The Liberal Democrats claim the Treasury is the last stumbling block to securing a levy on plastic bags to cut pollution . A poll by the Break the Bag Habit coalition of campaign groups last week found more than half people – 56 per cent – supported the idea of a small charge for disposable bags. Official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year, despite David Cameron demanding ‘significant falls’. Lib Dems say Caroline Spelman, the former Tory Environment Secretary, was supportive of the idea of a levy but came up against Treasury resistance, something the Treasury denies. After Mr Osborne proposed taxes on pasty and caravans - sparking a public outcry and leading to embarrassing u-turns - it was claimed the Treasury was reluctant to appear to be adding to the day-to-day costs of low income families. But Andrew George, the Lib Dem policy spokesman on the environment, today told MailOnline he hoped the adoption of a new party policy on the issue would place the issue back on the agenda. Lib Dem MP Andrew George said the new party policy ensured campaigners had the 'most effective weaponry' in taking on the Treasury's resistance . ‘We have seen some indications of support coming out of Number 10,’ he said. ‘It has always been over-ruled by the Treasury. We have only one remaining log jam and we need to keep firing the most effective weaponry at it and making it quite clear that this issue will not go away.’ However Treasury insiders were said to be ‘bemused’ by the suggestion that Mr Osborne was blocking the policy. ‘All ideas are on the table,’ said a source. ‘And the Lib Dems know that.’ In Wales shoppers are charged 5p for carrier bags with the money going to good causes. The Republic of Ireland has had a levy since 2002, and has seen significant drops in plastic bag use. Last year Mr Cameron said the level of bag use was ‘unacceptable’ and government sources suggested there had to be a reduction of five per cent. Instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011-12. Mr George added: ‘We need to bear down on excessive landfill. It is a cause of very significant pollution not just in the waste stream but around the countryside. ‘It is quite unnecessary. There are just so many alternatives to having a ready supply of free plastic bags. ‘It is a very simple, straight forward hit,’ the MP for St Ives told MailOnline. Lib Dem activist Justine McGuinness told the conference that she had changed her mind about the need for a levy after visiting Ireland where there were not bags in hedgerows . The Lib Dems are pushing for a levy of between 5p and 10p per bag. ‘It has got to be sufficient to make people think hard before going out shopping, planning in advance, and taking reusable bags with them where they can. ‘We don’t want to penalise people who find themselves in a situation where they have no alternative but we do need to change behaviour. ‘Behaviour is changing, but it seems to be that the political will isn’t there to tip things in the right direction.’ The Lib Dem motion was backed by delegates at the party conference in Brighton after being urged to do so by Justine McGuinness, a former election candidate who acted as a spokesman for or Kate and Gerry McCann's Find Madeleine Fund. Ms McGuinness said she used to be against the party’s policy on plastic bags but had changed her mind after visiting Ireland. ‘You don’t see plastic bags floating around in hedgerows because of course there is a plastic bag tax. 'It has changed people’s behaviour and that to me is a sign of a very good policy. It is a policy which will effect change.’","Liberal Democrats adopt new policy demanding a charge of up to 10p to fund community food projects .

Lied: Irshad Ahmed told the little boy's parents he had been pushed from a fire escape at the Birmingham nursery . The owner of a nursery where a child was left critically ill after falling 15-foot onto concrete from a fire escape lied to his family and said the three-year-old had been pushed. Eshan Ahmed, now four, had to be put into a coma after suffering a fractured skull when he fell headfirst through a gap in the railings of the staircase at the first-floor nursery in Birmingham. A court heard the steep staircase was used as an entrance and exit to Little Hippos Multicultural Nursery and Day Care Centre even though the owner knew the fire escape was unsafe, as small children could easily slip through large gaps on either side of the steps. Birmingham Crown Court was told that . Irshad Ahmed had lied to Eshan's family and to Ofsted about the fall . and created a 'fiction' surrounding it, claiming that the three-year-old . was pushed off the steps during a fire drill at the nursery in Summer . Lane. Ahmed - who has . been ordered to pay out over £20,000 - even tried to persuade other . members of staff to back up his story as part of his 'utterly cynical' cover-up after Eshan plunged headfirst from the top of the fire escape . in March last year. Recorder Malcolm Morse said it was only thanks to 'pure luck' that a similar accident had not happened before at the nursery. 'It was, in a hackneyed but accurate phrase, an accident waiting to happen,' he said. 'The fact it had not happened before is, in my judgement, pure luck. 'You tried to persuade two members of staff to uphold this fiction but they have always refused to do so,' he added. The court was told how Ahmed fed his . story to Eshan's distraught mother while she was at the hospital with . her critically ill son. 'Mr Ahmed’s conduct on behalf of the . company was as bad as his conduct exposing children to this risk in the . first place,' the judge said. Critical: Eshan Ahmed suffered a fractured skull following the fall at the Little Hippos nursery in Summer Lane, Birmingham . Injuries: The swelling on Eshan's head is clear in this photograph . 'You don't expect to see your child in that condition, especially when they are left at a nursery, a place you trust to keep them safe,' she said. 'Unsafe': Wooden panels have now been added to the railings on either side of the fire escape leading from the first-floor nursery . Fined: Little Hippos owner Irshad Ahmed was ordered to pay out more than £20,000 at Birmingham Crown Court . Nusery owner Irshad Ahmed admitted one count of breaching his duty as an employer, as well as failing to notify the authorities - in this case Birmingham City Council - within ten days of the incident in March last year. The judge fined the nursery £16,000 and ordered it to pay costs of £7,500 and a £15 victim surcharge. But Eshan's mother said she was disappointed by the verdict, and insisted that Ahmed should not be allowed to care for children. 'Doctors have told us the effects of the fall might not show until Eshan reaches puberty as it could have damaged his pituitary gland at the base of his brain,' she said. 'I am disappointed by the verdict in this case and would say this man and his nursery should not be allowed to care for children.' Prosecutor Barry Berlin described Ahmed’s attempt to cover up the incident as ‘utterly cynical’. 'What we have here is a cover up of how the incident occurred and that is an obstruction of the authorities,' he said. 'Why was he covering it up? Because he recognised the serious nature of the offence.' Dominic Adamson, defending, apologised to Eshan Ahmed on behalf of the company for the injuries he sustained. He said the nursery-owner wrongly believed the fire escape was safe to use following both a fire safety inspection and an Ofsted inspection.

A teenage boy has been caught using his bedroom as an illegal tattoo parlour to ink his friends, after advertising his services on Facebook. Up to 15 children - some as young as 13 - paid the DIY tattooist their £5 pocket money for the 'body art' while his unsuspecting parents watched television downstairs. But the illegal practice was soon discovered after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained to Trading Standards when she  home with a tattoo on her leg. Kitted out: the 15-year-old was found with a range of equipment in his bedroom, which he had turned into an illegal tattoo parlour . After raiding the schoolboy's bedroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, officers found a tattooist's kit under his bed with a stained 'skull and crossbones' tattoo machine and contaminated needles. They also recovered a blender for the inks, rubber gloves and tracing paper for designs including hearts, butterflies and swallows. It is believed the 15-year-old boy had attempted to sterilise the needles using household Dettol, hand gel and Savlon cream. The boy was questioned on suspicion of an offence under the Tattooing of Minors Act of 1969, but no further action was taken against him after he was given a formal warning and the kit was confiscated. The youngsters tattooed by the boy are believed to have been advised to undergo health checks tests. Pictures of the boy's extensive tattoo kit emerged as council inspectors said youngsters who had paid for the tattoos were 'taking their life in their hands' by risking deadly infections, including hepatitis, HIV and blood poisoning. Infection risk: The teenager had tried to disinfect his needles with household products . It is illegal in Britain to tattoo . anyone under the age of 18 except when the tattoo is performed for medical reasons by a duly qualified medical practitioner or by a person working under their direction. The maximum sentence for those convicted of tattooing under age youngsters can be a fine of up to a £1,000 pounds. But tattoos remain popular among children who attempt to copy their celebrity heroes. Councillor . Fred Jackson at Blackpool Council, said: 'It's shocking to think the . risks that young people are taking using unregistered tattooists. 'We . work very closely with the parlours in the town to ensure that anyone . having a tattoo is doing so in a safe and hygiene environment. 'I . understand that the equipment can be bought from as little as £50 on . eBay, making it more accessible than ever to those wanting to make a . quick buck. 'The last thing we want is young people making a bad decision that could cause permanent damage and impact on their health.' The council said over the last two months there had been an increased concerns about underage children being tattooed. Discovered: This stained skull and crossbones tattoo gun was found under the teenager's bed . Officials have fielded reports of . children as young as 13 obtaining tattoos, along with concerns over . infected equipment, poor quality workmanship and the risk of disease. Inquiries . have revealed that the main source of the problem is from people . setting up illegal make shift tattoo studios from home. The . boy's bedroom was one of two properties targeted by Blackpool Council . and the police using new powers aimed at safeguarding public safety. The . law requires any person who operates as a tattooist to be registered . with the local authority and comply with a code of conduct focusing on . cleanliness, sterilisation of equipment and the overall hygiene and . facilities of the premises. Blackpool Council is now beginning an awareness campaign working with Blackpool and the Fylde College and local schools to highlight the dangers. Catherine Hill, vice principal at Blackpool and the Fylde College, said: 'The College is happy to raise awareness among young people about the risks posed by illegal tattooing. The teenager had been operating an tattoo parlour illegally from his home in Blackpool, Lancashire . 'There are many pressures on young . people today and by keeping our students informed while in college, we . will hopefully help to make sure that they can stay safe in the outside . world.' Pete Sinclair . from Hawkeye's Tattoo Carnival, added: 'People getting a cheap tattoo in . a makeshift studio don't know the real cost of what they are doing. 'Picking up an infection in an unhygienic environment could cause serious health problems or at worse, their life.' Keith Butcher, who runs Dragons Den tattoo studio, in Blackpool said: 'The biggest risk is cross-contamination with people not cleaning the eqUipment properly. It's a hepatitis lottery. 'One of the reasons we bought a tattoo removal machine is because of the atrocious standard of work which is being done not just by kids, but by a lot of adults as well from bedrooms and garages. 'We've seen a big increase in it over the last 12 to 14 months.' Simon Tucker, a consultant doctor at Blackpool Victoria Hospital's accident and emergency department said anyone inked in unhygienic conditions was taking a 'big risk'. He added: 'Sterilising needles in Savlon is not a chemical, sterile procedure. It carries a huge risk, not only of infections such as cellulitis, but also blood-born viruses, most notably hepatitis and HIV, which can be transmitted through dirty needles.'","Teenager was paid for the 'body art' on children as young as 13, while unsuspecting parents sat downstairs watching television .

The NFL replacement ref who signaled a touchdown on the final play of Monday night’s Packers-Seahawks game has said he stands by his controversial decision which allowed the Seahawks to win 14-12. Lance Easley, who is out of a job following an end to the labor dispute and the return of the real referees, is adamant he made the correct call. 'I don’t appreciate the negative stuff,' said Easley, who feels that he’s had to shoulder the blame for Monday night's decision. Scroll down for video . Botched: The referee on the left, Lance Easley, called the play a touchdown for Seattle, even though most fans believe Green Bay had intercepted the ball. The ref on the right called for a stoppage of play . Scapegoat: Lance Easley claims that he didn't do anything wrong . 'I didn't do anything wrong,' Easley told TMZ. 'Put any other official who knows the rules and they would make the same call.' Easley said the Packers player who allegedly intercepted the ball never had singular possession because, 'You have to not only have the ball but have either two feet or a body part on the ground, and that never happened.' Although the NFL rulebook cites simultaneous possession is awarded to the passing team, Packers cornerback M.D. Jennings clearly came away with the ball prior to Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who stripped the ball away as he was tangled with Jennings. Easley, who normally refs at El Camino and Pierce Junior Colleges as well as Occidental, all in Southern California, said the replacement refs did what they were expected to do. 'We did a damn good job... for the most part.' His controversial call followed months of an intense labor lockout between the NFL and NFLRA, who finally came to an eight-year agreement on Thursday morning. The stalemate, which saw the NFL's referees locked out since the beginning for the pre-season, had been whittled down to disagreements over 'a little money.' The real refs returned to the field to officiate Thursday night's game between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens. Referee Gene Steratore and his seven-man crew received a standing ovation as they walked on the field in their familiar stripes for the first game of Week 4. One fan held up a sign that read: 'Finally! We get to yell at real refs! Welcome back!' 'The other refs just made dumb calls,' said Jessie Riley, a 15-year-old fan wearing an Ed Reed jersey. 'I couldn't stand them. Now we won't get robbed; everything will be fair - hopefully.' The officials ran a mostly smooth and efficient first game back, with no headline-making calls as the Ravens beat the Browns 23-16. Welcome back: A Baltimore Ravens fan holds a sign supporting the return of the real refs prior to the game against the Cleveland Browns . Ready for action: Referee Gene Steratore, right, and back judge Bob Waggoner, left, look around the field before the game between the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that Monday night’s disputed touchdown 'may have pushed the parties further along' in the talks. 'Obviously when you go through something like this it is painful for everybody,' Goodell said. 'Most importantly, it is painful for our fans. We are sorry to have to put our fans through that, but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long term and make sure you continue to grow the game.' The deal is only tentative - it must be ratified by 51 percent of the union's 121 members in a vote scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Dallas. The lockout ended after marathon negotiations produced an eight-year agreement to end the lockout that began in June. However, for the Packers, Redskins, Lions and other teams who voiced their displeasure with calls that might have swayed games, the agreement doesn't change their records. Unwanted fame: Lance Easley gestures on the field following his controversial call in the Seattle Seahawks' 14-12 victory over the Green Bay Packers . The commissioner said he watched Monday night's frenetic Packers-Seahawks finish at home. 'You never want to see a game end like that,' he said. The new agreement will improve officiating in the future, Goodell asserted, reducing mistakes like those made Monday and making the strains of the last three weeks worthwhile. Goodell acknowledged 'you're always worried' about the perception of the league. 'Obviously, this has gotten a lot of attention,' he said. 'It hasn't been positive, and it's something that you have to fight through and get to the long term. ... We always are going to have to work harder to make sure we get people's trust and confidence in us.' The dispute even made its way to the campaign trail, with President Barack Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, calling Thursday 'a great day for America.' 'The president's very pleased that the two sides have come together,' Carney said.","Lance Easley claims he made the right call in Monday night's Packers-Seahawks game .

Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice who heads the judiciary in England and Wales, said of the eight-year wait: ‘We really can’t have cases taking that long to reach a conclusion.’ He pointed to the European Court of Human Rights as the institution most to blame for the delay in the extradition of the hook-handed cleric to the US. 'Great public interest': Lord Igor Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, left, has revealed his personal sense of 'fury' at the delays in clearing the extradition of hate cleric Abu Hamza, right, to the U.S. to face terror charges . ‘I do not think, if you go through the processes, you will discover that the delays in that particular case, or in many like it, are actually to be levelled at the doors of the courts here,’ the Lord Chief Justice said. He spoke as Hamza – who has already served a jail sentence in Britain for offences under the Terrorism Act – mounted yet another attempt to stave off extradition. A claim on the basis of alleged new evidence is to be heard by a judge next month. Lord Judge expressed his anger at the glacial pace of the proceedings during a question and answer session with journalists. He said he was not commenting on an individual case – but made it clear that his remarks referred to the Hamza affair. ‘Any case that takes eight years through a whole series of judicial processes to come to a conclusion – and you have made the point that it hasn’t yet come to a conclusion – is a source of real fury to me,’ he said. ‘We really can’t have cases taking that long. It is not fair to anybody. It is not right. That is all I can really say about it.’ Glacial pace: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where judges took four years to finally rule that the extradition of Hamza was indeed lawful . The Hamza saga began in May 2004 when he was arrested on a US extradition warrant. He is wanted in America for conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, funding terrorism, and, between 1998 and 2000, organising a terrorist training camp in the state of Oregon. Extradition proceedings were on hold between October 2004 and 2007 while the preacher was tried and convicted on British terrorist charges. In May 2007 a preliminary extradition hearing was held in London. British proceedings ended in July 2008 when Lord Judge himself, sitting in the Appeal Court, said the extradition decision was beyond further challenge in the courts and raised no point of law worth taking to the Law Lords, the highest court in the country, now replaced by the Supreme Court. Yesterday Lord Judge recalled: ‘I was one of the judges who decided that case in the extradition proceedings…So far as we were concerned, that was the end of it.’ However in August 2008 European human rights judges in Strasbourg said that Hamza could not be extradited until they had considered the case. They did not rule that the extradition was lawful until April this year. Hamza leading worshippers outside the Finsbury Park Mosque: He has already spent time in a UK jail for offences under the Terrorism Act . A final appeal to Strasbourg was rejected earlier this week – more than four years after the European judges started to deal with the case. The extradition has now been delayed by a further UK appeal, brought by his lawyers on the grounds that there is fresh evidence to be considered. Lawyers led by Muddassar Arani have deposited papers at the High Court which say they want a judicial review of a Home Office decision to recall Hamza’s British passport. They say he needs the passport to establish his identity and get legal representation in the US. The case will be heard at the High Court next week. Lord  Judge said: ‘The problem is not that there isn’t a limit on the number of appeals. The problem is that new points keep coming up and new points are taken and then they go through the process. ‘What you need is a process in which all the points which need to be addressed are addressed once and then there is an appeal process and it comes to an end. Any case that takes eight years – unless there is some extraordinary explanation…is unacceptable.’ Lord Judge added: ‘In those sort of cases, alleged terrorist cases, well, actually, there is great public interest in disposing of them fairly, justly, but with speed.’","Country's most senior judge speaks as hate cleric Abu Hamza mounts a new attempt to avoid extradition to the U.S. to face trial on terror charges .

A mother whose two-year-old son died after she left him in a boiling hot car for 12 hours has been jailed for 35 years. Mollie Shouse, 29, left the boy in temperatures of up to 150F (66C) while she passed out at her apartment in Louisville, U.S., after taking drugs. She showed remorse only for herself and had to take responsibility for the death of her son Kenton Brown, a judge said yesterday. 'No remorse': Mollie Shouse was told to 'take responsibility' for allowing her son to die as the judge sentenced her yesterday . Shouse was convicted of murder last month by a Jefferson County jury, who recommended the sentence that was imposed yesterday. The 29-year-old will be eligible for parole in 20 years. Jefferson Circuit Judge Olu Stevens said Shouse had lied repeatedly to the police about what had happened when her son died on May 21, 2011. Convicted murderer: The 29-year-old left the toddler in her car while she got high on drugs in her apartment . 'You have to take responsibility for this,' he said. 'You are responsible for this life that . is no more. I didn’t see anywhere… where you showed remorse for what . your child went through, what he suffered at your hands.' Shouse showed little emotion at her . sentencing and did not speak on her own behalf, according to the Courier Journal. Afterwards, she looked . back in the courtroom at her family, who had pleaded for leniency. Prosecutor Erin McKenzie said the sentence was not unduly harsh, because Kenton, strapped in his car seat, 'suffered for hours upon hours while his skin seared against the hot plastic of the buckle between his legs.' The sentence is believed to be one of the longest in the country for a child left in a vehicle, according to American organisation KidsAndCars.org. There have been several other local cases in . which children were left in hot vehicles and died, in which the courts . were far more lenient with those responsible.

Horrifying death: Shouse's car, where she left her son in temperatures so hot that his his skin 'seared' against the plastic buckle of his car seat . A man whose eight-month-old son died after he accidentally left him in a hot car in June was not even indicted by a Jefferson County grand jury. But prosecutors said Shouse’s case was different because she knew she was risking her child's life and decided to ignore the danger. 'This was a deliberate decision on her part,' said Ms McKenzie after the sentencing. 'She chose to get high and it was convenient for her to leave him in the car to do so. The car seat was a babysitter for her.'","Prosecutor said toddler's skin 'seared' against the hot plastic buckle strapping him into his car seat .

New mother: Sarah Sandell named her son Noah after she battled through flooded roads to get to hospital for the birth . A pregnant teacher who had to battle through the floods to get to hospital has named her baby Noah. Sarah Sandell, 31, of Skeeby, North Yorkshire, desperately needed to get to hospital after her waters broke on Monday evening. However, she and her husband Kevin were left struggling, trapped by floodwater which had closed many of the surrounding roads. Police had closed the main bridge leading out of the village when cars became stranded in the fast-rising floodwater. Mr Sandell, 30, said: 'I had gone out to offer help because cars were getting stuck near the bridge. 'When I came back at about 8pm, I found another puddle on the floor after my wife’s waters broke. She had telephoned the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, where we were scheduled to be going, but they told her they were full and she would have to go to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.' The couple, who are both science teachers at Richmond School, knew other roads were already closing, so had to find a route that was not flooded. Couple: Mrs Sandell's husband Kevin had to find a route to the hospital that wasn't closed due to flooding . Newborn: Parents Sarah and Kevin Sandell had shortlisted four names for their newborn son, but battling through floodwater to get to hospital, they knew they had to settle on Noah . Mr Sandell added: 'Luckily we got onto the A1 from Brompton-on-Swale before it was closed and we managed to use the A66 from Darlington to Middlesbrough just in the nick of time before that road was closed.' Noah was born a fit and healthy baby weighing 8lbs 9oz. Mr Sandell said: 'Noah had been in our top five boy names, but the flooding just put the icing on the cake for it.' Noah, which is the 15th most popular . boy’s name in the England and Wales according to Office for National . Statistics figures, is of Hebrew origin and has meanings such as . ‘comfort’ and ‘peaceful’. The . story of Noah's Ark appears in the Old Testament of the Bible in the . Book of Genesis, telling how Noah builds an ark to save himself, his . family and a representation of the world's animals. Flooding: Torrential rain this week caused severe flooding in North Yorkshire, as gales and heavy rain caused fallen trees and put many areas under floodwater. The area of Gilling West, near Skeeby, is pictured . When . all the animals are on board, a flood is sent by God - who is angry at . the wickedness in the world - and flood waters rise.

Once the waters . have subsided, Noah and the animals safely leave the ark. Parts of north England have experienced the most intense September storm in 30 years. Heavy . rainfall early in the week have caused flooding across the country, . with the most severely affected regions being the North East of England . and Wales, where the Environment Agency still has 25 flood warnings. Parts of the Midlands and the South West are also at risk of flooding. Changed landscape: Clifton Ings, York, is a natural flood plain and has been swollen with flood water . Near Wrexham, North Wales, one couple were found drowned in a river, possibly because they had tried to save their dog.

Mum-of-one Karen Climpson, 46, attacked her partner Mark Chandler, 42, after she 'completely lost her mind' in an 'unexplained frenzy'. The tragic pair, who had been together for 18 years, lay dead for several days until concerned relatives forced their way into their home to discover the pair’s blood-covered bodies in January this year. Tragic: An inquest heard how Karen Climpson stabbed partner Mark Chandler 90 times before committing suicide in an 'unexplained frenzy' An inquest into their deaths heard how a struggle had started in the bathroom where mechanic Mark was stabbed before he either fell or was pushed down the stairs. Karen, who was taking antidepressants at the time, went downstairs and continued brutally stabbing Mark with scissors before walking to the kitchen, leaving a trail of bloody footprints. She then went back upstairs to the bathroom - where she took her own life using a razor blade, Stoke-on-Trent Coroners Court heard. North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith concluded that Karen had killed Mark but added that the full truth behind the case would never be known. He said: 'We don’t have all the facts. I would wish to know from Mark and Karen why they ended up the way they did. 'Was it some sort of domestic argument that got totally out of hand? We could speculate forever on that.

Ed Balls will vow today to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on building affordable homes and a stamp duty holiday if Labour is elected – after insisting the party has nothing to apologise for on the economy. The Shadow Chancellor will tell his party’s annual conference in Manchester that he would use the proceeds of the forthcoming sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to fund the initiatives. The defiant announcement is a deliberate contrast to the approach of Gordon Brown, who used all the £22.5billion raised from the sale of the 3G spectrum to pay down the deficit, even in the boom year of 2000. Scroll down for video . Getting ready for the main event: Ed Balls has make-up applied and has a quick drink before facing the media in Manchester ahead of his keynote speech at the Labour Party annual conference today . On air: Mr Balls has made it clear that Labour has nothing to apologise for regarding its public spending, vowing to spend more on affordable housing . Bold plan: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, left, . goes through his speech with Ed Miliband at their hotel in Manchester. He would use the proceeds of the . sale of the 4G mobile spectrum to finance fiscal measures . Although Britain is now battling to avoid a full-scale debt crisis, Mr Balls will say he would use the £3billion expected to be raised from the latest sale to build 100,000 affordable homes and fund a two-year stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers of properties worth up to £250,000. The Shadow Chancellor, asked yesterday whether he would apologise for Labour’s ‘profligacy’ when in power, declared: ‘No.’ Mr Balls said Labour had never pretended to be a ‘balanced budget party’, telling the Huffington Post website: ‘We were a borrow-to-invest and balance the current budget party. ‘David Cameron and George Osborne would like nothing better than for me to say that the reason there was a global financial crisis, the reason that our deficit went up, is because of Labour public spending. But it’s rubbish.’ Last minute revisions? Some Labour MPs hope that Mr Miliband would replace Mr Balls in the economic role should the party form a government after the next general election . Mr Balls insisted Britain’s structural . deficit was only ‘marginally higher’ than other countries before the . financial crisis hit, a claim derided by the Conservatives, who accuse . Labour of ‘failing to fix the roof while the sun was shining’. Labour leader Ed Miliband refused to . guarantee that Mr Balls would be his Chancellor if Labour wins the . election, though he appears powerless to move him. Some . Labour MPs hope for a comeback by former chancellor Alistair Darling, . or even Mr Miliband’s vanquished brother David, to take Mr Balls’s place . towards the next election. Amid . persistent reports of tensions between him and Mr Balls, when the . leader was asked if Mr Balls would definitely be chancellor if there was . a Labour government, he replied: ‘I think I’ll make my cabinet when it . comes to . . . measuring the curtains is not my style.’ Mr . Balls, however, made it clear that he did not expect to be shifted to . another shadow cabinet post. He said he would do everything he could to . ‘make it work’ if David Miliband decided he wanted to come back to the . political  front line. But asked if he would relinquish the shadow chancellorship, he replied: ‘There’s a limit even to my generosity.’ In his conference speech today, Mr Balls will say building 100,000 more affordable homes would help kick-start the economy and create hundreds of thousands of jobs. ‘We’re just one of two G20 countries in recession, the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. And because we are in recession, the deficit is now not going down, it’s going up – by 22 per cent so far this year,’ he will say. ‘There is nothing credible about a plan that leads to a double-dip recession, thousands of businesses bust, a million young people out of work, billions wasted on a soaring benefits bill, and borrowing going up not down. 'Rising borrowing, not to invest in the jobs of the future, but to pay for the mounting costs of this government’s economic failure.’ A Treasury source said the Government had not made any decision on what to do with the proceeds of the 4G sale. ‘Balls is all over the place – a feeble attempt to regain lost economic credibility with vague promises of a spending review after the election, then an unfunded stamp-duty cut, and now more spending,’ the source added. ‘It is total incoherence.’ Ed Miliband: He insisted he would undergo no Margaret Thatcher-style makeover to make him more attractive to voters before an election . Labour's attempts to overhaul Ed Miliband’s image by portraying him as a man of the people were undermined yesterday as he insisted he was proud to be seen as a 'pointy-headed’ policy wonk. The party launched a TV film relentlessly highlighting Mr Miliband’s comprehensive school background in an apparent attempt to contrast his upbringing with that of Old Etonian David Cameron. Old schoolfriends and teachers went before the cameras to suggest Mr Miliband’s ordinary education helped him to understand the lives of voters. Polls suggest Mr Miliband’s personal ratings are well behind those of David Cameron, with voters struggling to see him as a credible  prime minister. The main aim for this year’s Labour conference in Manchester appears to be to bring across his personality to voters and give more of a sense of what makes him tick. Mr Miliband, however, flatly rejected suggestions that he should undergo a makeover like Margaret Thatcher, who was coached to lower her voice and had her hair restyled before winning in 1979. 'I’m certainly not going to be doing that,’ the Labour leader declared. Asked if he minded being seen as 'pointy-headed,’ Mr Miliband said: 'I think it’s rather a compliment. 'I’m my own person and I’m going to do it my own way. I think ideas matter in politics and I’m not embarrassed about that, right?’ Mr Miliband dismissed a poll commissioned by the Conservatives suggesting that two-thirds of Labour supporters think his brother David would be a better leader for the party. 'It’s quite a compliment the Tories produced a poll about me,’ he said. 'It shows I’ve got them worried.’ Pressed on whether his brother would return to Labour’s top team, Mr Miliband said: 'He made a decision not to join the shadow cabinet and that continues to be his view, that he wants to be in the front line but not on the front bench.’ According to an updated biography of  Mr . Miliband, towards the end of last year David was overheard saying: 'Ed . will crash and burn.’ The former foreign secretary was in . Manchester yesterday for the start of the conference, but will leave . before his brother’s keynote speech tomorrow. Asked yesterday if he had seen the . poll suggesting he would be a more popular leader, David replied: 'Yes, . but the most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems . greener on the other side of the fence. 'I’m determined to do everything I can by supporting him (Ed) . . . sometimes that means speaking out, but it also means having the modesty sometimes to keep out of the way.’ Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, increasingly touted as a future leadership contender, admitted yesterday that Labour was not good enough at explaining its policies in ways that voters feel is relevant. 'We haven’t connected enough with people’s lives,’ he said. 'One of the problems sometimes is talking in jargon and percentages. You’ve got to relate what we say to people’s lives and make it relevant.’ Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman admitted many voters do not even know yet who Mr Miliband is. She told the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme: 'We need to set forth our plans, because people want to know that Ed Miliband has a strong set of plans so that the politics of a government can make a difference to their life, and he’s very determined  he will do that.’","Shadow Chancellor insists Labour has no apology to make on the economy .

The plane in which seven Britons died en route to Mount Everest may have been critically overloaded when it crashed and burst into flames, a senior figure from the firm that operated the aircraft said last night. The admission from Sita Air’s marketing director Dipendra Shahi came after he was shown a picture taken by a Mail on Sunday photographer of the mound of rucksacks at the wreckage site. Looking shocked as he studied the photograph, Mr Shahi said: ‘Personally I still believe it was a simple case of a bird strike, but it is possible that overloading played a part.’ Overloaded?: The picture of rucksacks and personal belongings found at the wreckage site in Nepal . Victims: Stephen Holding, pictured left with his wife Maggie, and Benjamin Ogden, pictured with his girlfriend Stephanie, were both killed in the plane crash that killed 19 people . Fireball: Firefighters battle to douse the burning wreckage of a plane which crashed on the edge of the Nepalese capital, killing 19 people including seven Britons . The tragedy has been blamed simply on the plane striking a bird of prey, possibly a vulture, at a height of 50ft as it took off from Tribhuvan Airport in the Nepalese capital heading for Lukla near Everest. But experts have now cast doubt on whether that alone would have prevented the pilot from bringing the Sita Air Dornier D-228 back around for an emergency landing at the airport. The Mail on Sunday picture adds to growing suspicions that the pilot allowed too many passengers with too much luggage aboard – which would have impaired the aircraft’s ability to pull up out of danger. Indian government aviation minister Suresh Acharya said that the combined weight of passengers and luggage carried by the plane would play a key part in the inquiry, which British investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch will join this week. Mr Acharya said: ‘We have taken the load factor seriously and the fact-finding committee will most certainly look into the matter. The exact cause of the crash is still unclear. Tragic deaths: Britons Raymond Eagle, left, and Timothy Oakes, right, were both killed in the crash . Destroyed: The fire quickly spread to the rear of the plane, but the tail was still in one piece at the scene near the Manohara River on the south-west edge of Kathmandu . ‘The bird strike may not be the sole reason behind the crash.’ And Kuma Sherchan, an experienced pilot with the Nepal  Airlines Corporation said: ‘A bird hitting the plane should not be considered in isolation during the investigation. ‘Several factors, such as technical maintenance, load, pressure on airline operators and many more, lead to an air crash.’ All those on board – including 12 people from Nepal and China – died in the inferno when the twin-prop aircraft ploughed into a riverbank minutes after take off. The Britons, who arrived in Nepal on Wednesday and were due to begin trekking in the Himalayas on Friday, were travelling with Hampshire-based company Explore Worldwide. They were named as Raymond Eagle, 58, from Macclesfield, Cheshire; Timothy Oakes, 57, from Winwick, near Warrington, and his friend Stephen Holding, 60, from Barlaston in Stoke-on-Trent; Vincent Kelly, 50, from Lostock, Bolton, and his brother Darren, 45, from Isle of Whithorn, Galloway; Christopher Davey,  51, from Moulton in Northamptonshire; and lawyer Benjamin Ogden, 27, from London. Former headmaster Mr Oakes and retired science teacher Mr Holding had been childhood friends and were members of a climbing club. Killed: Vincent Kelly, left, from Lostock, Bolton, and his brother Darren Kelly, right, from Isle of Whithorn . Major operation: Hundreds of rescuers and members of the public swarm around the site as investigators begin to piece together the events that led up to the tragedy . Last night Mr Holding’s widow, Maggie, said in a statement: ‘Steve always loved being in the mountains. Traveller: Christopher Davey, 51, from Moulton in Northamptonshire, died in the crash . ‘He had done a lot of work with Peak Pursuits taking youngsters on Duke of Edinburgh activities.’Mr Oakes’s wife, Angie Gaunt, 54, wept as she said he ‘died  doing something he always wanted to do.’ Mr Ogden, an Oxford-educated lawyer, lived with girlfriend Stephanie Illingworth in London and worked at international law firm Allen & Overy. Miss Illingworth said yesterday they had planned to marry and she had lost her ‘soulmate’. She added: ‘My whole world has been turned upside down.’ Relatives in Britain are likely to face a harrowing wait before their loved ones’ remains can be identified and returned home. The pathologist conducting post-mortems and trying to identify the badly charred bodies said the process could take several days using a combination of DNA samples, dental records and matching personal jewellery. Professor Pramod Shrestha of Maharajgunj Medical Campus described the task as ‘one of the most difficult I’ve dealt with.’ He said families in the UK had already been sent identification forms on which they list distinctive items of jewellery and consent to dental checks. The tragedy is the latest in a series of fatal air accidents in Nepal. In the 20 years before  Friday’s disaster six crashes claimed the lives of 225 people.","Plane was heading to Lukla - the gateway to Mount Everest, which attracts thousands of tourists every year when it crashed .

All but one of the girls pictured were turned away from the dance . Scandal: Half the girls that arrived to attend the Stansbury High homecoming dance were barred from entering because their hemlines showed an inch of thigh - a length deemed dangerous because it revealed the girls' scandalous knees. Both these young ladies were turned away at the dance . Knees: But the school dress code states that teens could wear dresses that 'at or near knee length' causing confusion and shattered dreams on an evening that was supposed to celebrate the beginning of the school year . Students believed they were following the dress code when they spent hundreds of dollars on their festive wear, but one by one, were turned away. As many as half the students were rejected at the door. 'It was just utter shock at first,' said Amber Hesleph to KSL. 'Here we are spending all this time and everything and then we get there and they just turn us away. It's just kind of depressing.' Parents who were dropping their children off, after first taking memorable snapshots of their teens, were also flabbergasted at the melee. 'If you're going to arbitrarily paint scarlet letters all over children, then something has to change,' Donna Hesleph, Amber's mother, said. Many parents and students shared their frustration on a Facebook page titled 'Stansbury High Homecoming Spirit Massacre.' More than 3,300 people liked it by this morning.

On the site, mothers and daughters posted photographs of their dresses and smiles before the dance, explaining how many of them paid to get hemlines taken out and shoulder straps extended to make the look more modest - to no avail. Reminder: The Formal Dance Dress Code is located on page 30 of the student planner and there are posters up around school showing examples. Students are expected to look their best and dress appropriately. Dresses should be at or near knee length. Slits in the dresses should not be any higher than the top of the knee. Strapless dresses are prohibited unless a jacket or shawl is worn. 'Plunging' necklines are prohibited. The backs of dresses should not show more than 1/3 of the back (directly below the armpits). Midriffs should not show in any way. 'Sheer' fabric is acceptable, as long as skin is not showing underneath. Even the homecoming queen was turned away. 'They told me that it was showing my knees so therefore it was too short, and in order to get into the dance I needed to put on leggings,' Miss Alvey said. 'So I did and I got back in the dance, but that was before I realized that this thing was going to turn into such a big issue.' The principal insisted that the dress code was posted before the dance, but that the vague rule that 'dresses should be at or near knee length' had disastrous consequences. 'It's been our dress standard in our previous handbooks but the vagueness seemed to come to the surface this time and, again, it needs to be addressed and we'll get it fixed,' principal Kendall Topham said to KSL. He held four assemblies on Monday, one for each grade, and apologized to the students. He promised to host a replacement dance at a future date.

Gravity measurements reveal deformations in Titan's interior that suggest a layer of liquid 'sloshing around' A watery ocean may lie beneath the surface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, scientists believe. Gravity measurements reveal deformations in Titan's interior that suggest a layer of liquid ‘sloshing around’. The ocean is thought to be made of water with a depth of a couple of hundred kilometres. It appears to cover the entire moon beneath 100 kilometres of ice. The evidence comes from the American space agency Nasa's probe Cassini, which made six fly-bys of Titan between 2006 and 2011. Scientists used signals beamed back by Cassini to measure distortions in Titan's gravitational field. The data showed something strange happening in the moon's interior which indicated the presence of liquid water. Writing in the journal Science, the planetary experts led by Dr Luciano Iess, from La Sapienza University in Rome, concluded: ‘Such a large response to the tidal field requires that Titan's interior is deformable over time scales of the orbital period, in a way that is consistent with a global ocean at depth.’ Titan is now believed to belong to an elite ‘club’ of moons with sub-surface oceans. Other members include Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Scientists have speculated about the possibility of life evolving in the hidden oceans. But there are doubts about whether anything could survive on icy Titan. In a news story accompanying the research paper, Science writer Richard Kerr says: ‘Inside Europa, planetary scientists believe hot springs on a rocky ocean floor may be belching all the nutrients and inorganic building blocks required by life. ‘But other kinds of gravity studies show that Titan has a cold, icy ocean floor, so no hot water can be leaching life-giving chemicals into the ocean.’","Measurements show water below surface .

The AntiSec hacking group claims to have over 12 million IDs, known as Unique Device Identifiers, in total - as well as personal information such as user names, . device names, notification tokens, cell phone numbers and addresses. It has released a million of them online - but has removed the most personal data. Have claim to have obtained more than 12 million ID codes Apple uses to identify its gadgets, along with user names and password. The FBI was today facing major questions over why it held the data.

However, before releasing the data, the group removed most of the personal details. Graham Cluley of computer security firm Sophos believes the FBI now has serious questions to answer. 'Hacktivists are out to embarrass organisations, and it would appear the FBI were lax in storage of data. 'However, we have to be grateful they haven't published more personal information and held back data.

A controversial web site that publishes twitter users home addresses online has come under fire from security experts. The site uses location information it says many people unwittingly transmit every time they send a tweet. It then matches this to their home address, even providing a Google Street View image of their home in some cases. weKnowYourHouse.com checks for users who have included the work home in a tweet and have transmitted their location. It then displays their address, and even a picture . Many mobile phone twitter apps can transmit a user's location. The site looks for this location in any tweet containing the word 'home'. When it finds a match, it uses Google Maps to match the location with an address. After removing the most sensitive parts of the address, it it published on the web site . The creators of WeKnowYourHouse.com say they are providing a service by alerting users to the location feature. They describe the site as 'an experiment'. they also claim similar privacy issues exist with other services such as FourSquare and Google's Latitude. 'Our advice is don't check in at your own home, whether using Twitter . with locations, Foursquare, Google Latitude, or any other location-aware . service, because you're telling the world exactly where you live,' the team say on the site. 'This website simply takes that, runs it through a geocoder to turn it . into a human readable address, and links it with Google Street View.' The team even boast of how simple the site was to set up. 'The . code is not particularly complicated either, and is done completely . automatically.' The site says it deletes user's data after an hour, and also offers user an option to opt out of the site. The site displays a constantly rolling list of usernames and addresses, with full details removed to retain some privacy for users. Security experts have described the site as 'scary'. 'The site promises that it only keeps the last hour of data, and then fully deletes it, but it's scary to see how much information can be compiled against someone so quickly, using information that is freely available,' said Anna Brading of security firm Sophos. The site also explains how to switch off location capabilities in twitter software on mobile phones. The site's creators say it was built as a warning to users. 'The idea is simple: many people tweet about being at home, and some even attach their location to it. 'This is represented as the latitude and longitude, and is completely open for any website or application to access.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, believes the site could actually help users by drawing attention to the location information. 'The simple truth is that mobile phones are tracking devices that let us make calls,' he said. 'Many people are sharing their location with a whole range of services without realising just how seriously they are compromising their privacy. 'As this website shows, the number of people who share information that could identify where they live continues to be a major cause for concern and it’s a very useful tool to highlight just how big a problem this is. 'It further highlights the need for much stronger regulation of what happens with our personal information, particularly geolocation data.' He also called on technology firms such as Google, Apple and Twitter to be more open about their capabilities and help educate users. 'Equally, the organisations involved need to do much more to educate consumers about what data is being shared and how they can take control of it.' Mobile phone user's could be accidentally revealing their home address when they tweet, a controversial website that publishes twitter user's location online claims. Mr Pickles fear that as firms begin to harness the potential of using mobile phone user's location data to target them with adverts, the problem could get much worse. 'However, when profit from targeted advertisements relies on using location data, consumers are seeing the perils of companies putting profit before privacy.' Twitter initially suspended the @WeKnowYourHouse account earlier this week, temporarily cutting off its access to tweets. However, the account appeared to have been reinstated today, and the site was working normally.

These spectacular photos show the surface of the sun in incredible detail - and yet they were taken from an ordinary English country garden. For as these clouds of solar matter whirl around on the fiery star 93 million miles away, they are under the keen eye of astronomer Paul Andrew, who is simply standing by his back door in St Margaret’s Bay, near Dover, in Kent. Thanks to a special solar telescope costing thousands of pounds, Mr Andrew can take photographs almost as clear as the world’s best observatories. Scroll down for video . Stunning detail: Paul Andrews can capture solar emissions from the comfort of his home in Kent . 93 million miles away - but just down the lens: Paul's telescope can pick up details of sun spots and solar flares . Mr Andrew, 58, said: 'I can get an amazing amount of detail now. The bigger the telescope, the finer the detail that can be seen. 'I think the amount of detail you can actually see on the surface of the sun now is fantastic. I love watching the jets of gas that have been thrown off the surface. It can change from minute to minute.' He added: 'That is one of the most exciting things about this kind of photography. Only the other day I saw a big flare go up. It only lasted a couple of minutes before burning up and fading away.' Mr Andrew’ new telescope has a six-inch diameter lens which filters out the sun’s harmful rays. Its photographs, taken from his back garden, depict strands of hydrogen gas sticking out from the sun's profile. Filaments of gas shoot out millions of miles from the sun's surface, before falling back down onto the surface of the star . Another filament takes off from the sun, as a sun spot - a relatively cooler patch - swims across the surface . In the front-on images, they appear as dark lines or strokes and are known as filaments. Mr Andrew, a professional photographer, added: 'I try and get out as early as possible in the morning, around 9am. 'As the day goes on the earth’s atmosphere becomes very turbulent and you can actually degrade the image of the sun. 'Photographs taken in the morning tend to be a lot clearer and sharper.' Paul Andrews in his garden observatory, which - ignoring the clouds - allows him to capture the spectacular images . Mr Andrew is the founder and president of his local astronomy society and has been taking images of the sun for around five years. The father of one added: 'These photos have been taken over the last two months, since I got my new specialised solar telescope. 'It’s just about the biggest commercial telescope you can get, and filters out the harmful white light, heat and ultra violet light that would damage your eye sight. 'Now I can see the hydrogen gas bubbling and will dash out when the sun comes out between the clouds.'

For 24 years, Aung San Suu Kyi was either under house arrest or too fearful that if she left Myanmar, the government would never let her return. Now, in a sign of how much life there has changed, she's back to being a world traveler. Bangkok's towering skyscrapers and sprawling urban lights will be the opposition leader's first glimpse of the outside world when she lands Tuesday night to kick off a tour of two continents. It's a stark contrast to the sleepy city of Yangon, where the former military regime kept her a prisoner in her own home for a total of 15 years. Respected: Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi pictured at a press conference following a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last Tuesday . Suu Kyi was to spend several days in Thailand, where she'll speak Friday at the World Economic Forum on East Asia. She'll return to Myanmar briefly and head to Europe in mid-June, with stops including Geneva and Oslo - to formally accept the Nobel Peace Prize she won 21 years ago. In Dublin, she'll share a stage with U2 frontman Bono, a staunch Suu Kyi supporter, at a concert in her honor, according to Irish media. In England, she has been given the rare honor of addressing both houses of Parliament. France's Foreign Ministry says she also plans to stop in Paris. Distinguished: The political prisoner met with the Indian leader ahead of her foreign trip . Prison: The riverside spot where Aung San Suu Kyi was detained under house arrest by the military regime in Yangon, Myanmar . The tour marks Suu Kyi's latest step in a stunning trajectory from housewife to political prisoner to opposition leader in Parliament, as Myanmar opens to the outside world and sheds a half century of military rule. Meetings with world leaders are planned along the way as dignitaries line up to shake Suu Kyi's hand. The last time the 66-year-old Nobel laureate flew abroad was a year before the Berlin Wall came down, in April 1988, when she traveled from London to Myanmar to nurse her dying mother. Until then she had led an international lifestyle, growing up partly in India, where her mother was ambassador. The world was a different place the last time Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar. The Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union still existed. Bangkok, the city Suu Kyi visits this week, now has towering skyscrapers, a subway and elevated rail system and slightly milder traffic jams. Elsewhere in 1988: . She later attended Oxford, worked for the United Nations in New York and Bhutan and then married British academic Michael Aris and raised their two sons in England. Suu Kyi returned to Myanmar just as an uprising erupted against the military regime. As daughter of Gen. Aung San, the country's independence hero, she was thrust into the forefront of demonstrations until the military brutally crushed the protests and locked her under house arrest in 1989. Over the next two decades she became the world's most famous political prisoner. During intermittent periods of freedom, she declined opportunities to go abroad for fear she would not be allowed to re-enter Myanmar. Suu Kyi's commitment to the cause came at high personal cost. In 1999, she stayed in Myanmar even as her husband was dying of cancer in England. They last saw each other in 1995, after which the junta denied Aris a visa. After her release from house arrest in November 2010, Suu Kyi had an emotional reunion with her youngest son, Kim Aris, when the junta gave him a visa after a decade-long separation. The English leg of Suu Kyi's trip is bound to include some family time. She will celebrate her 67th birthday on June 19 while in England, where Kim lives. Suu Kyi's aides have offered few details about her trip aside from the destinations, saying only that she will pack medicine for motion sickness. 'She gets airsick and seasick very easily. She will have to take her pills to prevent airsickness,' said Win Htein, a senior official from her National League for Democracy party. He said she was typically stoic ahead of her travels: 'She doesn't look too excited about it.' Thailand was not part of the original itinerary but Suu Kyi decided last week to attend the economic forum. She has a Friday speaking slot that is bound to be the event's main attraction. Suu Kyi's appearance at the conference had threatened to upstage that of Myanmar President Thein Sein, but he canceled over the weekend citing 'urgent matters' at home, said Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Thani Thongphakdi. He rescheduled his first official visit to Thailand for next week. Sad: Suu Kyi's commitment to her cause came at high personal cost.

Finally: Clasped hands of Aung San Suu Kyi as she was reunited with her son Kim Aris at the Yangon International Airport in November 2010 . Thein Sein took power last year from the military junta following elections that were deemed unfair by international observers. Since then he has surprised much of the world by engineering sweeping reforms, though military leaders still have great control over the country. Since Suu Kyi's release, many international dignitaries have visited her in Myanmar, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in December and British Prime Minister David Cameron in April. Cameron suggested she visit her 'beloved Oxford' in June. Suu Kyi replied at the time: 'Two years ago I would have said 'Thank you for the invitation, but sorry.' 'But now I am able to say 'Perhaps,' and that's great progress.'","Democracy campaigner to finally pick up Nobel Peace Prize in Geneva .

It still has the same gleaming red paintwork and immaculate grey nylon weave interior as it did the day it rolled off the assembly line. The odometer shows just delivery mileage and there are no proper licence plates as the owner has not yet had it registered with the DVLA. Which is odd, since the car in question is a Ford Cortina Mark V, built more than 30 years ago. Pride and joy: Frank Sheach, from Dundee, with the 31-year-old Ford Cortina which he is selling . Despite its venerable age, this unique 'brand new' GL-badged Cortina has never been driven on a public road, as the absence of wear on its tyres testifies, and its Scots owner Frank Sheach has only ever allowed it out of locked storage on the back of a trailer for rare appearances at classic car shows. Now, the 47-year-old car enthusiast, who bought the car seven years ago for £9,995, has decided to auction off his pride and joy and the car’s unusual provenance could spark a bidding war among fanatical old Ford collectors. Mr Sheach, a member of the Tayside Classic Car Club, said yesterday: 'I don’t think there will be another one in this condition. There’s only delivery mileage on the clock and it’s brand new. First-class conditon: Mr Sheach, a member of the Tayside Classic Car Club, said yesterday: 'I don't think there will be another one in this condition. There's only delivery mileage on the clock and it's brand new' Unique: Mr Sheach's 2.0L, four-speed petrol version was among the last batch of Mk Vs to leave Ford's Dagenham plant in 1981 before production switched to the new Sierra model . 'Initially, I bought it to drive it. I had already done up another Cortina as a hobby and I have always liked them. They were the type of cars I worked on when I did my engineering apprenticeship so I always had a soft spot for them. Overview At first glance the Cortina ‘80 didn’t look much different to the MkIV, but it received a huge number of improvements that kept it on top until the arrival of the Sierra in 1982. The most prized models are the wood-trimmed Ghia and the run-out Crusader, which buyers clamoured for in 1982, in preference to buying a new Sierra. Price at launch: £3475 . 0-60mph: 16.1secs . Top speed: 87mph . Power: 61bhp . Torque: 68lb/ft . Length: 4326mm . Wheelbase: 2578mm . Width: 1702mm . Height: 1321mm . Weight: 965kgs . 'Because of its unique history, I always resisted driving it. I used to take it to car rallies on the back of trailer puller by my other Cortina, which is actually older. 'But there is only so long you can keep doing that, so I have decided to sell up and give someone else the pleasure of owning this piece of Britain’s motoring history.' More than 2,600,000 Ford Cortinas were sold in Britain in the 20 years since its launch in 1962, making it the third most popular car ever sold in the UK. A Mk III revived popularity when it starred in the hit BBC One detective series Life On Mars. The MkV easily stood out from the MkIV predecessor due to its larger lamp clusters, wraparound bumpers and newly-designed aeroflow radiator grille. Build quality and rust resistance were also improved. Mr Sheach’s 2.0L, four-speed petrol version was among the last batch of Mk Vs to leave Ford’s Dagenham plant in 1981 before production switched to the new Sierra model. It was immediately snapped up by Midlands millionaire TC Harrison, who had a number of Ford dealerships around the country and built up a celebrated collection of 'last ever' models. The vehicle was sent direct from the factory to TC Harrison Group in 1982 with no fluids and had been dry stored for 23 years, before being sold to Mr Schiach in 2005 for £9,995. When father-of-two Mr Sheach, who is chief engineer for National Express in Dundee, bought the car seven years ago, he left the DVLA 'flummoxed” when he tried to register it for use. 'I got it after I was told about it by someone in my car club. They said a multi-millionaire enthusiast called TC Harrison had kept it in his collection since buying it new. Apparently, he used to buy the last model made of different kinds of cars and he bought this one when Ford stopped making Cortinas and started the Sierra. 'He kept it until he died and then I bought it. Up for auction: Frank Sheach will be hoping a keen Ford fan is taken with the Cortina . Showroom shine: Mr Sheach added: 'I have no idea what it would be worth now, but it would have been about £5,500 new in 1981. I am still considering my options for how best to auction it' 'It came out the same year the Sierra . was launched and it doesn’t even have a number plate. The plate just . says Cortina. Anybody who buys it can choose their own number if they . want to register it. 'I . went to the DVLA and asked what number it would get and they didn’t . know. They had never been asked about the first registration of such an . old car before and it completely flummoxed them. 'Eventually . somebody said there was no reason why it could not be given the latest . number available, which would make it a 61-plate. Then, they said it . could be given a number that would have been generated on the computer . from 1981, which would make it a Y-reg.' Mr Sheach added: 'I have no idea what it would be worth now, but it would have been about £5,500 new in 1981. I am still considering my options for how best to auction it. Dave Richards, editor of Classic Car Weekly magazine, said: 'This is very exciting news to see a Ford from the Harrison collection come onto the market and still in such good condition, although anyone who wants to drive it will have to spend a bit of money making it road-worthy. 'It is possible that Mr Sheach only manage to get back what he paid for the car at auction, but Ford collectors can be fanatical and if two of them decide they really want it then the sky’s the limit really.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:39 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:33 EST, 20 July 2012 . Two shocking acts yesterday starkly illustrated the seam of cruelty that runs through parts of our supposed animal-loving society. In one incident, a thug filmed his terrified pet cat being put through a tumble dryer cycle three times. In the other, an owner abandoned his injured dog after she was thrown on to a motorway at 80mph. The RSPCA is investigating  both cases which have been variously described as callous, savage and vile. Mistreated: Hattie was thrown from a horsebox on to the M56 near Cheshire but the three-year-old Lurcher, pictured left with veterinary nurse Nikki Butterworth now expected to make a full recovery . In a state: This is Hattie pictured just moments after she was brought to Beech House Vets in Warrington . Inspectors said the three-year-old lurcher – nicknamed Hattie by rescuers – was lucky to be alive after being hurled from a horsebox on the M56 near Altrincham in Cheshire. Despite suffering a fractured pelvis and numerous other injuries in the fall, the dog miraculously managed to dodge other drivers to get to safety. She dragged herself to a grass bank next to the hard shoulder and was tended to by two passing motorists who stopped to help. According to witnesses, the driver of a pick-up truck which was towing the horsebox stopped and went back to the pet but fled when the lurcher barked at him. Fractures: This X-ray shows the damage to Hattie's hip after she tumbled from the horsebox on to the M56 . Painful: Hattie's pelvis was fractured in three places and had to be patched up with a surgical plate and six screws . Surgery scar: Hattie's operation cost £1,500, £600 of which was donated by the RSPCA's Altrincham branch . Animal welfare officer Katie Glenn said: ‘I’m shocked. 'We’re not sure whether she jumped or was pushed but the fact is she should not have been on that horsebox when it was travelling at speed along the motorway.’ Inspectors are also investigating the case of a yob who uploaded a film on the internet of him shoving a cat into a tumble dryer and turning it on by shutting the door. The pet, called Princess, is seen going round inside the machine and is thought to have been put through the ordeal at least three times. The film was posted on an internet forum for radio controlled car enthusiasts by a martial arts fan calling himself ‘Nitroazza’. The cute cat Princess is pictured before her terrifying ordeal . The owner films himself forcing the cat into the tumble dryer . The cruel owner is seen shutting the door with the cat inside . Listing his location as Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, he said: ‘Like cats? Check out my cat, the new version of Mr Tumble.’ He capped the ‘joke’ with a smiley face before asking users to comment and rate his video. In later posts he told viewers his cat was called Princess – and that she should be shot. The thug said in his forum profile that he was 22, had a wife and baby son and also did kickboxing. Horrified forum members attacked the vile video, which has now been removed from the website. One said: ‘There is something not right here. I was trying to figure out if it was real or not. I certainly hope not.’ A still image of the footage uploaded online shows 'Princess' the cat trapped inside the tumble dryer. The video has now been taken down. The sick footage was uploaded to the Sportsmodel UK web forum with this message - which asks users to rate the video . The video is later taken down and an apology is posted by the owner . The man later posted a half-hearted apology, writing: ‘It was wrong of me to put up edits of animals, especially in that manner up on public forums. 'I am very sorry if your [sic] a cat lover.’ If he is found, the man could be jailed for up to six months and fined £20,000 for animal cruelty. An RSPCA spokesman said inspectors wanted to hear from anybody who could give them the attacker’s real name and address. ‘The video is really horrible. We were shocked,’ she said. ‘The door to the tumble dryer was opened and closed three times. ‘The poor cat would have been very distressed. Obviously we are very concerned about it.’","Police are hunting the owner of Princess the cat after he stuck her in the tumble dryer three times and posted footage of it on YouTube .

Craig Hepburn, 19, died in hospital after he was found in Marsden, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday. An 18-year-old man was also taken to hospital with stab wounds. A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said a 36-year-old man and a 21-year-old man had been charged with murder and attempted murder. They will appear before Huddersfield Magistrates' Court this morning. Officers were called to an incident in the Manchester Road, Town Gate, Old Mount Road area of Marsden shortly after midnight on Saturday. They found Mr Hepburn and the 18-year-old, both from Renfrewshire, Scotland, who had both been stabbed. The pair were taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where Mr Hepburn later died from his injuries. The police spokesman said: 'Two men, aged 36 and 21 years, have been charged with murder and attempted murder and will appear before Huddersfield Magistrates tomorrow morning.' The Scottish teenagers had spent the . evening in good spirits, playing the bagpipes and making friends in pubs . in Marsden, West Yorkshire. They were visiting Mr Hepburn’s uncle and were about 300 yards from his house when they were apparently attacked. Mr . Hepburn suffered ‘multiple’ stab wounds and collapsed dying on the . pavement. His male friend, who was also stabbed, managed to stagger back . to the house and raise the alarm. The pair were taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where Mr Hepburn died. His friend was undergoing surgery at the hospital yesterday. Although he lost a lot of blood, police said he was not suffering from life-threatening injuries. The teenager, who has not been named, was able to say a few words, but police have been unable to take a detailed statement from him. Detectives remain baffled by the horrific incident. Mr Hepburn and his friend were described as ‘jolly lads’. Eyewitnesses said they had been drinking in three bars in the village centre, but they were good-natured all evening and caused no trouble. One of the teenagers was wearing a . Manchester City shirt, but the detective leading the murder inquiry said . this was not believed to be a factor in the attack. Tributes: A group of women arrive to lay flowers near the scene in Marsden, near Huddersfield . Investigation: Police carry out a search through woodland following the horrific attack . The teenagers were set upon near a graveyard around midnight on Friday. Police were alerted by a 999 call to paramedics. Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘What happened is still a secret which lies between whoever did this, the dead man, and the man now in surgery who we cannot speak to. ‘The two victims are friends who were both down from Scotland visiting relatives and staying in the village for a few days. ‘They were having a night out in the village and it looks as if there was a confrontation in the street. ‘They had enjoyed the night and were making their way back to the relatives’ house where they were staying. Attack: An 18-year-old man was also taken to hospital with stab wounds. Marsden is pictured . ‘They were just a couple of lads enjoying a night out. ‘The weapon was a knife but we have not found it yet and there may be more than one. ‘It is unlikely they knew their attackers because they did not know anyone else in the village.’ Mr Hepburn’s parents travelled down . from their home in Renfrewshire and were staying with his uncle Scott . Hepburn, who refused to comment yesterday. Police have appealed for witnesses and are trying to establish precisely where the teenagers were attacked and why. Mr . Taylor said: ‘Marsden is a close-knit community and if anyone hears any . rumours about what has happened then I would ask them to get in touch.’ Hospitalised: The murdered teenager's friend was taken to Huddersfield General Infirmary where he is in intensive care . A local man who was drinking in a bar with Mr Hepburn and his friend shortly before the incident said they were ‘very well behaved’. He added: ‘I was chatting to the older lad and he put his arm around me. They were just having a good time and were good fun. ‘One of them played the bagpipes in the pub next door. This is a beautiful, peaceful village and it’s a shock that something like this has happened. ‘I don’t think these two would have done anything to provoke an attack – they were not like that – although they were a bit drunk.’ Local resident Gordon Stokes added: ‘From what I know, they were doing nothing wrong. They seemed well behaved and seemed really friendly. ‘They were not violent towards anyone and were just having a good time.’ Marsden, which has a population of 4,400, is surrounded by stunning Pennine countryside and is a popular commuter village.

The devastated family of a teenager who collapsed and died at a music festival after apparently taking a 'legal high' have warned about the dangers of taking drugs. The grieving family of Alex Herriot described the 19-year-old as a 'happy, caring and kind young man' after he collapsed at the RockNess festival in Scotland. Mr Herriot, from Portobello in Edinburgh, is thought to have experimented with a legal drug called Benzo Fury at the festival, on the shores of Loch News at Dores in the Highlands. The 19-year-old collapsed in the main area on Saturday night and died in hospital a short time later. His relatives say he was not a habitual user of drugs and had been warned to steer clear of them. They spoke of their devastation at the loss of an 'immensely popular' young man, saying they would never get over his death. In a statement issued through Northern Constabulary, the family said: 'Alex, our much loved son, was happy, caring, kind, loyal and affectionate and joined in enthusiastically with any project. He was very popular with a large group of close, good friends. 'He was beautiful both on the outside and the inside where it matters most. He loved his life. 'The fact that we will not be seeing him wandering around the house with his laptop playing his music, teasing his sister and asking if there was any food and 'could he have a bus fare please' is unbearable. 'Alex was attending a music festival which he had been looking forward to enormously. As a young man who enjoyed life, it was unfortunate he chose to experiment with a drug that had such a catastrophic effect on his system. 'We are devastated that we have lost him but anything he did, in every area of his life, was done with good intent, in this case to get the most out of his festival experience.' Mr Herriot had almost completed an HND in media studies and planned to go to Edinburgh's Queen Margaret University. He was said to have enjoyed film, anime, comedy and music. Thanking the police and the medics who tried to save his life, the family said: 'The sudden death of our beloved son Alex has left his family in a state of shock and is a loss we will never get over. On Thursday, the teenager, had written on his Twitter profile page about how much he was looking forward to the Scottish music festival . Festival: More than 30,000 people attended the weekend event and police said 144 revellers had been arrested over drug possession and one for dealing .

Mr Herriot died in the early hours of Sunday morning at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, failing to respond to treatment. Police said over the weekend that early indications show that he may have taken drugs. Officers said a 19-year-old girl and a . 20-year-old man were also taken to hospital from the festival in the . early hours of Sunday morning.

Toxicology tests are being carried out to discover what substance or mixture, if any, was involved. Benzo Fury can be bought wholesale over the internet and usually sells for £10 a pill, or £25 for three. Mr Heriot's father told the Daily . Record: 'We are still talking to the police liaison people and we are . not sure of the full circumstances of what has happened. 'We are still struggling to take it in.' On Thursday, the teenager, who was . studying at Jewel and Esk College in Dalkeith, Midlothian, had written . on his Twitter webpage about how much he was looking forward to the . festival, headlined by acts including Mumford & Sons. Benzo Fury can be bought wholesale over the internet and usually sells for £10 a pill, or £25 for three. He wrote: ‘To say I am excited for RockNess 2012 is an absolute understatement.’ More . than 30,000 people attended the weekend event and police said 144 . revellers had been arrested over drug possession and one for dealing. Legal highs defeat sniffer dogs which are not trained to detect legal substances and so far no other Benzo Fury has been found. Police . and organisers minimised the risk of controlled drugs at the festival . through measures, including searches and the use of drugs dogs as well . as amnesty bins. Event . commander, Superintendent Stevie Mackay, said: 'Taking drugs or any . medicines, which you have not been prescribed, is an extremely risky . thing to do. 'If anyone has the tablets described or any other drug, whether controlled or a 'legal high', in their possession, they are advised not to take them and to hand these in. 'Amnesty bins are available at the main Nesstival entrance or anyone can hand in substances to Crew 2000 at the welfare tent.' ‘Legal highs’ are substances which produce the same, or similar effects, to drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, but are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act. There are a large number of 'legal highs' - some are known by their brand/product name, such as Benzo Fury and it's not always clear what's in these products and their contents can change regularly. Legal high deaths: Hester Stewart's body, left, was found next to a bottle of GBL in a house in Brighton after a party while Lois Waters, right 24, is believed to have taken party drug mephedrone - known as meow meow - in the lead up to her death . In recent years there have been . several highly publicised cases of young people dying after taking drugs . which were legal highs.

Brighton after a party in 2009, while Lois Waters, 24, is . believed to have taken party drug mephedrone - known as meow meow - in . the lead up to her death in 2009. Both . substances are now banned, but health professionals and police fear . each time a drug is outlawed, a new alternative is introduced on to the . market. Benzo Fury is a man-made amphetamine which can give users a euphoric high and induces feelings of empathy similar to ecstasy. It is also a stimulant and its side effects include loss of appetite, hallucinations and paranoia. Fatal collision: Two men killed in a road crash on Friday that involved a bus taking people to RockNess have been named as Mark McFarlane, 38, and Barry Murray, 28 .

"By . Paul Harris . PUBLISHED: . 11:06 EST, 25 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:35 EST, 25 June 2012 . As historic landmarks go, it hardly ranks as a world heritage site. There’s a simple swathe of grass around the remains of some summer flowerbeds, and the rusty old signpost in the middle has clearly seen service for generations. Granted, it’s only a roundabout. But for the past 185 years there has always been something rather comforting to the good folk of Leek about the island that stands at the entrance to their town. Protest: Dozens of local residents have set up camp on a historic roundabout in Leek, Staffordshire, in a bid to stop the council replacing it with traffic lights . Taking a stand: The campaigners, including Philip Kent (pictured), are fighting to save the island in the picturesque market town, which has stood for 185 years . So much so that when highway planners announced a scheme to get rid of it, they mounted a fearless campaign to save it. Elderly ladies joined furious traders  and young mums to occupy the site on a 24-hour rota. Tents were pitched where pelargoniums . once bloomed; demonstrators started a sit-in (a sit-on, to be . technically correct); organisers hoisted a Union Flag and arrived with . banners and placards. Then they vowed that in the matter of . the people versus Staffordshire County Council – much like traffic at . the five-way junction the roundabout commands – the dispute would be . going only one way. One told the Daily Mail the . roundabout was as much a part of the market town’s geography as the . memorial clock tower overlooking it. Another said she would refuse to move . until a public inquiry threw out what she described as a ‘ridiculous, . insensitive and unnecessary’ redevelopment. The £5million revamp is part of a . planning application for a new Sainsbury’s and the ‘regeneration’ of the . surrounding area. The supermarket is paying for the work and the county . council has devised a scheme to accommodate it. An architect’s impression of how it . would look shows pedestrians strolling in leafy, traffic-free zones and . cars waiting obediently at traffic lights – but no roundabout. Claim: The protesters say the land that the roundabout is built on was bought by Leek Town Lands Trusts for £100 in 1827 on behalf of the people and therefore cannot be developed . Shift work: More than 60 residents now take it in turns to occupy the roundabout 24 hours a day by sleeping in ten tents which are pitched on the island . Landmark: The roundabout was originally a meeting place for traders entering the town in the 19th century . A council press release trumpets: . ‘The changes will help the town centre cope with expected increases in . traffic due to this and other  new developments that aim to revive the . local economy.’ It said the plan would provide better views and improved access to the Nicholson war memorial, the tallest in  the country. But the proposals have sparked a . minor revolution in Leek (motto: Arte favente nil desperandum – our . skill assisting us, we have no cause for despair). Some 1,500 people joined a protest march and more than 1,100 signed a petition to save the roundabout from destruction. The council has applied for an eviction notice. Meanwhile a legal wrangle has been . going through the courts after residents claimed the roundabout – . originally an island meeting place for 19th century traders – stands on . land owned by an ancient trust. Roger Cannon, representing protesters at a county court hearing last week, said the land was bought for £100 in 1827. Council lawyers argued it had been part of a highway since 1879. Protester Sarah said: ‘I think it is absolutely disgusting. We’re standing here doing our democratic right to protest. ‘Once this is all over, the people . that have let this town down . . . are going to absolutely regret . messing with the people of Leek.’","Campaigners are fighting to save the traffic island in the picturesque market town of Leek, Staffordshire, where it has stood for 185 years .

A convention centre, sports stadium and performing arts complex are among the landmark projects planned for a new-look Christchurch after the city was levelled by an earthquake last year. Essentially given a blank slate, government planners today unveiled a blueprint for New Zealand's oldest city that replaces office towers with green spaces, urban apartments and innovation 'hubs'. Under the plan, which is hoped will give the city the feel of a college campus, its area will be smaller, with new buildings lower in height and built with better earthquake protection. Clean and bright: This design concept distributed by Christchurch council shows the futuristic new look planned for the New Zealand city after it was devastated by earthquakes last year . Campus vibe: The plan for a revived Christchurch includes better use of green spaces and an overall design that would give more emphasis to the Avon River which winds through the city . It is nearly 18 months since the magnitude-6.1 earthquake struck, killing 185 people and irreparably damaging 1,400 buildings, including the century-old Anglican cathedral in the city centre. 'It will be safe, modern, green and will leave a legacy that makes Christchurch one of the best places in the world to live and work for many generations to come,' said the city's mayor, Bob Parker. The plan has been eagerly awaited, with many residents becoming frustrated at the slow pace of recovery. Hundreds of substantial aftershocks have hampered progress and made insurers wary, while government and city officials, including Mayor Parker, have been accused of dithering and bickering. Ambitious: This computer generated view shows the concept for the Christchurch's new stadium, seating up to 35,000 people, to be built in the city's south-east . New amenities: This image shows the design of the planned new sports centre, which will be situated in south-west Christchurch . Quality of life: According to the plan the central city square, shown here, would be divided into a number of smaller public gathering spots . Culture: A new convention centre with the capacity to hold 2,000 people would overlook the river, according to the blueprint . The planned Cricket Oval: Under the plan, the new-look Christchurch would be bordered with green spaces . A river runs through it: This plan shows how the Avon River will become a central part of the new layout of Christchurch . Old and new: This computer-generated image shows how planners intend to fuse modernity with New Zealand's Maori cultural heritage . Even before the plan was released, some wondered if they would end up footing a chunk of the bill through rate hikes. Yet for many, the plan is a welcome step forward. Some see it as a unique chance to correct problems in the city, such as an excess of older-style office space that was evident even before the earthquake. The plan also comes as the aftershocks appear to be finally abating. However, New Zealand government officials have not yet identified an overall cost for the rebuild or specific funding sources for all the new projects. Nick Bryant, a spokesman for earthquake recovery minister Gerry Brownlee, said that funding will come from a variety of sources, including local councils, private investors, insurance payouts and from the central government, which has so far set aside 5.5billion New Zealand dollars (£2.8billion) for the recovery efforts. Devastation: Rescue workers look for victims on the collapsed Pyne Gould Guinness building after the devastating earthquake struck in February last year . Desperate: Rescue workers search for survivors through debris in central Christchurch after the earthquake struck 5km below the surface . Smashed: A bus covered in building debris in Christchurch . Gutted: The earthquake damaged Carlton Hotel in Christchurch . Crumbling: A building's side is caved in at the side of a street in Christchurch . Search and rescue: Apocalyptic scenes in Christchurch were reminiscent of 9/11 . Rubble: The city's iconic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament lost its steeple in the quake which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale . Under the plan, the city would be bordered with green spaces and the overall design would give more emphasis to the winding Avon River. An earthquake memorial would be given prominence, as would a Maori cultural centre. The central city square would be divided into a number of smaller public gathering spots. The city would be broken into a series of hubs featuring related activities. For instance, there would be a health precinct anchored by a hospital, a justice precinct with courts and a police station, and a retail precinct with shops. The plan identifies sites for big infrastructure projects including a prominent library and a convention centre with the capacity to hold 2,000 people that would overlook the river. There would also be a covered sports stadium seating up to 35,000 people built in the city's south-east and an indoor aquatic and recreation centre built in the south-west. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who grew up in Christchurch, said it was important to identify sites for the major new projects so that private developers could begin planning hotels, restaurants and shopping areas to complement them. 'I am delighted to see this plan for new development and to know that construction will soon be underway to rebuild my old hometown,' he said.","It is nearly 18 months since a magnitude-6.1 earthquake flattened New Zealand's oldest city .

New home: Farnborough International Airshow is . home to a breeding pair of black redstarts, who have made a nest in a hospitality chalet . With the deafening sound of jet engines and the commotion caused by hundreds of thousands of visitors, it seems an unlikely place to bring up your brood. But Farnborough International Airshow is home to a breeding pair of black redstarts, who have made a nest to care for four chicks in the roof of a hospitality chalet. The birds, so rare that they are protected by law, stunned wildlife experts when they were found nesting at the festival in Farnborough, Hampshire. Organisers were due to take down the . chalet when the show finished last week, having attracted 227,000 . visitors and seen the sale of aircraft worth £46billion. But they decided to leave it up for an extra two weeks to avoid disturbing the chicks, which are only two weeks old. Experts believe there are only about 40 black redstarts in the country. Keith Betton, of Hampshire Ornithological Society, said the birds were brown with a red tail and a little bigger than a robin. 'Black redstarts are one of the ten rarest birds in Britain and a delight to watch,' he added. 'They have a tendency to nest in unusual places such as power stations and building sites but their new home is equally bizarre. 'This breeding pair have found a little hole in the side of a chalet and set up home for their chicks despite the bustling crowds and noisy aircraft. 'Once you are aware the birds are nesting it is a criminal offence to disturb them so the airshow have to leave them in peace.' Mr Betton has seen the breeding pair leaving the nest and returning every three or four minutes, collecting small insects to feed to their chicks. Airshow spokesman Philippa Ewart said the birds had nested in a chalet hired by The Blades aerobatic team. The chalet, which was put up in March, contains a kitchen, reception and lounge/dining area. Organisers were due to take down the . chalet when the show finished last week, having attracted 227,000 . visitors and seen the sale of aircraft worth £46billion. The nest location is circled . Ms Ewart said: 'We don't know . precisely when the birds occupied their chalet but we only found out . about their existence last week. 'On . average 60 people per day are hosted in a single unit. Then the flying . displays begin, which are incredibly noisy with the Vulcan aircraft and . other fast jets displaying on a daily basis. 'The birds seem totally unfazed by all the activity around them. 'They regularly pop in and out to feed the young chicks, which we believe to number four. 'I guess the parents got used to the daily activities around the show as it built up. 'Once the chicks were hatched I understand the bond is strong enough that the adult birds will not leave them.' Ms Ewart said the chicks would probably be ready to leave the chalet in about a week's time. An Aero L-39 Albatros (x7) takes off at the Farnborough Air Show - a seven-day international trade fair for the aerospace industry visited by hundreds of thousands of aviation enthusiasts . She said organisers decided not to publicise the birds' presence when they first spotted them last week. She added: 'It would have been easy for them to be disturbed by people wanting to see the nest and catch a glimpse of the redstarts. 'The show is now closed and we have a secure and private environment for the birds to nest in - or as privately and undisturbed as they can be when the world's largest temporary exhibition is being de-rigged. 'We are usually plane spotters not bird spotters but this week we have taken a keen interest in nature's great flying machines. 'We are all really excited to have the birds with us on site and are keeping them as safe as we possibly can.

Critics claim the 800ft £1.2 billion Palace of Light is too large and vulgar and will have a negative impact on Venice's historic skyline and church spires. They say that the tower, to be built in Porto Marghera, a former industrial zone a few miles from Venice, will be clearly visible and dwarf the iconic bell tower in St Mark's Square. Cardin's creation: The palace of Light skyscraper designed by the fashion magnate has divided opinions in Venice . Iconic St Mark's Square: Critics claim the Palace of Light building will impinge on Venice's historic skyline . The 60-storey building - three shard-like towers connected by six interlocking horizontal discs made of glass and steel  - will be double the height. Mr Cardin, 90, with an estimated fortune of £230 million, designed the Palais de Lumiere with his architect nephew, Rodrigo Basilicati. He has described the skyscraper as his 'last great project.' It will have a helicopter landing pad, apartments, restaurants, nearly 60 lifts and a cinema complex. Thousands of jobs will be created in an area which has seen the closure of chemical plants and oil refineries in recent times.

Mr Basilicati said: 'We chose this apparently ugly and difficult location because we hope it will convince people that Porto Marghera can enter a new chapter.' Luca Zaia, head of the Veneto region, believes the new building will be Venice's answer to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. But despite getting the go-ahead earlier this year, the tower has already hit snags with Italy's aviation authority claiming the building could pose a problem for planes flying into Marco Polo airport - the destination for millions of tourists every year. Art historian Tomaso Montanari told the Sunday Telegraph the project was something the 'emirs of the Gulf' would have dreamt up . Mr Cardin,is due to lay the first symbolic stone in September, but is so fed up with the delays he has threatened to take his project to another country.","Critics claim it will dwarf iconic St mark's Square tower .

Police have evacuated part of a Milwaukee suburb as they search for evidence in Sunday's deadly gun massacre at a Sikh temple. Officials are concentrating their search on a home in Cudahy, Wisconsin believed to be linked to the unnamed gunman who killed six and left dozens more injured before being shot dead by police. As they began the investigation, they asked residents of two blocks near the house to leave the area. The evacuation order is similar to that in Aurora, Colorado less than three weeks ago, when neighbours of shooter James Holmes were forced to leave their homes while police searched the suspect's apartment.

In Cudahy, which is just a few miles away from the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, FBI vehicles pulled up with a dozen agents around 6.30pm, eight hours after the start of the deadly rampage. Some agents were wearing protective clothing, according to Fox6. Police were seen entering the top floor of a two-storey duplex, according to locals. Precaution: Officers were heavily armed as they staked out the suburban house . Evacuation: Local residents were asked to leave the neighbourhood during the investigation . Fire truck: Other emergency vehicles were also standing by as well as workers from the local power company . Residents of the wider area, which is a . mixture of duplexes and single houses, were told to remain in their . homes during the search.

A police spokesman said the department's bomb squad was also on the scene, but had no details on why the unit was called. Representatives of the local energy company were standing by, apparently so they could cut off the neighbourhood's electricity while police investigated. Protection: Officials spent hours scouring the scene making sure the temple was safe . Desperate: Victims' relatives search for information in the wake of the massacre . The gunman who attacked a group of Sikhs as they gathered for a Sunday morning service has not yet been identified. He is said to have been a white male in his 30s.

A scientist died in a freak accident when he touched a power cable while out running. James Kew, 41, was leading members of a running club through a cornfield when he came into contact with the  end of the 11,000-volt cable, which had come loose from a telegraph pole.

A spurned husband exacted revenge on his former wife during divorce proceedings by sawing their furniture into pieces and labelling half of them as his. Kevin Fiore, 56, caused £5,184 of damage to the £130,000 house in Werrington, Staffordshire, which he shared with wife Katrina, who walked out on him in March 2011. The father-of-two, who had been married to the 39-year-old for three years after a 14 year relationship, hacked the sofa in half and wrote 'Kev's half' on the cushions. Spurned: Kevin Fiore reacted to his divorce with ex-wife Katrina Fiore, right, by ransacking their home . A wardrobe, dressing table and two sets of drawers faced the wrath of the jilted man, who also tore down the loft ladder, trashed the bathroom and scrawled offensive messages on the walls. Fiore, a bankrupt builder who now lives with his daughter from another relationship, pleaded guilty to criminal damage and walked away from Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court with a two-year supervision order as the judge called his antics 'mean and unpleasant'. Judge Mark Eades told him: 'This was a piece of revenge upon your ex-partner. 'It was mean and unpleasant but, at the end of the day, it was only property, and the value falls firmly in the magistrates’ court bracket. 'Therefore I’m going to be mindful of the magistrates’ court guidelines.' The court heard how Mrs Fiore had walked out on her husband, with whom she has a son, in March last year. A sofa written on and slashed by Kevin Fiore on to show which half belonged to him and which half belonged to his wife Katrina . The bathroom at the marital home that had also been defaced by Kevin Fiore . The bedroom in the loft at the house which Fiore damaged by breaking up the furniture and walls . Fiona Cortese, prosecuting, said: 'On . September 10 Mrs Fiore received a text message that said ""There's . nothing left, it's all trashed"". 'As a result, Mrs Fiore went to the address and found various things had been damaged.' Fiore sent an apologetic text to his wife the next day. He was arrested and told police he had 'lost it' and that everything had gone wrong. The court was told that Fiore had . tried to sell the house but an estate agent said the garage, utility . room and loft conversion would have to be demolished first because they . were built without planning permission. Colin Drew, defending, said his client was depressed and was being financially supported by his grown-up daughter. He said: 'His total bankruptcy is approximately £62,000. He was a self-employed builder. 'He is out of work at the moment. He is signed off by his doctor because he has been suffering from depression.' Mrs Fiores was not awarded compensation by the court because of her ex-husband's financial situation. Rampage: The Fiore family home in Werrington, Staffordshire, which received £5,200 worth of damage . Close: Katrina Fiore, 39, at home with her and Kevin's 11-year-old son Brandon . After the sentencing, Mrs Fiore revealed the moment she discovered her house had been ransacked. She said: ‘I told him I wanted a divorce but he refused to accept it. ‘He texted me telling me he'd trashed the house and I went round there with our son and just cried when I saw what he'd done. ‘We had a lovely expensive cream leather sofa which he'd sawn in half and scrawled 'Kev's Half' in black marker on the cushions. ‘I just cried when I walked round the house. ‘I am shocked that the judge let him walk free. ‘He deserved to be jailed for what he did to me and my family, I can't stand to look at him now. ‘I want him out of my life for good but I have to see him in court to discuss access to our son.’ She also spoke about her ‘deeply unhappy’ marriage to the builder. Mrs Fiore said: ‘We were together for 14 years but got married four years ago in July 2008. I decided to call it a day because we'd simply grown apart. ‘We had nothing in common anymore and I didn't enjoy his company. He didn't do anything wrong really but I just didn't want to be with him anymore.’","Bitter Kevin Fiore, 56, trashed home and wrote offensive messages on walls .

Busted: Federal agents have so far unearthed 4,100 images of child pornography and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from David Moe's home . A disturbing secret diary of a pre-school professor who is under arrest for possessing child pornography reveals moments of physical contact with many of his pupils. David Moe, 45, has worked as a teacher at the exclusive Paddington Station School in Denver for the past 18 years. However, he was arrested on July 24 for possessing large amounts of child pornography and has since been held in jail. During a bail hearing yesterday, Denver prosecutors read out excerpts from the secret 800-page diary of Moe, which he had kept since 1997. Of one girl, Moe wrote, 'Did hold [name withheld by prosecutors] by the waist briefly, and she didn't flinch.' Another record read: 'Had [name withheld] by the hips, and she was fine by that,' Moe wrote of another little girl entrusted to his care. 'Gave . her a kiss on the cheek, and no bad reaction. I love her so much.' In reply to one of his advances, Moe recalled a girl saying: 'I . only let my family tickle me.' To this, he said in his diary: 'She's obviously been coached.' Prosecutors revealed the journal's . existence in a Denver federal court to argue to . Magistrate Judge Michael Hegarty that Moe should not be released before his . upcoming trial. But despite all of the chilling testimony revealed by federal agents handling the case, Judge Hegarty seemed skeptical the journal was, as Denver's 9News.com put it in their account of the proceedings, a smoking gun. Innocence lost: Moe toiled at Paddington Station School, pictured, which is thought of as a haven for the privileged children of Denver's elite . Instead, Hegarty suggested the journal . may simply represent a child care worker's log of innocuous day-to-day . activities with his students, chronicled to provide a defence against . allegations of inappropriate conduct. A defence attorney, for his part, maintained the journal, and the behavior contained therein, represented, as the Denver T.V. station put it, 'only a record of benign, caring interactions between a preschool teacher and his students.' Paul McCormick did not try to gild his client's affinity for kiddie porn, but rather argued that Moe had constructed a de facto 'wall' between his sordid peccadilloes for porn, and how he interacted with the children entrusted to his care. 'When someone has 'fessed up and come clean,' McCormick told the judge. 'They're well down the road to recovery.' Despite this, prosecutors reportedly disclosed information about an alleged incident 10 years ago when a Paddington family accused Moe of improperly touching their 3-year-old daughter. A federal agent testified Tuesday that the 2001 allegation concerned a young girl adopted from a Romanian orphanage who was still learning English. Shades of Sandusky: Like the former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky, pictured, prosecutors allege Dave Moe 'groomed' potential victims, testing boundaries and limits . The agent testified, according to 9News.com, the girl's parents said their daughter kept repeating the phrase 'Dave touch' as she pointed to her genitals. The agent also swore under oath that the girls' parents believe Moe once changed their daughter's diaper in a remote, unused section of the school. However, Moe just faces charges of owning child pornography. He first reportedly told federal agents he owned about 200 images. But prosecutors revealed in court Tuesday federal agents unearthed 4,100 images of child porno and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from Moe's home. Along with that stockpiled stash of CDs, federal agents working for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confiscated six portable hard drives and two desktop computers containing as-yet undisclosed materials from Moe's abode. Tuesday's court proceedings were witnessed by many Paddington Station School parents, many of which, according to 9News.com, shielded their ears with hands and fingers so as to muffle disturbing accounts of what agents found in Moe's cache. Still, Hegarty reserved judgement, reportedly saying Tuesday, 'This is not the Roman Coliseum where it's a thumbs up, thumbs down decision by the community.' The judge later added, 'There's no evidence of grooming. There is an obsession with his interactions with small children...That is strange. It is odd. It is disconcerting. It is alarming. I don't want a horrific event occurring on my watch.' Hegarty then subsequently accorded himself 24 hours to decide whether to hold Moe without bail until his upcoming child pornography trial. Moe resigned from the school last Thursday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","David Moe meticulously recorded the limits he could go with each child, writing of one little girl, 'Gave her a kiss on the cheek, and no bad reaction.'

Shoppers were tingling with excitement when they spotted stalls handing out free vibrators yesterday.

Crowds downtown were left frustrated however, when city officials pulled the plug on the traffic-stopping event after only 40 minutes. Creating a buzz: Around 1,000 people - male and female - joined the queues across New York to get their hands on the sex toys . Just a few hundred pleasure-seekers got lucky and scored themselves a Trojan vibrator before the event was shut down. The company had announced that it had an impressive 10,000 of the toys to give away. It managed to hand out 400 at the Rockefeller Centre but only a couple of hundred downtown before the mayor made sure the event's battery life ran out. Linda Postell, who waited in line with scores of other unsatisfied passers-by, told the New York Post: 'I’m 57 years old. I should be able to get a vibrator! 'I have a problem with the smoking ban, and the soda ban — and now this!'

The giveaways were scheduled to start at 4pm in the Flatiron District and near the South Street Seaport and as carts arrived at each location, nearly 300 women queued up. But the promotion was interrupted by City Hall, which sent a suited representative to close down Trojan’s 'Pleasure Carts' because of the size of the crowd that had gathered. Park Slope bar owner Melody Henry, 42, said: 'There’s a lot more important things the city should be worried about than a free-vibrator giveaway. '[Mayor] Bloomberg doesn’t want anyone to have fun. You can’t have a giant soda. You can’t have a vibrator.' The Mayor’s Office insisted the vibrator switch-off was a permit issue, and not due to any prudishness. 'This activity promoting Trojan products, which impeded pedestrian and street traffic, did not have a permit,' City Hall said in a written statement. 'The production company affiliated with the event is currently in discussions with the Mayor’s Office to hold a promotional event with proper permits at a later date.'

A jilted British man was jailed for 19 years today for stabbing his ex girlfriend nearly 50 times after she dumped him. Judges called Alan Daulby's attack on the blonde bar worker ‘brutal and barbaric’ as they sentenced him to just one year short of the maximum jail term that prosecutors were demanding. A jury last month found the 27-year-old British expat guilty of the stabbing murder of Irish woman Avril Flanagan, 20, at his flat on Spain's Costa Blanca on May 29, 2009. Jailed for 19 years: Alan Daulby (left) was found guilty of the stabbing murder of his ex girlfriend Avril Flanagan (right) in an attack judges called 'brutal and barbaric' He was convicted of knifing her 47 times around the head, neck, chest, arms and legs before hiding her body in plastic sheeting under his sofa as part of a clinical clean-up of the murder scene and going on the run. Mr Daulby, 27, from Liverpool, Merseyside confessed to killing Miss Flanagan at the end of his trial but claimed he had confused her with an intruder after bingeing on drink and drugs and panicked when he woke up to find her dead. Police told the court in Elche near Alicante they had found 53 stab wounds on her body. Forensic experts said Miss Flanagan, from Swords, Dublin, died only after she had been stabbed 47 times. Mr Daulby had subjected his former partner to seven minutes of agony. Speaking for the first time after Mr . Daulby was found guilty of her daughter's murder, Barbara Flanagan said: . ‘He destroyed my life that day. ‘He took my only daughter, my baby. ‘I . have an image stuck in my mind of Avril lying there dead and him . showering and tidying up the apartment to try to cover up his awful . crime.’ Caught on the run: Mr Daubly was arrested hours after he killed Miss Flanagan, hiding her in plastic sheeting under his sofa, cleaning up her blood and going on the run . Mr Daulby, a former car valeter, used a mop and bleach to wipe up Miss Flanagan’s blood after killing her with a kitchen knife, showered and changed clothes and tried to stuff her mutilated body into a suitcase before wrapping her in blankets and plastic sheeting. Judge Gracia Serrano, one of the three judges sentencing after the jury verdict, said in an 18 page ruling released today: ‘The number of stab wounds Avril received was very high. ‘The majority of them weren't either fatal or necessary for Alan Daulby to fulfill his intention of killing Avril. ‘He did not therefore just commit an evil crime. ‘He also committed other equally intentioned wrongdoing by taking pleasure in causing Avril additional suffering. ‘We have no doubt that Daulby acted with the intention of killing a woman who up until a week earlier had been his girlfriend. ‘It's . clear to us from the way in which he murdered Avril that his attack was . premeditated and deliberately designed to end her life.’ Family torn apart: Avril Flanagan, centre, pictured with her brother Ger and his fiancee Emeline. Her mother Barbara said outside court today that Mr Daulby had 'destroyed my life that day (he murdered her)' He is expected to be moved from maximum security Foncalent Prison in Alicante in the next few weeks. Miss Flanagan’s father Gerry Flanagan, a former bus engineer said: ‘Nothing will bring Avril back so this sentence doesn't actually mean much to our daily lives. ‘But it is a relief to know my daughter's killer will be punished for his horrendous crime and it enables us to get some closure on a chapter of our lives we wish we had never had to deal with in the first place.’ Her seven minutes of agony only ended when Mr Daulby stabbed her for the 47th time about the head, neck, chest, arms and legs with a kitchen knife. Her family found her body hidden in plastic under a sofa after he spent more than three hours cleaning up the murder scene before going on the run. He was arrested hours later 124 miles away after a police chase. He had been dating Miss Flanagan, who worked at her family's pub Smiling Jacks in the Costa Roig resort for about 18 months before she ended their relationship. Her mother told Mr Daulby's three day trial how he stalked her after she broke up with him and she broke her phone SIM card to stop talking calls from him. The jury of eight women and one man convicted him of her murder in a unanimous verdict reached in just under two hours. They ruled by a majority verdict of seven to two he was conscious of what he was doing, rejecting his claims his mind was not befuddled by drink or drugs. Miss Flanagan, who moved to Spain in 2006, was due to fly back to Ireland the day of her death with her mother Barbara Flanagan to celebrate a relative's 21st birthday. Judges also ordered Mr Daulby, who . turned 27 last month in jail following his murder conviction, to pay Miss . Flanagan’s parents €40,000 each for the loss of their . daughter. The three years Mr Daulby spent in jail on remand before his trial will be taken off the time he will serve behind bars. Jose Carlos Munoz, a private prosecutor who represented her family at the trial, said: ‘Daulby wanted to do a deal before his trial and confess to killing Avril in exchange for a 17 and a half year sentence. ‘Her family rejected it. We feel it's positive that he's ended up getting 18 months more by taking it to trial. ‘The sentence he's received is just short of the 20 years we and the state prosecutor were seeking.’","Alan Daulby was jailed today for 19 years for killing Avril Flanagan in 2009 .

But when members of Team USA return home from their triumphs in London, they could face an unwelcome surprise - a large tax bill on the value of their winnings. Now members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have launched a bid to exempt the nation's medallists from having to hand over some of the spoils of their success to the government. Champion: But Michael Phelps could have to pay $9,000 for each gold medal . As well as the precious metals which Olympic medals are composed with, each victor receives a cash prize for his or her performance. Gold medallists are awarded $25,000 by the U.S. Olympic Committee, while silver winners receive $15,000 and bronze $10,000. This means that athletes could be liable for up to $9,000 in income tax for each gold medal they win. They could also theoretically pay $200 for the value of the metal in the medal itself - though it is unlikely that the IRS would make that demand. Liable: 16-year-old gymnastics prodigy Gabby Douglas could also face taxes . Several congressmen have now launched attempts to prevent Olympic athletes paying any tax at all on their Games-related earnings. One of the first proposed bills came from Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican rising star, who argued: 'Our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success, and the tax imposed on Olympic medal winners is a classic example of this madness. 'Athletes representing our nation overseas in the Olympics shouldn't have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home.' Mr Rubio's measure would exempt 'the value of any prize or award won by the taxpayer in athletic competition in the Olympic Games' from income tax calculations. Law change: Republican congressmen Marco Rubio, left, and David Camp, right, are among the legislators seeking to exempt Olympians from income tax . On Friday Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced that he too would back efforts to allow the athletes to keep their earnings. 'These athletes deserve every bit of our support and appreciation for representing the United States on the world stage,' the Michigan congressman said. 'Allowing our Olympians to receive and enjoy their medals and awards without having to worry about whether they can pay the taxes on their accomplishment is just one small way we can show that support.' Other members of the House seeking to eliminate tax on Olympic earnings include Republicans Aaron Schock and Mary Bono Mack, and Democrat G.K. Butterfield. No thanks: Beach volleyball star Todd Rogers says the gesture is unnecessary . Many Team USA champions will doubtless be grateful for Congress' attempts to give them a financial helping hand. But one athlete, beach volleyball star Todd Rogers, has rejected the offer, saying he thinks well-off sportsmen should have to pay their fare share. 'For me, I make enough that I would say I should get taxed,' said Mr Rogers, a gold medallist in 2008. 'I'm not going to say I wouldn't take it, but I'm just looking at it from a realistic perspective.'","Gold medal winners could have to pay $9,000 tax .

BBC chiefs faced a barrage of criticism last night over a report attacking the work of military charity Help for Heroes. Former Army chief Richard Dannatt accused the broadcaster of an ‘abuse of the truth’ over claims the charity was subsidising government rehabilitation buildings rather  than spending on everyday care for veterans. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Dannatt says the report took television journalism to a ‘depressingly low point’. 'Abuse of the truth': Writing in the Mail on Sunday, former Army chief Lord Dannatt has criticised a BBC report that quoted servicemen complaining over the way Help for Heroes spends funds . His . attack was echoed across the political divide, with Defence Secretary . Philip Hammond saying the charity did not deserve the criticism and . Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy adding that the BBC ‘got it totally . wrong’. Last night the BBC was standing by its report, broadcast on BBC2’s Newsnight on Thursday. Help . for Heroes was set up five years ago by ex-serviceman Bryn Parry and . his wife Emma to raise money for the care of wounded veterans. It has so . far raised £141 million, with much of that being spent on a series of . world-beating ‘personnel recovery centres’ run on Ministry of Defence . land. But the BBC report quoted some veterans . complaining that the  charity was spending money on MoD buildings rather . than on practical help. Investigators said they had uncovered examples . of injured soldiers having to pay for physiotherapy and prosthetic . limbs. Former Royal Marine Ben McBean, a double amputee and one of the charity’s patrons, said it should work more closely with veterans.But ex-Chief of the General Staff Lord Dannatt – who helped set up the charity – mocked the idea that Help for Heroes had been ‘duped by the Ministry of Defence’. And he said of the use of the servicemen quoted in the report: ‘It was a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of the truth.’ He also raised fears that Newsnight may have ‘seriously prejudiced’ the charity’s bid to raise another £63 million for the centres. Rehabilitation: Private Stephen Bainbridge, who lost both of his legs in a blast in Afghanistan, is pictured with a physiotherapist at Headley Court . Last night, Mr Parry said the report was ‘completely misinformed’. And Mr Hammond joined in the row, saying: ‘We shouldn’t be criticising the important work they do; we should be backing them and encouraging members of the public to continue showing their appreciation of the Armed Forces by donating to such worthy causes.’ Labour’s Mr Murphy said: ‘Help  for Heroes should be supported not slurred. Army Recovery Centres  are a major success and to suggest otherwise is misguided.’ Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell, a member of the Commons Defence Committee, said the ‘tenor of the criticisms was bang out of order’. But the BBC said: ‘We stand by the programme and the high quality of our journalism. ‘We accurately and impartially reported our findings and strongly believe it was in the public interest to do so. Lord Dannatt was given an opportunity to state his view in both the filmed report and the subsequent studio discussion, and he acknowledged that there are indeed problems with the way veterans are cared for.’ By Lord Dannatt . 'Disastrously wrong': Lord Dannatt claims the Newsnight report has 'backfired' on programme makers . Truth is the first casualty of war, it is often said, but where should truth lie in the treatment of the casualties themselves? Not with the BBC, it seems. Thursday’s Newsnight report on the support for our wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan took TV journalism to a depressingly low point. The central proposition was that the service charity Help for Heroes (H4H) had been duped by the MoD and was spending its millions, donated by a generous public, on ‘opulent’ buildings rather than  giving money directly to alleviate the needs of our wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women. Three of the many hundreds of young people who have been helped by H4H were persuaded to take a sort of whistleblowing role. It was a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of the truth. Mercifully, it now seems to be an ambush that has backfired on the programme-makers to an embarrassing degree. A glance at the H4H website puts forward its defence and tells an interesting story. Help for Heroes was created in October 2007 by a small group of people led by Bryn Parry, an ex-soldier turned cartoonist. He and his wife were so appalled at what our wounded returning from Iraq and Afghanistan received by way of medical and welfare support that they felt compelled to act. I have seen blood flowing in the streets of Belfast after two soldiers on either side of me had been shot, and carried the remains of four comrades in plastic bags to a waiting helicopter. Bryn’s son and my son were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. We knew we had to act, whether others liked it or not. Our first aim was to raise the cash to build a swimming pool for those recovering at the Defence Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, Surrey. Incredibly, this key establishment on the path to recovery had no proper pool. It does now, thanks to the public’s generosity. The dilemma for Help for Heroes was where to go from there. It could have chosen to fold, but it had caught the public imagination and people up and down the country wanted to make a difference for our wounded via H4H. Recovery: Help for Heroes opened its rehabilitation complex at Headley Court, Surrey, in 2010 . It could have chosen to become just an appeal and channel money to other charities. Indeed, it has done that in part, giving large grants to Blind Veterans UK, Combat Stress and SSAFA Forces Help, among others. But H4H chose a twin track for the future. First, to set up a Quick Reaction Fund to pay rapidly for individual needs, principally through other charities that were expert in their fields. More than 2,000 service people have been helped in this way so far. But more importantly, Help for Heroes saw the strategic need to provide a third stage on the road  to recovery – the first stages being clinical care at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and then rehabilitation at Headley Court. The third stage would be a network of Personnel Recovery Centres  in major garrisons to help our wounded return to duty or prepare for a new career on civvy street. Bryn and I discussed this in 2008, but the MoD wasn’t keen: there was a strong element of ‘not invented here’ to the whole discussion. And then the economy collapsed and there was no money anyway. So after several years of tortuous debate with the MoD it was eventually decided to go ahead with  the Personnel Recovery Centres, funded largely by the charitable sector, underpinned by a tripartite deal between the MoD, the Royal British Legion and H4H. That has been the focus of H4H for the past three years. Four centres are open, with a fifth soon to follow, but the charity sector has had to put up most of the funding, because the MoD chose other priorities for its money – our money. Is that right? Does the Government not have an absolute responsibility to provide fully for those wounded answering the nation’s call? Many would argue they do. Morally that must be correct, but what if there is neither the money nor the will? But little is new. We have been here before, with the private, public and charity sectors coming together to deliver our obligation to our wounded. That was how the Chelsea Pensioners at the Royal Hospital came about, and the Erskine Hospitals in Scotland.  Now we have Tedworth House on Salisbury Plain. Left derelict by the MoD but rented to H4H for £1 a year, it was transformed by H4H and the British Legion into a Personnel Recovery Centre to take your breath away in terms of what it offers those on the path to recovery. '(The report) on the support for our wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan took TV journalism to a depressingly low point.' Former head of the Army Lord Dannatt . In its determination to attack what is honourable and good, the BBC chose to focus on the statues, stained glass and chandeliers: but they were already there and merely dusted or painted recently. They chose not to focus on fantastic accommodation and a state-of-the-art gym and learning centre. This is where those who have  survived the trauma of war – the blood, confusion, deafening noise and sickly stench – can prepare for the rest of their lives.Having given the best of themselves in the line of duty on behalf of the nation, they deserve the best. Tedworth provides that for today’s recovering wounded and must be there for tomorrow’s veterans too.  This is why, of the £141 million raised by H4H, £125 million has been committed, principally to the Personnel Recovery Centre programme. Of this, £70 million will go on capital projects, mostly for the centres but some to other charities’ projects. £50 million is allocated to the centres’ running costs and direct support of the wounded. To secure these centres for the future and make them fully accessible to veterans, too, H4H needs another £63 million – but last week, Newsnight seriously prejudiced that aim. You have to wonder what the BBC’s agenda is sometimes. The Armed Forces Covenant, which outlines the Government’s moral obligation to veterans, is now part of the law. H4H may have been seen as an irritant to those comfortable in their traditional approaches to military welfare, but it has been a wake-up call to which many have responded. It was Britain’s most admired charity in 2011, but that made it  a target for the BBC to bash. The Beeb should adjust its sights to  the side, put the MoD between the crosshairs and squeeze the trigger usefully. How about running a campaign for the Government to repay H4H the money it has had  to spend to do the Government’s work? That would help to restore the moral balance that Newsnight got so disastrously wrong.","Former Army chief has attacked BBC report criticising military charity .

One open-top vehicle fitted with an SS  registration plate was driven by a grinning man wearing a senior SS uniform flanked by a woman with a machine gun. 'Offensive': A row has erupted after war enthusiasts took to the streets in Nazi uniforms and flying swastikas from their cars, pictured . Jewish leaders and anti-fascism campaigners yesterday attacked the ‘disturbing’ event. The ‘Yanks’ festival, which attracts . up to 5,000 visitors each year, sees hundreds of  volunteers dress up in . traditional military  uniforms to re-enact life in Uppermill, . Saddleworth, near Oldham, during the 1940s. The weekend, which also included swing . dance lessons and a vintage fun fair, was inspired by the Richard Gere . movie Yanks, which was filmed in the town in the late 1970s. Mark Gardner, from the Community . Security Trust, which campaigns against anti-Semitic attacks, said: . ‘Most decent people - not only Jews – will be disturbed by the sight of . people walking the streets in Nazi uniform and displaying swastikas. It’s sick.’ Angry: Protesters compared it to a Nazi rally, shown here as German soldiers occupied the Sudetenland in October 1938 . John Brooks, who lives in the mill . town, added: ‘The film Yanks was about the relationship between the . local community and the US forces stationed here. ‘As such you might expect to see . festival goers dressed as US soldiers, locals in 1940s civvies and a few . British service personnel on leave. ‘There is no place for German . uniforms. I cannot understand why  anyone would want to wear a German . uniform. I do not want to see it in my town. The organisers must try . harder to stop this affront to the millions who died at the hands of the . Nazis.’ Mike Killian, from campaign group .

A sports student who took her final physical exam while in the early stages of labour has been awarded a first class degree. Despite experiencing contractions, Samantha Locke performed a series of six physical exercises before going on to complete a written test. The 23-year-old had been due to be induced the day after her last exam, a test made up of six gruelling practical exercises at Bournemouth University in Dorset. First class delivery: Not only did Samantha Locke manage to get through her final exam while in labour, but she was awarded a first . Long day: Samantha with newborn Poppy who she gave birth to 13-hours after going into labour . The exercise science graduate had begun suffering from pains in her stomach from about 8am on the morning of her exam but initially put it down to nerves and arrived for the final later that day at 2.30pm. It was not until the end of the physical test that Samantha realised she was in labour. However, she then went on to complete the theoretical section - with excruciating stomach cramps - before finally going to hospital. Daughter Poppy was born the next day weighing 8lb 8oz following a 13-hour labour. Graduate Samantha, who lives with partner Chris Ellis, a 28-year-old accountant, said she was delighted with both baby Poppy and her first class degree. She said: 'I was absolutely determined to finish the exam after all of those three years of hard work. 'On the morning of the exam I did have some twinges but I just put them down to nerves. I did think it might be something to do with the baby but ignored it. On hand: Samantha with her mother Angela, who was by her side as she went into labour with baby Poppy . Just born: A one-day-old Poppy at Bournemouth Hospital, left. Samantha plants a kiss on baby Poppy, right . 'The final exam was a practical and written exam, so I had to demonstrate how to perform six exercises for people with medical problems. 'It was funny because the problems were high blood pressure and a bad back, which I had because I was in labour. I just tried to do them slowly with no sudden movements. 'When I reached the last station I felt a definite twinge and realised what it was. Then I started to get more regular contractions. 'I just wanted to keep going because otherwise I would have had to have done it in the re-sit period in August, which would have been a nightmare with Poppy.' The exam was the final part of her three-year course at Bournemouth University on June 7. Proud: Samantha with Poppy and her partner Chris Ellis. The graduate is planning on embarking on another higher education course . When Samantha's mother Angela Locke, a 51-year-old cleaner from Somerton in Somerset, realised her daughter was in labour she rushed to her side once the exam had finished. Together, the pair waited until the contractions became more regular and drove to hospital at 11pm, once they were happening every four minutes. Samantha finally gave birth to baby Poppy by natural delivery at 12.44pm on June 8. She added: 'It was so surreal because I knew all my course mates had been out that night celebrating and they would all be in bed hung-over and I had just had a baby. 'I normally think about exams straight after them and worry about what I could have done better but I just forgot about it.' Samantha and Poppy were allowed home on June 10 at 5pm and returned back to the university a month later to pick up her results. She said: 'I was really hoping for a first but wasn’t sure what I was going to get because some parts like the dissertation and final exam were quite heavily weighted. 'It was amazing when I got my results, I was so proud. I brought Poppy with me when I collected them and she slept through the whole thing, completely oblivious.' Samantha is currently a full-time mum to Poppy but is study occupational therapy at Southampton next year. She added: 'Hopefully my exams will be a lot less eventful this time round.' Her mother Angela added: 'I am very proud of her university success but on top of this she has given birth to her beautiful baby girl Poppy.'","Samantha Locke woke up with stomach pains on the day of her exam .

A pub DJ and father-of-two was left scarred for life by a heckler who glassed him after he changed the words to an Elvis Presley song during a karaoke night. Richard Sykes, 36, was singing a comedy version of 'I Just Can't Help Believing' at a pub when customer David Watson took offence. Watson, 43, started heckling Mr Sykes and his singing partner before trying to pull the wires out of the karaoke machine at the Jug and Barrel Pub in Stanningley, Leeds, West Yorks. Scene: Father-of-two Richard Sykes, 36, was singing at the Jug and Barrel pub in Leeds when he was attacked . But when Mr Sykes tried to stop him, Watson, of Leeds, West Yorks., smashed the pint glass into his face. Mr Sykes, also of Leeds, spent three days in Leeds General Infirmary and has 42 stitches in four wounds. Watson was handed an 11-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months plus 180 hours of unpaid work by a judge at Leeds Crown Court last week. The court heard Watson was angry after claiming Mr Sykes' singing partner had changed the words of the song to reveal information about Watson, which he believed only a handful of people knew. But Mr Sykes said: 'I had never met him before in my life, neither had the friend I was singing with. He said the reason it happened is because we released sensitive information about him but we didn't know the guy. 'I do a comedy Elvis show and it was just a song I sing from time to time on my karaoke.' Mr Sykes said he is struggling to complete his mobile DJ gigs since the attack last May, adding: 'I just can't face standing up there alone in front of strange crowds. I feel scared and I just can't be my normal self. 'I have spent 18 months trying to work out why it happened.' Watson's lawyer Sean Smith told the court last week that the singer was 'making up his own words in a derogatory nature against the defendant'. Mr Smith said: 'He was surprised to know how the individual with the microphone got hold of that information.' Prosecuting, Stephanie Hancock said the incident had a devastating impact on Mr Sykes' life, adding: 'He feels what happens on that evening has made him a different person entirely. 'He has lost motivation for doing day to day things and has suffered with bouts of depression.' Miss Hancock said Mr Sykes used to work regularly as a DJ, but since the attack has only done so on a handful of occasions. She added: 'He just didn't have the nerve to stand up there alone.'

Podiatrist Steve Bloorwas told to leave his local Tesco store after a security guard stopped him entering . A podiatrist who walks everywhere in his bare feet was banned from his local branch of Tesco for refusing to wear shoes. Steve Bloor, 48, believes walking without footwear is good for posture and general health and says shoes are unnecessary. He has been walking everywhere barefoot for the last two years but was stunned when a security guard stopped him entering his local Tesco in Helston, Cornwall. The manager intervened and explained the policy was in place in case anyone injured themselves walking around the shop. But . father-of-four Mr Bloor criticised the rule: 'I should be able to be . responsible enough to look after my bare feet as well as a guide dog . does. 'It’s the healthiest way to walk and it strengthens your feet and connects you to the environment. 'I would like to see that there’s no discrimination and people are given the option of going barefoot.' Mr Bloor is a qualified podiatrist of 27 years experience and runs the Run Right Step Free clinic in Helston. He believes feet are much healthier without shoes and by going barefoot people can improve general health. Mr . Bloor claims his foot hygiene is better than those who wear shoes and . that people wearing flip-flops or high heels are more likely to have an . accident. He said his two boys, Elliot, 12 and Chris, 19, do not have a problem with going barefoot and often do it themselves, with Chris even going barefoot at University. Mr Bloor said: 'When I first started . going barefoot everyone thought I was mad, but now they have accepted it . and see it as acceptable as bare hands. 'People do not have to go around wearing gloves to cover up their hands so I don’t see why people should cover their feet. Let him back in! Tesco Personnel manager Claire Parrott with podiatrist Stephen Bloor who was banned from walking barefoot in the Tesco store in Helston, Cornwall . 'People are not offended if they see others wearing flip flops and that is just a piece of cord on their feet, but as soon as the feet are bare people generally do not like it. 'I have always thought that people needed to wear shoes as they can support your feet up to 80 per cent. 'However, then I read a book named Born To Run and it was about a barefoot runner. After reading it I did a bit of research about barefoot walking and running and liked what I read.' Amazingly, Mr Bloor said he has never had any injuries from going barefoot, and has only encountered a few splinters. He has been shopping barefoot at the Tesco branch for years without incident but was suddenly blocked by a security guard on August 5. Mr Bloor explained: 'When I got banned from Tesco I was pretty shocked, I had been going there for two years and spent hundreds of pounds. 'The security officer basically said there was glass everywhere and didn’t want me to end up suing Tesco. 'He went and got the manager - they . were both very pleasant and agreed with me that it should not be an . issue but they have a regional policy in case somebody claims against . them for accidental damage. 'But . if you’re barefoot you’re more aware of your surroundings. I asked if . they had a similar policy to ban guide dogs and they don’t ban toddlers . from walking around with their hands on the floor. 'I think quite a lot of people in this part of the world go barefoot as there is a very outside way of life here.' The father claims that people wearing flip-flops or high heels were more likely to have an accident, whereas he is more aware of his surroundings . However Mr Bloor, who also has two daughters Bethany, 15 and Lucy, 18, launched an appeal against the decision by Tesco. After a ten-day period bosses agreed to make an exception to their barefoot policy and allow him back into the store. A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We do tend to ask customers to put footwear on during the summer months, as a lot of them come straight from the beach and we want to stop sand spreading through the store. 'But we try to take a common sense approach and are happy to make an exception in Mr Bloor’s case.' Mr Bloor said he would continue to campaign for anybody to be able to enter the store without shoes.","Security guard stopped him entering his local Tesco in Helston, Cornwall .

La Tomatina traditionally takes place on the last Wednesday in August in Bunol, which is around 25 miles north of the coastal city of Valencia - Spain's third largest city. Though the origins of La Tomatina are unclear, it is thought to have its roots in a food fight between childhood friends in the mid 1940s, an AFP report said. After the annual food fight in Bunol, many of the tomato-soaked festival-goers head to the river in the town to wash off the pulp. Six special trains were laid on for this year's Tomatina, providing an extra 29,000 seats for people heading to the festival, and camping grounds were also set up to cater for the influx of tourists.

Four members of Congo’s Olympic team were said to have gone missing in London yesterday as thousands of their fellow London 2012 athletes and officials flew home. Their disappearance took the number of African athletes and delegates attending London 2012 who have vanished from their camps or sought political asylum in Britain to 15. Immigration officials expect that number to increase sharply when athletes’ special London 2012 visas expire in November. Not going home: Cameroon's Blaise Mendouo, left,  Christin Adjoufack, centre, and Paul Edingue, right . Still in Britain: Cameroon's Serge Ambomo, left, Drusille Ngako, centre and Abdon Mewoll, right . Details of the apparent Congo defections came as it emerged that at least five members of the Cameroon team have pleaded to be allowed to stay in Britain rather than returning with teammates yesterday. The Home Office refused to say whether the five, all boxers, were seeking asylum. Two members of the Sudanese team and one Ethiopian are reported to have sought asylum in the UK, one Sudanese is missing, and two other members of the Cameroon team – a swimmer and a female footballer – have also disappeared after suddenly vanishing from the Olympic Village. A UN-run radio station in Congo said Cedric Mandembo, who competed for the central African country in judo, disappeared after the closing ceremony and has not been reachable on his mobile phone. He lost his match after 49 seconds and is said to have left the Olympic Village without saying where he was going. He had been due to fly home last night. Plea to stay: Flyweight boxer Thomas Essomba, who was beaten by Ireland's Paddy Barnes, is one of the absconded boxers . Congo judo coach Ibula Masengo, boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa, and national technical director of athletics Guy Nkita had also gone missing, it was claimed. They too were said to have left the Olympic Village with their luggage. The Home Office declined to comment on the individual cases. Congo team officials were ‘out of contact’ returning home while no one was available for comment at the country’s London embassy. The disappearances come at a hugely sensitive time for the Government after the success of the Olympics and with the Paralympics due to begin in two weeks. It follows fears from immigration staff that up to 2 per cent of Olympic visitors from some continents may claim refuge in the UK in the months after the Games. Authorities in Cameroon, which is regarded as one of the more stable countries in Africa, have accused the boxers of wanting to be economic migrants and say they should have returned home with other athletes. But the Olympians, who absconded from their Stratford, East London, village last week, told the BBC they had been threatened and wanted a sponsor to help them stay in Britain. Boxer Thomas Essomba said that there was no support for athletes in Cameroon, adding: ‘We are not staying here because we don’t like our country, but [because we] want to practise the sports we love. We want to become professional. We cannot return to Cameroon... if we return, we will not practise any more.’ As well as claiming they were threatened, the boxers said promised bonuses had been halved. However, David Ojong, the head of the Cameroon delegation to the Olympics, accused the boxers of lying and said they were making up the allegation to justify desertion. The seven - who are members of Cameroon's Olympic team pictured during the opening ceremony - claim they want to stay in Britain to practise the sport that they love and not for economic reasons . Investigators have identified several countries where they ‘expect’ asylum claims from athletes and supporters given visas specifically to attend London 2012. Several are African and Middle Eastern. Asylum claims are not unusual at sporting events. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games more than 20 members of one West African country sought to stay on in Britain. Before the 2008 Olympics seven members of the Cuban soccer team sought asylum after a qualifying game in the US, and the entire Eritrean national soccer team fled during a 2009 competition in Kenya.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:20 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 22 August 2012 . A British man who has lived as an Apache Indian for the past 20 years will be allowed to keep badger paws and eagle wings in his home after charges against him were dropped. Father-of-six Mangas Colaradas, 60, was due to stand trial tomorrow for keeping protected wild animal parts in his semi-detached home filled with the trappings of his Native American lifestyle. But brave Mangas vowed to fight the court case on the grounds that it is part of his Apache lifestyle - even though he lives in a three-bed semi in Swansea, South Wales. Charges dropped: Apache Indian Mangus Colardas from Swansea, South Wales, will not face charges over the animal parts police found in his home. But today a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed the proceedings had been discontinued before he gave his evidence. Mr Colaradas - born in Wales more than 6,000 miles from the plains of the Apache tribe - said: 'I’m pleased they dropped it, it shouldn’t have come to anything in the first place. 'Common sense should have come into it far sooner but they just don’t understand my native way of life. 'It’s been a big waste of money and a dreadful thing to have hanging over me. But I was always confident I would clear my name.' He refuses to reveal his original name - he only answers only to his adopted name in honour of a famous Apache chief. Mr Colaradas was charged under the Protection of Badgers Act and the Wildlife and Countryside Act over the badger and eagle relics. He had previously appeared in court wearing a ceremonial head dress, tassled jacket, suede moccasins and a snake’s head necklace to deny the charge at Swansea magistrates court. At the time Anne Griffiths, defending, said: 'My client Mangas is part of a native American Apache tribe. 'He has spent time living in these Apache communities and this is his belief.” The Apache people, split over around 13 tribes, are  usually found in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Apache was originally a word given to the natives' enemies, known as the Zuni. But over time the word became adopted worldwide and is even used by the Apaches themselves. There are thought to be about 30,000 Apaches left in America. The Apache tribes were nearly wiped out by Europeans. They now have their own areas, or 'reservations', to live on, where they can live by their own customs and rules, but they must still obey the U.S. law. A stereotypical Apache image might be an Indian with his horse. However horses did not exist in North American until colonists arrived - but the Apaches quickly adopted them and used them for transport. The case was thrown out after his defence team provided expert evidence from an animal specialist. Mangas said: 'Animals come first to me, there was nothing cruel about it, I would never hurt or kill an animal. 'But as a native, when I find a dead animal I will eat it or I will use its body parts.' The father-of-six began living a Native American lifestyle after he divorced from his wife in the early 1990s. In 1997 he travelled to United States to try and live on a Red Indian reservation but the American government would not let him. He then moved to Spain in 2000 where he lived in a tepee in the mountains and the forest around Torremolinos. He brought the badger paws and eagle wings back with him from Spain planning to turn them into a headdress. But he was arrested before he was able to do this when police found his collection at his three-bedroom detached house in the Townhill suburb of Swansea. Now the case is over they will return the items to him but have told him he will have to apply for a licence if he wants to turn them into clothing. He added: 'I don’t mind I’ve got plenty of other things I can use to make my jewellery. 'I dress like this all the time I’m not just some weekend Indian. I don’t put it on to show off, I put it on because I want to wear it. 'I’m against modern life, nobody cares about anybody else, nobody cares about mother earth. 'The whole point of the Native American lifestyle is that everyone believes in mother earth and treats others who you want to be treated.' Mangas is currently working in Portsmouth where he is doing snake shows on the seafront for the summer season. The animal lover said: 'I’ve cured thousands of people of their fear of snakes, I don’t believe in money, I just do it to educate people. 'I get on with animals better than most people, I’ve got an affinity with them. There are no bad animals just bad keepers. 'I’ve owned hundreds of snakes in my time, I eat them when they die, we Natives don’t believe in letting anything go to waste.' Jackie Lis, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, confirmed charges were dropped against Mr Colaradas after reservations about conflicting evidence from animal experts. She said: 'Having considered expert evidence from a number of sources, we concluded in that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to the charges against Mr Colaradas.'","Swansea man has lived as Native American for two decades .

It should be a time when you cast aside your predictable workday attire and revel in the freedom to dress down. But for David Cameron, going on holiday seems to bring out a determined desire to stay within his sartorial comfort zone. At the beginning of his summer break yesterday, the Prime Minister clung resolutely to the identikit crumpled blue shirt, dark cotton trousers and smart black shoes that have accompanied him on family trips to Cornwall, Ibiza, Siena and now Majorca. Family outing: Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha enjoy a coffee together today in Majorca, left, but Mr Cameron clearly needs more imagination with his wardrobe as he wore a very similar shirt just a year ago, top right, while having coffee in Tuscany . Meanwhile the Deputy Prime Minister ventured out in sandals that looked more suited to heavy-duty hiking . than a relaxed stroll in Spain – though at least he remembered to take . his socks off. David Cameron and his wife Samantha are in Majorca with their children and looked thrilled to have . swapped Downing Street for a pretty pavement cafe in a quaint cobbled . street area. Perhaps heading . for a coffee at the beginning of their hols is a Cameron tradition, as . last year in Tuscany they were spotted doing the same thing with the . Prime Minister wearing almost exactly the same outfit. Nick Clegg, with his wife Miriam, put on some rather heavy duty sandals for a gentle stroll in Spain . But hopefully this time the Prime . Minister left a tip after last year in Italy he managed to fall out . with a waitress after stopping for a drink with his wife. Mr Cameron made headlines across . the world when it emerged he had paid for a 3.10 Euro bill with a 50 . Euro banknote and failed to leave any small change, as is customary in . Italian bars. Waitress Francesca Ariani, 27, failed to recognise the Number 10 . resident when he walked in with his wife Samantha, 40, and ordered two . cappuccinos asking for them to be brought to an outside table. The next day he returned to the bar and made amends with the waitress, by leaving a tip on that occasion. Mr Cameron left Britain with his family yesterday, after the London Olympics came to a close on Sunday evening. Their exact location on Majorca is currently being kept secret. He is expected to return to the UK next week and spend a few days in the office before taking a further short holiday in the UK. Questions were raised yesterday over . Nick Clegg’s role in the Government after he flew away on holiday on the . same day as the Prime Minister, rather than taking charge of the . country in his absence. As . both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister began summer breaks in . Spain, William Hague was instead left to take the reins. The holiday arrangements led MPs to . question why the Lib Dem leader would jet off at the same time as Mr . Cameron, with one Tory saying it was proof he was not really his deputy. Foreign Secretary Mr Hague – whose . full title is First Secretary of State – will  take charge of the . day-to-day business of government in their absence until he goes away . on his own foreign holiday next week. Happy holidays: David Cameron and his wife Samantha stop for a quick coffee as they start their summer break in Majorca . Refreshment: Samantha tells her husband a story while his sips on his coffee . Don't forget to leave a tip!

His wife might be an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, but even Samantha Cameron’s designer contact book can’t save husband David’s holiday wardrobe. When you spend most of your time power dressing in a suit and tie dressing down in style can be tricky. Yes, he IS a dad on holiday but that doesn’t mean he has to dress like man from M&S circa 1992. Holiday dressing is a skill, and unfortunately for David taking off your tie and swapping a smart shirt for a ‘relaxed’ chambray style is not enough when vacationing in one of the world’s most stylish countries. While Samantha channels her typical chic holiday vibe in a simple denim tunic dress and box fresh Birkenstocks,  David looks less than comfortable in the Spanish heat wave in freshly pressed jeans, slip-on shoes and navy denim-look shirt. Next time he’s away from Downing Street Femail would recommend some tailored city shorts, a crisp white shirt and an espadrille for summer style points. (Toni Jones, Deputy Femail Editor) Home Secretary Theresa May, who flew . back early from holiday last summer when the riots began, will then take . the helm for a few days before Mr Cameron returns. Controversially, it emerged yesterday that this two-week break is not Mr Clegg’s first summer holiday this year. The Deputy Prime Minister quietly slipped away during the Olympics to spend one week at the villa his family owns in France. He has now flown to the small town of Olmedo in Spain. He is due to spend two weeks in the . area where his wife Miriam González Durantez grew up and her family . still live. They will be accompanied by their three children Antonio, . Alberto and Miguel. Tory MP Peter Bone has repeatedly . asked both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg in Parliament who would take over if . the Prime Minister were to be unable to lead, but has never received a . definitive answer. Last night he told the Mail the holiday plans were proof that Mr Hague, not Mr Clegg, would actually take charge. Speaking shortly before himself flying . to the US for a holiday, Mr Bone said: ‘What it clearly shows is that . the real Deputy Prime Minister is William Hague and the Prime Minister . has no intention of leaving Nick Clegg in charge, which is exceptionally . good news for the British people. ‘We can sleep safely in our beds and hope that he enjoys himself. Flashback: David Cameron with Tuscan waitress Francesca Ariani, who he went back to see the next day after paying with a 50 euro note but left no tip . All in this together, almost: Both David Cameron and Nick Clegg depart from the UK for their annual holidays in Spain today, but the pair are off to different destinations . Taking it easy: Nick Clegg on holiday in Norfolk last year . Left in charge: The departure of David Cameron and Nick Clegg means the most senior minister remaining in the UK will be Foreign Secretary William Hague . ‘I have never got a straight answer . about the true pecking order but if Nick Clegg was a real Deputy Prime . Minister there is no way he would  go on holiday at the same time as Mr . Cameron. ‘The only reason they don’t say that Hague is number two is because it would offend Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems. ‘There is a serious point here. The . country needs to know who is going to be in charge if the Prime Minister . is unable to lead.’ An irritated Mr Cameron defended his right to a break on Sunday. ‘I am a great believer that politicians are human beings and they need to have holidays,’ he said. ‘I don’t call it annual leave, I call it a holiday and I  am looking forward to having a holiday.’ No 10 officials insist that Mr Cameron remains in charge over his summer break. He will be accompanied by a fully working office, security official and secure communications on his trip to the Mediterranean. Downing Street said  he would be returning to  the UK next week and would be ‘back in the office for a couple of days’. He will then head off for a ‘short . break’ in Cornwall before returning to London in time for the start of . the Paralympics on August 29. Allies say Mr Clegg is in need of a . break after a strained period in coalition relations following the . abandonment of his plans for House of Lords reform. A source close to the Lib Dem leader said: ‘It’s primarily so they can both get back for the Paralympics. ‘Last year there was a  phase where Nick was minding the shop. ‘He agrees with the Prime Minister . that politicians do need holidays and the time available has been . limited by events this summer.’ He did take charge of the Government . for a few days last summer but Mr Cameron was forced to come home early . from holiday as the conflict in Libya escalated. A senior Lib Dem source added: ‘Perhaps Peter Bone should relax and have a holiday himself.’ ‘I’m sure Mrs Bone would appreciate . the quality time,’ the source added, in a reference to Mr Bone’s regular . mentions of his wife’s views when questioning members of the Cabinet in .

He was released on bail and has absconded again . One of Britain’s most wanted tax fugitives, who was caught after a decade on the run, has absconded again after being released on bail by a Spanish court. Cigarette smuggler Malcolm McGowan, 60, has been wanted by police since 2001, when he fled the country after being convicted of bringing £16million of cigarettes into Britain illegally. A European arrest warrant was issued against him but it was not until December last year that he was arrested after police received a tip-off that he was living in Valencia, Spain. But in a bizarre move, Nottingham-born McGowan was granted bail and is now on the run for a second time. After his arrest by the paramilitary Civil Guard, McGowan appeared before Spain’s National Criminal Court and was sent to a top-security prison near Madrid. Shortly afterwards, he was released on bail under Spanish holding laws and has not been seen since. The blunder has been criticised by Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie, who said McGowan should never have been released. The MP is planning to write to Foreign Minister William Hague to demand a review of how extradition cases are dealt with. Absconded: Malcolm McGowan was sent to a top security prison following his appearance at Spain's National Criminal Court, pictured . 'Certainly the first thing that I would like to see is the treasury and the British Foreign Office talking in very firm terms with the Spanish authorities about why there’s a process that allowed bail to be granted in cases such as these,' he said. 'I would have thought that the European Union justice system should be that when one country has clearly got a right to have someone extradited to be jailed it will be sorted out without these sort of loopholes. 'It sounds to me like we do need the Foreign Office to speak to their Spanish counterparts urgently to close this particular loophole.' McGowan was originally arrested in 2000, along with ten others, after customs officers intercepted containers carrying six million Superkings cigarettes in gypsum boards at Thamesport, in Kent. Six days later, 3.3 million Embassy Number 1 cigarettes were seized from a lorry travelling from France to Dover. McGowan was convicted of smuggling 24.3 million cigarettes, which would have attracted duty of £4million, into the UK from November 1999 to March 2000. He was one of 20 criminals whose photos were released on Thursday by HMRC as part of a Government crackdown. Former Home Office minister MP Vernon Coaker said: 'I think it’s certainly something that needs to be looked at and clearly on the face of it justice is not being served by the fact that someone wanted by us for so long and for such a serious crime has been released and then absconded. 'However difficult these things are it shouldn’t deter us from truing to do better and at the end of the day justice needs to be done.'

Cheat: Donna McConville, 35, pocketed more than £13,000 to which she was not entitled (pic posed by model) A mother-of-four believed she was entitled to claim benefits as a single parent because her husband spent so much time working away from home. Donna McConville, 35, pocketed more than £13,000 to which she was not entitled after failing to tell the authorities that she had a husband to provide for her. Over a 15-month period, from March 2010 to June 2011, she was paid £10,050 in housing benefit, £1,680 in council tax benefit and £1,291 in income support - none of which she would have received if she had been honest about her circumstances. She would not have been allowed the benefits even if she had been a single parent, because for most of that period she had a part-time job as a £7.40 an hour office administrator with LLED Construction, a property maintenance company. At Carlisle Crown Court prosecuting counsel Tim Evans said the job was something else she overlooked when filling in her claim forms. McConville, of Stanley Road, Brampton, Cumbria, had denied three charges of making false representations to obtain the benefits but was found guilty last month by Carlisle magistrates, who sent her to the crown court to be sentenced. Mr Evans said the evidence against her was conclusive. In mitigation, defence barrister David Birrell said McConville was 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' now that she understood the rules. 'In her particular circumstances she did not consider that she and her husband were living together in the proper sense,' he said. 'Now that the situation has been explained to her she accepts fully that she is guilty of the offences as charged. Sentencing: The mother-of-four's barrister told a judge at Carlisle Crown Court (pictured) she was ashamed of her actions . The court heard that McConville, whose youngest child is just 16 weeks old, is currently on maternity leave from what Mr Birrell described as 'a decent job'. Judge Paul Batty QC told her: 'I do not find it an attractive argument that because your husband was working abroad, and no doubt earning good money, it entitled you effectively to a single person's allowances.' He added: 'Many, many people who do not have the advantages that you have got in life manage to muddle along without committing offences such as these.' He imposed a community order, which will see McConville supervised by probation officers for 12 months. The judge also put her under a curfew to keep her indoors at home from 10pm to 5am every night for the next four months. He said the curfew started late enough so as not to interfere with her children's evening activities. But he told her: 'It will mean you won't be able to go out and enjoy yourself.'","Donna McConville, 35, pocketed more than £13,000 after failing to tell authorities that she had a husband ."

Tensions between Japan and China threatened to boil over yesterday in a row over a group of disputed islands. Around ten right-wing Japanese activists swam ashore the main island in the Senkaku archipelago and raised the national flag. They carried out the stunt to call on China to give up its claim to the islands, which are under Japanese control. Scroll down for video . Worrying: Tensions between Japan and China were close to boiling point this evening after a group of daredevil activists from Japan scrambled onto a disputed island and raised the Rising Sun flag . Protest: The activists hold up the national flag on Uotsuri island, one of the islands of Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, in the East China Sea . Controversial: After swimming ashore the protesters clambered onto rocks and raised the Japanese flag . Infuriated, Beijing issued an  immediate rebuke as thousands of Chinese took to the streets in cities across the country in protest at the stunt. The uninhabited islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu and Taiwan also lays a claim to, are hotly disputed because they lie close to rich gas fields and are situated in a vital shipping lane in the East China Sea. The activists, who belong to a group whose name translates as ‘Hang in there, Japan’, travelled  to the islands with 150 other people in a flotilla, which had ostensibly set out to commemorate Japanese citizens who died nearby in World War II. The pro-Japan activists arrived in the island chain at dawn today on a flotilla of boats carrying a total of 150 people. Disputed: This picture shows an aerial view of Uotsuri Island . Japanese coastguards, aware of the row that would follow if any of them landed on the islands, ordered them to sail away. But a determined dozen strapped on life jackets and swam to the rocky shoreline of the main island, Uotsuri. They said that not only would they raise the flag on the coastline rocks, they would sing Japan’s national anthem, have a fish meal, and then carry the flag to the island’s highest point, where it would be planted. When news of the assault reached Beijing, the Chinese issued an immediate rebuke and more than 100 people gathered near the Japanese consulate in China’s southern city of Guanghzou, demanding the Japanese leave the islands. Anger: When news of the assault reached Beijing, the Chinese issued an immediate rebuke. Protesters carried Chinese national flags at an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province . Unhappy: People hold banners as they attend a rally protesting against Japan's claim of the islands . The Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency said anti-Japanese rallies were also held in Shenzhen, Qingdao and Harbin. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gan had warned even before the flotilla set out that ‘any unilateral action taken by Japan on the Diaoyu Islands is illegal and invalid.’ He added: ‘China has made solemn representations to Japan, demanding that it immediately cease actions harming China’s territorial sovereignty.’ The islands are important to Japan, China and Taiwan because they lie on a vital shipping lane, but more importantly they are surrounded by deposits of gas.

Officially, the Japanese flotilla set out to commemorate the Japanese who died near the islands in World War II, but diplomats in Tokyo and Beijing were convinced that was just a cover story. The real reason for the landing, it was being widely accepted, was to counter a similar landing by Chinese activists last week. They had managed to get ashore, despite a Japanese coastguard vessel firing a water cannon at a boat carrying the group. The Chinese activists were deported shortly after landing on the island – but it is believed it was their action that resulted in the pro-Japanese group arranging their own assault. As the Japanese protest voyage was setting off, Mr Kenichi Kojima, a politician from Kanagawa, near Tokyo, said the trip was about who owned the archipelago. ‘I want to show the international community that these islands are ours.

French writer Richard Millet sparked controversy for claiming Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik, whom he described as 'without doubt what Norway deserves' A French author has sparked controversy . after saying that Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik is . 'without doubt what Norway deserves'. Richard Millet, who says he has read all 1,500 pages of Breivik’s online manifesto in which the Norwegian lays out his world view, insists that he does not approve of the gunman’s crimes. However, the respected writer and editor praised Breivik’s writing and cry of hatred for social democracy, immigration and multi-culturalism. 'Breivik is without doubt what Norway deserves,' wrote Millet in an 18-page pamphlet. He . is 'as much a child of a broken family as of an ideological and racial . fracture caused by immigration from outside Europe over the last 20 . years', added Millet, who has edited several award-winning books in . France. His writing about . Breivik has sparked consternation in the literary circles, with one . author Annie Ernaux calling the text 'a politically dangerous act'. Another author Tahar Ben Jelloun said: 'He has lost his head.' Others were less critical. 'He . is still my editor,' said Alexis Jenni. 'I don’t want to take any . public position on the subject. Millet believes only in literature. 'He is someone who writes marvellously well. His questionable ideas do not reduce his literary qualities,' he argued. Breivik . was last week sentenced to 21 years in prison for killing 77 people in a . bomb attack and deadly shooting rampage that shook Norway. In a manifesto he published online . before the attacks, Breivik wrote that 'patriotic resistance fighters' should use trials 'as a platform to further our cause'. The respected French writer has claimed mass killer . Anders Breivik (pictured) was 'without doubt what Norway deserves' Carnage: The aftermath of the Oslo car bomb planted by mass killer Breivik . Blast: The bomb at the high-rise government building left scores injured last year . He claimed to be part of a secret . organisation modelled on the medieval Christian military order the . Knights Templar, which aimed to purge Europe of Muslim influence. Police found no trace of the organisation, however, and said he acted alone. The document laid out a blueprint for . a multi-phase 'revolution', targeting left-leaning political elites he . accused of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of . immigrants, especially from Muslim countries. The document spelt out Breivik's . extreme nationalist philosophy as well as his methods. It described how . he bought guns, tons of fertiliser and other bomb components, hid . collections of weapons and evaded police suspicion in the run-up to the . attacks. CCTV: Surveillance footage shows Breivik, dressed in . police uniform and carrying a pistol, as he walks away from a car after . placing a bomb in Oslo last year . Force: This photo shows members of the Norwegian Special Forces land by boat on the shore of the island of Utoya during Breivik's shooting spree . Before the killings, Breivik spent much of his time absorbed in online gaming, mostly playing the World of Warcraft series. He was a high school dropout and, the . court heard, made money by forging diplomas and certificates under the . company name Diplom Service, which folded in 2006. He released a YouTube video six hours before the attacks calling for conservatives to 'embrace martyrdom'. It included pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon. In a text with the video he detailed . his plans for the attacks, writing that he would 'dress up as a police . officer', adding that it would 'be awesome as people will be . astonished'. Chilling: Breivik walks with a gun among the bodies strewn around Utoya island during his rampage last July . Terror: Teenagers on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya had to 'swim for their lives' and hide in trees when Breivik fired indiscriminately at them . In the wake of the attacks, anxious to prove he was not insane, Breivik called right-wing extremists and radical Islamists to give their public support for his view of clashing civilizations. It was widely reported that he had made postings on British nationalist websites. But Norwegian authorities said there was no evidence of links to the English far-right. Breivik derided a jail term as . 'pathetic', and said acquittal or execution were the only reasonable . outcomes, although the country does not have the death penalty. Breivik's rampage began when eight people were killed after his car bomb exploded at the high-rise Norwegian government headquarters in Oslo at 3.26pm. It left a dust-clogged square covered in twisted metal and shattered glass. Police . described it as an 'Oklahoma city-type' bombing, perpetrated by a . home-grown assailant and using the same mix of fertiliser and fuel that . blew up a building in the U.S. in 1995. The . bomb was packed into a panel truck outside the building. An . agricultural supplier said Breivik bought six tonnes of fertiliser in . the weeks before the explosion. But . as police battled to deal with the effects of the bomb, a much more . deadly attack was about to begin 20 miles north-west of the capital. Breivik, . dressed as a policeman, drove to a lake outside the capital and took a . ferry to the island of Utoya, where hundreds of young people were . attending a summer camp organised by the youth wing of the Labour Party. At . around 4.50pm he opened fire, claiming another 69 lives. It is claimed . that he beckoned to his young victims before shooting them one by one. Survivors of the shooting spree described hiding and fleeing into the water to escape. Police . arrived on the island an hour and a half after the gunman first opened . fire, because they did not have quick access to a helicopter and could . not find a boat to reach the scene just several hundred yards away. When . the armed officers did locate a boat they overloaded it, causing it to . break down. Breivik surrendered when officers finally reached him on . Utoya at 6.35pm. Oslo . police director Oeystein Maeland said later: 'I regret we weren't able . to arrest the suspect earlier than we did. Could police have been . faster? The answer is yes. 'If . the boat hadn't been over capacity, police would have been on Utoya . faster. If it would have led to another and better result is nothing we . know for sure, but we can't rule it out. 'And it's tough, like I've said before, to think that lives thereby would have been saved.' Chilling . accounts soon emerged of what happened at the camp. A 15-year-old, . Elise, said she heard gunshots but then saw a police officer and thought . she was safe. Then the . man started shooting people in front of her. She said: 'I saw many dead . people. He first shot people on the island. Afterwards he started . shooting people in the water.' Dana . Berzingi, 21, said several victims 'had pretended they were dead to . survive'. But after shooting them with one gun, he blasted them in the . head with a shotgun, he added.","Richard Millet says he has read all 1,500 pages of Breivik’s online manifesto .

Hannah Cockroft won Britain’s first Paralympic gold on the track last night in a stunning display that saw her smash the Paralympic record. The 20-year-old wheelchair racer – nicknamed ‘Hurricane Hannah’ – and one of the ‘faces’ of London 2012 stormed to the T34 100m title to the delight and roars of 80,000 packed in the Olympic Stadium for the opening day of athletics. A strong pre-race favourite, Cockroft, who has a condition similar to cerebral palsy, led from the front on a dry, warm night to easily win her first Paralympic medal in a time of 18.06 seconds. Jubilant: Hannah Cockroft celebrates her record-breaking victory in the T34 100m . Wheels on fire: Hannah Cockroft, front left, on track to victory during the Women's 100m at the Olympic Stadium . Her win came on a mixed day for Paralympic GB that saw cyclist Mark Colbourne win gold in the Velodrome but Jody Cundy, a seven times Paralympic champion and favourite for another cycling gold, was controversially disqualified. Jon-Allan Butterworth, Aileen McGlynn, and Shaun McKeown won silvers in the cycling while Darren Kenny bronze took a bronze in the Velodrome. 'Hurricane Hannah': Wheelchair sprinter Hannah Cockroft will also compete in the 200m at the Paralympics . While in the pool there were five silvers for Oliver Hynd, whose brother Sam Hynd took bronze , Stephanie Millward, James Crisp, Heather Frederiksen and Aaron Moores. In the stadium there was a bronze for Aled Davies in the shotput. Cockroft’s appearance had been one of the most anticipated of the Paralympics with many tipping her to be the track star of the Games. From her teens, when her father, an engineer, built a training “roller” for her racing chair in the basement of the family home in Halifax, she has had to contend with being described as Britain’s ‘new Tanni Grey-Thompson’ – the record- breaking 11 time Paralympic champion. Cockroft suffered two heart attacks due to an infection she contracted when in the womb. As a result of this, her brain was starved of oxygen – leaving part of her brain damaged and affected her back, legs, hips and part of her hands, which means she has problems with fine motor skills, mobility and balance. Her mother Rachel, 49, who watched her daughter’s first gold last night, said: ‘It’s very much like cerebral palsy but  Hannah doesn’t get the stiffness. She’s able to get about but not very far.’ She said her daughter took a little longer to start walking than other children her age, and ‘was in her buggy a lot longer than normal children would be’. When Hannah started school, her . mother Rachel said the disability didn’t particularly affect her. She . added: ‘She looked differently and she walked differently and there were . limitations in PE. ‘But . it didn’t hold her back. It didn’t affect her schooling – it was more . the little sort of things – she can’t tie her shoelaces for instance. There were frustrations, because she couldn’t walk far she couldn’t . always go into town with her friends.’ Winning smile: Hannah Cockroft, pictured at the age of five, has a condition similar to cerebral palsy . Defying the odds: Hannah is already a multiple world record holder - despite doctors saying she would never be able to do anything with her life when she was born . At the age of 13, Cockroft began playing wheelchair basketball and was spotted at the national schools event by Dame Tanni’s husband Ian who gave her a go in the champion’s wheelchair. ‘She immediately got hooked on speed,’ her mother, a teaching assistant, said. ‘After seeing how much she loved it her father and the community came together to raise the funds to buy her a sprinting chair. It wasn’t long before she was picked up by British Athletics. ‘She was originally pencilled in to take part in the Rio 2016 games but she did so well at the World Championships that she was brought forward for London.’ Mrs Cockroft travelled to the stadium last night with her husband, Graham, 50, an engineer, and two brothers Joel, 23 and Daniel, 16. Channel 4 has been rewarded with big audiences for its £6million investment in the Paralympic Games. The opening ceremony on Wednesday drew more viewers than any of its other programmes over the past ten years. This is the highest for a Paralympics . event in recent history - although some way from the top figures in . excess of 12 million the BBC was achieving for the main Olympics. And around 3million tuned in to watch Great Britain in the wheelchair basketball between 9 and 10pm on Thursday. Other events have had encouraging audiences, with daytime peaks of around 1.8million. Many viewers said they had been put off by the style of the coverage, which has been criticised as too sombre, with not enough live action and too many ad breaks. Viewers were particularly furious when the live coverage of Johnathan . Fox’s gold medal-winning performance in the pool was not shown because . it clashed with the start of the news at 7pm. However, the network, which is broadcasting more than 400 hours of coverage and 150 hours in peak time, has been praised by the International Paralympic Committee for its commitment to the Games. A spokesman said American coverage, which is being run by NBC, was disappointing by comparison because there was very little coverage and nothing broadcast live. ‘Great Britain is leading the way, as is the rest of Europe,’ he added.","Wheelchair racer Hannah Cockroft has a condition similar to cerebral palsy .

Yemen has gone from being 'on the brink' to being 'in the midst' of a major food catastrophe. Over 10 million people are thought to be starving in the war-torn country, which has been struggling with al-Qaeda terrorism as well as a lack of political stability. As these painful pictures show, it is often a daily battle, especially for children, to survive as food supplies begin to run low. Worrying: A doctor checks a three-month old severely malnourished baby at a therapeutic feeding center in Sana'a, Yemen . Help needed: Nearly a million children in Yemen are suffering from acute malnutrition, whilst right, this child is barely recognisable as human such is  his malnutrition . The already poor are on the verge of death, the middle class now struggling to pay for life essentials, whilst the rich find it much easier to spend their money. Speaking to The Business Recorder,  Mustafa Nasr, the head of Yemen's Studies and Economic Media Centre, a non-governmental group said: 'Yemen is suffering from a serious economic meltdown that marks it as one of the 10 most food-insecure countries with the highest poverty rates in the world.' Millions of people have exhausted their ways of coping, and cannot afford to buy enough food for their families, leaving many close to breaking point. Yemen's political crisis last year increased hunger in the country as food and fuel prices surged. According to the UN, malnutrition rates in some parts of the country are alarming, with one in three children severely malnourished. Weak: High food prices have left millions in Yemen struggling to survive day on day . Graphic: A Yemeni man sits on the ground as he waits for his malnourished child to receive treatment at a therapeutic feeding center . Yemen is heavily dependent on food imports; it is believed the region depends on outside imports for 90 per cent of its wheat. Rising food prices, added to a lack of home-grown food reserves have put the Asian country in desperate trouble. The worrying shortage of food is intrinsically linked to the rise of extremism within the country; people disillusioned with the government failing to sort the problems often turn to extremist groups such as the Ansar al-Sharia who offer alternatives with the promise of food. It's certainly a vicious circle which in turn continues to lead to unrest in the region. And as these pictures show there seems little in the way of a solution to this country's deepening crisis.

Search: It was hoped the spade would provide clues to the final resting place of victim Keith Bennett . A forensic expert is carrying out tests on a rusty spade discovered on Saddleworth Moor which could prove to be a dramatic new breakthrough in the search for the body of the last missing victim of child killer Ian Brady. It was hoped the tool would provide clues to the final resting place of victim Keith Bennett, whose mother Winnie Johnson died last month without ever knowing what became of his remains. The 12-year-old was abducted and murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in 1964 and is the only one of the five young victims whose body has never been traced. But Steve Kershaw, senior lecturer in . forensic analytical science at Manchester Metropolitan University, who . has been examining the spade, said he has been unable to trace its . history. He said: 'It is very, very corroded. The metal in it appears to be a reasonable steel that pre-dates the start of recycling. 'There was some vegetation attached to it and was found in an area of peat. 'The . handle had been broken off, but even if we had lots more time, and even . if we had established that it was a spade from the 60s or pre-dated the . 60s, we would not have necessarily established if it was anything to do . with Ian Brady. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Keith Bennet was abducted and murdered by Ian Brady, left, and Myra Hindley, right, in 1964 and is their only victims whose body has never been traced . 'The only way we would have been able to tell is if it had DNA on it and that is harder to tell with the handle gone, with it being so corroded. 'Although some vegetation has survived, there is very little chance of DNA having survived.' He said the spade has now been returned to its finders, members of Worsley Paranormal Group, who had been searching the area for signs of where Keith's remains lie on the moor outside Manchester. Brady, 74, who remains in prison after being locked up for life, had been urged by police to 'at last do the decent thing' and finally tell Keith's family where he buried him on Saddleworth Moor so he can be given a Christian burial. Grief: Keith Bennett's mother Winnie Johnson, pictured on Saddleworth Moor above Oldham, died last month having never been able to lay her son to rest . Torment: Many attempts have been made to find the remains of Keith Bennett on Saddleworth Moor, but without success . Keith's brother Alan, who was nine when his brother was taken off the street by Brady and the late Hindley, said he will remain in the possession of the murderous pair until his body is found. Writing on his website, www.searchingforkeith.com, Mr Bennett said: 'As far as I am concerned, until Keith is found then he is still in the possession of Brady and Hindley. 'Our fear as a family is that now my mother is no longer with us, this may be seen by the police and the media as some sort of closure to the case. 'This must not be allowed to happen both out of respect for Keith and my mother's memory and for those of us who loved them both.' The family's lawyer, John Ainley, said of the spade: 'As far as I was concerned it was going to be subject to forensic tests and until we know whether or not it is relevant there is no comment from me or the family. 'We are keeping an open mind until the results of the tests are revealed.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said it did not have any information about the spade.

The warning came after David Blunkett was forced to move by a ‘stroppy’ official when he attended last week’s opening ceremony with his guide dog, Cosby. The former Home Secretary, 65, said he was made to sit in an ‘exposed, blustery gantry’ rather than his reserved spot. But Games organisers Locog insisted the official had done nothing wrong – and said other guide dog owners might also be barred from the seats they had reserved at busy venues. Instead, they may be moved ‘to allow dog and owner more room’.

Roach to non-commissioned-officer's rank was filmed in April by . a superior at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, and first aired by WMMT News Channel 3 in Kalamazoo. Vexing Video: The film depicts one of Sgt. Phillip Roach's superior officers hammering him in the gut with a wooden mallet . Newly Promoted: The hazing ritual was conducted to initiate Phillip Roach to an NCO's rank. He formerly was a specialist . Phillip's superior officer is shown  taking three practice swings at the newly-minted N.C.O's gut. Finally, the unidentified batsman delivers a brutal coup de grace that sent Phillip crumpling to . the floor. Phillip, who hails from Battle Creek, was not only bowled over by the blow, but badly whacked his head - first on a . folding chair and then on the concrete floor, according to the shocking video. He then suffered a seizure that required a hospital visit and that still has him . unable to go airborne for the Army, Ken Roach has said. Mr. Roach added that his son was an aviator, but is yet to be cleared by a doctor to return to his duties. 'That was assault with a deadly weapon,' Mr. Roach told WMMT. 'He could've killed my son and he . should pay for it... I'm mad at the individuals who done it and who's . trying to give a little slap on the wrist and say, ""It's good to go. Let's just sweep it under the rug. Send him somewhere else and be done . with it.''' A Father's Fury: Ken Roach, who served in the U.S. Army from 1982 to 1990, dashed off a letter to President Obama concerning the affair . The wooden mallet's wielder reportedly received a $1,000 fine and a reprimand for simple assault. Mr Roach has said he would like to see formal assault charges brought. 'I never thought in my wildest dreams I'd be contacted by anybody that my son had a seizure and was hit in the chest during a hazing incident,' he told the AP, adding that Phillip required six staples to close a head wound from the affair. In response to his plea to Mr. Obama, . the elder Roach reportedly said he received a letter from 'someone in . the president's office.' The reply acknowledged the . 'unauthorized ceremony,' in which his son was injured, as well as called . it a 'clear incident of hazing that caused injury to a great soldier.' Winding Up: The unidentified superior who wielded the mallet is shown in the video taking three measured practice swings at Roach's gut . A Vicious Swing: Roach's unidentified superior then whacks the 22-year-old seemingly as hard as he can in the abdomen . An Empty Handshake: The mallet's wielder then congratulates Roach with a handshake as the grimacing sergeant obviously fights through the resulting pain . But Mr Roach sneered that the punishment was a 'slap on the wrist' and said it was not good enough. Phillip has been a serviceman in the U.S. Army for five years. Mr. Roach, for his part, served from 1982 to 1990. The father told the AP his son informed him during his junior year at Battle Creek Central High School that he wanted to join the Army 'so he could serve under the flag and fight for the freedom of the United States.' Now, the elder Roach added to WMMT, 'There's a possibility that he may never be able to clear medically and be able to do his job and they could medically discharge him just because of this stupid hazing.' Carl Levin, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has released a statement asking the Army to review the case. In Obvious Pain: After shaking hands with his superior, Phillip Roach doubles over in obvious pain from the blow . The Aftermath: Moments after he is slugged with the mallet, Roach doubles over in pain, supporting himself by laying both hands on a nearby table . Laid Out: Roach then falls to the concrete floor, first hitting his head on a folding chair and then on the hard surface. He suffered a seizure for which he had to be hospitalized . Phillip Roach is yet to be cleared for to resume his prior duties. The superior officer was fined $1,000 and cited for simple assault .

The 32-year-old moved in with 'reformed love rat' Richard Antony, 34, after he promised to put an end to his infidelity. But she was left devastated when she took her blocked Henry cleaner to be fixed at a local repair shop and the technician pulled out a pair of frilly French pants belonging to another woman. Busted: Melissa Smeaton discovered her boyfriend was cheating after finding these frilly French knickers beloning to his lover in her vacuum cleaner . Tearful Melissa stormed back to her house in Croydon to confront her lover with the 'cleaner in one hand and knickers in the other'. Richard at first denied he had done anything wrong saying 'they are nothing to do with me'. But after hours of interrogation, he eventually confessed his guilt when Melissa forced him to admit he had been seeing another woman. Jilted Melissa, who had already seen her previous marriage collapse, today admitted her relief at rumbling the love rat.

Its difficult to get close to another man after being betrayed in such a painful way.' Melissa discovered she was being two-timed in March this year. Mr Antony said: 'Obviously, I feel sorry I feel sorry now more than I did before. I wish it had never happened. I want to try and make it up to her.'","Melissa Smeaton, 32, rumbles her partner after taking cleaner to repair shop .

Inquest: Jane Cappleman told police she thought she had been tending to the remains of Osama Bin Laden . A mentally ill woman who washed and dragged round the naked corpse of her friend for three weeks, thought she was tending to the body of Bin Laden, an inquest heard. Jane Cappleman, 77, lived with the decaying body of 75-year-old Anthony Sherman after he died from unknown causes - and even washed his corpse with a flannel. Worried neighbours eventually called the police after spotting her burning his clothes in the garden of the south London flat, Southwark Coroner’s Court heard. After officers battered down the door, Ms Cappleman told them she thought she had been tending to the remains of Osama Bin Laden. By the time it was discovered, Mr Sherman’s body was too badly decomposed to shed light on how he died. An analysis of insects that had hatched on his flesh concluded he had been dead for around three weeks. Recording an open verdict, Assistant Deputy Coroner Belinda Cheney said it was impossible to know how Mr Sherman died. ‘It’s difficult because we really don’t have enough evidence for any type of verdict,’ she said. ‘While it seems tempting to say this is natural causes, we have no information about that and, of course, the post-mortem report could not assist in any meaningful way. ‘In the circumstances I feel the only verdict open to me is an open one.’ Police forced entry to the ground-floor flat in Cross Close, Peckham, south London, shortly after 2.30pm on May 3 last year. In a witness statement, paramedic Sebastian Clover said even before emergency services entered it was obvious from the smell that Mr Sherman was dead. ‘The flat was extremely dirty and untidy,’ he said. Southwark Coroner’s Court (pictured) heard how worried neighbours eventually called the . police after spotting Ms Cappleman burning clothes in the garden . ‘When I opened the door to the back room I found a person lying on the floor. The body was wrapped in a sheet and was heavily decomposed.’ A short while later police arrested Ms Cappleman on suspicion of failing to report the death to the authorities. The charges were ultimately dropped after a judge at Kingston Crown Court ruled she was unfit to plead, after which she was detained under the Mental Health Act. In a police interview, Ms Cappleman, said she had known Mr Sherman, described by neighbours as a ‘well-spoken quiet man’, for around 10 years after meeting him in church. The pair had never been romantically involved, she said, adding that she lived with him and he gave her £20 a week as ‘pocket money’. Summarising her account, Detective Constable Andy Faiers said Ms Cappleman claimed to have been at the flat for three weeks but was ‘adamant the deceased was not Mr Sherman.’ She variously claimed she thought he was former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, or that he ‘must have been Australian or American because they’re nudists’. DC Faiers added: ‘She knew he was dead but didn’t know what to do. ‘There appeared to be drag marks on the floor, indicating the body had been moved, and she said she moved him so she could wash him every day. ‘She cleaned his face, chest and upper back with a flannel.’","Jane Cappleman lived with the decaying body of her friend for three weeks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:46 EST, 3 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 3 September 2012 . Lance Armstrong underwent blood transfusions to boost his performance and took advantage of legal loopholes to cover up his doping, a former teammate has claimed in an explosive new book. US Postal Service cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who rode with the now-disgraced cyclist between 1998 and 2001, has claimed dishonest techniques were rife throughout the team. 'To Lance's way of thinking, doping is a fact of life, like oxygen or gravity,' Hamilton said of Armstrong, who last week dropped his challenge to doping allegations, losing his seven Tour de France titles. One technique was blood doping, where a . rider would extract his blood in a bag and then re-inject it to boost the . red blood cell count, Hamilton claims in The Secret Race, which is out on Monday. New claims: In a book released on Monday, Tyler Hamilton, left, has claimed his former team mate Lance Armstrong, right, would routinely take drugs and came up with ways to pass drugs tests . 'With the other stuff, you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny . injection,' Hamilton wrote. 'But here you're watching a big clear . plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood. You never . forget it.' Hamilton added that, at the 1998 Tour, Armstrong's gardener, Phillipe, followed the riders on a motorbike carrying vials of the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin (EPO). The team and Phillipe used prepaid cellphones to discreetly organise times and places to drop off the drugs in white lunch bags along the way. 'When we needed Edgar [Allan Poe, a slang term for EPO], Phillipe would . zip through the Tour's traffic and make a drop-off,' he claimed. The following year, Hamilton claims he . was at Armstrong's villa in Nice when he asked Armstrong if he had any EPO. Armstrong pointed to the refrigerator, where Hamilton found the . drug. Head-to-head: Hamilton (right) said Armstrong (left) would call his gardener to bring him blood-boosting drugs in white lunch bags along the Tour de France route . Stocked up: Hamilton, right, said he once asked Armstrong, left, for drugs and was directed to his fridge . Hamilton also alleges Armstrong and other team members took advantage of . a French law that barred drug testers from taking samples from cyclists between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m so they could sleep. Explosive book: Hamilton, who wrote The Secret Race with a New York Times journalist, has been banned twice for his own doping offenses . The cyclists would take small amounts of drugs at 10 p.m. so the drugs would be out of . their systems eight hours later, at the end of the period they called 'glowtime'. Hamilton cited another example of getting a text from . his doctor on a prepaid phone which read: 'The restaurant is 167 miles away,' meaning he could get a blood . transfusion in hotel Room 167. While Hamilton has twice been banned . for doping offenses, Armstrong has never failed a test - but Hamilton . said this is merely because they were 'easy to beat'. 'They . weren't drug tests,' Hamilton said. 'They were more like discipline tests, IQ tests. If you were careful and paid attention, you could dope and be 99% . certain that you would not get caught. 'We're way, way ahead of the tests. They've got their doctors and we’ve got ours, and ours are better. Better paid, for sure.' Hamilton has previously spoken out against Armstrong and the team in interviews with federal criminal investigators. At the weekend, Armstrong's former personal assistant, Mike Anderson backed up the claims in Outside Magazine. He said Armstrong made little effort to cover up the practice. 'I found a prescription box in the . medicine cabinet - to the side of the vanity in the bathroom - that sent . everything spiraling,' Anderson wrote. 'I knew what it was. Not exactly at . first, but I sensed from my rudimentary knowledge of medicine that this . box shouldn’t be in the bathroom of a professional cyclist. The label . said Androstenedione.' But when Anderson confronted Armstrong about it, he shrugged off the severity of the practice. Disgraced: Armstrong, photographed signing autographs in Montreal last week, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after he gave up his challenge to the doping accusations . Ousted: Armstrong's former personal trainer Mike Anderson, pictured, claimed he found a banned substance in the cyclist's apartment early last year - and that Armstrong was nonchalant about it . '""Everyone does it,"" he said . nonchalantly, looking me straight in the eyes. That floored me. I didn’t . say anything else, but the implication was clear enough,' Anderson wrote. Anderson's claims have been mocked by a spokesman for Armstrong. 'The alleged substance produces the . antithesis of an endurance athlete. [It] leads to increased muscle size . and strength,' Mark Fabiani said, adding . Anderson was a 'disgruntled former employee'. Armstrong's reputation as a record-breaking cyclist and inspirational cancer survivor has shattered since he have up his years-long fight to clear himself of doping charges on August 23. Subsequently, the US Anti-Doping Agency that banned him from competition and stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles.","Tyler Hamilton's new book claims doping was widespread among cyclists .

The first human cases of a mosquito borne virus, previously only found in animals, have been found in Vermont causing widespread fear of an impending epidemic. The Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus, which can be deadly a third of the time, has struck two victims who have been hospitalized with flu like symptoms. But health officials fear the virus could develop into a serious strain of the illness that can be fatal. Public health officials fear the easy spread of the mosquito-borne virus, similar to the West Nile virus . The two cases for the state were found in residents in Rutland and Addison counties, in western Vermont, though no information has been released about the identities of the patients. In humans, the virus can develop into two types of illness. The first, which is least worrisome, causes flu like symptoms and typically lasts one or two weeks. But the more serious form attacks the central nervous system, causing fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, convulsions and coma. It causes death in a third of all cases, which have been found mainly in Massachusetts, and can leave survivors with serious neurological damage. 'It's impossible to tell which people will develop the more severe illness,' Vermont State Epidemiologist Dr Patsy Kelso told WFFF-TV. 'Like I said with eastern equine virus a number of people develop that more serious illness and it's fatal about a third of the time,' she added. EEE is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito and has been found in other areas in New England . EEE is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito and has been found in other communities across New England. In Vermont, it was first discovered in emus in the state in September 2011. There is a vaccine for horses, emus, llamas and alpacas but no vaccine for humans. 'Last year there was an emu farm that had a die off from eastern equine and so we've been anticipating that we might see some human cases and unfortunately we have this year,' Kelso said. 'The reason we're seeing it here now is the weather. Hot dry summers are perfect for mosquitoes, conditions that have been seen all over Vermont this year.' Public health officials in Vermont fear the fast spread of the illness and local officials are working on measures to keep the virus contained. Officials in Vermont will spray pesticides to control the mosquito population, using aerial spraying similar to this twin-engine plane used in Dallas to control the West Nile virus . The EEE virus, as well as West Nile Virus, were both detected in mosquito pools in the two counties. The Vermont Department of Health and Agency of Agriculture will be spraying pesticides from aircraft to control mosquitoes. 'The severe form of EEE is a terrible disease, and we want to take every reasonable action to prevent people from becoming infected,' Health Commissioner Harry Chen said in a statement. 'These viruses will continue to circulate until the first freeze. Although spraying will help reduce the risk of infection, it's important that we all take personal precautions to avoid mosquito bites no matter where we live,' the statement added. In addition to spraying for mosquitoes, officials are warning Vermont residents to wear long sleeves shirts and pants and to avoid being outdoors after dark.# . The West Nile virus was first discovered in the U.S. in 1999. So far in 2012, 66 people have died from West Nile virus infections and the number of people infected is now at 1,590, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","EEE virus can cause death in a third of the cases .

Prosecutors have decided not to bring manslaughter charges against the workmen who installed the appliance . Relatives of a young mother who was electrocuted while mopping up water from a faulty boiler have spoken of their fury after prosecutors decided not to bring manslaughter charges against the bungling workmen who installed the appliance. An inquest jury ruled that Emma Shaw, 22, was unlawfully killed when she suffered a fatal electric shock in her flat in West Bromwich, West Midlands, in December 2007. But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says there is 'insufficient evidence' to charge Anchor Electrical and Building Services, the company which let an unqualified electrician safety inspect Miss Shaw's home. Prosecutors reached the decision despite jurors at Miss Shaw's inquest hearing of a 'catalogue of mistakes' by the firm, which has been wound up since the tragedy. Miss Shaw's parents today revealed that they were considering bringing a private prosecution, and the Health and Safety Executive is still to decide whether it will take action. Miss Shaw's mother, Dianne Potter, said her daughter had been denied justice. 'I’m disgusted,' Ms Potter added. 'Have we come all this way for it to finish like this?' Miss Shaw's father, Paul Shaw, said: 'We feel dumbstruck. Do we bring a private prosecution? That’s a question to raise with our solicitor. 'We had what we considered a positive result at the inquest and thought there may be sufficient evidence for a criminal case.' 'Denied justice': Dianne Potter, pictured holding a book in her daughter Emma Shaw's memory, criticised the decision of the CPS . Miss Shaw's boyfriend Andy Cross, who found her body and is now raising their six-year-old son Brayden alone, said: 'The jury said it was unlawful killing which, to me, means someone was to blame. 'How can the CPS turn down the case when the coroner’s court said something was not right?' During a seven-day inquest last December, jurors heard there had been a catologue of mistakes by the company that wired Miss Shaw's flat. Testing was 'not carried out to a professional standard, if at all', the inquest was told. Jurors heard there had been a . 'failure by the company to assess the capabilities of their workforce . and constantly monitor their development' and a 'failure to comply with . their health and safety standards'. Fury: Dianne Potter (left) said she was 'disgusted' that manslaughter charges would not be brought even after an inquest jury ruled that her daughter, Emma Shaw (right), had been unlawfully killed . The inquest heard that Anchor could not explain why an employee who was not a fully-qualified electrician was left alone in the flat to carry out a safety inspection of electrical work. In a statement, the CPS said: 'Following the unlawful killing verdict at the inquest into the death of Emma Shaw, West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service has conducted a full review of the original decision not to charge six suspects with the offence of manslaughter. 'The review is now complete and, with the benefit of advice from a leading specialist QC, we have decided there remains insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any suspect for the offence of manslaughter. 'The CPS has informed the Health and Safety Executive of its decision. HSE is likely to consider whether it is appropriate to bring any prosecutions under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.' The HSE confirmed it was 'liaising with the CPS' over the case. Mother: Miss Shaw with her son Brayden, then aged one. The boy, now six, is being brought up by his father, Andy Cross .

The contractor, of Worthing, West Sussex, denied the charge of failing to comply with an improvement notice during a short hearing at Brighton Magistrates Court today (Thursday). Marmont is described on his website as having worked 'alongside various architects and designers...most recognisable being Laurence Llewelyn Bowen and Diarmuid Gavin'. Garden designer and TV personality Gavin fronted the home makeover show along with Llewelyn-Bowen. The charge is in relation to a house in .

Mrs Conroy-Taylor had kept the horse at Beaumont Grange Farm, which has an equestrian centre with a riding school, for several years. But tragedy struck in May last year when Mrs Conroy-Taylor, 45, went to the stables to help ‘muck out’ Zara’s horse after returning from a family holiday. Crushed: Charlotte Conroy-Taylor was killed by a one-ton hay bale only months after warning of the risk of such an incident, an inquest has heard . An inquest into her death at Preston Coroner’s Court was told that Mrs Conroy-Taylor died almost instantly after being struck by the hay bale covered in black plastic. Giving evidence 13-year-old Zara told how her mother had warned of an accident occurring with the hay bales prior to her death. She said: ‘A few months before the accident my mum said ""I bet one day one of them is going to fall"" because she wasn’t as happy as she should have been with the way that they were stacked. The girl said she went to the stables with her mother every evening at around 5pm. Mrs Conroy-Taylor, Youth Offending Team manager at Lancashire County Council, would begin mucking out duties whilst Zara rode her horse around the stables. Zara said her mother suffered from a bad back causing her to ‘hunch over’ meaning she preferred to get hay from a trough within the stables rather than access the bales. However, on a number of occasions clients were forced to access the hay bales as the trough ‘was more often than not empty’. She said: ‘We never opened a bale at the bottom of the stack and would know not to open one supporting the stack. It would make it unstable or fall it was common sense.’ On May 31 last year, the last time Zara saw her mother alive was as she stood next to a stack of hay bales around five metres high. Preston and West Lancashire Coroner, James Adeley said: ‘Zara went to muck out the horse and Charlotte went to collect some hay. 'Precariously balanced': A giant hay bale fell on Mrs Conroy-Taylor at Beaumont Grange Farm, an equestrian centre with a riding school . ‘But after her mother left Zara heard a scream a few moments later and found her mother on the floor with a hay bale near her feet and another by her side. ‘Zara called for help but Charlotte had already succumbed to her death.’ Zara held her mother’s hand and squeezed it but Mrs Conroy-Taylor did not respond, the court heard. Emergency services were called to the farm in Morecambe but Mrs Conroy-Taylor, who lived with her husband Ian at Brookhouse, near Lancaster, was pronounced dead later the same day. Four days after Mrs Conroy-Taylor’s death the farm in Bottomdale Road, Slyne, was visited by a number of health and safety experts. Peter Lord, an environmental health officer for Lancaster City Council, told the jury he found an almost empty plastic wrapper at the bottom of the hay bale stack. He said: ‘This empty wrapper was obviously a full bale at one time but hay had been taken from it on a regular basis and this had caused instability in the stack above. ‘The stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support, causing it to collapse.’ Mr Lord said stable owner Carol Hill claimed that she had repeatedly tried to stop clients from accessing hay bales. He said: ‘She told me she was red hot about this and told them regularly not to do it and to prevent it she had purchased a large wheeled trough which she kept stacked up with hay.’ 'The stack was precariously balanced and as the bale below got emptier it provided less support, causing it to collapse' Mrs Hill who runs the equine centre with her husband, Steve, told inspectors on the day of the accident the trough had contained hay. However, Detective Sergeant Colin Forsyth from Lancaster CID said that during his inspection of the site the day after Mrs Conroy-Taylor’s death the trough was ‘completely empty.’ Michael Mullen from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he became ‘very concerned’ about the safety of the stack during a visit to the farm following the incident. He said: ‘We were reluctant to leave the centre because we thought the stacking at the stables was unsafe. ‘The front and back stack was not tied together and they were free standing. We had concerns about the structural integrity of the stack.’ Peter Hamer, agricultural expert at the HSE, told the court he had major concerns after he found the stack ‘dangerously’ leaning towards one side. He ordered the couple to reassemble the stack immediately as clients including children were still using the stables. He said: ‘We were not prepared to leave the site until the stack had been made safe. ‘It was a major concern as the stack was not tied together and the left hand row was leaning over.’ Pathologist Nicholas Mapstone told the court that Mrs Conroy-Taylor had died from multiple injuries including collapsed lungs and internal bleeding caused by the weight of the hay bale.","Charlotte Louise Conroy-Taylor, 45, died after bale fell on her at Beaumont Grange Farm in Morecambe, Lancashire .

A former 'gangster' who used to steal lead from church roofs has swapped his life of crime and turned to the church and become a vicar. Reverend Mark Rowan, 41, who spent more than 17 years in and out of jail for a variety of drugs, theft and violent offences has seen the light and changed his ways. But former gang leader Mark - who had previously 'only gone to church to steal lead from the roof' - saw the light during a prolonged spell inside and swapped his criminal career for a life of prayer. Repent! Mark has swapped a life of crime and prison sentences to become a reverend . Determined to turn his life around he left prison and underwent five years training at theological college before being ordained. And after becoming a pastor in Devon the father says the community has welcomed the unusual vicar. The heavily-tattooed vicar said: 'I have full reverend status. This was the first exam I have ever taken and it is a huge achievement for me. 'The only time I wasn’t committing crime was when I was sleeping. I carried knives and was involved with gangs. 'I used heroin, cocaine and cannabis and lived a crazy life. A lot of my friends are either dead or serving life sentences in prison. 'The only time I went to church was for the lead on the roof. I had no respect for Jesus and never thought about being a Christian.' Yorkshire-born Mark began his . christian mission following his release from Channings Wood Prison in . 2000 when he moved to Exeter, Devon. Mark, having escaped a life of . violence and crime, has now settled down to a quiet life in a sleepy . Devon village, with wife Andrea,a clinical psychologist, with whom he has two young children. A changed man: The former gangster has given up his criminal career to pursue a life in the church and written a book about it . He said: 'The community here have welcomed me with open arms, when they first saw me I am not sure what they thought. 'I have tattoos from my neck, down to my feet, but now, after two years, everyone is great and we all get on so well.' Mark, who has a huge demon angel holding a skull inked onto his back, has written an autobiography entitled ‘Condemned’. He said: 'It is great to be carrying an inspirational story of transformation and encouraging people that it is never too late to change.' Mark, who admits he is not an average village vicar, became a pastor a Braunton Costal Community Church in Devon two years ago. The tough-talking priest said: 'I didn’t get any qualifications in life other than being a vicious criminal. 'I felt that was the only way I knew - I was more comfortable in prison with murderers and psychos than I was on the streets. 'The only time when I wasn’t committing a crime was when I was asleep or in prison. I was a 24-7 active criminal.' A leopard who changed his spots: Mark turned to God during a spell inside Channings Wood Prison . After seeing his work go from strength to strength, he is now launching a new outreach service in Barnstaple, to help troubled youth. He said: 'If my old self could see the new me, I would be inspired with what I am doing now. I am trying to get children to steer themselves away from the life of crime. 'My children and family are all very proud of me now, I wasn’t around for their childhoods but now I am making up for lost time and rectifying my mistakes. 'Many of my family didn’t believe that I would survive much longer from my previous life. 'People were kicking doors of my family homes with shotguns and baseball bats, contracts were out on my life - for me to come out the other side unscathed is a miracle.'","Reverend Mark Rowan spent more than 17 years in and out of jail for drugs and theft-related crimes .

It’s no secret that the Obamas run a tight ship when it comes to parenting 14-year-old Malia and 11-year-old Sasha, especially now the girls are fast heading into the tumultuous teenage years. As well as recounting endless anecdotes about their daughters, the first couple have mentioned various household rules they set for their girls over the past four years. But, when it comes to campaigning, it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard. Smiling and waving - yes, and lots of it. Talking - no, thank you. Smile and wave: Malia, left, and Sasha, right, appear with their parents during the final day of the DNC; it seems the girls number one rule is to be seen and not heard . Cosy: The White House released a heart-warming photo of Malia and Sasha snuggled up on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech on Tuesday night . And the two girls, now all grown up, . excelled themselves on Thursday night when they made a composed . appearance at their father's DNC speech. When not on the political trail themselves, the girls are frequently . referenced by their parents, appear in campaign videos and on . promotional posters. But, as the New York Times pointed out, the sisters are barely ever heard speaking. 'They are a bit of a mystery,'  J. J. Abrams, an Obama donor and  Hollywood writer-director, said of the sisters. 'But they’re authentic, and we’re starving for that,' he told the Times. Indeed, as Obama’s re-election campaign forges ahead, his daughters will be his not-so-secret but silent weapon. The girls clearly help Obama portray a family-man image and the President recounts carefully selected stories about them whenever he can - to the chagrin of his opponents. Family Man: Barack and Michelle Obama have always picked carefully selected stories to tell about their daughters, Sasha, centre, and Malia, left. This 2009 picture shows just how much the girls have grown up since their father entered office . Back then: Malia (left) and Sasha (center right) were only 10 and 7 years old respectively when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 on the night their father accepted the nomination . The discipline to be seen and not . heard, the oldest in the book, will be easy for Malia and Sasha who are . known to have strict rules set at home. Those household rules, largely set by . mom-in-chief Michelle, which have been compiled by the New York Times, . offer a glimpse of what home life is like for the youngsters. Here are some of the rules that Michelle and Barack have confessed to laying down: . (Incidentally, when they do watch TV, the girls are said to enjoy Modern Family.) Laying down the law: It is no secret that Michelle and Barack set strict rules for their daughters, including no technology during the week . Color coordinated: On election night 2008, it was clear that someone else picked out the girl's outfits. More recently, it appears that the girls have had more of a say in their attire as they begin to experiment . Most changed: While both girls have obviously . matured, Sasha, who wore peach at the inauguration (left) and was only 7 . when she moved into the White House, looks much older now (right) Vacation time: This past Christmas, in 2011, the first family traveled to their father's home state of Hawaii .

The girls were unable to join their . mother in Charlotte on the night of her speech- which has received . almost universal praise- because it was their first day of school. Sasha is now in sixth grade at . Sidwell Friends School, which they chose to attend once their father was . elected and they moved to Washington, D.C . Malia just had her first day of high school on Tuesday, reaching a milestone in her education thus far. President and First Lady Obama sat . down with People magazine during a campaign stop towards the end of . August and at that time they said how there was a lot to think about in . terms of back-to-school preparations and Malia's transition to high . school. 'She's going to be great. The truth . is my girls, they don't seem to have all the flaws I had when I was . their age. They're just good kids- smart, hardworking, kind, and . respectful.

The intrepid flying man takes to the air using only a jet-powered carbon-fibre wing strapped to his back. Death-defying formation: 'Jetman' Yves Rossy flew alongside an iconic British Spitfire flown by Nigel Lamb above the Swiss mountains for an airfield's annual 'fly-in' He teamed up with warplane pilot Mr Lamb for the annual aviation festival at the Bex aerodrome near Geneva. Mr Lamb, who is part of the Breitling . Fighters display team, was flying the original wartime Spitfire MH343, . which is based at the Imperial War Museum aerodrome at Duxford, near . Cambridge. In 2006, Mr Rossy, 53, a former Swiss . Air Force fighter pilot, became the first person to successfully fly . using just a  jet-powered wing. Since then he has powered across the . English Channel at 186 mph and flown over the Alps and the Grand Canyon. He said: ‘To fly in formation with this wonderful machine [the Spitfire] is an incredible experience. ‘Since my technology is getting more . and more reliable I am very confident about these flights. I can relax . and enjoy such a fantastic experience. Under my wing I am free. I have . the perfect view.’ Jet pack: His custom made jet-propelled winged invention allowed him to fly close by the Spitfire . Sky high: Rossy used to fly fighter jets for the Swiss air force but now dons the 121lbs jet suit, completing many astonishing individual flights . Popular plane: The 1943 Spitfire has been a popular part of the annual 'fly-in' at Bex airfield since its first appearance at the event in 1976 . It is the latest in a series of . astonishing stunts mr Rossy, 53, has done in formation having flown . alongside 1940s’ passenger aircraft Breitling Douglas DC-3 and also with . two L-39c Albatros Jets. His custom made jet-propelled winged . invention allowed him to fly beside the Spitfire at high speeds above . the stunning Swiss mountains. Operated by the Old Flying Machine Company, the original wartime MH343 is perhaps the most famous of all Spitfires still flying today. It was built in 1943 at Vickers, Castle Bromwich in West Midlands and is completely original and never fully rebuilt. Rossy flew fighter jets for the Swiss air force for 17 years and since he created his flight suit in 2006 he became the first and only man in the history of aviation to fly with a jet-propelled wing according to his website. The suit weighs almost 121lbs and has a wing span of 6ft 6in. What a view: Rossy said that the technology of his jet suit has become so reliable that when flying he can relax and take in the view . His invention has now been refined, so 'all he has is an altimeter for safety, and a tiny throttle control in his hand'. Rossy’s . website said he 'has always dedicated all his free time to flight and . experimented with all its forms', creating a harness with inflatable . wing panels that he subsequently developed into a rigid wing with four . engines.

Prince Harry spent yesterday signing forms to ensure he receives a £200-a-week bonus for flying  combat missions against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The tax-free gratuity – awarded to all troops in the war zone – will be added to the £38,931 captain’s salary the Prince receives for piloting an Apache helicopter gunship. But there is little chance that Harry will be able to spend the extra cash on Christmas presents – the bonus is paid at the end of a tour of duty, and the Prince is not expected to return home until January. Britain's Prince Harry inspects the weaponry he will be using to shoot Taliban insurgents with from the powerful Apache helicopter . Back in action: Prince Harry is shown the inside of an Apache by a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Concentration: Harry will be operating as a co-pilot gunner while part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps . The so-called Operational Allowance is paid at a rate of £29.02 for every day served in the war zone. Harry, . 27 – known as Captain Wales to his colleagues – arrived in Afghanistan . on Thursday night as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, . Army Air Corps. Another . Apache pilot said: ‘Each time we serve in Afghanistan, it is for four . months – and no holidays in Britain, or Las Vegas, while we’re there. We . get a lot of stick from the soldiers on the ground because their tours . last six months rather than four, but our jobs are more mentally . demanding.

He was mocked after winning an award for his skills on a course in Arizona. The pilot added: ‘Before his training out there, nobody had heard of an award for best gunner. So the joke ran that it was made up by the Americans just for him.’ Last night, Harry was completing his RSOI . (Reception, Staging, Onward-Movement and Integration) training at Camp .

Fun times: Prince Harry along with friends and females partied in an exclusive, heavily guarded, VIP Bungalow at Wet Republic in Las Vegas . Anyone who sees a suspicious object is responsible for establishing a cordon and alerting the camp guards. Concerns that explosives will be smuggled into Bastion have triggered a security upgrade. More than 100 troops are on permanent guard, with military police and dogs on standby. To enhance Harry’s security, he will also be shadowed by close protection officers. They will eat in the same canteen and share the Prince’s accommodation. To guard against a terrorist attack by a Taliban undercover agent, Afghan troops are not allowed near him. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that a threat assessment had been undertaken prior to Harry’s deployment – to ensure his presence in Helmand would not put him or his colleagues at greater risk.","Weekly bonus will be added to the captain's £38,931 salary .

Courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars while others send down as many as 90 per cent, a new 'leniency league table' reveals today. The table, which is based on official Ministry of Justice figures, shows an astonishing variation in how Crown Courts deal with convicted burglars. It comes just days after Judge Peter Bowers, sitting at Teesside Crown Court, sparked outrage by praising a housebreaker for his 'courage'. Lenient: Courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars . But the table reveals that 30 courts across England and Wales were more lenient towards burglars than Teesside in 2010. Leniency league: Tables are based on official Ministry of Justice figures . Based on the number of burglars given immediate jail sentences, Newport in South Wales was the most lenient court in the country with just under 58 per cent of the crimes ending in jail straight away. Portsmouth was little better at just over 58 per cent, with the figure for Basildon in Essex 59 per cent. But in stark contrast, judges in leafy Dorchester in Dorset were the toughest in 2010, handing down immediate jail sentences in more than 90 per cent of burglary cases. Chichester in West Sussex was the second strictest Crown Court on housebreakers with an 88 per cent prison sentence rate. Four other courts - in Northampton, Warwick, Derby and Ipswich - handed out immediate jail sentences in more than 85 per cent of cases. Last night, Tory MP Philip Davies, who unearthed the figures through Parliamentary questions, called on new Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to investigate. Mr Davies said: 'What this table reveals is a map showing burglars the best places to get caught if they want to avoid being sent down. 'I am astonished that one court jails nine out of ten while others are sending not much more than one in two burglars to their just deserts.' Yorkshire MP Mr Davies last week branded Judge Bowers 'an idiot' after he gave burglar Richard Rochford, 26, a suspended sentence after commenting about the amount of courage he believed it took to enter someone's house. Mr Davies said that he was particularly worried that 30 courts were more lenient than Teesside in 2010. Controversy: Judge Peter Bowers, left, sparked outrage month when . he praised burglar Richard Rochford's, right, 'courage' for breaking into three . homes . Tougher laws: Patrick Mercer is Tory MP for Newark and an ex Army colonel . In 1999, the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went to burgle his farm. Quite rightly, Mr Martin was prosecuted and served time in prison but the case became a cause celebre. Last Sunday, Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey from Leicestershire used a legally-held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who are alleged to have broken into their property. Two of them were wounded and the Ferries were held and questioned by police for more than two days before being released at the behest of the Crown Prosecution Service. Now, the two cases are very different, but there is one important similarity – the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way I believe that it should. In 2004, I initiated a Private Members' Bill that would have solved the problem. After the Martin case, there had been a very important change in civil law. Brendan Fearon, my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary, attempted to sue Mr Martin for the injuries that he caused. As civil law then stood, he would have to prove that Mr Martin had used 'unreasonable force'. Very quickly, though, the government  of the day amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase 'grossly disproportionate' force. My Bill was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law. Dominic Grieve, the then Shadow Attorney General, drafted a simple amendment which would have  the effect of giving ordinary householders the protection of the 'grossly disproportionate' proviso. Legal protection: Brendan Fearon, right, attempted to sue Tony Martin, left . It seemed at one stage that the Bill had the support of Tony Blair and the then Met Police Commissioner. Brendan Fearon even told my local newspaper that such a change in the law would deter him from breaking and entering in future. The whole issue was immensely popular. My Bill was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery  from the Labour Party. I was delighted, then, when the Conservative manifesto in 2010 said: 'We will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend themselves against intruders in their own homes.' Such promises were not contained in the Coalition Agreement although the Coalition has tweaked the law a little further. But it's cases such as that of the Ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now. This need can only be underlined by the extraordinary statement from Judge Peter Bowers last week who apparently told an offender that 'it takes a huge amount of courage ... for somebody to burgle somebody's house'. It is an astounding statement and the Prime Minister, absolutely properly, condemned it completely. But he also went on to say 'that's why this Government is changing the law to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars'. Really? It's two years later and yet we still do not have the 'grossly disproportionate' phrase enshrined in criminal law. Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were held for more than two days by police . I don't want householders to be given a licence to butcher intruders in their homes, but I do want normal people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and  not on that of the criminals. I also want the police and the CPS to be confident about not putting people like the Ferries through days of anguish when such anguish should be reserved for offenders. When they were in Opposition, the Tories seemed very clear about what needed to be done. Indeed, many of my Bill's greatest supporters are now in power. Yet, something is stopping them from putting their earlier words into action. Dithering doesn't deter. The Government needs to listen, not  just to decent people, but to burglars like Brendan Fearon  and change the law now.

The Ohio parents of Olympic gold medalist Tianna Madison have filed a $50,000 lawsuit against her, saying she falsely spread stories they had been selfish and bullying and cheated her financially causing her bankruptcy. Elyria residents Robert and Jo Ann Madison filed the libel, slander and defamation lawsuit on Thursday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Cleveland. They say they've been loving, supportive and generous parents. The lawsuit, which also names her husband, John Bartoletta, reportedly says Madison and Bartoletta have repeatedly made false statements since March to the media. Tianna Madison runs at the 2012 London Olympics: The gold-medal winning athlete is being sued by her parents for allegedly spreading falsehoods about her childhood . The complaint alleges that Madison falsely said her parents mismanaged her finances and knowingly allowed a boy who had molested her in the past to enter their home. Tianna Madison was on the winning 4x100-meter relay track team at the Summer Olympics in London. She won the gold with Allyson Felix, Bianca Knight and Carmelita Jeter in world record time. The parents' lawsuit seeks more than $25,000 each in compensatory and punitive damages. Madison did not return to her hometown of Elyria, Ohio following her record-setting performance in London. Her parents held a rally for their daughter in Elyria in July before the start of the Olympics, but she did not attend. At the event Mrs Madison said: 'We've been extremely busy for this and . in our personal lives as well. I'm really on an emotional rollercoaster . myself.' Mr Madison said his daughter had 'been working on this for 12 years, and it’s here'. They also travelled to London to see their daughter win gold. Jo Ann and Robert Madison are suing their daughter for $25,000 worth of damages after they say that she spread lies about her upbringing . Jo Ann Madison said in the complaint that she and her husband have . spent around $100,000 supporting their daughter and do not recognise the claims she is making against them in the media. The parents claim that their daughter and . her husband, have repeatedly published false . and defamatory statements in media outlets. Brian Butler who is the spokesman for Tianna Madison and John Bartoletta said that his clients would not be commenting publicly on the lawsuit. 'This should be a time for not just Tianna, but her family to celebrate all she has gone through and her winning a gold medal,' said Butler to the Chronicle and Telegram. 'That is what she is going to focus on at this time.' He added that despite the action against Madison and Bartoletta, all the couple wanted to do was to celebrate her recent Olympic success. 'And, I think, she is trying to take some time to enjoy the fact that she won an Olympic gold medal,' said Butler. Tianna Madison and her husband John Bartoletta. The complaint against Madison alleges that she falsely said her parents mismanaged her finances and knowingly allowed a boy who had molested her in the past to enter their home . Jo Ann and Robert Madison's attorney, Scott Schooler said that despite the lawsuit, the couple only want to reunite with their daughter. 'They are not seeking any financial gain,' said Schooler. 'At the end of the day, they would like to restore their relationship with their daughter. 'Beyond that, I am not going to comment on the parameters of any possible resolution.' Schooler said that his clients wanted to use this lawsuit as a method of getting their daughters attention. 'It was a wake-up call for Tianna to really look at the entire situation and look at what exactly is going on,' he said. 'Hopefully, she will realize there is some importance in having a relationship with her parents.' Addressing the allegation that they let a child mollestor into the family home, Schooler said the Madisons have no evidence that she was ever abused. 'But secondly, assuming that fact is true, the parents had no knowledge this had ever happened,' he said. 'She did not disclose this to her parents.' Tianna Madison of the United States (1st left) bursts out of the blocks in the Women's 100m Final at the London 2012 Olympic Games . In a CNN interview last week, Tianna referenced the alleged molestation, but insisted that she was not using it as a sob story. The breakdown in communications between the Madisons and their daughter began on March 17th when Bartoletta indicated that he and Tianna were planning to sue them for mismanaging her finances. He also said that he was going to hire a bodyguard to protect his wife - but to date no such lawsuit has been filed. The Madisons lawsuit contends that their daughters behaviour changed after her marriage and that she sent them a text on August 11th outlining plans to reveal their controlling attitude towards her. Jo Ann and Robert Madison attended a July rally in their home town of Elyria, Ohio to support their daughters Olympic efforts . This contrasts strongly with a July rally that the Madisons held in Elyrian to support the Olympic efforts of their daughter - which Tianna did not attend. 'When Tianna was young, and Christina, we trained them to read the word, love the Lord, love people, take care of people, take care of your community and the community would give back to you,' said Robert Madison during the meeting. 'When you train them this way, how to do their studies and have a good work ethic, it carries over into their athletics and academics.' Madison is reportedly focused on training for a tryout with the U.S. bobsled team next month. 'It was totally John's idea and I'm somewhat of a daredevil,' Madison told Cleveland.com. 'We're all-in. We're going to become students of the sport, and we're going to try to shock the world.'","Robert and Jo Ann Madison are suing their gold medal winning daughter Tianna Madison for $25,000 each for defamation, slander and libel .

But while most parents just tell them off if they indulge a little too much, Jack Cooper's parents have had to put him on a lifetime ban of junk food - because he can't stop eating. Doctors have diagnosed a rare condition - Prader-Willi syndrome - which leaves the five-year-old with an uncontrollable appetite. Jack Cooper's Prader-Willi syndrome leaves the five-year-old with an insatiable appetite and his mother Alison having to carefully monitor his diet . Mother Alison, 35, can't have snacks in the house, because he'll simply devour them. And she has to carefully control his calories to prevent him becoming morbidly obese. Jack, from Hilton, Burton, Staffordshire, never feels full. The condition means he'll simply carry on eating. Sufferers' obsession with food usually starts between three and five years old. 'Jack is very interested in food and at times needs to be distracted to get off the topic,' said Alison. 'But whatever you give him he will eat, so I have to be very firm. 'We have no snacks whatsoever between meals - never. No crisps, biscuits, cake, chocolate or sweets.' Jack cannot be trusted to have just one or two sweets - his condition means he will continue eating and eating . She said: 'The doctors were trying to find out what was wrong. I didn't have the early joy of having a new baby. It was a big shock.' Jack was fed through a tube to try to build up his strength - he weighed in at just 6lb, despite being two weeks overdue. Experts then noticed he had poor muscle tone as well as undescended testicles. It was when Jack was a week old that a doctor first mentioned Prader-Willi syndrome. Alison said: 'I remember thinking ""what a ridiculous sounding name"". I couldn't believe it. 'When I looked at my baby I saw my beautiful boy.' She received the diagnosis when Jack was five weeks old, with doctors confirming he had a genetic condition which affects just one in 20,000 people in the UK. She added: 'As he got older it would affect his appetite so he was at risk of overeating and obesity. He would also be sterile. 'We were in such a massive state of shock. 'As I gave Jack his bottle in the hospital soon after, I was devastated to think that my son would not have children of his own.' Now Jack has mastered walking confidently he can do the five-minute journey to school without his walking frame. The next challenge is to work on his speech. Alison said: 'I'm a very optimistic person. I don't think ""why me?"" - I tend to think ""why not?"" 'He is my little boy at the end of the day. I'm proud of so much with Jack.'

Naked Rambler Stephen Gough - who has spent years in solitary confinement in a Scottish jail - was branded arrogant and self-indulgent by a sheriff after refusing to get dressed and go home to England. Gough, from Hampshire, was brought into a draughty courtroom naked but for a pair of handcuffs today to be quizzed on why he had refused social work and psychiatric help. The ex-marine was jailed for five months at Kirkcaldy Sheriff's Court, Fife, for committing a breach of the peace. Gough arrives at John O' Groats in 2004 after completing a 900-mile walk naked. Over the course of the journey Gough was arrested numerous times . He was found guilty of the offence last month after strolling naked near a swing park . where children were playing in Dunfermline, also in Fife, and refusing to . put on clothes. Sentence had been deferred for social workers to assess . whether he needed psychiatric intervention. His arrest in July came just three days after he had been freed from . prison in Perth, 30 miles to the north, after spending six years in . solitary for previous offences involving nakedness. Gough, 53, who insists he is not a naturist and claims his naked rambles . are 'a protest,' was initially removed from the dock after only five . minutes when he refused to sit down so his privates were hidden by the . wooden dock. He said: 'I just want to be treated like anybody else.' After he was brought back in, and agreed to sit, the court heard he had . refused to meet social workers and so no assessment was available. Prosecutor Brian Robertson said the Crown was prepared to help him go back to England if he co-operated. Mr Robertson said: 'The authorities are prepared to facilitate his . return home if his behaviour doesn’t cause alarm to the public.' Pictured behind bars in the nude: Gough leaving Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in July. He decided to represent himself rather than have a solicitor at his trial . Determined: Gough (pictured here with his girlfriend Melanie Roberts) has been jailed for five months for committing a breach of the peace . Sheriff James Williamson told Gough, who has refused legal . representation, said that he was concerned that he had not met or co-operated . with social workers drawing up the background report ordered. The sheriff said: 'Will you meet with them and assist them?' When Gough responded, 'No, not really', Sheriff Williamson said he had been left with no choice but to jail him for five months. The sentence was backdated until July 20th, the date of his arrest, . meaning Gough will be freed again before Christmas. If he wins 50 . percent time off for good behaviour - unlikely unless he drops his . protest - he could be out in three weeks. He is likely to serve his sentence in Edinburgh’s tough Saughton Prison. Sheriff Williamson told Gough he realised his motives for refusing to . get dressed were not 'sinister,' but slammed him for his refusal to . co-operate with the preparation of a social background report. He said: 'I had hoped it [the report] would assist me in dealing with . you without sending you back to prison - but you leave me no choice. 'The police officers who arrested you told you that if you carried on . your journey you would pass a playground occupied by children. Unshaven: Gough pictured in July as he arrived at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court after being arrested for walking around naked . 'You were given three options - one, change direction, two, cover your . private parts, or three, enter a police van which would take you around . the playpark and release you on your way at the other side. 'Despite that, you refused, which showed disregard for other members of . the public, in particular children who have the right not to see naked . men. 'It shows arrogance. 'That self-indulgence carries on today. 'I have no other alternative option but to impose a custodial sentence.' Gough, of Chamberlain Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, now has 18 convictions for nakedness. He first achieved notoriety during a naked walk from Land’s End to John O’Groats in 2003. He went on to be repeatedly arrested and jailed for walking naked, and refusing to get dressed. He had tasted only minutes of freedom - usually being re-arrested at the . prison gates for being naked - until his release from on July 17th. Earlier this month Gough’s former partner Alison Ward, the mother to his . two children, Kiana, 16 and Yarin, 14, said she could not comprehend why he had given up family life, and knowing his children, simply to . walk around naked. She said: 'I don’t think Steve is a bad person, but he’s made bad decisions. 'I feel very sad for him, for what he’s given up. 'He lost his . relationship with me. He has two beautiful children who are a real joy, . but he hasn’t been a father to them. 'The price he’s paid for his determination to go naked is too high. 'When I told Steve, ‘You can’t see the kids if you’re going to go naked’, he said, ‘Right, I won’t see them. 'He chose his cause over his children and he’s continued to do so.' A Crown Office spokesman said: 'The actions of the accused made his arrest and prosecution necessary. 'Mr Gough intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents. 'The evidence in this case clearly established that despite repeated police requests not to do so, he was determined to deliberately walk naked past a busy children's play-park in Fife.

Sentenced: William MacKenzie punched and kicked protected birds of prey and scared them with a petrol-powered lawnmower . As the owner of a respected bird sanctuary, William MacKenzie displayed his snowy owls and hawks at country shows and appeared on the BBC to discuss his devotion to his birds. But when out of public view – or at least when he thought he was – the 68-year-old used a brutal method to rule his roost. After being filmed by neighbours kicking and punching birds he kept in his garden, MacKenzie was this week banned from keeping animals for life. And despite claiming that his birds  were ‘like my children’, he was told by a magistrate that he had caused them fear and distress. MacKenzie kept 26 birds including a snowy owl, African spotted eagle owl and a Harris hawk, at his home in Shrewsbury. Over a two-year period, horrified neighbours filmed him abusing and tormenting the birds which he kept on perches and in cramped cages in his back garden. He was once seen slapping a barn owl in the face before kicking it into a corner of the garden. He was also filmed hitting  and kicking an eagle owl and holding a barn owl by its wing before hurling it to the ground. In another clip, MacKenzie can be seen using his lawnmower to scare the birds by revving it close to a stack of cages. Two distressed barn owls desperately flap their wings as the blades of the mower come within inches of their perches. At Shrewsbury magistrates’ court on Wednesday, MacKenzie was convicted of nine animal welfare charges and sentenced to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. He was also found guilty of five . offences of causing fear and distress to the birds while using the . lawnmower and was banned from keeping any animals for life, ordered to . wear an electronic tag for six months and charged £500 in costs.

He told the court: ‘In my opinion they are not just suffering physically but also suffering distress and anxiety.’ After the verdict, RSPCA inspector .

Elocution lessons lowered her 'too feminine' voice and power suits gave her an authoritative edge. And research shows that women are emulating some of Margaret Thatcher's most well-known traits, in a bid to get ahead in the workplace. Looking to the 1980s Prime Minister, whose tough image earned her the nickname the 'Iron Lady', females are adopting throatier voices, wearing longer hemlines and displaying less cleavage. Findings suggest that 56.7 per cent . dress more conservatively to boost their careers while almost have half . perfect a more masculine tone. Now . the trend is set to grow thanks to Phyllida Lloyd's biopic, in which . Meryl Streep replicates Thatcher's iconic look and mannerisms on the big . screen. Commenting on the survey carried out by One Poll for Business Environment, company CEO David Saul said: 'As the first major female leader of our . times, it’s not completely unexpected that today’s women should want to . emulate her in various ways – intentionally or not. 'Whilst it is still widely reported that . women still have some way to go in terms of boardroom equality, . evidence suggests they are well on their way to the dizzy heights of . ‘Thatcherdom’ once again.' In preparation for the film Iron Lady, costume designer Consolata Boyle, . describes Thatcher's . image as 'fascinating'. Boyle studied patterns and pieces from some of the former Prime Minister's favourite designers including Aquascutum and Jean Muir, before designing Streep's costumes. As . the story unfolds we learn that Thatcher's style didn't emerge fully . formed, but was gradually refined by image consultants, including . television producer Gordon Reece, who trained her for the camera in . 1974. Following his advice, . she refrained from wearing hats - although she refused to give up her . pearls, a gift from her husband, Denis, when their twins were born in . 1953. Taking inspiration from Thatcher, millionaire handbag entrepreneur Anya Hindmarch told Vogue: 'I am a lifelong fan of Margaret Thatcher. 'She was very much part of the get-up-and-go spirit and was a big influence on me and many others at the time I started my business. 'She is a strong and charismatic woman and was apparently a terrible flirt which I admire. 'Margaret Thatcher dressed as a strong woman and developed a style that was very much her own brand. The hair, the bow, the pearls and the handbag all became iconic.' Despite flaunting more masculine characteristics, findings also suggest that . modern businesswomen don't forget the power of the feminine touch. Leading the way: Meryl Streep playing Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady dressed in one of many power suits . More than two thirds of the 2,000 surveyed (64.3 per cent) confessed to wearing . more-make up to the office, perhaps an indication that whilst they value . the ‘power effect’, they . realise the female touch can bring about success in other ways.

A recluse failed to notify the authorities after his elder brother died and lived with the corpse for three years, continuing to claim his dead sibling's benefits. Alistair Brown fraudulently claimed more than £38,000 before the gruesome case came to light - when firefighters discovered his brother John's 'badly decomposed' foot sticking out from under a bed. The firemen had been called out to the flat the brothers shared in Denny, Stirlingshire, after reports of a burst pipe, Alloa Sheriff Court was told. Recluse: Alistair Brown lived with the body of his elder brother John for three years and fraudulently claimed benefits totalling more than £38,000 . They notified police, who arrested Brown, 61, at a nearby hotel. He told officers that his brother 'had not been keeping well'. John Brown's foot was discovered in December 2010 - three years after he is believed to have died, aged 69. Ann MacNeill, prosecuting, told the court that the authorities had been to inspect the flat on a number of occasions before the gruesome discovery. She said: 'On December 20, 2010 the remains of a dead male were found by members of the fire brigade called to inspect water running in the flat. 'The crews entered a bedroom and found furniture on the bed. 'There was a human foot coming out from the bottom of the bed and police were immediately called. 'The accused was traced by police on December 21, 2010 at the Royal Hotel in Bonnybridge playing in a domino tie. 'He attended at the police station and said that he had been residing with his brother, who had not been keeping well.' The depute fiscal added: 'The body was in such a state of decomposition that the cause of death could not be attained. 'It was later found that there had been no ill-will but that the accused had used a bank machine to remove money from the dead man’s bank account.' Brown, now of Falkirk, admited concealing his brother’s body and continuing to withdraw the deceased man’s benefit payments, totalling £38,237.84, to which he was not entitled. The court heard that John Brown was thought to have died in mid-December 2007. He had problems with alcohol and had suffered a number of strokes. Defence agent Gordon Addison described the case as 'tragic and unusual'. 'The body was in such a state of decomposition that the cause of death could not be attained' He said the brothers were 'very close' - and neither of the men had any contact with other members of their family, including John’s two grown-up children. Mr Addison added: 'We all have to cope with death in our own way but most of us have family and friends to help. If you have no-one to turn to the consequences can be out of the ordinary. 'My client is quiet, introverted, lonely, and shy, and his actions have had tragic personal and awkward legal ramifications. 'Ian was his last living brother and the last contact he had with his family. No-one had spoken to either of them for three to four years prior to the man’s death. 'After his partner’s death, Ian was living alone. Alistair was a janitor but gave up his job and went to live with his brother to look after him. 'Ian was largely housebound and the accused dealt with all his needs, such as shopping. 'On the day he died, Ian had not been feeling well and Alistair attended to his needs. 'He then went to the pub and came back to find his brother dead.' Mr Addison said that Brown had suffered what social workers have described as an ‘acute and unusual grief reaction’. 'He had no-one to turn to and knew he would be in trouble,' the defence agent added. 'He felt he was in a hole he could not get out of.' Mr Addison said Brown would have been entitled to various benefits himself but never applied to the State. Both men lived off John Brown's benefits. Sheriff Kenneth McGowan ordered Brown to perform 240 hours of unpaid work, saying it was in the 'public interest' not to jail him. He told Brown: 'The circumstances are bizarre.They do not fall into a simple category for sentencing. 'If the court was to approach this as a £38,000 fraud then you would be going to jail for a significant period of time. 'But I am willing to accept that the true loss to the State is substantially lower than that amount as you would have been entitled to funds of your own. 'Therefore, it is clear that the net loss will be substantially less than £38,000. 'I believe that the public interest will be served by a community-based disposal.'","Alistair Brown failed to notify the authorities after his brother John died .

Pippa Reed, pumped air into the lungs of 12-week-old Jacob after he stopped breathing while under sedation. 'Within 15 or 20 minutes of him being sedated he almost stopped breathing and his lips went blue,' the 25-year-old said. Pippa Reed feeds her son Jacob in hospital. He was born 12 weeks early . 'I gave him the kiss of life. It was an immediate reaction. My little boy needed help and I had air in my lungs and just gave it to him. 'I knew what I had to do and I did it. If I had not it would probably have been worse.' Mrs Reed, a former St John Ambulance member, sprang to assist Jacob when he got into trouble after being prepared for an MRI scan intended to check his brain function at Queens Hospital in Burton, Staffordshire. Nurses rushed to prepare emergency care and alerted the crash team before one gave the newborn oxygen. Jacob eventually returned to the children's ward after being stabilised but has since been plagued by falling oxygen levels and poor breathing. Jacob, pictured, stopped breathing after he was sedated in hospital for an MRI scan . He is now receiving antibiotics for a slight chest infection and is being closely monitored in an oxygen-filled incubator in the neonatal ward. 'I'm heartbroken it's happened but with time he will get better, I know he will,' said Mrs Reed from Stretton, Staffordshire. 'It's just a mother's intuition. I can't put my finger on it.' Jacob has continually defied the odds since he was born on February 29 at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital. He was 12 weeks early and weighed just 2lb 10.5oz and was given a lowly three per cent chance of survival. Keeping watch: Pippa trained with St John Ambulance so was able to spring into action when Jacob's lips turned blue . But Jacob has clung to life, amazing those around him by defying a seemingly endless series of life-threatening health problems. 'That such a little person can go through all this and still fight on is incredible,' said Mrs Reed, who has learned to cope with adversity on an almost a daily basis. 'It's very hard, but this is how my life is at the moment.' Jacob was then transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital before being moved to Burton’s Queen’s Hospital on April 12. He now weighs 5lb 9oz and has an umbilical hernia that will need to be treated. He also has liver problems. Mrs Reed has had to cope with this week's trauma on her own because her husband, Tim, 32, has been suffering a cold, an infection which prevents him from seeing his son. 'Even more has been on me,' said Mrs Reed, 'but as long as my men get better that’s all that matters.'",Pippa Reed pumped air into lungs of son Jacob after he was born 12 weeks premature on February 29 .

Women are increasingly starting to smoke at younger ages, according to a large international study which found 'alarming patterns' of tobacco use. While the study, published in The Lancet medical journal, found male smokers far outnumbered females in the 16 countries surveyed, women were picking up the habit earlier. 'Many factors contribute to these changes, including the targeting of tobacco products to . women via multiple media outlets, such as the cinema, and cigarette designs that ease the transition from experimentation to established use,' they wrote. 'Low prices and absence of effective counter-marketing campaigns also contribute to high rates of uptake.' The study also found two fifths of men in developing countries still smoke or use tobacco and that these countries had low quit rates. There are wide differences in the . rates of smoking between genders and nations, as well as major . disparities in access to effective anti-smoking treatments. 'Although 1.1 billion people have . been covered by the adoption of the most effective tobacco control . policies since 2008, 83 percent of the world's population are not . covered by two or more of these policies,' said study leader Gary . Giovino of the University at Buffalo in New York. Measures . include legislation banning smoking in public places, imposing . advertising bans and requiring more graphic health warnings on cigarette . packets. The findings come as the world's leading tobacco firms, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a crucial legal appeal in Australia this week against the introduction of plain tobacco packaging. Australia's planned 'no logo' laws are in line with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and are being watched closely by Britain, Norway, New Zealand, Canada and India, which are considering similar measures. Tobacco kills up to half of its users, according to the WHO. Smoking causes lung cancer, often fatal, and other chronic respiratory diseases. It is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the world's number one killers. Other forms of tobacco use include snuff or chewing tobacco. Proportion of adults aged 15 years or older who currently smoke cigarettes and other tobacco products . Matthew L. Myers, president of the . U.S.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the study 'underscores . the enormity of the global tobacco epidemic'. 'Without . urgent action, tobacco use will claim 1 billion lives this century,' he . said, urging poorer countries to 'act now and address a crisis they can . ill afford.'Using data . from Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) carried out between 2008 and . 2010, Giovino's team compared patterns of tobacco use and cessation in . people aged 15 or older from 14 low- and middle-income countries. They . included data from Britain and the United States for comparison. They . found disproportionately high rates of smoking among men - at an . average 41 per cent versus 5 per cent in women - and wide variation in . smoking prevalence, ranging from about 22 per cent of men in Brazil to . more than 60 per cent in Russia. Rates . of female smoking ranged from 0.5 percent in Egypt to almost 25 percent . in Poland. Women in Britain and the United States also had high smoking . rates, at 21 percent and 16 percent respectively. The . study found that around 64 percent of tobacco users smoke manufactured . cigarettes, although loose-leaf chewing tobacco and snuff were . particularly common in India and Bangladesh.With . an estimated 301 million tobacco users, China has more than any other . country, closely followed by India with almost 275 million.

Male members of President Francois Hollande's socialist cabinet will be taught how to avoid 'stereotyping and inappropriate language' when talking about women. The idea is the brainchild of new Women's Rights minister and staunch feminist Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. It comes after a recent blunder by agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll, who told L'Express magazine: 'Out of 15 people in my cabinet, seven are women.

Two months earlier, housing Minister Cecile Duflot was wolf-whistled by men in parliament after she walked into the chamber wearing a knee-length dress. Former sports minister Chantal Jouanno also said she avoided wearing skirts altogether for fear of attracting smutty comments.

The wife of outspoken Labour MP Austin Mitchell has defended her husband against claims that his Twitter outburst at a Tory MP proves he is a sexist. Mr Mitchell, who has been an MP since 1977, admonished chick-lit author and politician Louise Mensch for contradicting her husband about why she was quitting parliament. The left-winger MP tweeted: ‘Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics.’ Austin Mitchell's wife Linda McDougall said she was standing by her man after he took to Twitter to tell Louise Mensch to 'shut up' Mr Mitchell’s remarks provoked fury and calls for the MP to be expelled from the party. Critics – including his wife, the journalist Linda McDougall who describes herself as a hardline feminist - called for Mr Mitchell to withdraw the tweet. But Mr Mitchell’s wife insisted her husband is not a ‘dinosaur’. She told the Daily Mail that she blamed herself as she had alerted her husband to the article about Mrs Mensch after she ‘dispatched him to fetch the Sunday papers’. Ms McDougall said: ‘We were sitting across from each other on the train and before I knew it he was tweeting it on his I-phone.’ Mr Mitchell tweeted telling Ms Mensch she was wrong to contradict her husband . The broadcaster and filmmaker also revealed that she knew Mrs Mensch after  ‘I employed her to do a film’ about some political awards. She added: ‘She was very nice and I really liked her. This has not changed my opinion of her. Austin has long been a great admirer of hers.’ She added that while she did not approve of the tweet, she was standing by her man: ‘I am the Tammy Wynette of Grimbsy. Austin is the kindest and hardest working man. ‘I wouldn’t describe him as a feminist as he likes his jokes but I am proud of him. No one would stand up more for the hard-pressed women of Grimsby than Austin.’ Ms Mensch was forced to deny allegations made by her husband Peter in a newspaper interview that she quit her role as an MP because she didn't think she would win at the next election . Ms McDougall – who said she had been a feminist since she ‘emerged from the womb 71 years ago’ - said she was upset at the Twitter abuse aimed at her husband. ‘About 80 per cent of the Tweets have been ageist. It may be terribly upsetting for Louise Mensch but it’s OK for us elderly.’ Despite the criticism from all sides, Mr Mitchell, issued an even more inflammatory tweet yesterday. He said on the social networking site: ‘Calm down dears. Irony may be a low form of wit but it's clearly above my level. And yours. So my wife has banned me from tweeting today.’ He added: ‘Wife,three daughters,one granddaughter and Labour press office all demand that I withdraw my tweet. No chance of front bench now.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Austin Mitchell has made clear the tweet was a joke, not a serious comment. It’s not funny, it’s understandable that people find it offensive, and it is not the view of the Labour Party.’ Mrs Mensch also called on Ed Miliband to ‘repudiate’ Mr Mitchell, pointing out Tory MP Aidan Burley’s twitter tirade at the Olympics Opening Ceremony as ‘leftie, mult-cultural clap trap’ had been called ‘idiotic’ by David Cameron. Mrs Mensch also took a swipe at deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman took to Twitter to say: ‘H Harman's silence speaks volumes. Don't talk to me about standing for women.’ Mrs Mensch took to Twitter to respond to her husbands claims in the interview . But Tory MP Nadine Dorries took a swipe at her former colleague, accusing Mrs Mensch of ‘deserting her post’. Ms Dorries said: ‘It’s disappointing that Louise did not do what every other MP has to do. The decent thing to do would have been to stick in there and battle to the end.’ The controversy started when Peter Mensch told a Sunday newspaper that his wife was quitting British politics because of ‘Louise’s belief that she was only going to be an MP for three more years.’ He said: ‘She thought, and I wasn't going to argue with her, that she'd get killed at the next election. So, to her, it seemed much more short-term than my job as a manager, which is going to go on for another 20 years. ‘And listen, they hadn't promoted her yet, and it's not like she thought she had a future because perhaps she felt she was too outspoken. She was doing her own thing regardless and maybe wasn't . 'Conservative party enough' to move up the food chain.’ Mrs Mensch, who is taking a job as a newspaper columnist in New York, took to Twitter to explain her side: ‘Can honestly say I had no fear whatsoever of defeat at next election since had already decided not to stand again,’ she tweeted. ‘However: nothing, repeat nothing, influenced decision to resign other than inability to hold family life together away from him.’ The seat of Corby is set for a byelection on 15 November 15.

'What I didn't realise is they don't act like 16 or 17-year-olds - they were more like 10 or 11-year-olds because they finished school at 11.' Hard work: Two of Thelma Madine's gypsy students cut out fabric for their wedding frocks . Mrs Madine launched her fashion academy in her Liverpool shop as a thank-you to the girls who have contributed to her success, selecting 10 inexperienced teenagers and endeavoring to teach them how to make a spectacular wedding dress of their own in just six months. She said: 'There are so many girls who want a job. Maybe they don't work because they've never had that opportunity. I really do want to do this. 'The travellers have helped put me where I am today and this is my way of giving something back.' But teaching the girls - whose progress is documented in Channel 4's upcoming spin-off, Thelma's Gypsy Girls - was much tougher than she had expected. As well as dealing with squabbles and excitability, Mrs Madine also found herself up against extraordinarily poor levels of numeracy and literacy - many of the girls struggled with the numbers on tape measures and were even unable to use calculators. Pink lady: Margaret Toohey, 16, says her boyfriend disapproves of her working but that Thelma has been like a second mother to her . She brought in a tutor to help the girls with their reading and writing, and stuck up paper clocks on the walls to help them recognise times. Since the girls are paid for their work, she also had to teach them about tax and national insurance. Mrs Madine soon realised that traveller girls are never expected to have jobs, rather that their lives are set on a path which includes only marrying young and having children. Many of their families and boyfriends even disapprove of the girls having jobs. The project is meant to teach the girls that having a trade is invaluable in life, however prescribed your destiny may be. Dressing up: Traveller student Bridget during one of her lessons with dressmaker Thelma Madine . Some students in the show include 16-year-old Irish traveller Margaret, who instantly makes an impression with her boisterous ways and wilful attitude; Bridget, an English traveller who was bullied at school and is keen to do well on the course; and Irish Shannon who is suspended from the course when she does something Thelma describes as 'pure evil'. Dress-making divas: Students Lilyann, left, and Kathleen, right, are two of Thelma's traveller students . Thelma Madine - who is not herself a gypsy, just a dressmaker whose clients happen, mostly, to be gypsies - has been running her dressmaking business, Nico, since 1998. She shot to fame after creating a wedding dress weighing 21-stone for a 15-year-old bride and attracting the attention of local Liverpudlian press and TV producers. Her success followed a period of turbulence which included being imprisoned for four months in 2001 after receiving a 12-month jail sentence for benefit fraud to the tune of £10,700 she committed for 11 months between 1996 and 1997.

We can come to terms with it. Terrible teeth? Tolerable. Big bottom? Bearable. But love handles are a different story entirely, it seems. Hard-to-shift fat on the hips is the biggest body hang-up among women, according to a study. Excess weight on the hips is our biggest body hang-up, topping the list above 'saddle-bags' (fatty outer thighs) and muffin-tops, according to a new survey. After those top three come bingo wings and inner thighs. The results reflect the changing shape of British women, with the 'apple' type - who store fat around the middle - now more common than big-bottomed 'pears'. Donnamarie McBride, co-founder of Harley Street cosmetic clinic Lovelite, said that more than two-thirds of women who come in for fat removal treatments want to target fat on their stomachs, hips and the sides of their torsos. And it seems that even celebrities with 'perfect' bodies are not immune to such feminine insecurities. Singer Mollie King of the Saturdays has admitted to being 'very self-conscious in a . bikini' and says she would never get her stomach out on stage. Made In Chelsea's . Binky Felstead has also spoken out about her body insecurities. The reality TV star revealed she doesn't like her 'tummy and love handles' and is currently . undergoing sessions of a non-invasive fat reduction treatment named Lipoglaze . to help with shifting the weight on these areas. The Saturdays' Mollie King, left, has revealed she is self-conscious about her stomach, while Cheryl Cole, right, is not completely happy with her legs . Meanwhile, pear-shaped women including Cheryl Cole are more concerned about their legs. The star said: 'I don't like my legs. I haven't got much of them for a . start. If I was dressing myself I'd probably cover them up.' American actress Katherine . Heigal has even admitted that her thighs are her 'obsession', saying: 'I always complexed about my . thighs. I think they're very fat. This is the only part of my body which . I have no control of. My thighs are my obsession.' Even Elle 'The Body' Macpherson is not immune to insecurities about her figure, admitting: 'It's taken me a long time to feel good about my body.

A couple were left fuming after their trim-looking five-year-old was branded overweight by school health officials - and they insist she won't be going on a diet. Ann and Matt James were amazed to be told their daughter Lily was too heavy after she was weighed as part of national child health checks. They said she was on the go 'non-stop' and was so small she wore clothes made for younger children. Trim: Little Lily James, who is five, has been branded overweight by school health officials despite weighing just 3st 3lbs. Her parents say she is 'on-the-go' non stop and wears clothes made for younger children . 'I was hopping mad when I read the letter,' said Mrs James. 'My friends were appalled a letter like this could be sent out.' The couple have called the verdict a 'joke' and challenged anyone looking at pictures of their daughter to say she looked unhealthy. Mr James, a house husband, added: 'There’s no way Lily is overweight. She’s very active and is on the go non-stop with her trampolining, running around and swimming. 'She will be six in November but still wears clothes for four to five-year-olds.' The couple also vowed not to put their daughter, a reception pupil at Green Meadow Primary in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on a diet for fear of sparking eating disorders in later life. Advice: A copy of the letter the school sent Lily's parents telling them she is 'in the overweight range' and explaining that there are 'small changes' they could make to help her eat well and be more active . Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS . Trust, which weighed Lily as part of the National Child Measurement . Programme, would not comment on her case but insisted the initiative was . a useful tool in fighting Britain’s rising weight problem. This isn't the first time parents of children who appear to be a healthy weight have been told their little ones are too fat. In April, the parents of Lacie-May Gray, the smallest . in her class, were warned of the 'serious implications' of her weight in . a stern letter from NHS bosses. The four-year-old, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, weighs just 3st 7lb. In the same month, the same thing . happened to four-year-old Sophie Kettle, from High Wycombe, . Buckinghamshire, who was declared 'obese' despite weighing just 2st . 13lbs. Upset: The couple vowed not to put their daughter, a reception pupil at Green Meadow Primary in Selly Oak, Birmingham, (pictured) on a diet for fear of sparking eating disorders in later life . The latest row . began when Mr James, 34, and Mrs James, 31, were sent a letter saying . Lily was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed 3st 3lbs. According . to the Body Mass Index Centile - the chart used to assess a child’s . weight and growth pattern - she had a score of 91, putting her in the . overweight category for her age and height. The letter went on to offer the couple a list of healthy eating and exercise schemes they could enrol her on. The . couple said Lily had a healthy diet of porridge for breakfast, fruit . mid-morning and then at school she had a cooked meal of meat and two . vegetables. 'She isn’t interested in pizza or junk food and prefers brown bread to white, hardly ever has sweets or cakes and when we had a barbecue recently only ate half a burger,' Mr James said. The National Child Measurement . Programme was set up in 2005 and brackets reception class and Year 6 . pupils according to whether they are underweight, healthy, overweight or . obese. Latest figures, . released last December for the 2010/11 school year, showed a rising . trend of obese Year 6 pupils - those aged ten or 11. A total of 19 per cent of Year 6 children were classed as obese, up from 18.7 per cent in 2009/10 and 17.5 per cent in 2006/7. But . the proportion of reception children who were obese in 2010/11 fell to . 9.4 per cent; against 9.8 per cent in 2009/10 and 9.9 per cent in . 2006/07. Mrs James said: 'There’s no way I’m putting Lily on a diet. That will make her grow up with an eating disorder and turn her anorexic.' A health trust spokesman said every child was weighed and measured in their reception class and again in Year 6. 'Today, one in three children aged between two and ten is overweight,' he said. 'The gradual increase in the number of children who are overweight means society has collectively become used to it. So it can be difficult to tell whether an individual child is clinically overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age. 'Research shows that if a child is . overweight now, they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an . adult, which can lead to health problems in later life. 'So the measurements are an important way of checking how a child is growing at crucial stages of their development.' NHS . Information Centre chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'More than a . million children in England are measured as part of the National Child . Measurement Programme. 'It shows that, while the proportion of four-to-five year olds who are obese has fallen, the opposite has happened among ten and 11-year-olds.'","Parents say she's always on-the-go and wears clothes for younger children .

A former high school football star who was wrongfully accused of rape and imprisoned for six years and monitored for another four will now get his long-awaited shot at the NFL. Long Beach Poly High School grad Brian Banks is slated to audition for a number of teams, including the Seattle Seahawks, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, and Miami Dolphins. The player, who had been offered a scholarship to USC at the time of the wrongful accusation, said he’s excited for what the future holds, and that his ‘mouth hurts from smiling so much.’ Celebrating: Brian Banks reacts with his mother, Leomia Myers, outside court last week after his rape conviction was dismissed . Training hard: Banks has been training since October in hopes of auditioning for the NFL - he now has four try-outs . The player has been training nonstop since October, and told ESPN: ‘After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.’ Even if Banks’ NFL dream doesn’t come into fruition, the exonerated high school graduate has a job offer from the Arizona Diamondbacks. Attorneys representing 26-year-old Banks said their client is entitled to $100 a day for every day of his incarceration under state law. Banks was exonerated last week after his accuser, Wanetta Gibson, admitted she had made up the whole story of sexual assault ten years ago and had been reluctant to come forward because of a large settlement she received from the school district. The Los Angeles Times has reported that Gibson also had been worried it would affect her relationship with her two children, now aged four and five. Freed: A one-time promising football star, Brian Banks, weeps after his rape conviction was dismissed in court. He was just 16 when a childhood friend accused him of kidnapping and raping her at school . Banks, a once sought-after linebacker, collapsed in tears in the courtroom on Thursday when his case was moved to dismissal. Banks' exoneration came after Gibson sent him a friend request on Facebook when he left prison in February of 2011 with a tag. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be bygones'. Banks's lawyer, Justin Brooks, told KPCC that Gibson and Banks met and she was caught on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no rape, and would help him clear his record. Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she would have to return a $1.5million payment she won after her mother brought a suit against Long Beach Schools. She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me, I don't want to have to pay it back.' New start: Banks, with his attorneys Justin Brooks and Alissa Bjerkhoel, after the charges are dismissed. It comes after the accuser contacted him to say the rape did not happen . A life shattered: Banks had been recruited by colleges and offered scholarships before the accusation . The 26-year-old has said he does not plan to pursue legal action against his accuser, and Los Angeles prosecutors have said it is unlikely Gibson will be charged with making false accusations, saying it would be a tough case to prove. Banks was jailed after Gibson accused him of rape in 2002, when he was just 16 and being heavily recruited by a number of colleges, including USC, which had offered him a full scholarship. He was on the way to the school office to talk about his college applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went to a stairwell to make out, Brooks told KPCC. He pointed out that they did not have intercourse. He explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on bad terms. She later accused him of kidnapping her, dragging her across the school and raping her in the stairwell. Investigators tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been consensual. Remorse: Wanetta Gibson, pictured, contacted Banks to say he had not raped her - but would not admit it to prosecutors as she feared she would have to pay back $1.5 million won in a case against the school . Scene: Gibson had claimed Banks had kidnapped her while at Long Beach Polytechnic High School in California, before raping her. In fact, they never had sex . Yet his then lawyer encouraged the promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted. Expecting he would serve just 18 months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest. He was in prison for six years. While there, his case was taken on by Brooks, a lawyer who head the California Innocence Project. 'Brian’s story is so compelling, and his case for innocence so clear, we knew we had to take this on,' said Justin Brooks. 'Brian lost a huge part of his life when he was unjustly sent to prison.' Moving on: Brian Banks, pictured left and right, continues to train for a chance at a football career . Brooks said Banks has remained on probation under electronic monitoring, has had to register as a sex offender and has had trouble getting a job. After the exoneration on Thursday, Banks added: 'My only dream in the world is just to be free... For years, I felt like a toy with the switch cut off, sitting on the shelf.' Banks continues to train for what he hopes will be a future chance at a football career in the NFL. 'This is a kid who was a superstar,' Brooks added. 'He would be playing the NFL now if this hadn't happened.'","Brian Banks exonerated last week in decade-long rape case .

When it comes to attracting men, less is more where makeup is concerned. Almost three-quarters of British men say they prefer women to wear very little make-up - in the style of the Duchess of Cambridge rather than that of former TOWIE star Amy Childs - according to a poll. Almost three-quarters of British men say . they prefer women to wear very little make-up, in the style of the . Duchess of Cambridge, right, rather than former TOWIE girl Amy Childs, left. Although 93 per cent of men surveyed agreed a small amount of make-up could improve a woman's look, just a quarter (27 per cent) said they preferred the caked-on TOWIE image to the demure tones of the Duchess of Cambridge. Female stars including Holly Willoughby, Amanda Holden, Fearne Cotton . and Jools Oliver were highlighted as being particularly attractive in a . natural way. And Amy Childs, Lady Gaga, Tulisa and Carol Vorderman were deemed too heavily made-up by the majority of males polled. Interestingly men from the south were found to be the biggest advocates of the subtle look, while northern males confessed to being more attracted to women who liked wearing substantial makeup. TV presenter Holly Willoughby's natural look, left, was generally preferable to men than to the heavily made-up style of singer Tulisa, right . Too much foundation was viewed as the biggest turn off, closely followed by streaky fake tan, ridiculous false lashes and tiger-like false nails. Ironically, nearly half of the men polled (48 per cent) said they used beauty products including moisturiser, eye-rollers and teeth whitener in a bid to look their best for the ladies. A spokesman from RoxyPalace, the online casiono that conducted the survey of 800 men, said the results may show men to be less cynical than first thought. He said: 'Men are often accused of . preferring women who apply bold, eye-catching make-up, yet what our poll . has found is that for most too much slap is a reason to take a step . back. 'While nearly all . agreed that applying a little makeup could help accentuate a woman's . best features, the vast majority believed that less was more when it . came to presentation – which may be bad news for makeup manufacturers.' Most men surveyed felt Lady Gaga, left, wears too much make up, and that the understated style of Jamie Oliver's wife Jools is more attractive . He concluded: 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and there is no right or wrong amount of make-up to wear, but if you're out on the pull, particularly in the south of England, you may wish to ditch the make-up in the hunt for the dream man.' Natural? Pah! Looking this 'natural' takes just as long as looking 'unnatural', says Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon. But what men think of as 'natural' actually takes a lot of effort, according to one make-up expert. Lisa Potter-Dixon, Benefit's Head Makeup And Trend Artist, told MailOnline: 'So, boys, you may think my flawless skin and rosy cheeks were a gift from god....well, you are very, very wrong! 'The ""natural"" look takes just as long as the ""unnatural look"". 'You see, to get this face, we have prepped using a moisturiser, primed, using a primer and then perfected with a foundation, concealer, highlighter and powder! 'It's the precise and timely application of these products that creates our flawless looking skin. Then there's the blush. 'Getting this natural glow takes military application! 'It's all about the positioning of where you apply it; not too high, not too low. Not too round, not too angled! 'And did I mention that if you get your blusher wrong, you can't just rub it off, you have to take your entire face of make-up off and start again! 'I haven't even mentioned the monthly tinting, waxing and threading that our facial hair goes through to finish our looks. But that's another story! 'So boys, the truth is, being beautiful takes time. It's just a good job us girls have got it down to a tee.'","93 per cent agreed make-up improves a woman's appearance .
