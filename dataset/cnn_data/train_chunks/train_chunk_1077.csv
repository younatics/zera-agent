"A helicopter hovers over the hotel and in the next moment a trace of fire is seen hitting the roof. Seconds later a huge explosion rips apart the roof of the InterContinental, killing three Taliban suicide bombers who had launched a commando assault on the building. The siege, however, was still not over. Some hours later the last insurgent blew himself up in a hotel room. Officials said today that eleven civilians were killed in the assault that has sent shock waves through the Afghan capital. Scroll down for video . Engaged: A Nato helicopter fires a missile on the roof of the Intercontinental hotel in Kabul this morning . An explosion on the roof of the hotel lights up the night sky . As the sun came up, smoke still spewed from the devastated roof of the Intercontinental. The attack on a five-storey, Western-style hotel in the capital raised doubt about the ability of Afghan security forces to take charge of securing the nation from foreign combat forces. The assault began at around 10pm yesterday eight suicide attackers killed the guards and entered the building. During the next four hours, a number of workers were killed as the men stormed through the hotel, which sits on a hill overlooking the city. The 11 civilians killed included a judge from an unnamed province, five hotel workers and three Afghan policemen, Latifullah Mashal, the spokesman of the Afghan National Directorate for Securitym said. He said no foreigners were killed, but two were among 14 people wounded in the attack. He did not disclose their nationalities. One guest, named as Jawid, said he jumped out a one-story window to flee the shooting. 'I was running with my family,' he said. 'There was shooting. The restaurant was full with guests.'A police source said a wedding party was underway when the attack happened and that the death toll could have been much higher. Attack: Eleven Afghan civilians were killed when suicide bombers and heavily armed Taliban insurgents attacked the hotel . Target: The Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul is popular with foreigners and Afghan officials . The attackers were heavily armed with machine guns, anti-aircraft weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and grenade launchers, the Afghan officials said. Afghan police rushed to the scene and firefights broke out. ‘We were locked in a room. Everybody was shooting and firing,’ said Abdul Zahir Faizada, head of the local council in Herat province in western Afghanistan. I heard a lot of shooting.’ The attack occurred the day before a conference was scheduled in Kabul to discuss plans for Afghan security forces to take the lead for securing an increasing number of areas of the country between now and 2014 when international forces are expected to move out of combat roles. Afghans across the country were in the city to attend, although it's not known who was staying at the Inter-Continental. Nazar Ali Wahedi, chief of intelligence for Helmand province in the south who was attending the conference, called the assailants ‘the enemy of stability and peace’ in Afghanistan. ‘Our room was hit by several bullets,’ said Wahedi. ‘We spent the whole night in our room.’ U.S. Army Maj. Jason Waggoner, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Afghanistan, said the helicopters killed three gunmen and Afghan security forces clearing the hotel worked their way up to the roof and engaged the remaining insurgents. As the helicopters attacked and Afghan security forces moved in, there were four massive explosions. Officials at the scene said the blasts occurred when security forces either fired on suicide bombers or they blew themselves up. After the gunmen were killed, the hotel lights that had been blacked out during the attack came back on. Afghan security vehicles and ambulances were removing the dead and wounded from the area. Bloodied: Soldiers - believed to be international special forces - leave the scene of the siege . Devastation: Smoke was still billowing from the roof as the sun came up over Kabul this morning . Afghan policemen keep watch: The attack has raised fresh questions over the country's ability to handle security . An American PhD student has relived the terrifying moment he was caught up in the gunfire - prompting him to write his own will. Saiz Ahmed had just eaten dinner and returned to his fourth-floor room at the InterContinental Hotel when he heard loud noises. He thought that there might have been a power cut when the lights went out but moments later realised it was gunfire. Mr Ahmed stayed put inside the hotel and grabbed a piece of paper to hastily scribble down his will in case he was killed in the explosions. 'It was clear that people were shooting from inside the building - a number of people I didn't know where - and from outside,' he told CNN. 'I didn't know who was who. They might have been people blowing themselves up' Mr Ahmed said that over the next few hours he endured the sound of constant gunfire and explosions roughly every 45 minutes. The building rocked with the force of the blasts but he remained inside after speaking by phone with relatives in Kabul. He said that he was sure that nobody would get out alive and he scrawled the names of a handful of charities on a piece of paper in case he was killed. 'I've never experienced explosions that near. I felt the ground move up,' he added. 'I was just praying that the next one wouldn't be right under me or above me or anywhere else where there were people.' Hours later, however, the last of the suicide bombers, who had been holed up in a room, blew himself up, the final act of violence of the night. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the rare night-time attack in the capital - an apparent attempt to show that they remain potent despite heavy pressure from coalition and Afghan security forces. It came less than a week after President Barack Obama announced he was withdrawing 33,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan and would end the American combat role by the end of 2014. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid later issued a statement claiming that Taliban attackers killed guards at a gate and entered the hotel. ‘One of our fighters called on a mobile phone and said: “We have gotten onto all the hotel floors and the attack is going according to the plan. We have killed and wounded 50 foreign and local enemies. We are in the corridors of the hotel now taking guests out of their rooms - mostly foreigners. We broke down the doors and took them out one by one”.’ But Kabul Police Chief Gen. Mohammad Ayub Salangi said the death toll was only ten, who were all employed at the hotel. He provided no further details, but said none of the conference attendees staying at the hotel were harmed. ‘There were no casualties among the guests - either foreign or Afghan,’ he said. ‘No high-ranking government officials were killed.’ Earlier on Tuesday, officials from the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan met in the capital to discuss prospects for making peace with Taliban insurgents to end the nearly decade-long war. 'The fact that we are discussing reconciliation in great detail is success and progress, but challenges remain and we are reminded of that on an almost daily basis by violence,' Jawed Ludin, Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister, said at a news conference. 'The important thing is that we act and that we act urgently and try to do what we can to put an end to violence.' Assault: Afghan soldiers gather outside the hotel after the siege finally came to an end . Perimeter: The siege only came to an end after the lone surviving suicide bomber blew himself up in a hotel room . The InterContinental - known widely as . the 'Inter-Con' opened in the late 1960s - was the nation's first . international luxury hotel. It has at least 200 rooms and was once part of an international chain. But when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the hotel was left to fend for itself. It was used by Western journalists during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. On November 23 2003, a rocket exploded nearby, shattering windows but causing no casualties. Twenty-two . rockets hit the Inter-Con between 1992 and 1996, when factional . fighting convulsed Kabul under the government of Burhanuddin Rabbani. All the windows were broken, water mains were damaged and the outside structure pockmarked. Some, but not all, of the damage was repaired during Taliban rule. Attacks in the Afghan capital have been relatively rare, although violence has increased since the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden in a U.S. raid in Pakistan and the start of the Taliban's annual spring offensive. Storm force: Afghan soldiers on a road near the hotel. The siege was ended by NATO helicopters and forces . Staff at the same hotel clean up after a bomb went off in its garden in November 2003 (file picture) On June 18, insurgents wearing Afghan . army uniforms stormed a police station near the presidential palace and . opened fire on officers, killing nine. Late . last month, a suicide bomber wearing an Afghan police uniform . infiltrated the main Afghan military hospital, killing six medical . students. A month before that, a suicide attacker in an army uniform . sneaked past security at the Afghan Defense Ministry, killing three . people. Other hotels in the capital have also been targeted. In January 2008, militants stormed Kabul's most popular luxury hotel, the Serena, hunting down Westerners who cowered in a gym during a coordinated assault that killed eight people. An American, a Norwegian journalist and a Philippine woman were among the dead. A suicide car bomber in December 2009, struck near the home of a former Afghan vice president and a hotel frequented by Westerners, killing eight people and wounding nearly 40 in a neighborhood considered one of Kabul's safest. And in February 2010, insurgents struck two residential hotels in the heart of Kabul, killing 20 people including seven Indians, a French filmmaker and an Italian diplomat.

"Steven Gerrard silenced his critics with a passing masterclass - with more than 90 per cent accuracy - and a goal in the Merseyside derby. Click here for his stats and all the players' heat maps in our brilliant Match Zone. For two proud captains, this was the Redemption Derby. Steven Gerrard and Phil Jagielka have each been on the receiving end of unaccustomed criticism this season but neither Brendan Rodgers nor Roberto Martinez could have done without them yesterday. Gerrard went first in a pulsating derby, pulling rank on Mario Balotelli to take a 65th-minute free-kick and curl it exquisitely past Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard. Overtaken by the emotion of it all, the 34-year-old midfielder let out a joyous screech of pure adrenalin and cupped his hand to his ear — a response to the abuse Evertonians had given him all afternoon. It looked as if it would be the latest Gerrard classic winner until Jagielka improbably stepped forward in the second minute of injury time and hit a 25-yard screamer that would still be travelling if the net had not stopped it. Everton celebrate the injury time equaliser from Phil Jagielka (right) after his stunning half-volley clinched a draw in the Merseyside derby . As the graphic demonstrates, Jagielka's stunning drive was clocked at 58mph as it flew off the defender's boot and into the back of Simon Mignolet's net . Steven Gerrard celebrates giving his side the lead from a free-kick in the 65th minute at Anfield . Liverpool (4-2-3-1): Mignolet 5.5; Manquillo 7, Skrtel 7.5, Lovren 7, Moreno 7.5; Gerrard 8, Henderson 8.5; Sterling 8, Lallana 7.5, Markovic 5 (Coutinho 60); Balotelli 6 (Lambert 88) Subs not used: Jones (GK), Enrique, Toure, Lambert, Coutinho, Lucas, Suso . Manager: Brendan Rodgers 7.5 . Goal: Gerrard 64 . Booked: Gerrard, Moreno . Everton (4-3-3): Howard 5.5; Hibbert 5.5 (Browning '73), Stones 7, Jagielka 8, Baines 6.5; McCarthy 7, Barry 5.5, Besic 7 (Eto'o '80); Lukaku 5, Naismith 6, Mirallas 6 (McGeady '31) Subs not used: Robles (GK), Gibson, Osman, Alcaraz . Manager: Roberto Martinez 6.5 . Goal: Jagielka 90+1 . Booked: Barry . Referee: Martin Atkinson6 . Attendance: 44,511 . ‘I have never seen a better strike live,’ said Everton boss Martinez. ‘It was incredible, though it probably it helps it was in the last minute, at Anfield and for my team.’ There was something poignant about both players hauling their team-mates up by their bootstraps for the biggest game of the season for supporters. Gerrard has suffered a slow start to the season and found it difficult to recover from the twin blows of making a mistake that cost Liverpool the Premier League title last season and then captaining England to their World Cup failure in Brazil. No wonder he enjoyed his brilliant set-piece goal. ‘I’ll agree with the constructive criticism and I’ve been stifled in a couple of games when people have followed me around and I haven’t been able to shake them off,’ he said. ‘But then people take it too far and say that “He’s 34 and he can’t run and he’s finished”. I can still compete with the best players around.’ After seeing Balotelli miss with a series of free-kicks in the first half, he had no hesitation in grabbing the ball when the Italian had been fouled by Leighton Baines. ‘You get a feeling for free-kicks in certain areas of the pitch and I fancied it,’ he said. Rodgers was a bit more forthright. ‘I was screaming for Steven to take it because I know his quality in those situations. But he is so selfless he sometimes wants others to have an opportunity.’ The Liverpool boss was adamant that Gerrard’s goal should have been the winner and in terms of possession and chances he was unquestionably right. Everton could have seen Gareth Barry sent off early for a series of indiscretions, starting with a first-minute foul on Adam Lallana and were relieved when Balotelli hit the crossbar from four yards out following Raheem Sterling’s cross. But the visitors showed tremendous character to pour bodies forward in the closing stages. Just after the stadium announcer told 45,000 fans there would be three minutes of added time, Aiden McGeady whipped a cross into a crowded penalty area. Dejan Lovren got good distance with his clearing header but Jagielka returned it with interest with a strike that hit Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet’s top-left hand corner like a bullet.

It was the 32-year-old defender’s seventh Premier League goal in seven years at Everton and, like Gerrard’s, followed plenty of recent criticism for his displays at the World Cup and his club shipping goals. Martinez said: ‘There has been talk of a World Cup hangover and I think that has been really unfair. He has set high standards and cares like nobody else. ‘It would have been easy for him as a centre-half to stay in his position while we’re chasing the game. But he came forward because of his belief and sense of responsibility he has. He showed the way to face adversity. Nobody deserved to score more than him.’ Given the form of both teams going into the 223rd Merseyside derby, a goal glut was widely predicted. Everton had conceded 17 goals in seven games and Liverpool had been beaten in three of their five Premier League outings. The opening was as ferocious as in any previous derby. Barry was booked for his early go at Lallana and could have been sent off either for handling Sterling’s shot inside the area or clipping Balotelli, both inside the first 11 minutes. Neither was given by referee Martin Atkinson, who also waved away Everton appeals for a penalty when Alberto Moreno shoved Romelu Lukaku. Everton were lucky to reach half-time on terms, with Howard making excellent stops to deny Balotelli and Lallana.

They also had to regroup when Kevin Mirallas strained his hamstring and had to be replaced by McGeady. Balotelli was targeted in the second half, with Tony Hibbert eyeballed by the Italian after a scissor-kick challenge to win the ball. But the Italian’s penchant for over-dramatising any challenge did not earn him any sympathy from the referee.

Speedy defender Moreno is upended in the challenge from Lukaku . However, it was Balotelli who won the all-important free-kick for the goal when he was brought down after ghosting past Baines. Gerrard, sent off the last time Everton won at Anfield in 1999, did the rest with precision. Despite his disappointment at not winning, Rodgers was pleased with his side’s improvement after what he called a ‘broken’ start to the season. ‘We were clearly the better side and didn’t get what we deserved,’ he said. Everton still have not won on enemy territory this century. But after their late escape, they will not care — for this weekend at least.

"Manuel Pellegrini praised his Manchester City players for keeping the pressure on leaders Chelsea with a record-equalling victory at the start of what he called a ‘key’ week. City beat West Bromwich Albion 3-1 without a recognised striker and head into their match against Burnley with the chance of winning 10 consecutive games for the first time in their history. City are three points behind Chelsea, but Pellegrini is targeting top spot by the turn of the new year. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping to win their 10th consecutive game against Burnley . Pellegrini barks out instructions during Manchester City's 3-1 win against West Brom . David Silva celebrates with Samir Nasri after scoring his side's third goal against the Baggies . ‘I think this is a key week because we have to play nine points in just one week,’ Pellegrini said. ‘It is important for us to be as soon as we can at the top of the table so as not to give an advantage for the second half of the season. ‘We are not aware about records but we are aware of adding points because it will be a very close fight for the title this year and we want to keep our title. ‘If we continue in this way maybe we can do it. Any team who can arrive to 86 points can win the title. The title is not just two teams. Other teams will be involved as well. Manchester United.’ City, who have 42 points, face Sunderland at the Etihad Stadium on New Year’s Day after the visit of Burnley.

City won at the Hawthorns through goals from Fernando, Yaya Toure and David Silva. Brown Ideye got a late consolation. Pellegrini used James Milner up front once more with Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko still injured. Stevan Jovetic made the bench and could feature against Burnley. Captain Vincent Kompany could also return from injury. ‘We scored three goals again without a striker,’ said the City manager. ‘James is a very intelligent player. He knows which movement he must take to create the space. ‘David is a very dangerous player because he finishes very well and has a lot of skill inside the box. ‘Vincent Kompany maybe will be fit (for Burnley). Jovetic was on the bench, so maybe he will be fit for Sunday. He was available to play today, but in this game it was not important for him to play. Also, the pitch was difficult for someone recovering from a muscle injury.’","Manchester City won their ninth consecutive match against West Brom .

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock says co-owner Steve Parish is doubling up as chairman and director of football following the departure of Iain Moody.

"Talk about taking on the Brazilians at their own game. Liverpool academy star Adam Phillips showed his class on Sunday by scoring a glorious last-gasp equaliser against the South Americans for England Under 17s. The 16-year-old midfielder, who travelled with Brendan Rodgers' first-team squad on their United States tour last summer, looped home an exquisite 25-yarder in the eighth minute of injury time to earn 10-man England an unlikely 2-2 draw. Adam Phillips in action for England during an earlier match - he curled home a 97th minute equaliser for England Under 17s against Brazil in the Nike International Tournament on Sunday . Phillips took to Twitter to express his delight at scoring England's leveller . The Under 17s are currently out in Sarasota, Florida competing in the Nike International Tournament along with Brazil, the United States and Australia. Having lost 3-1 to the States in their first match on Friday, England were staring at a second defeat when they won a corner just as the clock was about to tick past 97 minutes. But after Sunderland's Daniel Wright played the ball out to him, Phillips curled the ball over a mass of bodies inside the penalty box and watched as it dropped over the despairing dive of Brazil goalkeeper Bruno Bertinato. The goals sparked wild celebrations, with England's substitutes rushing from the bench onto the pitch to celebrate with Phillips. 'Great moment for me scoring last minute against Brazil!! Great team effort bring on Australia!!!' tweeted an excited Phillips afterwards. He later added: 'What a game football is.' The Young Lions finish the tournament against Australia on Tuesday. Phillips celebrates a goal for Liverpool during an Under 18 Premier League fixture with Sunderland at Kirkby . Phillips pictured on the bench during Liverpool's pre-season tour to the United States . Phillips is regarded as one of Liverpool's brightest young talents and this was the latest demonstration of his class and ability. He hails from the Lancashire town of Garstang and joined Liverpool's academy at the age of 11 having spent three years with Blackburn Rovers. He joined Neil Critchley's Under 18 squad at the club's Kirby Academy in the summer but received a surprise promotion after impressing Rodgers in a pre-season friendly with Brondby on July 16. Phillips came on for Fabio Borini at half-time and, despite losing the match 2-1, did enough to win himself a place in Liverpool's 33-strong playing squad for the US Tour. So within a few weeks of finishing his studies at Rainhill School, where many of the club's scholars are educated, he was travelling alongside the likes of Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge. 'Dreams do really come true,' tweeted Phillips at the time. Phillips (second right) lines up alongside fellow Reds youngsters Jordan Rossiter (left) and Cameron Brannagan (No 10) in an Under 21 Premier League fixture . Phillips challenges for the ball with Manchester City's Cameron Humphries during an U18 game this season . Critchley told the Liverpool Echo following his call-up: 'Adam came down for the first day two weeks ago when I did an induction meeting with the first years to welcome them aboard and tell them what to expect over the coming year. 'On the following Monday, Adam was called down to train with the first team at Melwood and we haven't seen him since. 'I'm not surprised that the manager is keen to have a good look at him. He's a talented lad who can play in a number of positions. He played wide right against Brondby but he can also play centrally. 'He played No 6, No 8 and No 10 for the U18s last season. He has a great range of passing and he can score goals. He can do a bit of everything.' His call-up meant Phillips had to wave the chequered flag on his other great passion - cycle speedway. He had joined Astley and Tyldesley Cycle Speedway club at the age of four and was a three-time British champion. Phillips tackles Manchester United's Devonte Redmond during an U18 fixture back in August . Phillips played the last five minutes of Liverpool's first tour match against Roma in Boston and gained valuable experience during the trip. This season, Phillips made his Under 21 debut, scoring twice in the 4-3 defeat to Manchester City and has also played in two UEFA Youth League fixtures. Internationally, Phillips made two appearances for England Under 16s, scoring the winner against Portugal in the Montaigu Tournament back in April, and was called up by John Peacock for the Florida tournament last month.","England's Young Lions were trailing Brazil 2-1 deep into stoppage time .

"Arjen Robben scored a 90th minute winner in their 2-1 victory at Mainz 05 on Friday to send Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich into the winter break with a commanding 14-point lead. Dutchman Robben, who has been outstanding for Bayern all season and was also on target last week against Freiburg, netted his tenth league goal at the end of the game, tapping in from close range after a second-string Bayern struggled against gutsy Mainz. The Bavarians have seen their team ravaged by bad luck, with Xabi Alonso, Robert Lewandowski, Medhi Benatia and Sebastian Rode injured in last week's win over Freiburg and joining half a dozen more on the sidelines.

Their joy was shortlived, however, with Bastian Schweinsteiger curling a sensational freekick over the wall and into the top corner three minutes later. Mainz had a big chance to take the lead again when Yunus Malli found himself with only Manuel Neuer to beat but the keeper kept his cool to stop his shot. Bayern were lacking their usual spark with only a third of their record 31 shots on goal against Freiburg but they struck when it mattered most with Robben scoring from close range after fine work from Franck Ribery and Juan Bernat for their eighth successive league win.

"Mario Balotelli could not inspire Liverpool to a comeback victory over Manchester United on Sunday when he was introduced at half-time for Adam Lallana, and was denied his first Premier League goal for the club  by an array of spectacular David de Gea saves. Liverpool trailed 2-0 at the interval and went on to lose 3-0 at Old Trafford through goals from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie but the away side had found moments of attacking joy against United's defence prior to Balotelli coming on. And he was unfortunate not to halve Liverpool's deficit when he blasted a pass from Raheem Sterling goalwards from ten yards, only for De Gea to brilliantly tip it onto the crossbar on 68 minutes.

"Departing Rangers boss Ally McCoist made an emotional farewell speech to his players and told them to make him proud by pipping Hearts to the Championship title. The club's record scorer has been put on garden leave for the remainder of the 12-month notice period after handing in his resignation 11 days ago. McCoist's former number two Kenny McDowall has now been placed in temporary charge until the end of the season. Outgoing Rangers manager Ally McCoist made an emotional farewell speech to his players on Monday . The manager met his squad for the final time at Murray Park on Monday morning, just as the club's directors were being booed and heckled at a stormy Ibrox AGM. But the 52-year-old used his final words to fire up the Light Blues for the title run in as they try reign in Hearts' nine-point lead. McDowall, speaking to the media for the first time since he was put in charge on Sunday night, said: 'We need to give the fans something back. 'That's what they boys are desperate to do. We set out to win this title and that is still the aim. Nothing would make Ally McCoist more happy than the boys doing that. McCoist has been placed on gardening leave for the remainder of the 12-months notice period . 'Yesterday was a sad day. Ally came in to say goodbye to the players and the staff. The man that he is, he finished by saying that nothing would make him more proud than if they went on to win the title. 'It would be a great tribute to Ally if they boys could pull that off.' McCoist's turbulent three-and-a-half year reign was finally brought to an end late on Sunday night. The former Scotland striker had been determined to see out his year-long notice period but just 14 hours before the club's directors were set to face off against seething shareholders, a brief three-line statement confirmed McCoist was gone. McDowall will be assisted by Gordon Durie and Lee McCulloch, now doubling up as skipper and player/coach, as he tries to re-energise a team that has creaked its way through recent weeks. But the 51-year-old former Celtic youth coach, who quit Parkhead to join Walter Smith's Rangers coaching staff in 2007, looked uncomfortable as he explained how new chief executive Derek Llambias and football board chairman Sandy Easdale turned to him just moments after dispensing with McCoist. McDowall (right) will be assisted by coach Gordon Durie (left) and Lee McCulloch . They also sent coach Ian Durrant back to work with the club's Under-20s side - and left McDowall to break the bad news. The former Partick and St Mirren striker said: 'The board intimated to myself that Ally had been put on garden leave and they told me they were going to make some changes to the structure of the coaching team. 'Gordon was to come up from the (under) 20s to assist me and they wanted to make Lee a player/coach and I was to start immediately. 'Was my opinion sought? No, they asked me if I could make those changes immediately. But the decision was made by them. 'As for Durranty, that was the board's decision too. They asked me to carry it out which I duly did. 'I was asked to inform the guys of the changes being made.' McDowall was promoted to assistant manager when McCoist replaced Smith in 2011 but Llambias hinted at Monday's shareholder meeting that he could end up keeping the top job permanently. McDowall faced the press for the first time since being placed in temporary charge . 'I'm just going to take it one game at a time and try to get Rangers winning on the park,' said the interim boss before he paid tribute to McCoist. 'I'm very saddened to see a good friend, who has been absolutely unbelievable for the club over the last three years and longer before that when he was a player, depart. 'Ally McCoist was the glue that kept this club together. 'I was surprised when I found out he had resigned because I didn't know it was coming. Listen, we are all big boys. It has been a bumpy ride but football is football and anything can happen.' While the club's off-field soap opera was a distraction for McCoist, performances did little to help his cause. McDowall's first match in charge will come against Hibernian this Saturday but he knows defeat will all but kill-off their automatic promotion hopes. However, he warned fans not to expect sweeping changes when he names his line-up for the Easter Road clash. He said: 'There's not a whole load I can change because everything Ally was doing was with my backing. 'The players appreciate that they have got to do a bit better on the park in terms of consistency. But these guys are good players. They don't just become bad players overnight. 'Because they are Rangers players, everything is scrutinised - every last pass.

"No offence is intended to the loyal assistant stepping into the breach. But you get the impression that, without Ally McCoist in the opposing technical area on Saturday, something will be missing for Hibs boss Alan Stubbs. There was more than just professional respect between two former Old Firm warriors who, despite some of the absolute lunacy that goes on around the fringes of both clubs, found plenty of time to be the friendliest of foes during their playing days at the big two. So, as warmly as he’ll welcome caretaker boss Kenny McDowall, there’s a feeling that the former Celtic defender will be sparing at least a thought or two for the man who finally decided to walk away from a much-changed, majorly-diminished, barely-recognisable Rangers. During his days at Celtic Alan Stubbs formed a respectful rivalry with former Rangers player Ally McCoist . McCoist has been placed on gardening leave following his decision to step down as manager of Rangers . Kenny McDowall (right) replaced McCoist in the Rangers hotseat after he left the Scottish Championship club . ‘I had the utmost respect for Ally as a player - and we were known to socialise once or twice in Glasgow,’ said Stubbs with a grin and, unless there was something wrong with the lighting, a very definite reddening of the cheeks. ‘The rivalry between Rangers and Celtic was so intense, of course, but we got on great. There were are a group of players who, if we saw each other in town, would stop and have a couple of drinks before going our separate ways. It was total respect. ‘When we played against each other, there was still that respect, but we wanted to... actually I can’t say what we wanted to do to each other! We wanted to win, that’s all I will say. ‘Playing against him, he was a good player, a real pain. We used to have words and a bit of banter, naturally, but there was always respect. His record speaks for itself. He was a fantastic goal scorer and, no matter what anyone says, he did what he had to do as a manager by getting Rangers promoted twice. McDowall will take charge of the Rangers first team as they head into the top three clash with Hibernian . Caretaker manager McDowall (right) will be assisted by coach Gordon Durie (left) and Lee McCulloch . ‘It’s not ideal how it panned out and I really feel for Ally. I wish him all the best and hope he’s back in football soon. I will look to make contact with him soon and speak to him, that’s just the decent thing to do.’ Any manager in the land watching McCoist in the months and years since Rangers plunged into insolvency must have felt a range of emotions. Sympathy, naturally, for a fellow pro who had to act as leader, spokesman, figurehead *and* overall boss of an entire football department while a variety of men in suits made bold promises about what they’d do next. Virtually every other head coach in Scotland would also confess, though, to feeling more than a bit of envy as they watched Rangers continue to spend as if tomorrow was just a rumour. Even this ‘slimmed-down’ organisation is losing around £1million a month, yet still they allowed the manager to make signings. Addressing the two sides of the rebuilding job that fell upon McCoist from a great height, Stubbs said: ‘The one thing I would say is: Ally knew exactly what he was going into. ‘People will look at us managers and say we are stupid, we’re thick. They are probably right - but it’s the buzz you get from the job. When things are going well, it’s fantastic, when things are not going well you need to find a way to turn things around quickly. Rangers chief Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of  McDowall taking a permanent role in charge . ‘When you are at a really top club, where the demands are so high and the pressure is always on, if you don’t deliver you run the risk of this happening. It’s the same at any club. It is a results business and unfortunately Ally has paid the price, rightly or wrongly. ‘Rangers obviously have resources, because they have the biggest budget, but it’s about how you spend it. I have a budget here and I need to get the best out of it. The biggest budget will not always win you the league and, at the moment, the league bears that out with Hearts having such a big lead.’ Asked if he thought a club continuing to spend when they’re heading for another financial meltdown was akin to cheating, a laughing Stubbs said: ‘No comment! Listen, they started the season with a budget. Whether it’s fair or not, they have the players. The club is losing money, but it’s not my problem or Hibs’ problem.’","Alan Stubbs sent his regards to former Rangers manager Ally McCoist .

"Last weekend against Arsenal had appeared to represent a significant step forward but instead of hammering their foot down on the accelerator, Liverpool threatened to stall once again at Turf Moor. For so long here, it seemed that this would be another desperate day for Brendan Rodgers, another afternoon where his long-term credentials at the club would be questioned. Failure to win on Friday would have meant just four victories in 16 games in all competitions. Not since 1992 - the first season of the Premier League era - had Liverpool been as low as 10th on Christmas Day. For the first hour of this game, things looked destined to take yet another turn for the worse. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Raheem Sterling is learning and adapting quickly . Raheem Sterling rounds Burnley keeper Tom Heaton and slots calmly, but are his talents wasted up front . Sterling scored the winner for Liverpool at Turf Moor on Boxing Day soon after the hour mark . Burnley swarmed all over their illustrious visitors, invigorated by the adrenalin shots pumped from the terraces. This felt like an old-fashioned Boxing Day fixture, with Turf Moor packed to the rafters with families, from grandparents to toddlers, filling out all sides of this charismatic old stadium. In that first-half, a Burnley goal appeared inevitable, the home side every bit as enterprising and vibrant as their visitors were anaemic and listless. Liverpool looked ripe for a giant-killing. The problem for Brendan Rodgers these days is that his side's issues are not contained to one area. Instead, the malaise spreads throughout the team, from back to front and the current 3-5-2 formation with Kolo Toure in defence, Jordan Henderson at wing back and Raheem Sterling as the lone striker feels rather akin to putting a flimsy plaster on an open wound. Once again at Turf Moor, Liverpool had no focal point in the final third. Raheem Sterling scuttled around, dribbled with purpose and finished with composure to decide the game but the feeling remains that his considerable qualities are wasted in this position. Sterling dribbled with purpose but was not the focal point Brendan Rodgers needs in attack . It only serves to underline Liverpool's impotency in front of goal. They had just five shots in this game. Before this match, Liverpool's seven forward players - Sterling, Coutinho, Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge, Lazar Markovic and Fabio Borini - had played 4,435 minutes in the Premier League this season. Taken together, they had scored just seven goals - averaging a goal every 663 minutes - or every 7 or so games. It is a quite stunning statistic and a damning indictment of the transfer committee reportedly responsible for Liverpool's summer transfer strategy. Rodgers will hope that a solution can be uncovered in the January sales or that Sturridge recovers sooner rather than later. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has a number of pressing issues with his line-up from back to front . Perhaps even more urgent is the need to recruit a goalkeeper of elite standing. Brad Jones pulled up in this game after 16 minutes and the most anxious of performances from Simon Mignolet suggests that his spell out of the team team has done little to improve his state of mind. He looked horribly short of confidence, skewing long-kicks out of play, flapping at crosses and causing all sorts of panic for those in front of him. Clearly, Mignolet is a more talented goalkeeper than the recent months suggest and there must be some sympathy for him. It is difficult to imagine what it must be like when the quicksands of self-doubt takes hold, when the opposition supporters goad you with chants of 'You're **** and you know you are', as an unforgiving Burnley home crowd did here. Even more presing is keeper Simon Mignolet's lack of form and now an injury to Brad Jones . Jones leaves the pitch with an injury paving the way for Mignolet's return for Liverpool . An unforgiving Burnley crowe chanted to Mignolet: 'You're **** and you know you are' As it transpired, Mignolet survived here and who knows, the clean sheet may restore some confidence to the stricken Belgian. He was bullied and harried but he survived. Maybe, just maybe, it could be a turning point for both Mignolet and Liverpool. That, however, must be countered against a growing number inside Anfield that perceive that this struggle extends beyond a crisis of confidence and that Mignolet instead simply lacks the requisite qualities to be a first-choice goalkeeper at a club of Liverpool's aspirations. Rodgers will certainly hope for the former and he will also view this result as fundamental in the club's attempts to hunt down the seven point gap that separates his side from Southampton as they look to secure Champions League football for next season. If that is to be achieved, Liverpool must make a major step up from this performance.","Liverpool beat Burnley at Turf Moor courtesy of a Raheem Sterling goal .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche believes Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers is a victim of his own success. The pair worked together at Watford in 2008/09, Rodgers in his first management role and Dyche as academy coach, and go head to head in the Barclays Premier League for the first time on Boxing Day. They remain in contact, meeting earlier this year for dinner and sharing occasional text messages since the Clarets won promotion in the summer. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has come out in support of under-fire Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . Last term saw both men enjoying the best time of their coaching career, Burnley defying the odds in the Championship and Liverpool falling agonisingly short in an unexpected title bid. Rodgers' stock has plummeted in the intervening months, with the Reds sitting 10th having already lost seven times, but Dyche believes a sense of perspective helps his case. 'He's got his question marks now but in the grand scheme of things he's a good coach,' Dyche said. 'I think overall Brendan's done very, very well, it's just that the demands from last season, going so high, are seemingly making what's happening now look nowhere near as good as before,' he said. 'But if you look historically they were middle-ish, having a look at the top then dropping away a little. Dyche claimed the Northern Irishman was a victim of high expectations after last year's success . 'The perception of what they are changes on the fact that last year they went so close to taking it. I think it was a fantastic achievement to get so close last year.' Dyche happily opens up on his relationship with Rodgers, but concedes he has a professional as well as a personal interest in seeing the latter succeed. Although from Northern Ireland, Rodgers is seen as something of a flag-bearer for young home-grown coaches - and is often grouped in with the aspiring British coaches. 'We are always respectful friends. As you can imagine with his life and my life, they are full on. It's not like we're ringing each other every night for half an hour,' Dyche said. Dyche and Rodgers worked together while at Watford - the Burnley boss was the academy coach back then . 'But now and again we'll have a little chat, a catch-up, the odd text 'good result' etc. 'He's a good guy, I like him a lot and respect him. 'We have to have people doing well who are English or British, fuelling the belief at the top level, from boards and fans even, that there are good English, British coaches out there doing good work. 'To promote British coaches there has to be British coaches doing well and it has to be at the top level. 'He is certainly one of them.'

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez is prepared to make changes as he seeks a winning formula - but in personnel and not style. The Toffees have lacked consistency and are 13 points down on the figure they had in the Barclays Premier League at the same stage last season. They have won just one of their last five in the league and suffered a 3-0 defeat at Southampton last Saturday. Roberto Martinez and Everton lost 3-0 to Southampton in their last Premier League outing . Some critics have called for Martinez to modify his tactics, perhaps to scrap more, but Martinez has no intention of altering his flowing, pass-based approach. Asked if he might consider a change, Martinez said: 'No, never. What we need to do is get better - it is not about style. 'Our style is very clear at Everton. We are a football club that really enjoys playing in a certain manner and we need to master it. That is where the work is. 'The competition for places is huge. When you get a disappointing result you always consider giving any member of the group that is doing good work on a daily basis an opportunity on a match day, and that is healthy. Southampton defender Jose Fonte risest highest for Romelu Lukaku's own goal opener at St Mary's . 'But I am not concerned in terms of performances. I don't think we are far away from where we were last season. I would say we are even better in many aspects of our performances. 'There is a strange relationship between performances and results that at the moment we don't seem to get, but that is what we need to focus on. 'We are going into the second half of the season with a huge amount of points to fight for. 'I know for a fact we have got the quality and determination in the group, and the character, to have a really strong second half of the season.' Martinez, who guided Everton to fifth last season, is similarly dismissive of suggestions that his side have been hampered by their involvement in the Europa League. Southampton forward Pelle puts the ball past Everton goalkeeper Howard for his side's second of the game . Martinez has embraced the often-derided competition and seen the Merseysiders cruise through to the last 32. He said: 'It is a real exciting season. Playing in Europe and being involved in other competitions, as well as wanting to be as good as you can in the league, brings an extra dimension. 'I feel that is the only way we can fulfil our potential. I think it was a price we had to pay. 'We can learn from it and look to the second half of the season and how we can bridge that gap and make sure we can get results on a consistent basis.' Martinez believes Everton can get their season back on track as the fixtures come thick and fast during the Christmas programme. Maya Yoshida rises above Everton defender Leighton Baines to crash in the third of the game for the Saints . Everton host Stoke on Boxing Day, travel to Newcastle two days later and are then at Hull on New Year's Day. Martinez said: 'Southampton was a really disappointing result, there is no two ways about it. 'But we know why it happened and what we need to change. It is in our hands, which is always a positive sign going into the next game. 'We do it by playing quickly - getting on the pitch again. That is what this festive period brings you - the opportunity to play a lot of games. 'We have got three games in six days, which is an incredible opportunity and an incredible amount of points. 'We can't wait to get onto the football pitch and face a strong Stoke side that I really enjoy watching. 'In the last game against Chelsea they showed that they are a side that is ready to compete against anyone in this league and they are going to be really tough opposition on Friday.' But Martinez has said that the team's style of play is not to blame, and that his players need to perform better .","Everton are currently 11th in the Premier League, behind rivals Liverpool .

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. Grappling and blocking in the box is THE No 1 issue I am asked about by football people. It used to be foul language (but it is seven years since a top-flight player was sent off for that offence) and then  goal-line technology (but that’s been dealt with effectively). It is time to now deal with grappling and holding in the penalty area. Tackling this issue is long overdue. It’s not about a change in the law, it’s about the appropriate enforcement of the law. Grabbing, holding, grappling: however you describe it, is pure cheating. It’s an issue that is preventing goals from being scored. I remember my Sportsmail colleague Jamie Carragher saying towards the end of his playing career: ‘If referees gave it [fouls for holding in the box], we wouldn’t do it.’ Applying the law is an easy win for referees. They cannot award a penalty if the ball is not in play, but they can issue a yellow card. Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo both appear to grapple Ivanovic and John Terry at a Chelsea corner . Giving a penalty is a massive thing for a referee, but interrupting the game before a corner or free-kick can be taken to issue a yellow card to culprits is easily enforceable. We already see referees prevent corners being taken so they can verbally warn players about holding and grappling. It’s time for the talk to stop and the cards to come out. On Sunday at Old Trafford we saw Robin van Persie cautioned for removing his shirt after scoring a late equaliser. No-one blamed the referee. Everyone blamed the player. We need that same mental attitude here. This HANDS OFF IN THE BOX campaign can successfully assimilate into the game yellow cards for holding in the box, so it’s not something out of the ordinary. Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned – and sent off if you’ve been booked already. Once fans, managers and – crucially – players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims. Ricardo Carvalho was a master at it during his Chelsea days and Ryan Shawcross still does it for Stoke. He doesn’t even look at the ball, his focus is entirely on holding his man, preventing him from reaching the ball and scoring the goal we all want to see. Martin Skrtel does it for Liverpool, too. A direct free-kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force: . • kicks or attempts to kick an opponent . • trips or attempts to trip an opponent . • jumps at an opponent . • charges an opponent . • strikes or attempts to strike an opponent . • pushes an opponent . • tackles an opponent . A penalty is awarded if an offence is committed by a player inside his own penalty area, irrespective of the position of the ball, provided it is in play. An indirect free-kick is also awarded to the opposing team if, in the opinion of the referee, a player: . • plays in a dangerous manner . • impedes the progress of an opponent . • prevents the goalkeeper from releasing the ball from his hands . Smalling appears to blatantly pull down Ivanovic in the penalty area at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . Ivanovic falls to the ground after Smalling  dragged him down in the area by the Manchester United defender . Referee Phil Dowd should have awarded Chelsea a penalty during their draw at Old Trafford . The Chelsea defender appeals to Dowd shortly after the incident in the Manchester United area . Robin van Persie was rightly cautioned for taking off his shirt in celebration at Old Trafford on Sunday . Ryan Shawcross was penalised last week for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground . Click here to read Graham Poll's view on the wrestling in Manchester United's box on Sunday. Referees and their assistants can officiate tactically. The worst offenders of this holding practice are easily identified – I’ve already mentioned Shawcross, but Chris Smalling was at it against Chelsea and Branislav Ivanovic is no stranger to this dark art - and they can look out for them at the key moments during a game. Blocking is a more difficult offence to determine. Impending the progress of an opponent should be penalised by an indirect free-kick. Grappling, shirt-pulling, holding and blocking are stains on the game and referees should apply the law when they see these offences. I’ll be watching and detecting in all the big matches – starting at Loftus Road tonight as QPR host Aston Villa. I will be naming and shaming the culprits and the referees who fail to hold them to account. And so will my Sportsmail colleagues. Ryan and Co, you have been warned.

"Meeting: When David and Samantha Cameron arrived at the Old Billingsgate in London last year, they were whisked up to a private room for drinks with esteemed guests . As they arrived at the Conservative Summer Party, the most lavish event in the political calendar, some of the guests dissolved into fits of laughter. The cause of the hilarity? A bronze bust which was to be the highlight of the auction at the party at the fashionable Old Billingsgate Market in the City of London. As Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles held court, there was much waspish chatter over the cocktails about who the bust was supposed to be. In fact it was David Cameron, as the guests well knew. It had been sculpted by the Lebanese-born Harley Street surgeon Nadey Hakim, a long-time party supporter. But at the auction, at last year’s June party, there were initially no takers for the bust, valued by Mr Hakim at £12,000. After what seemed an eternity, one of the richest men present finally intervened to spare the Prime Minister’s blushes. Alexander Temerko, a Russian-born British businessman, paid an astonishing £90,000 for the bust. He liked it so much he promptly donated it to the Carlton Club, the bastion of the Conservative establishment in London’s St James’s. It is now ensconced in a corridor. One diner, who paid £12,000 for his table for a dozen guests, said: ‘The auctions are always hideously boring but this was a hoot as people began chuckling out loud as the Christie’s auctioneer tried in vain to shift the bronze. ‘There was a cheer when the Russian bought it but no one on my table could understand why anyone would want it.’ As for the Prime Minister, he was so relieved he raced over to Mr Temerko, who was on a table hosted by Eric Pickles, and slapped him enthusiastically on the back. Mr Temerko is a regular fixture on the Tory fundraising circuit. He has given either personally, or through his wind turbine farm company Offshore Group Newcastle, £348,000 since February 2012. As the guests took their places, on tables named after the 40 marginal seats the Tories have to win, it became clear why they will go into the next General Election campaign with millions more than the Labour Party. The total wealth of the guests – who included six billionaires and 15 worth more than £100million – was £11billion. The majority of the wealthiest guests came from the property and banking sectors but there is now an increasing number of multi-millionaires like Mr Temerko, who made their fortune after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Conversation: The likes of Theresa May (left) and Eric Pickles (right) held court over cocktails while other guests discussed a bust, the highest priced item at the auction . Rich: The total wealth of the guests at the Old Billingsgate Club in London - who included six billionaires and 15 worth more than £100million - was £11billion . In keeping with Cameron’s modern brand of conservatism, men were encouraged not to wear ties. There was not a long dress in sight. On his arrival the Prime Minister, in a plain blue suit, and his wife Samantha, in a dress by Serbian designer Roksanda Illinic, had been whisked into a closed upstairs room. They were entertained for 40 minutes to private drinks by the City financier Howard Shore who has given £450,000, and his wife Andree who was on the organising committee. Mr Shore’s firm Shore Capital sponsored the party. Also present were Darko Horvat, a Slovenian financier, and Nicholas Berggruen, a billionaire investor, art collector and philanthropist. Lord Feldman, a friend of Cameron’s from Oxford, who is joint chairman of the Tory Party with responsibility for fundraising, was a constant presence by the PM’s side. ‘This was the really serious money and this was their chance to have the undivided attention of the Prime Minister,’ says one Tory source. ‘There were only about 20 in the room including Dave and Samantha. No one mentions money but it’s clear to everyone why they are there.’ Shortly before dinner, the PM and his party returned downstairs to join the 459 guests to a polite smattering of applause. Thousands of pounds had been spent on . elaborate table arrangements of delphiniums and lupins so tall they . obscured some of the diners’ view of the people opposite them. Champagne . was off the menu in a nod to the age of austerity but there was no such . restraint evident in the ticket prices which ranged from £400 to . £1,000. After a starter of . smoked trout, Cameron gave a speech for just over 10 minutes, and the . room erupted in sustained applause when he paid a warm tribute to . Baroness Thatcher who had died two months earlier. Known as the 'homeless billionaire', Nicolas Berggruen is famous for not having a home despite his vast wealth. The 52-year-old founder and president of Berggruen Holdings, a private investment company, was seated very near to the Prime Minister at last summer's glittering Tory fundraising dinner . ‘Some of the guests were in tears,’ said one diner. ‘There was a huge roar of applause. It was the only time the room got going.’ After a main course of pan-fried guinea fowl stuffed with herbs and mascarpone the Prime Minister and Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, toured the tables. ‘You knew which table Boris was at because of the noise and laughter,’ says one senior MP. ‘Cameron carries his office on his shoulders while Boris exudes warmth, wit and personality. It was obvious to everyone, including Cameron’s table, who is the biggest draw.’ When Johnson returned to his table (after the Prime Minister had returned to his) he was clapped and cheered, taking his seat next to Andrey Borodin, a Russian financier wanted in Moscow in connection with allegations (which he denies) of a £220million fraud. He has been given political asylum in Britain. He was also next to the Finnish-born billionaire property developer Poju Zabludowicz who gave money to Cameron’s leadership campaign in 2005. He lives with his wife Anita in neighbouring ‘his’ and ‘her’ mansions on a north London street dubbed Billionaires’ Row. It may explain why Johnson was locked in conversation with the couple for so long. One minister said: ‘It was dreary but we are on a three-line whip to go because the donors want to see us. Our tickets are paid for as we can’t afford those prices. Even if we could, we wouldn’t unless we had to because the dinners are an absolute chore. It’s too crowded, it’s too noisy, and the auction goes on for ever.’ No one ever said that fund-raising was fun.","The total wealth of guests at the Old Billingsgate Market was £11billion .

It was acquired by the OXO cube makers in the 1920s . In the 1990s, the building and tower were refurbished to a high standard, giving the building over to shops, galleries, residential and restaurant space, with the latter opening as Oxo Tower Restaurant in 1996 . The PS4's launch line-up includes 22 games to attract fans of just about any genre, from military shooters to sports simulations to family-friendly adventures. It also offers such a wealth of easily accessible media apps, including Hulu and Netflix, that it may draw even the non-gamers in your household.

To those who have grown up in Britain, the brand of Oxo is well-known for its stock cubes. Although the building was originally built as a power station for the Post Office in the late 19th century, it was acquired by LiebIg (Oxo’s manufacturers) in the late 1920s. While much of the building was demolished, the façade remained and was extended. Architect Albert W Moore proposed spelling out Oxo in electric lights on the tower, but was refused permission, so the compromise of Oxo written in the window panes was agreed. However, after Oxo moved out, over the years, the building fell into decline. A new dawn was heralded when was acquired by the Coin Street Community Builders in 1984. In the 1990s, the building and tower were refurbished to a high standard, giving the building over to shops, galleries, residential and restaurant space, with the latter opening as Oxo Tower Restaurant in 1996.","Sony game console arrives in UK on November 29, while Microsoft's XBox One will be released one week earlier .

"The money is down but, to here, Manchester United’s roster has been largely unaffected by their post-Ferguson slump. They still recruit big players, they still shed the ones of their choosing. David de Gea’s next career move could alter that. He is out of contract in summer 2016, meaning United will want to get him signed long-term before the start of next season. David de Gea, celebrating against Everton, could come to symbolise Manchester United's current status . De Gea will be aware, however, that Real Madrid are in the market for a goalkeeper, with Iker Casillas nearing the end of his run. If De Gea stalls, it would be the first sign of United’s changing status. For De Gea is not Cristiano Ronaldo. Playing for Real Madrid was never his dream. He was an Atletico Madrid boy, at the club from the age of 10 until his £18m transfer to United 11 years later. Often, such an upbringing makes a player immune to Real Madrid’s overtures. Fernando Torres said he would never play for them. De Gea dives in an attempt to make a save during Spain training last week . To lose De Gea just as he is reaching maturity would be a significant blow for United but it would equally demonstrate that they cannot remain untouched by this slump indefinitely. With a long run until the next international break, Louis van Gaal’s regime must turn the corner. Champions League qualification is essential.

"The highest paid female business executive in the United States was born a man. Martine Rothblatt, who earns $38 million-a-year as head of United Therapeutics, was a married father-of-four before undergoing a sex change in 1994. Born into a Jewish family in San Diego, Martin trained as a lawyer at UCLA, married, had children, and went into business. Twenty years later, she has been named top in New York Magazine's list of the 200 most successful entrepreneurs - one of just 11 women in the list. Success: Martine Rothblatt, 60, started life as a man and had four children before a gender reassignment . She rocketed to success as a man in 1990, investing in the $19 billion digital radio industry years before any other company. After a gender reassignment, Rothblatt embarked on the second chapter of her career, developing revolutionary drugs as an alternative for heart and lung transplants. Last year, the firm posted a revenue of $1.1 billion, making her the most successful businesswoman in the world's most powerful nation. Rothblatt, who is still married to her wife of 32 years Bina, concedes that her achievement is unusual. 'I can’t claim that what I have achieved is equivalent to what a woman has achieved,' she told the magazine. 'For the first half of my life, I was male.' However, she is pioneering an alternative approach to gender roles in society. She denounces the use of 'Ms' for women and 'Mr' for men. Instead, she says, we should use 'Pn' for person. Unique: Rothblatt welcomes the prefix 'trans' because it highlights her personal journey of discovery . Her children still know her as 'dad', while her grandchildren have adopted the nickname 'Grand Martine' instead of grandmother. And in a manifesto entitled Apartheid Of Sex published in 1995, a year after her sex change, Rothblatt proclaimed: 'Genitals are as irrelevant to one’s role in society as skin tone'. But 'trans' is a prefix she wears with pride because she feels it highlights her journey of self-discovery. She founded United Therapeutics pharmaceutical company after their child was diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension - a life-threatening condition that restricts blood flow to the lungs. The drug Orenitram started publicly trading in 1999 at $12. Last year, after two failed attempts, Rothblatt got approval for the drug in pill form from the Food and Drug Administration. The stock instantly doubled. In June, it had a market capitalisation of $4.6 billion. Now, she and Bina lead a new 'trans' religion called Terasem, which sees the body as a shell for the mind - as they develop digital clones through which we can 'live after death'.","Martine Rothblatt, 60, was married father-of-four before sex change .

"Biscuit-eaters were today recovering from a shock announcement that has turned their world (quite literally) upside down. What they thought was the top of their beloved McVitie's Digestives and Hobnobs is actually the bottom... so they've been eating them the wrong way up all these years. It may be only a few days until the tomfoolery of April 1 but this is apparently no joke. Biscuit-breaking news: McVitie's fans have been told that what they thought was the top of their beloved Digestives and Hobnobs is actually the bottom. The digestive part is, in fact, the top . 'The biscuits go through a reservoir of chocolate which enrobes them so the chocolate is actually on the bottom of the biscuits and not on the top,' said Matt Brown, brand director of McVitie's . This revelation was later reinforced in a statement, which read: 'The McVitie's stamp is on the other side, which is the top of the biscuit' Following a recent thread on Reddit, a spokesman from McVitie's parent company, United Biscuits, confirmed the cold, hard, snack-shaped truth. Matt Brown, brand director for McVitie’s told Mail Online: 'Certain chocolate-covered biscuits within the McVitie’s range - specifically Chocolate Digestives and Chocolate Hobnobs - go through a reservoir of chocolate which enrobes them so the chocolate is actually on the bottom of the biscuits and not on the top. 'So yes, perhaps people up and down the country have been enjoying them the wrong way up – although we can confirm they’re delicious whichever way you like to eat them!' A further statement was run by the Independent, which said: 'The McVitie’s stamp is on the other side, which is the top of the biscuit.' However, the mystery remains why the chocolate side is on the top on the display of the packets. Not surprisingly, Twitter has been awash with comments. One poster wrote: 'Eating biscuits whilst doing handstands to try to console ourselves.' Biscuit fans have reacted on Twitter to the announcement . McVitie’s started making chocolate digestives in 1925 at its factory in Harlesden, North London – and now sells around 80million packs a year in the UK. In 1985, the new cult brand Hobnobs was launched. Huge demand for the original led to the introduction of the chocolate variety in 1987. Digestives have been enjoyed by Britons for more than a century, with Huntley & Palmers first advertising them in 1876. The name comes from the digestive properties they were thought to have because of the amount of baking soda in the recipe. In . 1892, Edinburgh bakers McVitie & Price made their version of the . biscuit to a recipe created by young new employee Alexander Grant. It was their first major biscuit and demand was strong, prompting the building of two new factories. Another said: 'Chocolate on the bottom?! Game changer.' The news comes barely a year after chocolate digestive fans were told McVitie's had changed the recipe. The reformulated biscuits were quietly introduced into supermarkets in December 2012. Taste testers said the new version was less crunchy, and the topping was more even - even though there was slightly more chocolate than the old one. And in a blind trial, two-thirds of those tasting the new recipe said they preferred the original. The snack company said it ‘tweaked’ the ingredients of the brand after receiving feedback from customers. United Biscuits said at the time that the new biscuit had around 3 per cent more chocolate, and the coating was more even. However, consumer group Which? found that just one per cent more was added. The news comes barely a year after Chocolate Digestive fans were told McVitie's had changed the recipe . Each biscuit contains 86 calories, compared to 85, and slightly more sugar, fat and saturated fat, although experts said the difference was ‘negligible’. And when 30 shoppers tried both versions, 19 preferred the old recipe. A spokesman for Which? said: ‘Our 30-strong blind taste test panel preferred the old biscuit, with many mentioning its crunchier texture.’","United Biscuits reveals biscuits go through reservoir of chocolate which 'enrobes'

"Celtic are refusing to sell Fraser Forster to Southampton until the Scottish club’s European fate is determined. Southampton are poised with an improved offer for Forster after a £3.5m bid was rejected last week. Celtic play Legia Warsaw in the Champions League qualifier on Wednesday with the return leg on August 6. Glove affair: Celtic and England keeper is a target for Southampton . The Saints are looking to continue their policy of buying British after seeing several first team players, including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert, leave St Mary's in the summer. However, they will have to increase their offer for the England international after Celtic described their opening bid as 'derisory' - the Scottish champions are believed to be holding out for a figure closer to £8 million.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers hopes injured striker Daniel Sturridge will be ready for a return to action in early January. The England star has not played for Liverpool since August after suffering thigh and calf problems, depriving Brendan Rodgers of his first-choice striker after the departure of Luis Suarez. Sturridge has been training in Los Angeles because the club thought that he would benefit from a change of scenery. Daniel Sturridge has been out injured since the end of August and will spend Christmas in America . Sturridge's latest injury was not connected to the one he suffered while on England duty in September . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks (min) Asked when the striker would return, Rodgers said: 'That will be just after the Christmas period.' 'The first stage of his rehab was in Los Angeles, he's gone to Boston and he will move on to a specialist facility there and hopefully in the early part of the new year he will be back. 'Some point in January we will get him back and that will be really exciting for this team.' The 25-year-old was injured just three games into the new season when he suffered a thigh strain in September while training with England for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland. Sturridge pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with Liverpool’s first-team in October and then picked up a fresh thigh injury in November that has ruled him out until the new year.

"For Celtic, the nature of this catastrophic Champions League defeat was bad enough. Yet they can take solace from one sobering fact: but for poor penalty taking and Fraser Forster they could, indeed should, have lost six. Bluntly, this was as close to another Artmedia Bratislava as the Parkhead side have come. Reduced to ten men by a red card for Efe Ambrose before half-time, the ten men kept the score down to four. Just. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Celtic boss Deila: We are favourites for qualifier . Turnaround: Miroslav Radovic (third left) celebrates his second goal which gave Legia Warsaw a 2-1 lead over Celtic .

Booked: Mulgrew, Griffiths, Kayal . Sent off: Ambrose . Goal: McGregor 8 . Referee: Pol van Boekel (Holland) Yet as . things stand Ronny Deila’s side are all but out of the Champions League. The debate over a lack of investment in new players will now reach a . deafening crescendo to eclipse the incessant din of an ecstatic Legia . Warsaw support in the Pepsi Arena last night. They . will make optimistic noises. They will speak of overhauling this . deficit and scoring three at their Murrayfield ‘home’. Yet the evidence . they can do so while keeping the back door shut is scant. After . a risky team selection, Deila watched his team capitulate in alarming . fashion here, losing two goals in the final six minutes on a night when . Legia’s Ivica Vdoljak also missed two penalties – Forster saving the . second. The chances of Scotland’s champions reaching the group stages of the Champions League now look wafer thin. They . hauled back a 2-0 deficit to Shakhtar Karagandy last season, but with . the excellent Miroslav Radovic in their ranks, Poland’s champions are a . level above the Kazakhstan team. On . another catastrophic European night for Ambrose the Nigerian defended . poorly for 44 minutes before recklessly chopping down Michal Kucharczyk . on the edge of the area in a goalscoring position. The . decision by the Dutch referee Pol van Boekel to show a red card was . correct. By then Celtic were already 2-1 down after the Legia dangerman . Radovic ran the Parkhead side ragged with a double. The . loss of the Nigerian was a blow, but a mixed blessing after a hopeless . performance. One which left the Scottish champions horribly and . hopelessly exposed.Charlie Mulgrew – instrumental in landing Ambrose . in trouble in the first place - moved into the centre of defence in the . second half. Taking advantage: Radovic (second left) pokes home from close range to give Legia a first half lead . Back on track: Radovic (left) celebrates scoring Legia's equaliser . Fine start: Callum McGregor (left) had opened the scoring for Celtic . Early smiles: McGregor celebrates his strike with Celtic team-mates . But . the captain almost made things worse when he gifted Legia a penalty in . 58 minutes, a lazy leg allowing Ondrej Duda to crumple in the box. Forster . went one way and penalty taker Ivica Vdoljak went the other. Thankfully . for Celtic the spot kick flew past the post. Forster would later guess . right when the same player took a second penalty in the dying moments of . this painful encounter to save further embarrassment. How . this night of humiliation transpired for Celtic is difficult to fathom. Like the boardroom spending policy, Deila’s team selection will . certainly come in for sharp scrutiny in the coming days. The . Norwegian raised eyebrows by throwing new signing Jo Inge Berget in for . a baptism of fire just 48 hours after joining the club on loan. The . decision failed miserably. After . 63 minutes he made way for Emilio Izaguirre, the left back left out to . make way for right-back Adam Matthews. On a bewildering night nothing . could fix this mess. It . started well enough. Callum McGregor putting Celtic ahead in seven . minutes. McGregor scored the winning goal on his European debut in . Reykjavik and followed that by smashing Celtic into the lead with strong . echoes of the goal in Iceland. The . 20-year-old received the ball from Teemu Pukki on the right flank and . cut inside the left back Tomasz Brzyski keeping his composure to keep . moving and smash a rising left-foot shot inside the left-hand post of . Dusan Kuciak from 18 yards. Reprieve: Skipper Ivica Vdoijak (left) sends his penalty wide for Legia . In the thick of it: Celtic's Jo Inge Berget was making his debut for the Hoops .

Running the line: Ondrej Duda (right) of Legia Warsaw tracks Stefan Johansen (centre) of Celtic . Battle for the ball: Celtic's Adam Matthews (centre) tries to keep possession from Legia Warsaw captain Ivica Vdoijak. For Celtic it was a start they could barely have scripted. Yet the twist in the first-half tale was swift, brutal and suicidal. Even . when the visitors scored Legia’s support never let up. Their fervour . was swiftly rewarded when their team levelled within three minutes . through the lively and irrepressible Radovic. Played . in by Michal Zyro on the right of the area, the striker should have . been closed down quickly by  Ambrose, but found time and space to strike . an angled shot through Forster. For . Celtic the equaliser was unfortunate, but no disaster. In attack they . carried a presence, Kris Commons almost striking the Scots back into the . lead in 23 minutes with a clever twist and turn which ended in a shot . over the bar. Yet . the main threat to Celtic’s hopes was self inflicted. Mikael Lustig . almost gifted a goal in 31 minutes, a slack pass in his own area allowed . Ondrej Duda a run on goal. It needed sharpness and pace from Virgil van . Dijk – who had a fine game here - to get across and cover for the . Swede. But in 36 minutes Legia scored a second. Again, the defending from the team in green shirts was alarming. A . lofted cross to the back post picked out Kucharczyk, his header back . across goal a meat and drink affair for Ambrose until the Nigerian . slipped. Radovic could scarcely believe his luck as the ball dropped . perfectly for a smash into the net from ten yards out. There . was misfortune in what happened to Ambrose, perhaps. But in common with . other European nights – most notably against Juventus in the last 16 . and against Barcelona in a 6-1 defeat – he had a pretty dismal night . here. The . misery of the World Cup defender was complete when he was red-carded . before the interval, Mulgrew’s failure to control the ball in midfielder . allowing Kucharczyk to nick in and slide the ball past the Nigerian as . he lunged in late. Glum: Injured Celtic captain Scott Brown (centre) looks on from pitchside . Rebuilding reputation: Former Blackburn boss Henning Berg was in charge of Legia Warsaw . Lining up: Celtic pose for a photograph before the third round Champions League qualifier . Keeping close eyes: Celtic boss Ronny Deila observes his side during the warm up . It was a red card, no question. One which left Celtic in an invidious and increasingly fraught situation.Beram . Kayal’s arrival at half-time for Pukki was intended to shore things up. Yet Legia blew two wonderful chances to make it 3-1. In . 53 minutes the excellent Radovic ghosted past van Dijk and played a . brilliant backheel into the path of Zyro. The attacker seemed odds on to . hammer a nail in Celtic’s coffin until Forster stuck out a knee to . produce a superb and crucial save. Five . minutes later the onus fell on Forster again. He got nowhere near the . Vdoljak penalty, guessing the wrong way. But when Celtic needed it most . luck was on their side as the ball rolled past the post.If luck was on their side then, it was to be in short supply as the game progressed. Playing . their intricate, neat passing moves Legia looked liable to score at . will. Somehow Celtic held firm until six minutes from time when Radovic . turned Izaguirre inside, his penetrating cross picking out Zyro for a . downward header into the corner of the net for 3-1. It . wasn’t over yet. Not for the first time in the match Forster kept . Celtic in it – just - by diving to save a second Vdoljak penalty after . Mulgrew tugged the substitute Kosecki back for a soft spot kick award. As . the board went up for full-time, however, the Englishman bore the look . of a modern day King Canute.

"Microsoft has unveiled its next-generation Xbox, the Xbox One - described as an 'all-in-one entertainment system for a new generation'. The Xbox One can be completely controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures, and with the new Instant Switching feature users can ask the Xbox to 'watch TV', 'open Internet Explorer' or use it to change channels quickly without having to find the remote control. Microsoft's Xbox One also comes with a multi-tasking Snap Mode that lets users run more than one service at any one time, such as watch a film while checking emails on Internet Explorer.

Xbox Live manager Marc Whitten said that voice recognition with the new Kinect sensor is 'more conversational and supports the voices of the whole family.' Whitten also explained that the Xbox controller has similarly been redesigned with more than 40 new . components and new D-Pad makes the controller 'more immersive.' Microsoft's new Xbox One console has improved voice controls that can switch TV channels, for example, and an updated Kinect sensor that can monitor users' movements.

The D-pad has also been tweaked to make the controller 'more immersive . An Xbox 360 controller in the foreground is compared to the new model on the Xbox One . Tom Parsons, Reviews Editor, Stuff, gave MailOnline his first impressions: . 'The Xbox One is clearly designed to blend into the lounge rather than stick out, so it’s not the most exciting looking device. It looks as though the Xbox One will perform very similarly to Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4 although rumour has it the Xbox One has slightly slower type of memory, which could prove to be a disadvantage. The way you interact with the consoles seems to be the big difference, though – the new Kinect’s advanced voice and gesture control should make it a very hands-off experience. If it works as well as Microsoft says it does. Because the Xbox One integrates all of your TV and web content, and can be controlled entirely through voice and gestures, it should appeal to plenty of non-gamers – as long as it doesn’t cost too much. I’m a little disappointed by the physical design and dimensions, especially of the Kinect camera, and I’m concerned that it might not be powerful enough for ultra high definition 4K graphics. One thing’s for sure – the battle between Sony and Microsoft looks like it’s going to be more fierce than ever when Xbox One and PS4 launch. Meanwhile, Microsoft confirmed tonight that the Xbox One will allow second-hand games to be played - for a small fee. A company spokesman said Microsoft was 'designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games'. This announcement follows concerns raised that single-code activations would effectively lock games to one of the new consoles. The new Xbox One is expected to launch 'later this year' and BlockBuster has already opened up pre-orders for the device with a £20 deposit. Ahead of tonight's event, Microsoft announced a new interactive TV show that will only be available Xbox Gold subscribers. The show, called 'The Music Room' starts on 29 May at 8.30pm. Microsoft will be looking to take aim at Nintendo, as well as Sony, with the launch of its new Xbox One. Sony was first to showcase plans for its upcoming PlayStation 4 - but not the actual box - at an event in New York last February. The reaction to that console, which featured richer graphics and more social features, was mixed. A new trailer for the PlayStation 4 was released yesterday ahead of today's Microsoft announcement.

"New Celtic signing Jo Inge Berget is looking to qualify for the Champions League following his move to the Parkhead club. The 23-year-old Norwegian international completed a six-month loan deal from Cardiff on Monday and went straight into the Hoops squad heading for Poland for the first leg of their Champions League third qualifier against Legia Warsaw on Wednesday night. Former Molde player Berget, who played for Parkhead boss Ronny Deila at Stromsgodset, said: 'It happened pretty fast. I heard a couple of days ago that Ronny was interested and I am really happy that it worked out. New signing: Jo Inge Berget poses with a Celtic shirt at the check-in desk at Glasgow airport .

'He wants to play football, entertaining football, the same as me so hopefully it will be a good match.' Berget made two appearances for Cardiff after switching to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in January - playing just 72 minutes across back-to-back home defeats - but now he is hoping to revive his career under his former boss. Relegation scrap: Berget had a difficult time at Cardiff but has now moved away on a six-month loan deal . 'I have been in the qualification before but have never played in the Champions League so hopefully I will be able to go there. 'I know it (Celtic) is the biggest club in Scotland, one of the biggest clubs in Great Britain and hopefully we will get to the Champions League. 'That is the goal for the club and it should be a goal for the club as big as it is. 'This is a great opportunity for me, it is a great club and I hope it works well. 'It is up to me.

"Ronny Deila assessed Tony Watt and found a footballer with talent and pace to burn. A local boy who had been a Celtic supporter all his life. But when the Norwegian looked a little closer he detected none of the dedication and selfless sacrifice required to be a lifelong Celtic servant. A former schoolteacher, the Norwegian issued a blunt warning to the current crop of Parkhead players. Scoring a winning goal against Barcelona at the age of 19 is no guarantee of a long Parkhead career. Departed: Tony Watt in action for Celtic in a pre-season friendly against FC St Pauli before his move . Unless young players progress and show a willingness to devote themselves to Deila’s culture of slavish professionalism, they will be shown the door just like Watt, who was sold to Standard Liege for £1.3million on Monday. Echoing some of the criticisms made by Neil Lennon and Stanley Menzo, coach of Lierse where Watt spent last season on loan, Deila answered supporters’ queries over his sale by delivering a damning verdict. ‘I have talked a lot with Tony and he knows that to develop you have to train 100 per cent every day,’ he said. ‘You have to be prepared every day. You have to sacrifice everything to improve. ‘Tony took a few small steps - but he has still a lot to work on. He has a big talent but he also has a history at Celtic which makes it harder for him to come through than I think it will be in Belgium. ‘He has the chance to start all over and try to take with him some of the things we have talked about. Maybe one day he can come back to Celtic again and be the star he wants to be.’ Too much too soon: Watt shot to fame when he scored the winner against Barcelona in 2012 aged just 19 . Right now few would care to bet on what the future holds for the Coatbridge striker. If the penny drops in Belgium he can be a Scotland mainstay for years. If he stubbornly refuses to listen to the well-meaning advice of a succession of coaches, he could just as easily be driving a taxi in five years time. ‘It’s about education,’ said Deila. ‘There are many things that go through the heads of young players. ‘Think back to how you were when you were aged between 17 and 20. I know I made a lot of mistakes when I was that age. ‘But you learn from experience. The difference between a very good talent and a not so good talent is how they learn as they grow up. Learn from the mistakes and take with you the positives. ‘Tony hasn’t progressed as we wanted so far and I think that’s because he hasn’ t been getting into the right culture, realising the consequences and changing his mentality. Destined for greatness: After rising to fame as a teenager the club expected huge things from Watt . Pedigree: Watt celebrates scoring a Champions League goal for Celtic at Celtic Park in November 2012 . Teamwork: But Deila has questioned Watt's dedication and commitment to football following his Celtic exit . ‘Now it’s good for him to start all over and to be the professional he needs to be to get to the highest level that he can.’ Watt angrily dismisses question marks over his attitude or professionalism. He admits he was never the strongest trainer, but refutes suggestions that a famous goal against Barca went to his head. Or that his diet and off-field discipline was lax. ‘When you see Fraser Forster, Emilio Izaguirre and Efe Ambrose, you are looking at top professional players,’ added Deila. ‘They work so hard, stay after training, go to bed at 10 o’clock - they do everything perfect. It’s no coincidence those three were playing at the World Cup Finals. The culture they have is the one we want to give to the young Scottish players. ‘Also, we have guys like Charlie Mulgrew and Scott Brown who give 100 per cent every day, every time they step on to a pitch. My job is to make that culture throughout the club. The young players have to look up to people like this and realise the standard they need every day.” Watt has proclaimed himself delighted with the move to Belgium, where he enjoyed a measure of success on loan last season. Earning good money at a top European club can hardly be described as a penance for bad behaviour, yet on Saturday in Hamburg the striker was expressing the wish to stay with Celtic for a very long time. All ears: Celtic players listen to a team talk from Deila during a pre-season friendly . The club – and Deila – had other ideas. Asked what will happen to any young player who follows Watt’s lead at Parkhead, he said bluntly: ‘You have no chance. No player can achieve his dreams if he does not work. ‘It’s about commitment. If you say to yourself you are going to be a Celtic player you have to change. ‘You have to commit, you have to make that sacrifice. ‘It’s not just about Tony – it’s the same with all players. If you don’t accept the consequences of your actions you will look back and say at the end of your career: “I was a good footballer, but I was just a player at Celtic.” ‘If you really listen, if you really do it, you can be a legend at Celtic. ‘I was one of these guys. I wasn’t the greatest talent as a player, but I could have been much better than I was because I didn’t sacrifice everything. ‘I didn’t get the treatment or learn what is important. I want the staff here to be like a library – one where the players can borrow whatever knowledge they need to improve.’","Watt rose to prominence after scoring the winner at the Nou Camp at 19 .

"Feared murdered: Heiress Janet Brown vanished in 2005, police say her inheritance has been left untouched . Detectives fear an heiress who inherited £1million but never touched it may have been murdered. Police have been seen digging up land behind the rural family home of Janet Brown, 51, who vanished in 2005. When she went missing friends of the TV extra and property developer from Lowgate, Northumberland, were not immediately worried as she was known to travel abroad often. But when Miss Brown didn't show up to either of her parent's funerals her friends told police they feared the worst, The Sun reported. Detectives discovered budding actress Miss Brown hadn't touched her inheritance and there had been mysterious activity in her dead parents' bank accounts. A man, 57, and a 63-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and were released on police bail. Last night a source told The Sun: 'It doesn't take a genius to work out they're looking for a body.' Friend Sheila Watchorn, 66, told the paper: 'We're convinced she's been murdered.' Police spent much of last Wednesday searching and digging on land at Plane Trees Farm, in Lowgate. Current tenant John Cairns told local paper, The Hexham Courant, police had been digging up the field periodically for the last 18 months. Mystery: Detectives have been digging in fields surrounding Plane Trees Farm, in Lowgate . He added detectives told him their investigation into what happened to Miss Brown had taken them to Spain, Italy and Thailand. 'They can’t tell me much,' he said.

"Students in China are reportedly being forced to assemble Sony's forthcoming Playstation 4 or risk failing their course. IT engineering students at China's Xi'an Institute of Technology claim they were made to glue parts of the console together in factory conditions in order to earn course credits. Chinese media say students were given unpaid 'internships' at the world's largest electronics manufacturer,  Foxconn, but were given manual work instead of tasks directly related to their studies. Students claim they were forced to assemble Sony's Playstation 4 at a Foxconn plant or fail their course. Pictured: Paid workers at a Foxconn factory in Guangdong . Jobs at the company's Yantai plant included peeling off the protective plastic from the console and putting stickers on it, according to reports. Other students were involved in distribution and shipping. Even more menial roles included putting the instruction manual into the boxes, Games In India reported. If the jobs were refused the students lost six credits and therefore jeopardised their chance of graduation. Foxconn said it has launched an internal investigation after finding a 'few instances' where students worked work nights and overtime. The company said the internships give students the opportunity to gain practical work experience and training. Sony Computer Entertainment president Andrew House introduces the new PlayStation 4 in June . A spokeswoman told Mail Online: 'All participating schools are required to follow specific policies established by Foxconn for this program including assurances that participation is voluntary, interns are free to terminate their internship at any time they choose, and interns are not allowed to take part in overtime work or work night shifts. 'In the case of recent allegations regarding the Internship Program at our Yantai campus, we have conducted an internal investigation and have determined that there have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced. 'Immediate actions have been taken to bring that campus into full compliance with our code and policies.' Mail Online has contacted Sony but no one was immediately available for comment. It is not the first time Foxconn has been accused of poor working practices. Hundreds of workers rioted at a Foxconn plant in Chengdu, southwest China, last year over perceived long hours and low pay. Foxconn, which employs about one million people, makes many of the world's most popular gadgets, including Apple's iPhone and iPad, the Amazon Kindle and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles.","Xi-an Institute of Technology students given 'internships' at Foxconn .

"A school netball team have been banned after reaching the national finals of a tournament - because of a 10p debt. Central Newcastle High School's under-16s and under-18s teams made their way through county and regional heats earlier this year, but as the girls trained for the upcoming national finals, they were told they had been disqualified. The private girls' school pays an annual subscription to be affiliated to England Netball and enter the competition, open to all schools. The under 18 netball team of Central High School in Newcastle, with student Farah Hasan holding a 10 pence piece - the root of their dispute with England Netball . The under 18s, pictured and the under 16 netball teams of Central Newcastle High School, reached the national finals of a schools tournament, but have been banned because they underpaid on their subscription . For the 2011/2012 they paid £24 of the £24.10 fee and were put on a debtors list without their knowledge. This meant they were not sent an invoice to pay their subscription for 2012/13. Once staff found out about the outstanding money, the school paid up. Despite appeals over the ban, England Netball have refused to back down, meaning the girls cannot fight for the title at next month's finals in Basildon, Essex. Headmistress Hilary French said: 'It all seems very petty to me. We have always paid our subscriptions for all the different sports played here. 'We . weren't made aware of the small underpayment and we didn't get any . further bills - either about the 10p or the fee for affiliation to . England Netball the next year. 'It was only when two teams reached the finals that we were told about the problem.' Mrs French said: 'We paid straight . away once we found out. It was only raised once we reached the finals, . that's when we were told we were disqualified. 'I guess they make extra . checks before the finals but we have paid and it's very unfair on the . girls.' 'Our PE teachers are some of the busiest staff in the school and because they didn't receive a bill, the payment was not made. 'We made a mistake and we did everything we could to rectify it immediately. Headteacher Hilary French said her students were 'very upset' after England Netball refused to let them compete in the national finals after they settled their debt . 'All of this has happened because of an unpaid 10p. The girls are very upset - they've trained a lot and they reached the finals.' Mrs French said: 'They've been able to compete so far, I guess technically they were not supposed to have but we didn't know at the time. 'Yes we made a mistake, but we paid at the earliest opportunity and they should take that into account. 'It's frustrating. It feels like the girls are being unfairly penalised for something that is not their fault.' The school's Head of PE, Jackie Atkinson, was named England Netball's Coach of the Year in 2009. Mrs French added: 'Jackie is a coach to the girls and she's a netball fanatic. 'She is so disappointed and hopes something can be done before March.' The school also won the sporting body's Endeavour Award in 2010 to acknowledge the number of times its teams had reached the finals. Mrs French said: 'We've hosted competitions for England Netball for free before and two of our staff are due to go on a training course with them. England Netball said Central Newcastle High School was the only school not to pay their annual subscriptions properly . 'They had to give our school's affiliation number and that all seemed to go through fine.' A spokesperson for England Netball said: 'England Netball has eligibility criteria for its National Schools Competition. ""This includes schools responsibility to affiliate to England Netball prior to the start of the competition. 'Central Newcastle High School failed to affiliate in accordance with these time scales and therefore it is with much regret that England Netball was unable to accept their entry into the National Schools Final. 'All other entrants to the National Schools Final adhered to England Netball's affiliation process.'","Central Newcastle High School's under 18s and under 16s made the finals .

"Ronny Deila knows his success at Celtic will be gauged on silverware. On his ability to deliver Champions League football and domestic dominance on an annual, undisturbed, basis. And yet for this educated, single-minded Norwegian, the cups and trophies are not his prime motivation. They are not his raison d’etre. Dermot Desmond, Peter Lawwell and Celtic supporters may feel differently, but for Deila it’s about the experiences. The sensations. Here is an idealist who wants to manage Celtic in Europe and feel goosebumps on his arms. New challenge: Ronny Deila is looking ahead to a new challenge with Scottish giants Celtic . Vision: Deila wants Celtic to make a mark on European football playing the right way . ‘My dream with Celtic is to go to Celtic Park for a Champions League match, play a really big European team and control the game. I want to have more passes than the opposition and really just blow them away. That’s my dream,’ he said. ‘For me, it is about moments. Trophies are important, but I don’t remember the trophies I won in Norway. ‘I remember the moments - driving to the stadium, seeing the people happy. Playing fantastic football to win the game and the young kids are smiling - I get goosebumps from that. ‘When I came to watch Celtic play Barcelona at home last season, it was unbelievable. Think what it would be like if Celtic could also control the game? That would be awesome, fantastic - and that’s my dream.’ All of this is well and good. But the truth is this. Ronny Deila will only hang around to sample these moments as a Celtic manager if he wins games. If he consistently delivers trophies and Champions League qualification. He takes a major step towards that goal in Poland this evening. Celtic arrived in Warsaw, the country’s capital city, to soaring temperatures of 31 degrees centigrade. The tar may not be melting on the streets, but a certain degree of expectation is bubbling under the surface here. Excited: Deila is relishing the opportunity to take Celtic to the next level . All ears: Celtic players listen to a team talk from Deila during a pre-season friendly . Scotland’s champions are marginal favourites. Yet Legia Warsaw fancy their chances of an upset. Even if no Polish team has competed in the Champions League group stage for 17 years. In this old city, they speak freely of Celtic being weaker than they used to be. Former Parkhead striker Maciej Zurawski claims his old team are nowhere near the calibre of line-up he performed in under Gordon Strachan. There can’t be many who recall Dion Dublin or Paul Telfer being world beaters, but Zurawki has given rise to a common view in Poland. Under Henning Berg, Legia Warsaw are no great shakes themselves. But their confidence is pinned on a growing conviction that the same might be said of Celtic. ‘We are meeting a team who could fight for playing in the Champions League group stages,’ acknowledged Deila. ‘They have a goal to do this and they are capable. ‘I think we are going to have two very close games and small details are going to prove the difference, as it did last year for Celtic and the year before. They had some very close matches.’ Deila, a coach with precious little real experience at this level, declared himself ‘comfortable’ with his team’s chances. Yet there are plenty of observers – and they are not all Polish - who suspect that this Celtic team lack the depth and quality to reach the group stages for a third successive year. Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama, Kelvin Wilson, Joe Ledley and Georgios Samaras have gone, while captain Scott Brown is injured. Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk have not departerd yet, but the only new faces are Craig Gordon - a goalkeeper who hasn’t played a competitive game for two years - and Jo Inge Berget, a Cardiff City loan signing who has barely kicked a ball in six months. Unfazed, however, Deila said: ‘I have seen my players for a month now and I’ve seen the quality in the squad. So, if we can manage to get the best out of them for this match then I know we have a very good chance to beat Legia. Confident: Deila will back himself to do well in the Parkhead hotseat . ‘Of course we want a good result here and if we win then it’s a good result. But it’s not easy to win away from home and I know at their own ground they will attack us very hard. ‘The players have to prepare, have to know what they are going to meet and how we’re going to go into the game. ‘If we do that well, I see in the squad we have a lot of good football players.’ On the persistent suggestions from current and former Legia players that Celtic are no longer the team they were at this level, Deila is dismissive. ‘Maybe there is a bit of disrespect. But they can say a lot of things,’ he said. ‘I think how we are feeling is much more important than how the others are thinking.’ The arrival of attacker Berget strengthens Deila’s options. Yet it’s hard to see how the new man can be fit or sharp enough to make a positive contribution to a team in need of first-choice, quality signings. As he must, Berget believes he can make a positive difference to the squad and claims he can play some role against Legia and his former Lyn coach Henning Berg. ‘I’m not expecting to go right in and start,’ said the 23-year-old Norwegian international, ‘but if I get the chance then I can tell the coach that I’m ready and I’m going to take it. ‘It’s not bad to maybe get a debut in the Champions League qualification, so I hope I can make a contribution. Competitive: Deila wants to make Celtic a force to be reckoned with in Europe . ‘I am match fit. I haven’t played many first-team games for Cardiff, but many for the second team and I played three or four national games during that time. I also played pre-season, so I feel fit.’ Deila knows Berget well after taking him on loan from Udinese for 18 months while coach of Stromsgodset. Neither is Legia coach Berg a stranger to his abilities. ‘Henning was my coach at Lyn and we were together for some years,’ explained Berget. ‘When I first started up at 15 he was my first coach and introduced me to senior football. ‘He played a big part in my development so it will be fun with the two coaches involved tomorrow night. ‘Playing under Ronny was kind of where I made my breakthrough. I owe him a lot - and I hope I can repay him here.’","While he knows he will be judged on his trophy haul at Celtic the new man's dream is to control European opposition and entertain the crowd .

"Gareth Bale believes Wales’ late comeback victory against Andorra can provide the springboard for Euro 2016 qualification. In a match that at one stage looked like it might ask questions of Chris Coleman’s job, Bale produced a brace to claim three points. But despite the ground-out nature of the win against a team ranked 199 in the world, the Real Madrid star thinks Wales will take renewed positivity into matches with other Group B rivals Belgium, Bosnia, Cyprus and Israel. Match winner: Gareth Bale scored a free-kick with just nine minutes to go to hand his side all three points . Bend It Like Bale: The Real Madrid star spared his side's blushes by curling the ball into the net . ‘This gives us confidence for what's ahead,’ said Bale. ‘All we could do now was get the three points - no matter how we did it. ‘It's a good start but now the next game is another final and we'll go into it confident we can get another win.’ Bale found the net with a superb header to equalise Ildefons Lima’s penalty, then cracked a free-kick nine minutes from time to seal the win. Positive start: Bale was pleased with the victory and insisted Wales' next game will be another cup final . ‘It was a good team performance,’ Bale added. ‘We knew from the start it was going to be difficult on that pitch. ‘They set up to defend. It wasn't the greatest of starts but we showed true character to keep going and come back like that.’ His free-kick winner actually came at the second attempt after his first was saved by Andorran goalkeeper Ferran Rol. But Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic spotted encroachment from Gabi Riera and ordered a retake. ‘Yes, thank God,’ said Bale. ‘The guy got a yellow card for coming too close and I did better second time around. It's great to get the winning goal for my country. Jumping for joy: Bale celebrates his winning goal 10 minutes from time in front of the travelling Welsh fans . ‘You are thinking the worst but we knew we had enough time to show our ability and the character in the squad. ‘We had massive possession of the ball, they made it difficult in their way, which is what they are going to do to every team. ‘But we showed our class, kept passing the ball as well as we could.’","Gareth Bale believes Wales comeback can provide springboard for Euro 2016 qualification .

"A pensioner who caught and killed a 'giant rat' measuring 4ft from nose to tail has received death threats from animal rights extremists. Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley, County Durham, used a lump of wood to bludgeon the creature on his farm last month. It was so heavy that he broke a paddle when trying to scoop it up. Scroll down for video . Death threats: Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley in County Durham has been targeted by animal rights activists after this picture of him holding a 'giant rat' he had killed emerged last month . Some observers believe the creature . was a coypu - a large South American rodent, also known as a river rat . or swamp beaver, which is bred for its fur. But the grandfather has now been targeted by animal rights activists who have labelled him a 'murderer' after a photo of him holding the monster emerged. He told Sky News: 'We've had quite a . few phone calls and letters off cranks saying I'm a murderer, that it . should be me that's clubbed to death because they're saying it's a . coypu. 'I know the difference between a rat . and a coypu, because I've lived in the country most of my life and it's . vermin, and vermin should be destroyed.

Some believe the animal was in fact a coypu, a South American rodent bred for its fur . Mr Watson said last month: 'I heard . him shouting there was a large rat. I came running round the corner. I . managed to grab some wood on the way. 'It wasn't very fast. I managed to kill it there and then. I've never seen a rat as big in my life before.' One reason it was quite slow is that it might have been pregnant. 'I think it was due to drop young 'uns,' Mr Watson added. The incident first came to light when . Mr Watson's friend, Bri Mitchell, posted a picture of the rodent after . it had been caught, on Twitter. Mr Watson said: 'We left it for a few . days, but word got round so we decided to destroy it and we chucked it . on the fire and got rid of it that way.' The RSPCA was last month seeking further information on the incident from members of the public. A spokesman for the charity said: 'We . would urge anyone with more information about this incident to contact . our cruelty line and we will look into it further.' Mr Watson said today: 'People saying I'm a murderer, that I kill wildlife, I love wildlife.

"Paul Gascoigne had to be helped to his feet after he lost control of a golf buggy he was driving and crashed into a ditch. The former England star, who was admitted to hospital a fortnight ago after an alcoholic relapse, was driving the 15mph buggy when it swerved off the course and into a grassy ditch at a golf course in Bournemouth. The former Tottenham and Lazio midfielder was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident, which happened at the Playgolf course in the south coast resort at 10.30am on Sunday. Crash: Paul Gascoigne (left) had to be helped after crashing his golf buggy - a beer can be seen on the ground . Dazed: Gazza was said to be unhurt after the incident, which happened at the Playgolf course on the south coast . Photographs of the incident show a can of Stella Artois amid the golf clubs which spilled as the buggy overturned. Peter Gilbert, head of operations at Playgolf Bournemouth, confirmed Gazza was at the wheel of the £18-a-time buggy, though he said it hadn't been hired out in his name. He told MailOnline the footballer and father of three was a regular and popular visitor to the course, which is near his home in the millionaire's enclave of Sandbanks, and said they never had any problems with him. Mr Gilbert said: 'He comes here once or twice a week, every week, and we never have any trouble with him - he's always happy to have his picture taken with children.' England soccer legend Paul Gascoigne being escorted from his Bournemouth home by police to an ambulance two weeks ago . Last month, Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Dorset. He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands. Neighbours called 999 for help after finding Gascoigne slumped against a wall, and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital. After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47, looking gaunt with sunken eyes, QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives in Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football. He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said ""I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids"". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation. 'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.' In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky. Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago. The accident happened at Playgolf in Bournemouth, where Gascoigne is a regular, and popular, visitor . Heyday: England star Gascoigne takes on West Germany during the 1990 World Cup semi-final . Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona. And for the past four years, Gazza has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre. Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it. I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.'","The 47-year-old former England player was helped to his feet after accident .

"Holed up: Julian Assange gestures from the balcony of Ecuador's embassy last month as it emerged his supporters have lost their bail money . High-profile supporters of fugitive Julian Assange have lost the £200,000 they gave for his bail, it was revealed yesterday. WikiLeaks . supporters including socialite Jemima Khan paid thousands of pounds . each as security to help its founder get bail while he fought . extradition to Sweden over accusations of rape and sexual assault, which . he denies. The cash was . forfeited when he broke his bail conditions and fled to the Ecuadorian . Embassy in London, where he remains, to ask for asylum. Nine other . supporters now face losing a further £140,000 offered as a ‘surety’ for . his bail unless they can persuade him to hand himself over to the . police. Assange, 41, entered the embassy in Knightsbridge on June 19 after losing the final stage of his appeal against extradition. Meanwhile, another handful of celebrities including socialite . Jemima Khan, journalist John Pilger, film director Ken Loach, publisher . Felix Dennis have already lost the £200,000 they stumped up between them to help free . him before he was bailed. They lost this money at a hearing in July when a judge ordered it to be forfeited. The nine backers who were today fighting to save their money are retired Professor Tricia David, Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston, who helped unravel the human genome, former Sunday Times journalist Philip Knightley, Lady Caroline Evans, wife of former Labour minister Lord Evans, his personal friend Sarah Saunders, a catering manager, Frontline Club founder Captain Vaughan Smith, who provided his Norfolk country mansion as a bail address. They all offered £20,000 sureties. Marchioness Tracy Worcester, 53, the . model and actress turned environmental campaigner, offered £10,000 while . his Wikileaks assistants Joseph Farrell and Sarah Harrison, both . stumped up £5,000 in return for his freedom. Today, lawyers at Westminster Magistrates Court argued the nine sureties could . not have 'talked him out of it' as it was a 'fait accompli' by the time . they realised Assange was jumping bail. Support: Celebrities including socialite Jemima . Khan, left, journalist John Pilger, film director Ken Loach, right, publisher Felix . Dennis have all confirmed they stumped up cash as security to help free Assange . Surety: Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston, left, who helped unravel the human genome, and Frontline Club founder Captain Vaughan Smith, right, have all offered £20,000 surety . 1. Professor Tricia David - £20,000 2. Lady Caroline Evans - £20,000 3. Joseph Farrell - £5,000 4. Sarah Harrison - £5,000 5. Philip Knightly - £20,000 6. Sarah Saunders - £20,000 7. Vaughan Smith - £20,000 8. Sir John Sulston - £20,000 9. Tracy Worcester - £10,000 . At the beginning of the hearing, Judge Riddle said it found it 'absolutely striking' that none of the nine had attended court in person. Henry Blaxland QC, representing four of the sureties, said Vaughan Smith, who owns the Frontline club where Assange has been staying, is making a documentary with the British Army in Afghanistan, while Lady Caroline was on holiday in Italy. Judge Riddle said: 'One can understand somebody is in Afghanistan, somebody else on holiday. 'But we have no explanation from the others.' Earlier, the judge threw out an attempt by Mr Blaxland to have today's hearing adjourned indefinitely until the situation had been resolved. The barrister earlier argued the court needed to hear the 'extent to which there is fault on behalf of the sureties.' He continued: 'The extent to which there is fault is open for debate. The purpose of this jurisdiction is not to punish - sureties themselves . may often be blameless - but simply it's a power of the court to ensure . a person on bail attends.' Mr Blaxland said there was 'no evidence any of the sureties are to blame for Mr Assange's failure to surrender. Bail: Assange in the grounds of the Norfolk home of Vaughan Smith which he offered as a bail address . 'His decision was entirely unforeseeable,' he said. 'It was an extraordinary thing to do. Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that's what he would do. 'The anxiety was not that he would . take the steps that he did but that he might abscond in the conventional . sense, or go into hiding. 'The police were put in an impossible . position - although they knew exactly where he was, and although they . knew he had breached his conditions of bail, they were essentially . powerless to act. Supporter: Marchioness Tracy Worcester, 53, the model and actress turned environmental campaigner, offered £10,000 . 'Short of persuading Mr Assange to abandon the course he had embarked upon, the sureties were in the same position. They are also in an invidious position in the peculiar circumstances here.' Giving evidence from the witness box . earlier, Det Sgt Mel Humphreys said Assange entered the embassy the day . before a ten-day period was to begin during which he could be . extradited. Asked by Mr Blaxland why he had not arrested Assange, he replied: 'Police officers do not go storming into an embassy. I do not go into an embassy uninvited.' The officer said he had sent a letter . demanding Assange surrender to police custody to his bail address, his . solicitors, and to the embassy, but the Wikileaks founder had refused. When he sought asylum Assange was . subject to bail conditions of living and sleeping each night at Ms . Saunders home in Kent, report each day to a police station, and adhere . to an electronically tagged curfew between 10pm and 8am. The . 41-year-old Australian has been holed-up in the South American embassy . for 12 weeks today and faces immediate arrest if he leaves as the . foreign secretary has refused to ensure him safe passage out of the . country. Assange has vowed to stay inside the tiny room in Knightsbridge for as long as it takes for Sweden to drop the allegations of sexual assault against two women in Stockholm in 2010. He claims to fear he will be extradited on to America because of his role in leaking thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and military files. He sought asylum just days after Britain’s highest court, the Supreme Court, refused to reopen his appeal against extradition. He was expected to be extradited within two weeks but could have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. While he remains inside the embassy he is beyond the reach of the authorities.","Wikileaks founder breached conditions by seeking political asylum before he was due to be extradited to Sweden to face sexual assault charges .

"A hotel boss ordered his staff to write bogus reviews of his hotel after it had a series of bad reviews online. Frank Long, who runs the Ramada Glasgow Airport Hotel, emailed his staff asking them to post glowing reviews of the hotel on TripAdvisor to boost its ratings. He wrote to his team: 'We could do with some positive comments'. Bogus: Frank Long, who runs the Ramada Glasgow . Airport Hotel, pictured, emailed his staff asking them to go online and post . glowing reviews of the hotel on TripAdvisor . He even asked his staff not to 'go overboard' so that the reviews appeared real. Mr Long then apparently vowed to 'deny everything' if details of the scam emerged. Soon reviews appeared on the travel review website, including one claiming it was the 'friendliest airport hotel ever' and made special reference to the quality of the staff. In his email, Mr Long advised his staff on how not to get caught by using a different email address. Genuine? This review said 'it's the staff who make it' and said it was the 'friendliest airport hotel anywhere' According to the Daily Record he . wrote: 'Do not overkill. Just good positive feedback such as: ‘Friendly . staff/good food/comfortable rooms etc’. 'Headings like brilliant/great/very nice always read well. It must not be seen we are adding comments ourselves.' One . staff member told the paper that Mr Long had been 'harassing people to . do reviews for ages' and said it was 'stupid' to have sent the email to . staff members. Mr Long . tried to deny sending the email claiming there 'wasn't a signature' on . it but then refused to make a comment when shown a copy of the message . by a reporter. Positive?

Rooms modern, clean and great great great laid out bathrooms!' Underneath, Mr Long has written: 'It is always nice to receive such comments'. Another review, entitled 'friendliest airport hotel anywhere', read: 'It's the staff who make it so: they turn an ordinary, run of the mill hotel into a pleasure, especially the bar and restaurant guys; anxious to please, jolly, motivated, and keen to make you feel at home.' Mr Long wrote: 'I was delighted to read that you found the food & beverage department to be excellent and I will of course ensure they are all aware of your comments.' Mr Long could not be reached when MailOnline contacted the hotel. However, a spokesman for Kew Green Hotels, which manages the hotel, said: 'Kew Green Hotels manages 23 hotels across the UK and take all guest feedback very seriously including online reviews on websites including TripAdvisor. 'A member of the management team at one of the hotels that we manage has been accused of manipulating the reviews. 'We do not condone this and it is against our company policy to write or encourage others to write manufactured reviews.  We have initiated an investigation and will take any action that may be appropriate once it is completed.' A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'Our specialist Content Integrity team is investigating this issue as a matter of urgency, and if the hotel has been attempting to manipulate the TripAdvisor system they will be penalised accordingly. 'We take our responsibility as the world’s largest travel site extremely seriously, and employ a zero tolerance policy on fraudulent reviews. 'In addition to being a violation of our terms of service and an unethical practice, review fraud is also a violation of the law in many countries including the United Kingdom.'","General manager Frank Long vowed to 'deny everything' if details of the scam emerged .

"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has become the latest former Leeds United striker to put himself forward for the vacant manager's job. The Dutchman, who played at Elland Road between 1997 and 1999, follows Robbie Fowler in expressing an interest. Leeds are searching for a new manager following the sacking of David Hockaday last month and Hasselbaink, speaking to talkSPORT, played up his credentials. Hat in the ring: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has expressed an interest in the vacant Leeds United manager's job . Goal machine: Hasselbaink scored 42 goals for Leeds United during his two seasons at the club . He told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast: 'Leeds United is a wonderful big club where I had two great years. If they want to talk to me, of course I would talk [to them]. 'I've got experience, I know I could take the club forward and I know I can take the club back to where they need to go. 'But what do Leeds United themselves want? That's the most important question. How do they see things? 'At the moment there are so many things going on they need to sort out first, or maybe they have already. 'But if they want to talk to me, of course I would be interested. Who doesn't want to manage Leeds United? It's one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country.' In the frame: Robbie Fowler, who played for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, is also keen on the job . Brief stay: David Hockaday was sacked as Leeds manager after just six matches in charge . Owner Massimo Cellino returns from a trip to the United States on Thursday and will start to consider applicants. Hasselbaink, 42, only has one season of management experience with Belgian second division club Royal Antwerp, though he did have a spell as a coach at Nottingham Forest. He scored 42 goals in 87 appearances for the Yorkshire club during his two seasons there before moving to Atletico Madrid in Spain. Fowler, who turned out for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, has been pushed forward for the vacancy by intermediaries. Decision time: Owner Massimo Cellino will make a decision on Hockaday's replacement in the coming days . Caretaker charge: Neil Redfearn will manage Leeds for their trip to Birmingham this weekend . The former Liverpool striker spent time as a player-coach at Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching back at Anfield with former favourites Steve McManaman and Rob Jones. Academy manager Neil Redfearn will be in charge for Saturday's Sky Bet Championship trip to Birmingham City and Cellino said he has 'not heard of anyone better to look after the team.' However, the 49-year-old, who is entering his third spell in caretaker charge at the club, is understood to have reservations about taking the job on permanently. Cellino is keen to appoint a British coach and will be heartened that Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton are among those in contention.","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink admits interest in vacant Leeds United job .

Substitutes now used: Bone, Pineida, Plata, Ramirez, Mina Meza, Gruezo . Referee: Edvin Jurisevic (USA) Following on from the weekend's win over Colombia in Miami, new coach Dunga - who replaced Luis Felipe Scolari following the tournament - was encouraged by the victory. 'There weren't any negative points,' he said. 'You have to take the positives from the negatives. You learn, you evolve. So for me it was all positive. 'The players played well against two very good teams. The team raised its ability depending on how difficult the situations were. All the players on this team I felt made the most of their opportunities in these games.' Brazil were some way from their best but with just seven survivors from the World Cup squad on the United States trip, it will take time to again forge a successful side.

"Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, says his class action against Facebook for privacy breaches has 60,000 supporters . A class action against Facebook by an Austrian law student has garnered 60,000 supporters who are all claiming £400 compensation each. Max Schrems is leading the Europe-V-Facebook challenge, which 25,000 people from around the world put their names on  by the time it was handed to a court in Vienna. Since then another 35,000 have joined the action and will be included if the case is expanded. The online activists have taken the claim to court as they believe Facebook breached their data protection rights, claiming the web giant supplied personal information to the U.S. Prism spy programme, . The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year. Mr Schrems said Vienna Regional Court had confirmed the lawsuit had been accepted and that Facebook had been ordered to respond. He said: 'The order is very likely on the way to Facebook. The first step in the legal procedure is hereby taken.' The social networking site, run by Mark Zuckerberg, now has four weeks to reply but can ask for an extension to double the timeframe. Mr Schrems said that the court in the Austrian capital would have the power to make a judgment in the absence of a counter-statement from the social network. His campaign has been overwhelmed with support since it was launched at the start of the month, with 7,000 users a day from more than 100 countries registering their backing at its height. Law student Mr Schrems is claiming damages of  £397 (€500) per supporter for the alleged violations . The lawsuit is being taken in Vienna Regional Court against the Irish subsidiary of Facebook . Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, which could have to pay nearly £400 in compensation each to thousands of activists who feel their privacy has been violated by the internet giant . Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8m. As it stand the company could still have to pay more than £9.9m if they lose the case. The action is being taken against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant. The class action claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data and it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites, including the use of 'like' buttons. An earlier landmark battle launched in Ireland to find out what Facebook tells US spy chiefs was referred to the European Court of Justice by a judge in Dublin last month. Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users and is worth around £118bn on the stock market. Facebook declined to comment, though founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously denied any link between Prism and his company. The allegations centre around three main concerns including: . Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities. External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons. Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours. Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page. It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films. When a user searches for something, that search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves as a title for the page. Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile.","Max Schrems has passed a class action against Facebook to a Vienna court .

"Actor Ray Winstone – famed for his tough-guy roles – has dismissed the building of the Olympic Stadium in 2012 as a ‘f***ing con’ and criticised the failure of the Games to revitalise London’s East End, where he was born. The Sexy Beast and Scum star questioned whether Britain should have hosted the Olympics in 2012 when it was struggling to pay for essential services such as the NHS and schools. The actor likened ‘corrupt’ members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ‘white-collar gangsters’ and even dismissed Lord Coe as a ‘puppet’. Scroll down for video . Actor Ray Winstone, who has criticised the failure of the Olympic Games to revitalise London's East End . He said: ‘The building of the actual stadium was a complete f***ing con. 'It wasn’t the Olympics themselves I objected to – I really admire the athletes and the effort and dedication they put in – I just looked around at East London and thought, “When we’ve built the hospitals and paid the teachers to be teachers and stopped closing all the fire stations down, maybe then we can afford this, but at the moment it’s an outrageous f***ing liberty.”’ He added: 'The Olympic organisation isn’t really about the sport, it’s about the building, and when I see the people who run the committee – not so much Lord Coe, but he’s a puppet, anyway – they look like white-collar gangsters to me. Mr Winstone branded the building of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford as a 'f***king con' 'The corruption isn’t just a side issue, it’s at the heart of the whole enterprise.’ Winstone, 57, has criticised the Games before but his latest comments, which appear in his new autobiography, Young Winstone, are his strongest attacks to date.

"You don’t get many of these to the pound! The original artwork behind vintage innuendo-laden English seaside postcards is going on sale – with price tags in the thousands. More than 100 Donald McGill originals are included in the sale and exhibition – including risqué images that once sparked an obscenity trial. This postcard, titled 'Just arrived all merry and bright', has a price set at £2,250 . Left, the card reads: 'I'm astonishing the natives here'. It's price is £2,750. On the £2,250 postcard to the right, the man remarks: 'This place gives me such an appetite I can eat anything that's put on the table here' For £2,250, you can purchase this postcard, titled: 'Well Sir, you said that to succeed I must begin at the bottom' When they were first produced, the postcards were considered offensive. In this one, on sale for £2,250, the woman remarks: 'The postcards down here are positively disgusting! I must send you one!' This black and white card can be bought for only £950. It's titled: 'I'm seeing all the sights from here' Chris Beetles, whose Mayfair gallery is selling the pictures, said: ‘McGill’s postcards are part of the cultural memory of the nation.’ McGill produced more than 12,000 designs from 1904 until his death at the age of 87 in 1962. Featuring overbearing mother-in-laws and randy newlyweds, more than 200 million cards were sold. His most popular sold more than six million and featured a bookish man asking a pretty woman: ‘Do you like Kipling?’ and her replying: ‘I don’t know, you naughty boy, I’ve never kippled!’ But McGill’s popularity took a battering in the 1950s when his cards were branded obscene and several local councils banned them. McGill was put on trial under the Obscene Publications Act, and pleaded guilty – marking the beginning of the end of the double-entendre postcard industry. Beetles said: ‘Nowadays we regard the cards as light-hearted but they didn’t in 1954. The authorities made sure they got him before the world changed.’ The exhibition opens on Wednesday but almost a quarter of the work has already been sold. McGill himself received only three guineas per design and didn’t own the copyright. He left just £735 when he died. The designs are being sold by the Donald McGill archive, which has decided to scale back its collection.","Original artwork behind vintage Donald McGill postcards up for sale .

Bruce initially begins her interview by teasing him about his obsession with the movie blockbuster. She says: ‘And are you by any chance a Star Wars super-geek? I am kind of getting that impression.’ Before 44-year-old Lane can answer the question, Bruce says: ‘Don’t even deny it. You were going to, weren’t you? Don’t bother.’ Bruce – who says she is a great fan of the original film – then tells him that although the helmet is difficult to value, the show’s experts believe it could be worth between £40,000 and £50,000. She then expresses her own surprise at the valuation, referring to the helmet as ‘this bit of plastic’ – only to be corrected by Lane, who describes it as ‘this beautiful sculpt of plastic’. First appearance: The helmet features in the original Star Wars film in 1977 which starred Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The three will reprise their roles in a new film released next year . The artefact is known as a TIE pilot helmet, after the ‘twin ion engine’ craft piloted by the evil forces of the Empire, and is seen in the film’s climactic battle in which hero Luke Skywalker is locked in a dogfight before the Death Star is destroyed. Just 14 were made for the original film and Lane bought his from a member of the crew who had kept it in his attic. The Star Wars series of films is one of the most lucrative in the history of cinema. A seventh instalment featuring original cast members Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill is currently being filmed for release next year. Antiques Roadshow is on BBC 1 tonight at 8pm.

The young Bardot may have regarded herself as ugly, but within a few short years of this picture being taken she would be a fantasy figure for men across the globe. The Paris-born actress had already made 16 films before her starring role in Roger Vadim’s 1956 movie And God Created Woman turned her into an international icon. In 1969 she received the ultimate accolade when she was chosen as the first face of Marianne, symbol of the French Republic. But the star grew tired of the movies and the celebrity, and she retired in 1973 after making more than 40 films. Now, just turned 80, Bardot devotes herself to her beloved animal rights causes.

"Void: Dame Maggie with her late husband Beverley Cross in 1987 . Her redoubtable character in Downton Abbey may be about to rekindle an old love, but Dame Maggie Smith has opened up about the loneliness she feels in real life. The 79-year-old actress says she has still not been able to fill the ‘awful’ and ‘deafening’ void left by the death of her second husband, playwright and librettist Beverley Cross, in 1998. Dame Maggie, who plays Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham in the hit ITV drama, said: ‘They say it [the pain] goes away but it doesn’t. It just gets different. ‘It’s awful, but what do you do? After the busy-ness you are more alone, much more. A day that is absolutely crowded keeps your mind away from why you are alone but when it stops, that is the deafening silence.’ The double Oscar winner married Cross – best known for his translation of the French farce Boeing-Boeing – in 1975, and they were together until he died. The actress was previously married to the actor Robert Stephens, the father of her two sons, Chris Larkin and Toby Stephens. In a candid interview with the Daily Telegraph, Dame Maggie, who has won a new fanbase thanks to her leading roles in Downton Abbey and the Harry Potter films, also reveals for the first time that she is no longer under the illusion that acting for the camera is an easy ride compared with live theatre. ‘In the theatre you knew you had to go there and you had a length of time to prepare yourself and then you did it,’ she says. ‘But TV is like being on demand every minute of what seems to me to be 12-hour days or more. ‘Wherever I got the idea that working in film or TV would not be so stressful as the theatre, I do not know. It’s an incredibly tough life. Bette Davis was right. Old age is not for sissies and old age is not for television because it is so relentless. ‘The young are terrific but even they get tired.’ Dame Maggie revealed she loved her scenes with Downton co-star Penelope Wilton, who plays friend and confidante Isobel Crawley. Formidable: The actress as the Dowager Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey . She added: ‘Penelope and I have a great time. We play endless Bananagrams [a word game]. She makes me laugh a lot and we talk about the books we read.’ The actress, who is set to start work on a film version of Alan Bennett’s The Lady In The Van, said she regarded her role as Professor McGonagall in Harry Potter as ‘her pension’ and was delighted to have been able to help pay for the education of her five grandchildren: ‘I’m on my own, so it’s lovely to help them.’","The 79-year-old actress lost her second husband Beverley Cross in 1998 .

"Professional golfer Bubba Watson has put down the golf clubs and picked up the microphone. Watson - who is currently fourth in the world golf rankings - has released a hilarious new Christmas rap video in which he assumes his festive-season alter ego named Bubba Claus. In it, alongside an elvish crew, he raps about his golf hovercraft, delivering gifts on a John Deere tractor, his Christian faith and his son's inability to sleep on Christmas Eve. Scroll down for video . Professional golfer Bubba Watson pictured with his Christmas crew in his new rap video .

"Disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne compared himself to 3rd Century Christian martyr Saint Sebastian in an interview the night before he was jailed for passing his speeding points to his wife, it has emerged. ‘It’s been a very long process,’ said Huhne. ‘My QC said his vision of me was Saint Sebastian having all these arrows coming in from all directions, which is sometimes what it’s felt like over the last few months.’ His interviewer, the transvestite potter Grayson Perry, replied: ‘But Saint Sebastian didn’t bring it on himself.’ The disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne (right) compared himself to 3rd Century Christian martyr Saint Sebastian (left) in an interview the night before he was jailed for passing his speeding points to his wife . Huhne replied: ‘We don’t know that. He might have.’ Sebastian was sentenced to death by being tied to a stake and facing a ‘firing squad’ of archers by Emperor Diocletian because of his Christian faith. He survived and was rescued, only to be clubbed to death later. Huhne’s astonishing comments came in a new documentary Grayson Perry: Who Are You? to be shown this month. Perry observed that 60-year-old Huhne’s conviction for perverting the course of justice, for which he was jailed for eight months, hadn’t changed him at all. Huhne’s ‘Teflon confidence’ was evident last week when he complained to The Mail on Sunday about our report.

His lawyers claimed a ‘wicked coven’ plotted to bring him down.

"When Ed Sheeran played in front of thousands of fans at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Concert, he may well have felt strangely at home. For the chart-topping singer has revealed that, as a teenager struggling to make his mark in the music industry, he slept rough under an arch next to the Palace. Now 23 – and despite becoming one of Britain’s leading stars with an estimated fortune in excess of £7million and with his latest album X topping the charts on both sides of the Atlantic – the memory of being homeless has left an indelible legacy in one of his songs. Scroll down for video . Ed Sheeran, right, was not always in a position to perform beside seven-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift . Since his success, however, he is more likely to be invited inside rather than sleeping on a hot vent outside . Sheeran said: ‘There was an arch outside Buckingham Palace that has a heating duct and I spent a couple of nights there. ‘That’s where I wrote the song Homeless and the lines “It’s not a homeless night for me, I’m just home less than I’d like to be.” ’ Sheeran described his unorthodox living arrangements in a new book called A Visual Journey, which charts his rise to the top. The star was 16 when he moved from Suffolk to London in 2007 to study at music college. But when the course ended, he no longer had a grant to pay for the rent and had to carve out a living performing gigs and selling CDs from a rucksack. He spent the next two and a half years sleeping on London Underground trains or ‘sofa surfing’ in friends’ homes. He said: ‘I didn’t have anywhere to live for much of 2008 and the whole of 2009 and 2010, but somehow I made it work. ‘I knew where I could get a bed at a certain time of night and I knew who I could call at any time to get a floor to sleep on. Being sociable helped. Drinking helped.’ Sheeran, who has written hits for One Direction and Taylor Swift, said he found his nomadic existence enjoyable but admitted there were some ‘hairy’ periods. ‘I spent a week catching up on sleep on Circle Line trains,’ he said. ‘I’d go out and play a gig, wait until 5am when the Underground opened, sleep on the Circle Line until 12, go to a session – and then repeat. It wasn’t that bad. ‘It’s not like I was sleeping rough on the cold streets.’ As a struggling performer, Sheeran has admitted he slept on the street outside Buckingham Palace . The singer released his debut album in 2011, and by the following year was playing before the Queen. And, while he does not give a precise location for the arch by the Palace and it is not clear when exactly he stayed there, he admits his alternative lifestyle did take one particular toll. ‘I didn’t have the best personal hygiene at that point because I didn’t get a chance to shower,’ said Sheeran, who now has two Brit awards and an Ivor Novello award. ‘It was just: sleep on the train, session, sweat on stage, drink, sleep on the train. I had 23 dreads on one side of my head from not washing my hair. My girlfriend counted them when she took them out with a comb.’ Meanwhile, a fresh-faced Ed performed in concert at the First Direct arena in Leeds . Giving it his all: The A-team hitmaker put his heart and soul into his performance . He also admits he would often be drunk on stage during his early gigs although he now says he never drinks before a performance. Sheeran’s current lifestyle couldn’t be further removed from his previous existence dossing in London. Home is a large farm he bought in 2012 close to where he grew up in Framlingham, Suffolk. And last year he also splashed out on a £2 million ranch in Nashville, close to the home of his former girlfriend, Amerian singer Swift. He has also been linked to pop star Ellie Goulding and recently performed at a private house party where the guests included David Cameron. Last night, Sheeran and his manager were unavailable for comment. Wow: The singer's star is almost certainly on the rise .","Ed Sheeran reveals he slept by a heating duct outside Buckingham Palace .

"As the foul-mouthed singer of The Sex Pistols, he was the scourge of the Establishment. But shortly before he became punk’s most notorious star, Johnny Rotten attended late-night drinking sessions at the House of Commons – and witnessed MPs mingling with ‘working girls’. Accompanying the singer to parties at the Palace of Westminster was his friend Linda Ashby. Scroll down for video . John Lydon, in his Sex Pistols days when he was known as Johnny Rotten. He has revealed in a new book that he attended late night drinking sessions at the House of Commons . The star – now 58 and known by his real name John Lydon – says in his new autobiography that MPs and escorts would go off with each other at the end of the evening. Most sensationally, he recalls how Ashby introduced him to Jeremy Thorpe, the then leader of the Liberal Party. According to Lydon, it was just two months before he and Thorpe became Britain’s most notorious figures, placing the meeting in 1976. Thorpe was forced to resign on May 9 that year when he found himself at the centre of an explosive sex scandal. In his book, to be published on Thursday, Lydon writes: ‘There was a late-night drinking thing in Parliament and she [Linda] had access to it, so she took me and a couple of other people. A few pennies a pint – outrageous, brilliant, what a great place to drink!’ The singer recalls how he was introduced to Jeremy Thorpe, pictured, the then leader of the Liberal Party . He adds: ‘There we were, looking out at the Thames under a brolly, the Houses of Parliament overshadowing us, surrounded by all of these MPs who all day seem to squabble and hate each other, but there they were, discussing who is going with what escort.’ Lydon had yet to become a household name as Rotten and he thinks many of the assembled MPs would have mistaken him for a male escort. He says: ‘I suppose they thought I was a male prostitute, with a slightly different way of dressing. ‘I certainly wasn’t what Jeremy Thorpe might’ve been looking for.’ There is no suggestion in the book that Thorpe himself enjoyed the company of escorts at the Commons. Accompanying the singer to parties at the Palace of Westminster was his friend Linda Ashby, pictured . The MP was alleged to have had an affair with his friend Norman Scott in the early 1960s at a time when homosexuality was illegal. He was subsequently accused of being part of a conspiracy to have Scott murdered. Thorpe and three other defendants were acquitted at the Old Bailey in 1979. Lydon writes touchingly about his friendship with Ashby. They shared a flat close to Buckingham Palace and he says: ‘I loved her to pieces. We had no relationship of any kind, other than equal nutters, I suppose. She was a working girl, basically.’ Neither Lydon nor Ashby were available for comment.","John Lydon says he attended late night drinking sessions in the Commons .

"She might have had the best education her billionaire father could buy – but it seems there are still some fundamental gaps in Tamara Ecclestone's knowledge. In a new reality TV show, the 30-year-old socialite is shown struggling to appreciate the difference between toast and bread. She is seen asking her husband Jay Rutland: 'Is it toast even when it's not toasted?' And when he patiently explains that non-toasted toast is called bread, Tamara can't quite bring herself to believe him. Scroll down for video . Tamara Ecclestone is seen asking her husband Jay Rutland: 'Is it toast even when it's not toasted?' She struggles to appreciate the difference between toast and bread during filming for her new documentary . It is, perhaps, the side-effect of the privileged upbringing one gets as the daughter of Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone. She was educated at the private Francis Holland School – whose old girls include Joan Collins, Jemima Khan and Cara Delevigne and whose motto is 'That our daughters may be as the polished corners of the temple'. But certain basics seem to have been omitted from the curriculum. In one scene of a documentary for new TV channel ITVBe, Tamara – the mother of seven-month-old Sophia – is shown making a bacon sandwich for her husband in the kitchen of their £45 million mansion in Kensington, West London. To Jay's bemusement, she admits she can't understand the difference between bread and toast. She believes bread to be anything that is served in a bread basket in a restaurant and insists that sliced bread is toast – even when it's not toasted. 'This is what I have to deal with every day,' sighs property developer Jay, before explaining the situation. The socialite believes bread to be anything that is served in a bread basket in a restaurant . At the end of the exchange Tamara turns to the camera and confides that she's going to have to check what she's been told on the internet: 'I am going to Google it.' The documentary, part of a series called Seven Days With..., provides other intriguing insights into the couple's lifestyle. Ecclestone insists on calling a medium to the house in a bid to explain why a picture of the couple hanging in a bathroom keeps moving slightly to the left. The psychic explains it is probably being moved by Jay's deceased grandparents – an explanation Tamara finds entirely plausible. She said: 'I believe in spirits and the afterlife. I don't think that when you are dead then that's it. If that makes me gullible, fine. But I like to keep an open mind. I think it's kind of cute that Jay's granny is moving the picture.' Seven Days With... Tamara And Jay is on ITVBe at 10pm on October 13. The scene: Tamara is making a bacon sandwich, complete with brown sauce for Jay's breakfast. She is using a loaf of white bread and is frying the bacon... Tamara: The secret to Jay's bacon sandwich is brown sauce and he likes the bacon well done and he likes the toast toasted. Is it called bread or toast when it's not toasted? Jay: Bread. Tamara: Is it toast even when it's not toasted? Jay: This is what I have to deal with every day. Tamara: Toast is not bread. Like bread is a whole loaf that hasn't been sliced up. This is clearly toast, it's different. Bread is like what you have in a bread basket at a restaurant. Jay: Please just stop now babe. Tamara: It's a legitimate question. Jay: Oh God. Are you seriously asking me if toast that is not toasted is still called toast? Tamara: Yes. Jay: But that would be bread wouldn't it? Tamara: No, it says toastie on the packet. Toastie. Jay: Babe. Tamara: What? Jay: Please stop. Tamara: What do you mean? Jay: You are killing me. Tamara: So before you toast it, toast is bread? Jay: Yes, of course. Tamara: So the process of making bread into toast is a toasting process? Jay: Correct. Tamara: Here is your toasted, lightly toasted, bacon sandwich.

He said: ‘She is happy for me to do the show. But I don’t know quite how she feels with my arms around another woman. She knows I wouldn’t do anything. But she said: “I can’t promise I won’t be jealous.” And she added: “You would be jealous if I was with another man.”’ Wallace said his heart sank when he saw how some of the younger male contestants looked in their costumes, adding: ‘I get it. I am the fat, bald dad in this year’s show.’ Strictly’s first live shows will be screened on Friday, September 26, and Saturday, September 27.

"Sir Roger Moore will today reveal he became the man with the golden bum after a blunder while filming James Bond. Sir Roger, 86, caught fire during the shooting of the 1977 movie The Spy Who Loved Me – one of seven times he played Bond. In the scene the villain Stromberg, played by Curd Jurgens, threatens to shoot Bond under the table. Scroll down for video . Singed behind: Roger Moore with Caroline Munro, left, and Barbara Bach on the set of 1977’s The Spy Who Loved Me . Moore and John Glen, who edited the film, recall the incident in this morning’s edition of BBC Radio 4’s Reunion programme. Glen said: ‘Stromberg has a gun under the table aimed at Roger’s crotch and at a certain time the special-effects man was to make the explosion. But he mistimed it and it finished up with Roger running around the set with his trousers alight.’ Moore added: ‘I was seriously on fire and it was terrible pain. I had to go to the sister every day and have Vaseline dressings changed on my rear end.’ Britt Ekland also ‘singed her bottom’ making the 1974 film The Man With The Golden Gun. She said: ‘Roger and I were told exactly the timing between each explosion. We were both told it’s very important that you hit these spots and leave. [But] I was very scared so I did what any normal person would do and threw myself on the ground.’ Reunion: Moore, with actor Richard Kiel who played the role of Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me -  the pair met (above) at a ceremony honouring Moore with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007 .","Embarrassing incident happened while filming 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me .

"The X-Factor singer who claims the cut-glass accent that has captured the nation's imagination is a product of elocution lessons - and not her upbringing - attended a £31,000-a-year private school, it has been revealed. Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, 23, of Wells, Somerset, said her well-spoken tone was down to speech therapy she received at the age of 11 to cure a lisp and was nothing to do with a privileged background. But the model, who stunned judges with a dazzling blues-soaked performance on last night's show, attended Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, which is set in over 250 acres of grounds on the banks of the River Stour and features a boathouse for rowing, a 294-seat theatre seating and an art gallery. Scroll down for video . Classy: Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, who stunned judges with a dazzling blues-soaked performance on last night's X-Factor, attended Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset . Impediment: The singer said her well-spoken tone was down to speech therapy she received at the age of 11 to cure a lisp . Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, which is set in over 250 acres of grounds on the banks of the River Stour and features a boathouse for rowing, a 294-seat theatre seating and an art gallery . Miss Whichello, who once said: 'When people meet me they always say, ""You are the poshest girl I’ve ever met in my life""', claims treatment for her speech problem caused her upper-class accent. She said: ‘I had elocution lessons in order to speak properly.' 'I literally couldn’t even formulate a sentence my lisp was so bad. It was terrible actually because I was too scared to speak.’ The singer admitted that boarding school and her modelling career had also helped to cement her speech, adding: ‘If people think it’s posh I am really sorry. I am not royalty.’ Miss Whichello once said: 'When people meet me they always say, ""You are the poshest girl I’ve ever met""' Last year she appeared on TV modelling contest The Face, hosted by supermodel Naomi Campbell . Chloe-Jasmine, who speaks fluent French, German and Portuguese, had planned to study law but instead took up modelling at 18. Her parents Garry, 55, and Denise, 57, live in the heart the prestigious village of Wells. The house has at least three floors - a ground floor with a large entrance hall, upstairs and a basement. The kitchen can be seen through the large Edwardian single glaze windows and takes up the whole left hand side of the house. Prices in the street are worth between £350,000 to £500,000. They are just a short walk from the glorious Wells cathedral, the quaint shops in the centre, and a large Waitrose is just around the corner. Plush: Chloe Whichello's parents home in Wells, Somerset . Their house is also just a two minute walk from the holistic health practice they own, the Beaumont Natural Health Centre. It is down a narrow cobbled road and offers osteopathy , massage, reflexology, hypnotherapy and acupuncture. Chloe-Jasmine said she was thrilled and shocked by the judges’ reaction. ‘I didn’t expect such a positive reaction because I haven’t had a singing lesson since school,’ she added. The singer's parents run the Beaumont Natural Health Clinic in Wells, which offers osteopathy , massage, reflexology, hypnotherapy and acupuncture . The young hopeful first auditioned in 2007, but did not make it on screen as the judges did not think she was ready. She was criticised by Simon Cowell, who claimed the then-16-year-old represented the generation of teenagers who only sought fame. But last year she appeared on TV modelling contest The Face and she said the cut-throat world of the catwalk had prepared her. ‘I have interacted with a cacophony of people and that has made me think that life is very short and what is the worst thing that can happen,’ she said. However, she has no intention of being a wild child. ‘I am completely teetotal,’ she said. ‘I don’t really see the point of going out and getting really drunk.’ Canford School hit the headlines recently when a teacher was cleared of engaging in sexual activity with a ‘flirty’ female pupil. Russell Woolwright, 30, said the false allegations had forced him to resign from his job as an economics teacher at the Dorset School attended by Miss Whichello, where he had worked for five years. The girl, who was 17 at the time, sent Mr Woolwright a series of inappropriate emails – but he insisted there had been no sexual contact. After having to endure a four-day trial in which he was charged with making the teenager perform a sex act on him during an encounter in an alleyway, he said the system leaves all the ‘power with the pupils and not with the teachers’. Mr Woolwright met up with the girl after she pestered him with a string of lewd emails including one she titled ‘party in my pants’ in October. He said he told the girl to stop contacting him and twice backed away when she tried to kiss him. After the police later learnt of the email exchange between the pair, the girl ‘embellished’ her version of events and claimed she carried out the sex act. But a jury took just 90 minutes to find him not guilty of two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust.","Miss Whichello, 23, wowed judges with her singing and upper-class accent .

"The BBC cut a controversial lesbian kiss scene from Doctor Who to avoid offending audiences when it was screened in Asia. Ten million British viewers have now seen the erotically charged encounter between lizard woman Madame Vastra and her human wife Jenny Flint since it was first shown on BBC1 last Saturday. But Corporation chiefs insisted on cutting the scene from the episode, called Deep Breath, when it was broadcast across Asia the next day. The kiss: The pair appear to kiss passionately - in fact Madame Vastra (left) is helping Jenny (right) to hold her breath by drawing on the excess oxygen Vastra can keep in her lungs . The decision to remove the first lesbian encounter in the show’s 51-year history has angered gay rights campaigners, who accused executives of giving into homophobia. Campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘The BBC should not bow to censorship demands from other countries. 'If these countries are bigoted and are not willing to show same-sex love, they have no right to demand that the BBC conforms to their standards of prejudice.’ Controversy: Madame Vastra (above - played by Neve McIntosh), shared a lesbian kiss with her wife in the episode but it was later cut for Asian audiences . Richard Lane, of gay rights group Stonewall, added: ‘It’s a great shame that some audiences were not allowed to see the episode in full.’ Doctor Who is a huge hit for the BBC across Asia. The feature-length edition – the first featuring Peter Capaldi as the Doctor – was broadcast to viewers in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore last Monday. BBC insiders say the scene, which lasted just a couple of seconds, was cut to avoid falling foul of a broadcasting code in Singapore which says programmes should avoid any content that could ‘justify’ homosexual and lesbian lifestyles. The Mail on Sunday has learned that a special BBC compliance team headed by former documentary film-maker Jane Ray insisted the scene was removed. The kiss, which raised some eyebrows in Britain, was portrayed as an ‘oxygen transfer’ between Madame Vastra and Flint, who were trapped in a room with killer androids. Sebastian Brook, editor of Dr Who Online, said: ‘Lots of people are saying it was a kiss but it wasn’t. It was an oxygen transfer and should have stayed in all editions.’ George Dixon, BBC Worldwide’s global editorial director, said: ‘When preparing shows for international transmission, we occasionally have to make edits to ensure we’re not breaking any local broadcasting rules.’","Kiss features lizard character Madame Vastra (played by Neve McIntosh) and her wife, Jenny (played by Catrin Stewart)

"Most patients are scared to complain about poor treatment because they fear that they will be ‘branded troublemakers’ by the NHS. Some are even denied treatment after raising concerns, the new patients’ watchdog Healthwatch England has found, while others are labelled ‘serial complainers’. Despite concerted efforts to make the NHS more open when things go wrong, Healthwatch has discovered that a pervasive ‘culture of fear’ means many patients are still petrified to make complaints. Healthwatch chief executive Anna Bradley warned a total overhaul of NHS complaints procedure was needed . The watchdog, which is the official voice of the patient in the NHS and social care, will present a 50-page report to Parliament this week outlining its concerns and setting out a series of recommendations. Last night, chief executive Anna Bradley warned a total overhaul of the NHS complaints procedure was needed, saying: ‘This is not just about tweaking with the system. ‘Patients experience fear in relation to making complaints and too often providers of health and social care are defensive and not listening properly. It a very negative experience for everyone.’ Miss Bradley said many hospitals, surgeries, mental health trusts and care home providers still denied patients information and forced them to pursue litigation when many did not want to. As part of its research, the organisation conducted a survey of more than 400 people. It found that: . One respondent, who had cataracts, claimed to have been denied further treatment at a hospital after complaining about being fitted with the wrong eye lens. He said: ‘A surgeon wrote to my GP saying, “Because this gentleman has made a complaint, we feel that it would be better served if he was seen elsewhere.” ’ The father-of-four believed the hospital had ‘turned its back’ on him as a result of his complaint. Another respondent, who suffered seizures after a routine hernia operation, was dubbed a ‘serial complainer’ when she raised the problem. Neither patient wanted to be named for fear of angering their doctors further. Miss Bradley added: ‘People are being branded troublemakers and experiencing ongoing problems with their care as a result of complaining. ‘The troubling thing about the case studies that we found is that, quite clearly, there is a reason to be scared. Very often, people walk away [from complaining] because they know that – even if one period of treatment is complete – they are bound to need the services of the same people again.’ Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry, concluded that a poor complaints system ‘allows unacceptable practice to persist’ She said improvements had been made to the complaints system since spring last year, when the report into the appalling care suffered by thousands at Stafford Hospital was published. Hundreds are thought to have died unnecessarily at the West Midlands hospital during the previous decade. Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry, concluded that a poor complaints system ‘allows unacceptable practice to persist’, ‘aggravates the grievance’ felt by the patient and ‘undermines the public’s trust in the service’. A Department of Health spokesman claimed the Stafford Hospital scandal had been ‘a turning point for the NHS’ and the Service was ‘now more transparent than ever before’. She added: ‘Feedback is essential so mistakes are not repeated. The Care Quality Commission now includes complaints-handling as part of their independent new inspection regime.’","Watchdog Healthwatch is official voice of the patient in NHS and social care .

"There won't be any presents under the Christmas tree this year at the Wanoa residence. Mum Nicky, of Upper Coomera in the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland, has decided her five children won't be receiving any gifts - not even from Santa - as she plans on teaching them 'the real meaning of Christmas'. Instead, she told the kids last week they'll be baking 200 cookies and pieces of fudge on Christmas Eve for local families who are in need of their help. Scroll down for video .

The mother-of-five has received many negative comments, including accusations that she is 'a santa slayer' and 'many swear words'. But little Lylah, her eight-year-old son, also has a few choice words. 'I was shocked because I love presents,' he told Seven News, when asked about his reaction to the news that there would be no Christmas presents this year. But his mother stands by her decision. 'There are lots of families around us who are struggling and can't even feed their families,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'This year my kids have been to Disneyland [in the US] and Vegas so I want to teach them that's not normal. I want to teach them there are kids out there who can't even have lunch. So I thought this would be a good opportunity to do that.' Little . 'Christmas isn't cancelled. It'll still be awesome and the kids will be spending more time with family.' Ms Wanoa says she and her husband Tee made the decision when their kids logged onto a Santa letter website, where they could choose expensive gifts and put it in their 'virtual Santa sack'.

'There were no limits and my kids are so naive that they thought they would be getting all the presents they chose,' she said. 'We've already given our kids enough throughout the year.' Ms Wanoa broke the news to her children - Alamein, 9, Tyler, 8, Willow, 5, Olive, 3, and Elora, 1 - last Monday. 'Every week we have family night and that's when I told them,' she said. 'They were in shock and very quiet at first. But then I tried to explain to them that we'll be spending our time baking and they loved the idea. 'The real meaning of Christmas is being grateful for what we have already. It's known as the day of giving I want my kids to know that this can be a way of doing that.' She hopes the experience will teach her five children a lifelong lesson. 'I know this won't work in every family but I just want my kids to learn about empathy and to become better human beings who look after one another,' she said. 'There are so many times where we've gone overboard with presents to see them lying in the backyard and never to be touched after a week or so.'

"Actress Joanna Lumley yesterday urged Nepal to ban a ‘festival of slaughter’ in which up to 250,000 terrified animals are killed. They are held in a giant open-air pen where their heads are hacked off in full view of each other. The victims include buffalo, goats, chickens and pigs. Some have their legs severed before they are decapitated. The festival is held every five years to honour Hindu goddess Gadhimai and takes place at the end of November. Appalled: Actress Joanna Lumley yesterday urged Nepal to ban a ‘festival of slaughter’ in which up to 250,000 terrified animals are killed . Millions cross the border from India to circumvent laws against animal sacrifice in their own country. The Nepalese government donated more than £36,000 towards the last Gadhimai festival in 2009, but now campaigners from Compassion in World Farming say the mass killing is opposed by the global Hindu community and that there is no religious justification for it. At a rally outside the Nepalese Embassy in London yesterday, Ms Lumley said: ‘This inhumane event is not part of the mainstream Hindu faith. 'It is little more than a bloodlust which allows people to revel in the gory deaths of thousands of terrified creatures.’ The slaughtered animals are taken to nearby villages and eaten in feasts.

The exercises come after the infection of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero, who caught the deadly bug treating two missionaries who had been repatriated for treatment in Spain. Mrs Romero is said to be gravely ill while another 16 people who she was in contact with are now being monitored for signs of infection. Last night Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, said the UK should expect ‘a handful’ of ebola cases in the coming months. She said: ‘The big problem is in West Africa where the doubling rate is every four weeks and it really is going up and up. So it will not be surprising if we have spill- over into this country. I would expect a handful of cases over the next few months.’ In an NHS exercise pictured here, an actor feigned collapse at a shopping centre in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after telling passers-by he was not feeling well. He was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by an ambulance crew equipped to deal with an ebola case, where he was put into an isolation unit. After blood samples were taken – and malaria ruled out – doctors decided to send some to the Porton Down laboratory in Wiltshire for testing. The ‘victim’ was then transferred 300 miles to the Royal Free Hospital in London – the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully ‘ebola-proof’ isolation unit.

He said: ‘We are waiting on word from No 10 on what the screening process will include and when it will begin.’ He added that they had been working with Public Health England ‘and trying to understand what the requirements are’.

"British doctors are to give five women without wombs the ‘miraculous’ chance of giving birth to their own babies by 2017. They say the success of the world’s first birth from a transplanted womb – announced by Swedish medics on Friday night – has opened the door for the revolutionary technique to take place in the UK. Around 60 couples are now hoping British womb transplant pioneer Richard Smith, who has spent two decades working on the project, will be able to make their dreams come true. However, funding problems mean only five of them will see it happen in the near future. Scroll down for video . The first birth to a woman after a womb transplant has happened in Sweden, and now British doctors are to give five women without wombs the ‘miraculous’ chance of giving birth to their own babies by 2017 . Last night, Mr Smith, a consultant gynaecologist at London’s Hammersmith Hospital, said at least two couples had already frozen their own IVF embryos in preparation. The Swedish baby boy was delivered by caesarean section last month by Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg’s Sahlgrenska Academy. The baby’s mother, a 36-year-old competitive athlete, was born without a uterus but had her own ovaries which produced healthy eggs. In 2012, she received a uterus from a 61-year-old family friend. This January, the younger woman was implanted with an embryo created from her own egg and sperm from her partner. Although the baby was premature, he was perfectly healthy and discharged from hospital after ten days. Prof Brannstrom said it was ‘still sinking in that we have actually done it’. And Mr Smith, who has worked closely with the Swedish team, hailed the birth as ‘wonderful news’. He said: ‘We have known for some time that it is possible to successfully transplant a womb. But the big unknown has been whether it is possible for that womb to safely carry a baby. Now we know it can.’ He now hopes to secure approval from UK ethics committees by next summer to perform womb transplants himself. After transplant, each woman would have to wait a year to ensure the womb was not rejected before being implanted with embryos. That would mean the first British womb transplant births could take place in 2017. Mr Smith explained: ‘Because of what has happened in Sweden, it’s much more likely that an ethics committee would view our application favourably. ‘We have 60 women who want the procedure and there are at least two couples who have had embryos frozen in anticipation. Women who want to have this done are keen to drive the process forward.’ But funding problems mean only five women are likely to benefit in the short term. While the £550,000 Swedish programme – which has resulted in six viable pregnancies – has forged ahead thanks to a large research grant, British researchers have had to rattle tins. Mr Smith’s charity Womb Transplant UK now has £40,000 – but that is well short of the £500,000 it needs to fund surgery and immunosuppressant drugs. A big difference between the two programmes is that Prof Brannstrom’s approach has been to use living donors – including mothers, sisters, friends and even a mother-in-law – who volunteered to donate their wombs. British ethical boards see that as problematic, fearing those donating could suffer ill-effects in the process. Mr Smith’s team has therefore opted to take wombs from women on the donor register who have died young, employing the same principles and processes as used to retrieve donor hearts and lungs. Mr Smith said that could change if it becomes clear the risks to living womb donors is minimal. He and his colleagues believe up to 15,000 women of child-bearing age in the UK could benefit from womb transplants – either having been born without a uterus or having undergone a hysterectomy. Hundreds opt for surrogacy every year and many more chose adoption. Mr Smith added: ‘Given a choice, most women would rather carry and deliver their own baby. If you met the women who are born without wombs, or have had them removed, then you know what has driven me to work for 19 years on this. ‘These are people who have a deep need to have their own baby and deliver it themselves.’ Sophie Lewis, who was born without a womb, with her her boyfriend Tilden Lamb . 'To feel our own baby growing... it would be a gift' Sophie Lewis cried yesterday morning after hearing the news that, in a world first, a baby had been born to a woman who had undergone a womb transplant operation. ‘I was so emotional,’ said Miss Lewis, who was a teenager when she found out she had been born without a womb. ‘The Swedish birth is absolutely amazing. I was overwhelmed.’ She now hopes to become one of five women in Britain chosen to receive a womb transplant herself. ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle,’ she said. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ She does not have a uterus because of a rare genetic condition called Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome, or MRKH, which affects about one in 5,000 women. Miss Lewis, who will be 30 tomorrow, said: ‘When I was 16, I went to the doctor because I was not getting periods. I ended up seeing a gynaecologist and had an endoscopy, which revealed that I have no womb. ‘It was a surreal feeling to find that out. I obviously wasn’t think about having children at the time – I was doing my GCSEs – and I don’t think I really took it in.’ But as time passed, Miss Lewis, who lives in Surrey with her 37-year-old boyfriend Tilden Lamb, a recruitment consultant, naturally thought more about having children. Two years ago, she stumbled upon Richard Smith’s womb transplant programme while contacting surrogacy and adoption charities, offering to raise money by running the London Marathon. As Miss Lewis has her own ovaries, the operation holds out the hope that she will now be able to bear her own child. ‘It was really, really exciting to find out that a womb transplant was finally a possibility,’ she said. ‘We have all been waiting on the Swedish programme. We have not known what to expect. When I was 16, it was adoption or surrogacy and that was it. And now, 15 years down the line, there’s the possibility that I will have a womb transplant myself, which is really incredible. ‘That miracle is now a step closer.’","Five women born without wombs could give birth to own babies by 2017 .

"A flagship scheme launched by David Cameron to get three million people texting or emailing their blood pressure and other vital signs to their GP surgery has been quietly dropped. When the Prime Minister announced the initiative in 2011, he said ‘telehealth’ had been found to be a ‘huge success’ – and promised three million people would use it within five years. He claimed it would save the NHS £1.2billion a year by keeping patients with long-term conditions like heart disease and diabetes out of hospital. Ill health: Many older people were put off by David Cameron's modern 'telehealth' gizmos . Getting patients to monitor themselves – for example, taking blood pressure or blood sugar readings – and send the information remotely would make them take better care of their own health, Ministers believed. And the NHS would save more money by not having to provide so many routine appointments. ‘This is going to make an extraordinary difference to people,’ Mr Cameron predicted. But now the ‘3millionlives’ project has been shelved, after subsequent research found NHS telehealth programmes to be expensive and largely ineffective. Many older people were put off by having to use modern gizmos to send in their details, researchers found. Nurses were enthusiastic, as the scheme cut their workload and ‘empowered’ patients to care for themselves. But doctors complained they were inundated by a ‘tsunami’ of patient data. And last month, academics found the extra £1,014 a year it cost to provide each patient with the monitoring service and equipment did not cut deaths or rates of admission to care homes. When the Prime Minister announced the initiative, he said ‘telehealth’ had been found to be a ‘huge success’ Last night, GPs said politicians should concentrate on getting the basics right, rather than obsessing about ‘gadgets’. Dr Margaret McCartney, who presents the BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health, said: ‘This expensive black box kit isn’t good value for money – and there is no gadget in the world that can help a sick person to eat, wash and dress. ‘NHS England needs to invest in what works – especially hands-on human care supplied by carers who currently often don’t have enough time to supply people’s basic needs.’ But Professor James Barlow from Imperial College, London, who has helped evaluate the programmes, believes telehealth still has a future. He said: ‘The evidence is that telehealth does lead to lower rates of admission and speedier discharge.’ The 3millionlives initiative has now been rebranded, with NHS England officials referring to it as TECS (Technology Enabled Care Services), but with no ambitious targets attached. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, has written to health bosses asking them to support the revamped scheme. Advocates of telehealth argue the popularity of smartphone health apps – which measure everything from sleep to fitness levels – make it more likely ‘remote care’ will become increasingly accepted. A spokesman for NHS England claimed their ambition was still to help three million people with long-term conditions using remote care devices. He added: ‘Twenty years from now, we will use technology to access our health services as a matter of course.’","David Cameron announced flagship 'telehealth' initiative back in 2011 .

"An elderly patient is suing the hospital where she was left blind after the surgeon collapsed during her routine cataract operation. Hazel Lockwood’s operation was halted when Jaheed Khan told colleagues that he felt dizzy, lay down on the operating theatre floor and said: ‘I am not fit to do it.’ It took 30 minutes to find another surgeon and the delay cost Mrs Lockwood her sight, according to legal papers lodged at the High Court. The botched operation has had a devastating effect on the great-grandmother, say her family. Mrs Lockwood relied almost totally on the sight in her right eye as her left eye had been badly damaged in a childhood accident. When specialists examined her right eye the next day, it was found to be ‘completely blind’. Mrs Lockwood, 84, is suing the world-famous Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, which was in charge of her care, for more than £50,000. The former secretary and mother of four had been reluctant to have the cataract operation because she was worried it could go wrong. Although the cataract was slowly clouding her vision, affecting her ability to read small print and do crosswords, its impact was otherwise limited. But after her husband Denis had a successful cataract operation in April 2011, she finally agreed to go ahead with surgery. That September, she went to the Moorfields Eye Centre at St George’s Hospital near her home in Tooting, South London, for surgery. It is one of the specialist hospital’s ‘district hubs’ and employs its own staff. When she arrived, she was still ‘very worried’, according to the court papers. Mr Khan apparently tried to reassure her but in doing so, according to her lawyers, he neglected to outline the full risks of the operation. The surgery involves making a slit in the eye, taking out the clouded lens and replacing it with a clear plastic one. The court papers claim: ‘Mr Khan nodded and smiled but did not engage in any discussion about the risks and benefits of the surgery.’ Mr Khan, who is deeply saddened that Mrs Lockwood has lost the sight in her right eye, denies the allegations, saying Mrs Lockwood was made aware of the risks of the surgery. He says he did engage in a discussion with her on the day of surgery. His position is that she was given a consent booklet several weeks before her operation and when she was asked if there were any outstanding questions or concerns there were none and she signed the consent form. Mrs Lockwood then signed a consent form warning that the operation carried a one-in-1,000 risk of severe and permanent sight loss. However, lawyers claim that because of Mrs Lockwood’s particular circumstances, the real risk to her was actually one in 333. Just minutes into the operation, Mr Khan ‘said he felt light-headed and dizzy with tightness across his chest,’ according to the court papers. They state that he ‘lay down on the floor’ and told a trainee surgeon: ‘You need to get a consultant surgeon now. You can’t do this one yourself. I am not fit to do it.’ The surgery was carried out at Moorfields Eye Centre at St George’s Hospital (above) in Tooting, South London . Mrs Lockwood, who had received local anaesthetic but was conscious, then had to wait about 30 minutes for a qualified surgeon to arrive. The consultant, Antonella Berry-Brincat, ‘noted that a large proportion of the intraocular contents were outside the eye’. She closed the cut with five sutures. Another surgeon arrived minutes later, ‘removed the remaining eye contents and sutured the eye closed’. Tests the next day showed Mrs Lockwood had no vision at all in that eye. Her lawyers claim Mr Khan was exhausted because he had been overworked. ‘On the balance of probabilities,’ they claim, his collapse ‘occurred as a result of extreme fatigue caused by a work schedule which required him to work on Wednesdays from early morning until late in the evening without the opportunity to take regular breaks or to eat meals’. Mrs Lockwood’s daughter Julia Laine, 53, said last night the operation had deeply affected her mother and the whole family. ‘It has completely stopped life as she knew it,’ she added. The family was later told that because Mrs Lockwood had high blood pressure and was lying on the operating table with no lens, her eye ‘gel’ had leaked out. Moorfields said: ‘It would be inappropriate for us to comment at this stage as the claim is subject to ongoing legal proceedings.’","Hazel Lockwood, 84, is suing world-famous hospital for more than £50,000 .

"NHS bosses have been accused of ‘rationing’ the amount of sex men with impotence problems can have. They have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see. The managers sent the note even though unbranded versions of Viagra, called sildenafil, are now cheap. A four-pill pack costs the NHS just £1.45, or 36p a tablet. Scroll down for video . 'Rationing':  Some NHS bosses have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see (file picture of model) The price of the anti-impotence pills has plummeted 93 per cent in the past year, since Viagra-maker Pfizer lost its patent. As a result, the Department of Health recently scrapped rules on prescribing sildenafil, so the vast majority of men with erectile dysfunction problems can get it on the NHS. But that decision – revealed in The Mail on Sunday last week – appears to have worried some local health managers fighting to balance their books. Cheap: Tablets of sildenafil, an unbranded version of Viagra used by the NHS, cost just 36p each . In a missive to GPs in the West Midlands, managers at NHS Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) demanded GPs limit their prescribing of sildenafil. They wrote: ‘In light of the pressure on NHS budgets, patients who are eligible for NHS treatment should be prescribed the lowest effective dose, with a maximum frequency of ONE tablet per week (ie FOUR per MONTH).’ But Dr Martin Duerden, a North Wales GP who advises the Royal College of General Practitioners on prescribing issues, asked: ‘Can we ration sex in this way? Prescriptions for sildenafil have no restrictions and each person should be assessed as individuals – some will need more, some less.’ GPs are free to prescribe what they like, based on what they think best for the patient, so such notes can only be advisory. However, CCGs can make life difficult for doctors they believe are costing them too much. NHS West Essex CCG has also warned doctors to look out for patients who might sell the pills for a profit. ‘Consider these drugs have a street value and quantities should be agreed after a discussion with the patient assessing realistic needs,’ they said. A spokesman for NHS West Essex CCG stressed it was not capping how much sildenafil doctors could prescribe, saying it was up to GPs. NHS Telford and Wrekin CCG did not comment.","Drop in cost of 'generic' Viagra recently led to the Department of Health making tablets available to patients on the NHS .

"Thousands of babies are suffering from eczema, vomiting and colic because doctors are failing to recognise they are allergic to cow’s milk, a new campaign claims today. Too many GPs are ignorant about the condition and write off symptoms as nothing serious, according to the charity Allergy UK. But it can leave children needing treatment for weeping eczema, sores, reflux, vomiting, facial swelling and breathing difficulties. Scroll down for video . At 12 weeks, Callum Newman was admitted to hospital with severe eczema, his skin so sensitive that hugging him would leave him in pain . And even mothers who exclusively breast-feed run the risk of cow’s milk proteins being passed to their baby through their own milk. Not to be confused with lactose intolerance, cow’s milk allergy (CMA) occurs when the body launches an immune response to the protein in cow’s milk. Lactose intolerance is caused when the body is unable to digest the sugar in milk. On average, it takes five months for CMA to be correctly diagnosed, research by the organisation found. Nathalie Dyson-Coope, 33, said she had to take her son Callum Newman to see medics nearly 50 times before he was finally diagnosed with CMA. ‘When he was born, I exclusively breast-fed him and for the first eight weeks he was fine,’ said the NHS administrator from Buckinghamshire. ‘But after that, his symptoms started to appear.’ Mothers who breast-feed run the risk of cow’s milk proteins being passed to their baby through their own milk just as much as women who bottle feed (file picture) At 12 weeks, Callum was admitted to hospital with severe eczema, his skin so sensitive that hugging him would leave him in pain. It was only at 16 months, and after many visits to A&E, that he was allergy-tested. Allergy UK and Mead Johnson Nutrition, which makes prescription-only infant formula for CMA sufferers, found many GPs underestimate how common the condition is. A third believe it affects just one in 10,000 babies – or 70 a year – when the actual figure is nearer one in 20, or 35,000 annually. In one in three cases, parents end up taking their babies to A&E because of undiagnosed CMA. Not to be confused with lactose intolerance, cow’s milk allergy (CMA) occurs when the body launches an immune response to the protein in cow’s milk. Lactose intolerance is caused when the body is unable to digest the sugar in milk . Dr Neil Shah, who sees hundreds of cases at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘There is an awareness issue with GPs and all doctors about CMA and, in fact, there is still some disbelief that it exists at all.’ A spokesman for Allergy UK – which has launched the website isitcowsmilkallergy.co.uk – said: ‘Undiagnosed CMA leaves infants in distress and puts families through unnecessary anxiety.’ A spokesman for the NHS Trust that treated Callum said: ‘It can be difficult to confirm a diagnosis of allergies as the symptoms could be caused by other factors.’","Too many GPs ignorant about condition and write off symptoms as nothing serious .

"It's being dubbed the ultimate selfie, and promises to make anything taken on a smartphone seem… well, a little bit flat. The next generation of self-portraits is here – fully detailed busts of a person’s head and shoulders, made on a 3D printer. Ryman – owned by former Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis – is the first high street chain to latch on to the new trend, offering customers 4in-high plastic 3D busts of themselves for £50. Revolutionary: The hand-held device will scan the contours of your face and reproduce a 3D plastic bust . Mr Paphitis said the level of detail that could be achieved was ‘amazing’. People who wish to be ‘printed’ must first be scanned using a hand-held device which emits an infrared beam. This collects information on the contours of the person’s head and shoulders, which is fed into a computer. Software translates this into a three-dimensional ‘map’ of the person that the printer reads, then recreates. Not so instant: Unlike selfies taken on your phone, this nifty device takes 10 hours to create your image . However, unlike the smartphone selfie, the process is by no means instant – it currently takes ten hours. Mr Paphitis admitted the printing time was ‘very, very slow’. But he said: ‘The speed will pick up exponentially, like computer memory has.’ Ryman stores will be selling personal 3D printers from next month, starting at £839.","Theo Paphitis's company Ryman has designed first 3D selfie device .

"Ordeal: MP David Burrowes was left in a cupboard then in a corridor at North Middlesex Hospital when he arrived with a ruptured appendix at 5.30am . An MP who suffered a ruptured appendix has told how he could have died after being left to wait for more than 12 hours on a trolley in a ‘chaotic’ A&E department. David Burrowes had expected the emergency department at North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, North London, to be quiet when he was taken there in agony at 5.30am. Instead, he found patients crammed into every corner – and beleaguered staff ‘run ragged’. In a disturbing account, Mr Burrowes, Conservative MP for nearby Enfield Southgate, described how: . Critics claim North Middlesex Hospital A&E has struggled to cope since the department at Chase Farm Hospital in neighbouring Enfield was closed last winter. And last week an official report concluded there had been an ‘underestimate of the resources’ needed to maintain standards, while nurses’ workloads had ‘increased significantly’. Mr Burrowes, 45, said: ‘I now realise I could have died waiting so long to get my scan and operation. ‘The place was jam-packed. Every cubicle was taken and trolleys lined the corridors. In between, people well enough to sit up were on chairs. If this is what it’s like at the height of summer, how bad could it be in the depths of winter?’ Mr Burrowes was taken to A&E by ambulance at 5.30am on June 2, after collapsing in agony. At 7am, a doctor assured him he would get a CT scan within ‘a couple of hours’. He said: ‘For six hours my wife, mother, and a friend were being told “Yes, yes, yes – he will be seen.” But they were being fobbed off. They found out I had not been booked in for a scan on the system. ‘In the meantime, I was on a trolley, in an A&E cubicle that doubled as a storeroom, curled up in pain. Scroll down for video . ‘I didn’t make a fuss about being a local MP, but someone found out, and the chief executive and the A&E consultant came to see me on my trolley. ‘They were very concerned and apologised for me being missed from the CT booking system.’ But after finally being taken for a scan at 5.30pm, Mr Burrowes had to wait another seven hours in an A&E corridor for a diagnosis – because all the doctors able to interpret the results were in theatre. He finally went into theatre at 2pm the next day – almost 33 hours after arriving by ambulance. The MP, a father of six, said: ‘They discovered I had a perforated, gangrenous appendix. Thankfully they got to it and the resulting infection in time, before it became life-threatening. It could have been very serious. People die of appendicitis and time is crucial. Closed: Nurses have been put under strain after the A&E at nearby Chase Farm Hospital was closed in January . ‘I waited nine to ten hours longer than I should have done for the scan. If it was not for my family and friend acting as my advocates, I fear I would have been completely lost in the system. ‘I fear for other patients, who may well be disorientated and vulnerable, and, without their own advocate, become helpless and voiceless. ‘I know the hospital was almost certainly trying to do its best. But when you have an A&E bursting at the seams, you can’t give everyone the best care. The reality I saw was that on an ordinary day in June my local A&E could not cope.’ In 2007, David Cameron joined Mr Burrowes in opposing the closure of Chase Farm A&E and was pictured with him outside the hospital. But after coming to power, Mr Cameron’s first Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley, approved the closure. Hospital inspectors from the Care Quality Commission coincidentally arrived the day after Mr Burrowes’ A&E ordeal. In their report, published last week, they calculated that 189,000 patients would use the A&E this year – 39,000 more than before the Chase Farm department was downgraded to an Urgent Care Centre in December. Health bosses had forecast only 26,000 extra patients would end up at North Middlesex A&E annually. Strain: Mr Burrowes described beleaguered staff 'run ragged' at North Middlesex Hospital . The report also found managers were ‘firefighting’ as the hospital was ‘stretched’. Yet two more A&Es in the area are to close next month. The rationale is that concentrating emergency services in fewer places will be better for patients, in part because it will be easier to staff them properly around the clock. A spokesman for North Middlesex University Hospital said Mr Burrowes’ stay had coincided with a period of exceptional demand, but denied patients were at risk. He said: ‘Our A&E department is one of the busiest in London, on some days seeing as many as 600 patients. 'During the three days in early June when David Burrowes was a patient with us, there were exceptional challenges which resulted in delays in A&E treatment. ‘We have apologised to David for the time it took to confirm his complex diagnosis and to get him to the operating theatre. It took longer than usual, but he was safe throughout, although we do recognise he experienced considerable discomfort. ‘We strongly reject his suggestion that patients who don’t have someone to speak up for them are at risk. When a patient is alone, our doctors and nurses are particularly vigilant and also carry out hourly checks.’","David Burrowes, Enfield Southgate MP, suffered ruptured appendix .

"Hundreds of thousands of men could enjoy a boost to their love lives following an NHS decision to dish out much more Viagra on prescription. Until this month, only men who suffered impotence as a side effect of illness or those evaluated by a specialist could be given the pills on the NHS. But since Viagra’s patent ran out last year, its cost has plummeted by 93 per cent as generic versions of the drug have become available. Scroll down for video . nly men who suffered impotence as a side effect of illness could be given the pills on the NHS . Because of this, the NHS has ruled that all men with serious impotence problems can now be prescribed the drug. Doctors have welcomed the change – which came into effect on August 1 – saying it had the potential to save relationships. Half of all men aged between 40 and 70 are estimated to suffer from erectile dysfunction. However, others claim increased demand for the drug will add to GPs’ already heavy workloads. Until a year ago, branded Viagra pills, made by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, cost £21.27 for a pack of four. But after the firm’s patent expired in June 2013, rival companies have been allowed to make ‘generic’ versions containing the same active ingredient, sildenafil, priced at just £1.45 for four pills. Mark Speakman, president of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, said the original restrictions, introduced in 1999, had been designed to save the NHS money. ‘They made the fairly arbitrary decision that if you had a discrete illness – like prostate cancer, diabetes or a spinal cord injury – you could get it on the NHS,’ he added. ‘But if you were a man of a certain age and wearing out a bit, you could only get a private prescription and you had to pay full whack.’ The Department of Health said that it did not believe the relaxing of restrictions would lead to a rise in spending. In 2012, the NHS in England spent £88 million on providing erectile dysfunction drugs to 180,000 men, of which £43 million went on branded Viagra. Under the new rules, it estimates demand could nearly double in three years to 330,000 and cost the NHS £68 each time a patient is prescribed sildenafil. However, the reduced price in the cost of the drug means overall spending on the condition would not rise. Dr John Chisholm, chairman of charity Men’s Health Forum, said the move ‘would make a great deal of difference to the mental wellbeing and happiness of these patients’. ‘It’s not a myth that relationships can be put in jeopardy by erectile dysfunction. This decision will enable some relationships to flourish when they’re being threatened.’ Doctors have welcomed the change - which came into effect on August 1 - saying it could save relationships . Visiting a doctor to ask for the drugs could also help men to identify the underlying causes of their impotence, including serious health problems, he added. ‘Erectile dysfunction can be a sign of underlying illness like diabetes, coronary heart disease, or peripheral arterial disease.’ Dr Andrew Green, chairman of the British Medical Association’s clinical and prescribing sub-committee, said the change ‘partially corrects an historic injustice done to men and their partners who were denied an effective treatment for a distressing condition’. But Dr Imran Rafi, chairman of clinical innovation and research at the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘You need to be careful. There can be side effects for some patients and sildenafil can react with other drugs.’ Taking sildenafil with nitrates drugs such as the angina spray GTN can lead to a sudden and serious loss of blood pressure, he warned. Doctors are also concerned about sildenafil being used as a recreational drug. Viagra – both the branded and generic versions – has been linked to 134 deaths since 1998, according to the UK drugs regulator, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Almost half were caused by heart problems. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Erectile dysfunction is a common and distressing condition and may be a sign of more serious underlying health problems. Now this treatment is cheaper we have made it more widely available on the NHS. We hope this will encourage more men to visit their GP.’","Only men with impotence as side effect of an illness could get the drug .

"Hundreds of thousands of hospital patients are being injected with potentially dangerous blood-thinning drugs for no good reason, a leading expert is warning. They are needlessly being put at risk of strokes, major stomach bleeds and other serious complications, said vascular consultant Dr Ander Cohen. Some are even dying due to the powerful drugs. He said too many were being given the thinners because guidelines were littered with ‘schoolboy errors’. Blood thinners known as heparins can cut the risk of death from pulmonary embolism by two-thirds - if used in the right patients (file picture) His criticisms are all the more potent because he helped push for greater use of the thinners in the first place. A decade ago, about 25,000 people were dying every year after developing deep vein thromboses (DVTs) while immobile in hospital beds. These clots usually form in a leg vein before travelling through the body and getting lodged in the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. The condition, known as a pulmonary embolism (PE), is often fatal. Blood thinners known as heparins can cut the risk of death from PE by two-thirds – if used in the right patients. But Dr Cohen believes the drugs are now being used ‘too broadly’. He said: ‘For patients who are at risk of developing a fatal clot, that risk [of the drugs] is balanced by the risk that they might die if they don’t get treated. But you cannot justify giving this treatment to low-risk or negligible-risk patients. They are being put at risk of a fatal bleed in their stomach or brain that could easily kill them.’ About two million people are admitted to hospital every year for urgent treatment, with 800,000 rightly being given the thinners, says Dr Cohen. But he added: ‘About 20 per cent of the remaining 1.2 million – 240,000 people – also get treatment even though there is no evidence they will benefit. The criteria for giving blood thinners are far too broad.’ Dr Cohen says two million people are admitted to hospital every year for urgent treatment due to blood thinners . He said there was ‘no evidence’ that they cut deaths in patients with a range of conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol and asthma. According to Dr Cohen, who advises the NHS on DVTs and PEs, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which drew up the guidelines, erroneously recommended such patients got heparin. ‘NICE made these schoolboy errors, because people who drew up the guidelines don’t know the subject,’ he said. Studies show that one in 100 hospital patients given heparin suffer what Dr Cohen called ‘major bleeds’ – such as bleeding in the brain or another major organ to such an extent that they lost two units of blood. Nice said it was looking at the matter urgently.’","Powerful blood thinners that stop DVTs are being used in the wrong patients, says expert .

"Hospital drama: One surgeon received a warning for throwing a scalpel across an operating theatre (File photo) Some of Britain’s worst doctors have been allowed to carry on practising despite making fatal medical errors and engaging in criminal behaviour, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. In spite of such failings as overlooking cancer symptoms, botching operations and kerb-crawling, they have been effectively let off with a slap on the wrist. In total, 147 doctors were given formal warnings by the General Medical Council (GMC) in 2013, which is charged with upholding professional standards. Cases included: . In each case, the GMC chose to issue a warning rather than impose a tougher penalty. Last year, 55 other doctors were struck off – 1.6 per cent of the 3,348 formally investigated. A further 86 were suspended, out of the total of 233,000 doctors who are licensed to practise. The identities of the doctors warned last year can be made public thanks to a Freedom of Information request by this newspaper. Warnings are published on the GMC register, which lists doctors by name and registration number, but using this to find out who has been warned and when would take a very long time. Last night, campaigners accused the GMC of ‘going soft’. Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The GMC is there to protect patients. It must never compromise their safety by failing to deal with serious breaches of professional duty and trust in an appropriate manner.’ One of those who received a warning for missing a cancer case was Stockport gastroenterologist Navneet Ahluwalia, who was asked to examine a female patient with ‘significant abdominal symptoms’. The GMC stated: ‘Despite test results that indicated the need for further investigation, Dr Ahluwalia wrote to the patient’s GP stating “we are not dealing with cancer” and that the results were ‘‘normal’’. This was incorrect.’ The patient was eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer ‘after a significant delay which could have affected her prognosis’. The GMC did not say whether the patient lived or died. Bolton GP Dr Anton Kiss was warned for indecently exposing himself to two women at a Christmas party and smoking cannabis. Dermatologist Dr Hari Narayana received a warning after trying to pick up a prostitute in the street. And surgeon Munir Abdullah Ali was warned after throwing a scalpel in an operating theatre at Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester. Dr Stephen Grant failed to refer a patient with an unexpected trunk pain . GMC chief executive Niall Dickson denied a warning was a ‘let-off’ for a doctor. He said: ‘We take very seriously our duty to hold doctors to account if a patient in their care is harmed, or other serious concerns are raised about them. These cases are often complex, involving a range of issues. ‘We investigate thoroughly before coming to a decision. Warnings sit on the doctor’s record for five years and are publicly visible on our website.’","Doctors have missed cancer symptoms, botched operations and kerb crawled .

"Britain has just two ‘ebola-proof’ hospital beds, The Mail on Sunday has learnt. Official guidance states that patients with the highly infectious disease – which has no vaccine, no cure and kills up to 90 per cent of victims – should be treated in specially built units that are biologically secure. Yet there is only one operational High Secure Infectious Diseases Unit (HSIDU) in the UK, at the Royal Free Hospital in London. It has two beds. A second, at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, is ‘being redeveloped’ according to NHS England. Scroll down for video . Just two beds: There is only one operational High Secure Infectious Diseases Unit (HSIDU) in the UK, at the Royal Free Hospital in London. It has an array of equipment to ensure the patient did not pass on the killer virus . An ambulance arrives with Ebola victim Dr. Kent Brantly, pictured right, to Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta. Dr Brantly, infected with the Ebola virus in Africa arrived in Atlanta for treatment on Saturday . Should Britain have more than two ebola patients at any one time, they will have to be treated in less secure hospital side rooms. Dr Stephen Mepham, an infectious diseases consultant at the Royal Free, said there would be ‘no other option’ but to treat ebola patients in standard isolation rooms. He said: ‘We think it is highly unlikely, but if we had more than two patients we would have to treat them in our normal isolation facilities. They are not to the same standard but we are confident we could prevent spread.’ The HSIDU, he said, had an array of equipment to ensure a patient did not pass on the killer virus, including air-lock doors and ‘negative pressure’ air flow to make sure nothing escapes from the unit. The patient is kept in a sealed plastic tent, with arm mouldings so doctors and nurses can treat them without any physical contact. The tent is burnt after use in dedicated incinerators. Guidance issued by the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive in 2012 states that patients with confirmed viral haemorrhagic fever – of which ebola is the most deadly type – ‘should be managed in an HSIDU’ to ‘eliminate or minimise the risk of transmission to health care workers’.

On Friday, WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said ebola was spreading ‘faster than our efforts to control it’. The Foreign Office refused to confirm if British citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment, saying only: ‘Procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case.’ With up to 10,000 passengers flying into . UK airports every week on 30 direct flights from West Africa,  Keith . Vaz, the Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, . said the country should not wait for its ‘first taste of ebola’ before . taking tough action. Epidemic: The ebola virus, which has killed more than 700 people so far. On Friday, WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan said ebola was spreading 'faster than our efforts to control it' He wants ministers to consider introducing fever-screening cameras at UK airports. South Africa, which has fewer direct flights from the region than the UK, introduced infra-red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in April, in an early response to the ebola threat. Last week Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria said they would be introducing temperature screening at airports. However critics say the cameras pick up lots of ‘false positives’ – including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport. Mr Vaz said: ‘As far as I’m concerned any measures – including additional screening – which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken. ‘Prevention is always better than cure: we don’t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action.’ A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘There are currently no known cases of ebola in the UK, but we are confident that we have robust arrangements in place should that situation change. ‘The Royal Free can routinely manage two ebola patients. There are arrangements to increase this capacity quickly should this be required.

"One million British children classed as healthy by the Government's official statistics are dangerously unfit, according to shocking new research. Academics warn that an epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk of an  early death from type 2 diabetes  or heart disease. They warn that a national schools strategy to monitor children's health is failing to identify many of those at risk because it does not officially class them as overweight. Scroll down for video . An epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk . It uses a measurement known as body mass index (BMI), which estimates the number of overweight or obese school-age children at about three million - nearly 30 per cent of all five- to 18-year-olds. But the latest research, using a more accurate method to measure actual body fat, indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs. It provides mounting evidence that Britain is facing a childhood obesity crisis - and suggests the Olympic legacy of 2012 is failing to create healthier and more active young people. The scientists have described a generation of 'Tofi' kids - who are 'Thin on the Outside,  Fat on the Inside'. They say as many as one in seven children recorded by schools as having a healthy BMI are at risk of developing life-limiting diseases. Last night, after being confronted with the research, Public Health Minister Jane Ellison admitted BMI 'isn't a perfect measure'. But despite the evidence, officials say there are no plans to change  the system. Child obesity expert Professor David McCarthy, of London Metropolitan University, who led the research, said the number of unfit youngsters had been 'clearly underestimated'. Research indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs . He added: 'There's a raft of children who have been overlooked because they have a “healthy” BMI. This matters because the more fat you have, compared to muscle, the more likely you are to develop type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease in later life. If they maintain that body composition into adulthood, or it gets worse, they are going to be at high risk of these diseases.' The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), introduced in 2006, records children's height and weight at ages four to five, and again when they are ten and 11. These measurements produce a BMI for each child, which indicates whether they are within a healthy range or not. However, BMI is known to be poor at distinguishing between overweight children and those who are naturally muscular. As a result of the programme, parents have received official letters warning them that their sporty, active children are overweight. In the unpublished study of more than 1,000 children, Prof McCarthy used a Tanita 'bio-electrical impedance' machine that passes a low electrical current through the body to determine how much weight is  fat and how much is muscle. The . research found 15 per cent of those classed as having a healthy BMI . carried high levels of fat, but low levels of muscle. One eight-year-old . boy recorded a healthy BMI of 17.7 but was found to have 23 per cent . body fat and low muscle mass. Another . boy, aged nine, had a healthy BMI of 19 but carried more than 28 per . cent body fat, making him technically obese - despite not appearing . overweight. Meanwhile, the study found one in ten children labelled . overweight using BMI were healthy - equivalent to 300,000 children . nationwide. Prof . McCarthy said: 'Many children find playing on the computer more . enjoyable than hopscotch or tag, as they did 40 years ago. I think we . have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity . habits early in life.' Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The NCMP is not producing a . true and accurate picture of obesity in this country. We need to see . inside children with sophisticated scientific equipment to find hidden . fat - otherwise we are failing to address a growing problem. 'There should be a scanning unit visiting schools, and children should be measured annually. We're making decisions on how to combat obesity based on inadequate information.' Child fitness expert Dr Gavin Sandercock, at Essex University, said: 'The least fit and healthy children in our studies are the ones  who are underweight, not the overweight ones. Prof McCarthy thinks we have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity habits . BMI isn't related to health at all - it's a height-to-weight ratio - and because it's so insensitive it's not fit for purpose. I can't think of a worse way to measure children's health. It fails them.' Childhood obesity is known to be a growing problem in the UK which has been blamed on poor diet and lack of exercise. Once established, it is hard to treat - making early intervention more crucial. Overweight children are more likely to become obese adults and therefore have a higher risk of premature death, disability and long-term health problems. Most of the serious consequences will not develop until adulthood. The NCMP is administered by Public Health England. Dr Ann Hoskins, director of children, young people and families, said: 'We have to look at the totality of evidence, which concludes the BMI Centile is the most suitable indicator of body fat and overall weight in childhood.' Minister Jane Ellison said: 'We know BMI isn't a perfect measure but it is recognised internationally as the most reliable way to estimate body mass. It is recommended by the World Health Organisation. 'There is still much to do and we are clear that families need a balanced diet and regular exercise to be healthy.'","Academics warn many inactive slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat .

"Risk: Millions of adults taking a daily dose of aspirin to ward off heart attacks may be significantly increasing their risk, new research shows . Millions of adults taking a daily dose of aspirin to ward off heart attacks may be significantly increasing their risk, new research shows. Nearly a quarter of adults – 23 per cent – have been found to carry a gene which, when combined with the painkiller, makes them nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack. It means about one in 100 with the gene who take the drug may suffer from heart problems that could have been prevented, researchers say. While past studies have shown taking aspirin can increase the risk of potentially life-threatening internal bleeding, this study, by scientists at Harvard University in the US, is the first to link dangers from the drug with gene variations. Dr Kathryn Hall, the report’s lead author, said: ‘We need to look at ourselves as individuals, a certain constellation of genes, and to take that into consideration. If the research is validated in further study, it would be the logical next step to test everyone for these genes before giving them aspirin.’ Government figures show there were 30.9 million NHS prescriptions for aspirin last year for those at risk of heart attacks and strokes. The latest study involved nearly 40,000 women over a ten-year period. Of those, 23 per cent carried a variation of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, which helps the body process stress hormones, linked to heart problems and stroke. The research found that those who had the gene were naturally protected and were 34 per cent less likely to have heart attacks. However, taking aspirin removed this protection and increased their risk of heart problems by 85 per cent – and, in some cases, by as much as three times. In contrast, another group who carried a different variation of the same gene were more likely to have a heart attack than those who did not carry the gene, but aspirin protected against this, cutting the number of heart attacks by 47 per cent. Study co-author Joseph Loscalzo, chairman of the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School, said: ‘Rather than give aspirin to all patients with risk factors for heart disease, we need to use modern genomics and genetics to identify those individuals for whom aspirin has the greatest benefit and the lowest risk of adverse effects.’ Discovery: The Harvard University study found that nearly a quarter of adults - 23 per cent - carry a gene which, when combined with the painkiller, makes them nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack (file picture) Tests for the genes are not currently available on the NHS. Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘There is a long way to go before personalised medicine is routinely used for people with cardiovascular disease.’ Previous studies have cast doubt on whether healthy people should take aspirin as the risks could outweigh the benefits. They have also found some do not appear to benefit from it, and while the risk of non-fatal heart attacks is reduced by 20 per cent, deaths from strokes and heart failure are not cut. Anyone prescribed aspirin should continue to take it, experts advised. A spokesman for the Government’s medicines watchdog, the MHRA, said: ‘As with all medicines we keep them under constant review.’","Nearly a quarter of adults - 23% - have been found to carry particular gene .

"Fraud: Cheats are costing the taxpayer £200m a year by forging prescription forms (file picture) Fraudsters who claim free prescriptions they are not entitled to face strict checks in a crackdown designed to save the NHS millions. The move follows the revelation that prescription fraud costs the taxpayer more than £200 million a year – enough to pay for some 10,000 nurses. Cheats get free medicines by pretending to belong to the categories of people exempt from charges. Children, pensioners and those with certain long-term medical conditions do not have to pay the £8.05 charge that is standard in England. Those paid Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Universal Credit are also exempt. To avoid the charge, patients simply tick a box on the back of the form declaring they are entitled to free medicines. Pharmacists are meant to ask for proof but many feel uncomfortable doing so. If a patient does not have written proof, the pharmacist ticks another box saying ‘evidence not seen’. Very few people are thought to be caught for cheating – so the millions who should pay but avoid doing so know they have a high chance of getting away with it. Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University, said: ‘People think it’s a soft touch. ‘The man in the street thinks, “Do I know anyone who’s got caught for prescription fraud? No.” ’ An insider said that pharmacists will now be forced to check claimants’ credentials – or risk having their NHS contracts revoked. The source said: ‘Pharmacists’ NHS contracts specifically state they are obliged to check a patient is entitled to free prescription medicines.’ Patients could even be denied free medicines until they prove entitlement. ‘That option has not been ruled out as too radical, as long as safeguards were put in place to protect vulnerable groups,’ the source added. Both ideas will meet strong resistance from pharmacists, who are opposed to prescription charges in principle and do not think it is their job to ‘police’ the system. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society believes prescription charges – which have been abolished in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – ‘act as a barrier to people accessing life-saving medicines’. It wants them abolished for all people with long-term medical conditions. System: Patients have to simply tick a box on the back of the form - pretending to be a child or elderly - and they can avoid the charge (file picture) Patients who do get fined usually only have to pay £40 – five times the prescription fee. The maximum fine is just £100. The cost of prescription fraud jumped from £47 million in 2006, to £100 million in 2008 and £216 million in 2013, according to NHS figures. Some 900 million prescription items were given out for free on the NHS in England last year – 90 per cent of the total. Some 25 million of those were claimed fraudulently. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Fraud against the NHS can have a serious impact on our ability to deliver high quality health services. We expect all appropriate sanctions and recovery action to take place.’","Those who are exempt avoid paying £8.05 fee that is standard in England .

"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 600,000 in Britain . A revolutionary eye implant inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope could help more than half a million people suffering from a previously incurable condition that leads to blindness. The device – a mini telescope comprised of two lenses – treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects 600,000 in Britain, mainly the elderly. The disease targets a part of the retina called the macula, the 5mm spot at the back of the eye packed with light-receptive cells. It often becomes diseased with age,  leading to central vision becoming distorted and blurred. There is no cure and about half of patients are so badly affected they are registered blind. However, a London eye surgeon and an optical physicist have come up with a new solution – inspired by a famous flaw with the Hubble probe. Eye surgeon Bobby Qureshi said: ‘There have been telescopic implants for AMD for a couple of years, but getting the optics right has been extremely problematic. ‘The lenses are so strong that focusing images has been difficult, and the results for patients have been hit and miss.’ The scientists then remembered the problems surrounding the Hubble telescope. ‘After Hubble was put into orbit in 1990 the images that came back were fuzzy,’ Mr Qureshi said. Scientists eventually solved the problem: the edges of the 8ft-wide mirror were two-thousandths of a millimetre too flat. The solution – called ‘adaptive optics’ – was to add extra mirrors to compensate for the flaw. Using this technique, Mr Qureshi, of the London Eye Hospital, and Professor Pablo Artal, of Murcia University, in Spain, have designed a ‘mini telescope’ to be inserted surgically into the eye. Called the iolAMD, it is comprised of two lenses 2mm apart, and magnifies images, as well as directing the centre of the image away from diseased parts of the macula and on to healthy sections. Combined, these effects enable the patient to see clearly again. London eye surgeon Bobby Qureshi and optical physicist Professor Pablo Artal were inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope (above) The new lenses come with a hefty price tag – £6,000 per eye – but Mr Qureshi believes the cost could fall to £500, at which point the NHS may start to fund it. He said: ‘I would like to see it on the NHS by 2017, because it will transform the treatment of people with end-stage AMD.’ He added the lenses were not a cure, as they did not stop the macula from deteriorating.","Device - inspired by Hubble Space Telescope - comprises of two lenses .

"The new rating system is part of a 'transparency drive' by Jeremy Hunt to raise NHS standards . GPs are to be publicly rated on how well they care for their elderly patients – with red ‘traffic light’ warnings for those who fall behind. Ministers want to publish information on the internet about how good or bad doctors are at keeping the over-60s out of hospital. Surgeries where too many are admitted to hospital as emergencies will be rated as ‘red’ on the NHS Choices website. Those where the number is in line with expectations, or better, will be rated green. Ministers hope the move will raise standards among England’s GPs, take pressure off A&E departments, and save the NHS millions by cutting needless hospital stays. The move is the latest in a ‘transparency drive’ spearheaded by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who thinks standards among England’s 36,000 GPs are far too variable. Two weeks ago The Mail on Sunday revealed how he was planning to rate GPs on how well they spotted early signs of cancer. Government sources say that the size, age profile and social make-up of each surgery’s patient list will be taken into account to avoid unfairly labelling individual doctors. Last night charities and patient groups welcomed the initiative, but the Royal College of GPs called it another ‘blunt instrument’. Caroline Davies of Age UK said: ‘Any measure that encourages better planning of care, gives people confidence in their GP practice and reduces avoidable hospital admissions is welcome.’ She added that some GPs needed ‘additional training’ to help elderly patients stay fit, healthy and independent. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said greater transparency could bring benefits if done in a ‘meaningful’ way. But she said: ‘Any approach that involves the naming and shaming of individual GPs and practices or that uses blunt instruments such as “traffic lights” to measure the care we provide to our patients would be counter-productive and extremely damaging to the unique relationship that GPs have with their patients. Surgeries where too many elderly patients are referred to hospital will show up as having a red warning on the NHS Choices website, while those where the number is in line or under expectations will show up as green . ‘While initiatives like this might seem beneficial at face value, the data that would be used to inform such ratings would be very complex and could easily be misinterpreted so we must approach with caution.’ Other GPs are much more critical, believing Mr Hunt is determined to undermine doctors’ credibility so he can drive down their pay – a charge the Health Secretary denies. But others are supportive. Dr Neil Bacon, founder of doctor comparison site iWantGreatCare, said: ‘There’s a huge appetite from patients for information about their GPs. 'More and more are realising that there’s such a variation in quality between them. Most are good; some are awful.’","GPs to be ranked on how well they keep elderly patients out of hospital .

"Thousands of patients suffering major heart attacks and strokes are having to wait around 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, new  figures have revealed. According to NHS rules, if a patient is suffering from an ‘immediately life-threatening’ problem then an ambulance should be on the scene within eight minutes. These so-called ‘category-A calls’ include cardiac arrests, traumatic injuries, major strokes or serious breathing difficulties. Statistics from England¿s ten ambulance services have shown that the target response time is not being met in an 'alarming' number of cases . But statistics from England’s ten ambulance services have shown that the target response time is not being met in an ‘alarming’ number of cases. And the newly released figures show that response times have worsened over the past three years. In April 2011, the slowest 1 per cent of category-A responses saw patients waiting for 23 minutes or more. But based on the slowest 1 per cent of  category-A responses in April this year, 28,000 critically ill patients a year are now waiting for an ambulance for 28 minutes or more. The East of England Ambulance Service was the worst, with response times of 36 minutes or longer in the slowest 1 per cent of category-A cases, compared with 22 minutes or longer  at the neighbouring East Midlands Ambulance Service. Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said lives were being put at risk by the delays, which he claimed stem from deep-seated problems in hospitals. Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said lives were being put at risk by the delays, which he claimed stem from deep-seated problems in hospitals . He said: ‘These alarming new figures raise real concerns that lives are being put at risk by the increasing chaos in the NHS. Too many ambulances are trapped in queues at overstretched A&Es, unable to hand over patients. ‘This, in turn, is leading to a worrying deterioration in ambulance response times across many regions of the  country. In life-threatening situations, every single second counts, and that is why this slump in standards simply cannot go on.’ A spokesman for NHS England, which has overall responsibility for ambulance services, said: ‘Nationally ambulance services have continued to perform well. ‘We know, however, that this is not the case everywhere, and our local commissioners are working with trusts to improve performance so that patients can get a fast, safe and high-quality service wherever they live.’","NHS rules state critically ill patients should have an ambulance with them within eight minutes .

"The new technology helps those suffering from longsightedness by inserting a new lens into the eye . A revolutionary new eye implant is set to make reading glasses a thing of the past for millions of people. The surgically inserted lens for longsightedness gives patients near-perfect vision just days after they have an operation lasting only minutes. Known as the Symfony, it restores sight to pin-sharp focus from just inches away all the way to the horizon. Surgeons hailing the ‘breakthrough’ invention say that until now no insertable lens has been able to mimic natural vision so closely. The lenses are made of plastic and should, in theory, last a lifetime. Currently surgeons can insert ‘monofocal’ lenses to treat cataracts, but they typically leave patients still needing reading glasses. There have also been multi-focal lens implants to correct vision both near and at a distance, but these often produce halo bursts and glare and give a ‘stepped’ effect rather than smooth focus. By contrast, the Symfony design gives an almost perfectly continuous experience. The lenses can also be used to correct short sight and stigmatism – a condition which results from the eyeball being misshapen – and are best suited to older people. Ian Peacock, a 54-year-old solicitor from Devon, is the first person in the country to be given such a lens. He used glasses for a decade before undergoing a procedure on his left eye. He said ‘Initially I needed glasses for reading, but I was soon in need of them for sports and driving too. I had to take several pairs if I was going out.’ He noticed the difference within 36 hours. ‘Everything was a lot clearer,’ he said, adding that he enjoyed being liberated from his many pairs of specs. However, at £3,900 per eye, the surgery is not cheap, and the NHS does not usually fund surgery to correct long-sightedness. Mr Peacock’s ophthalmic surgeon was Bobby Qureshi of the London Eye Hospital in Harley Street. Last night he said: ‘I can see these lenses becoming the gold standard. You get a continuous change in focus – and there’s no compromise on the quality of vision.’ Long sight due to age is extremely common. After 40, the eye’s natural lens begins to stiffen. This makes it harder for muscles to tug it into  the round shape needed to focus on nearby objects. Our minimum focusing distance gradually creeps up from the ‘normal’ eight inches, until we have trouble reading. Many people struggle on for years, straining their eyes in the process, before finally relenting and buying reading glasses. Some opt for laser treatment, which helps by changing the shape of the eye, but as the lens continues to stiffen the effect lasts only a few years. Reading glasses could become a thing of the past with nine out of every ten people implanted with the new lens technology reporting they no longer have to wearing reading glasses at all, according to a recent trial . But replacing lenses lasts a lifetime because the plastic does not alter. Over the past decade various ‘multi-focal’ implantable lenses have come on to the market. They work like bifocal spectacles, with a ‘step’ in focus. They can also cause problems in distinguishing similar colours. However, Mr Qureshi said: ‘The way this new lens works is different. There are tiny circular grooves in the front of the lens which change the rays of light so that the range of focus is stretched out from near to far. ‘By contrast, multi-focals bend or split the light by refraction, which results in stepped focus. Some of the light is also lost, reducing the quality of the image. ‘But with the Symfony lens, virtually 100 per cent of the light gets through, so you can still distinguish between subtle colours. There’s no step in focus, and, in terms of the quality of vision, they are the best yet.’ Nine out every ten people implanted with them never have to wear reading glasses, according to a recent trial. Although the operations are not funded by the NHS, Mr Qureshi said people with private health cover may be able to get them more cheaply if they needed cataracts removing, as this already involves replacing the lens with a plastic one. He said some insurers would pay for the cataract operation, then allow customers to ‘upgrade’ for about £500 more for each continuous-focus lens. Mr Qureshi said Symfony lenses might become available on the NHS in the future, if the price dropped.","Surgically inserted lens gives patients near-perfect vision just days after the operation, restoring sharp focus from inches away or into the distance .

"He spent almost half a century building up a fashion empire, but lost it over a bank holiday weekend. Now Jaeger founder Harold Tillman is back in the clothing business but in a very different style –  making outfits to combat malaria. The determined 68-year-old will be producing suits, shirts, trousers and other clothes impregnated with a powerful insect repellent. Harold Tillman, pictured here with former face of Jaeger Laura Bailey, is taking on . the mosquito - by launching a range of clothes which have an inbuilt . insect repellent . The revolutionary technology used will allow the clothes to be washed dozens of times before they lose their repellent effect. The new venture comes two years after he lost control of Jaeger and Aquascutum in a bitter power-struggle with bankers. He was away in Italy over that Easter when he learned that Lloyds Bank had sold Jaeger’s debt to venture capitalists Better Capital, which put the firm into administration. He says bankers ‘stole’ his company – a charge they deny. Detractors may see Tillman’s  new adventure as a little crazy, but the entrepreneur insisted: ‘I don’t think I’ve gone off my rocker at  all. I’m doing things that I want  to do, that give benefit back to  the world.’ According to the World Health Organisation, half the world’s population is at risk of malaria. In 2012 it claimed an estimated 627,000 lives. Tillman’s new clothing – and new mosquito nets he is helping produce – will be embedded with SIL2U, tiny porous silica particles with microscopic holes that can be filled with different biological agents. Mosquitos can bite through thin fabric but the repellant works to stop them coming near . For the anti-malarial garments,  the substance will be the repellent IR3535, just as effective as DEET – the most common active ingredient in insect repellents – but far less toxic, oily or smelly. Mosquitos can bite through thin fabric, so the repellent works by stopping them coming near. Tillman is also bringing out a spray that temporarily ‘mozzy-proofs’ normal clothes and that  can be sprayed on skin, and  wet wipes containing repellent  and sunscreen. He is also working with top chemists to create antibacterial hospital bedding – and even paint – by putting peroxide into the particles. Tillman said the projects were ‘very exciting’, adding: ‘I never realised the market for these sort of products was so big. We are talking billions.’ Jane Kaye-Bailey, founder of UK malaria prevention charity The Butterfly Tree, which works in Zambia, said: ‘I would welcome anything that has the potential to save lives.’ She urged Mr Tillman to make his new products affordable for those in poorer parts of the world, or to give them directly to charities.","Harold Tillman, 68, is producing clothes filled with a powerful insect repellent .

"Bladder cancer victim Heather Crisp pictured at home in Burnham, Bucks with her son Scott . A cancer patient who was told she had a good chance of making a full . recovery has now been diagnosed as terminally ill - after waiting ten . weeks for surgery because of a beds shortage at her local NHS hospital. When Heather Crisp was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year, doctors were optimistic because  the disease had not spread. She . underwent a programme of chemotherapy which ended in early December and . according to NHS rules, should have been operated on within a month. But the surgery was repeatedly delayed because of the lack of an . available bed at Wexham Park Hospital near Slough. In . late February this year, the mother-of-two was finally sent for . treatment at a private hospital but by then the cancer had spread to her . pelvic wall making it inoperable. She . was later told the cancer was probably terminal. Her family are now . launching legal action against Wexham Park, which was put in 'special . measures' in April. Last . night, Mrs Crisp, 62, from Burnham in Berkshire, said: 'I truly believe . that if they had done the operation when they should have, in early . January, I would not be in this situation. It's now inoperable, and . they've said there's nothing more they can really do.' She . recalled how, after being turned away for her operation the first time, . her surgeon had told her to stage a sit-down protest if it happened . again. When she went in a few days later and was told once more that . there were no beds, she decided to try the tactic. But after walking . around intensive care, the surgeon told her there was no point. That . second delay, on February 9, prompted a referral to a Spire private . hospital. But it was not until February 21 that she went under  the . knife. Mrs . Crisp's son Scott, 37, a marketing executive, quit his job in Australia . to become his mother's carer. He said the family had become more and . more uneasy as the weeks passed. He said: 'We were asking, ""Are these delays normal? Isn't there a risk the cancer will spread?"" ' The . shocking case comes as official figures published yesterday showed . cancer waiting time targets in England have been missed for  the first . time in five years.

"Tragic: Jasmyn Chan, 14, died at the scene when she and her 12-year-old friend were hit by a car . A teenage girl killed by a hit-and-run driver was last night hailed as a hero after apparently saving the life of her friend. Jasmyn Chan, 14, died after being struck by a car on Friday evening just yards from her home in Sheffield. Her friend Tia Tucker, 12, was seriously hurt but survived. She is being treated in hospital. Yesterday, friends and family of the teenager,  who went by the nickname ‘Jazzy’, paid tribute to her and suggested that she may have saved Tia’s life by pushing her out of the way of the car. Her aunt Christine, 52, told the Sunday Mirror: 'What Jasmyn did was amazing. When she saw the car she pushed Tia out of the way. 'I spoke to Tia briefly [yesterday] morning. I don't think it has dawned on her yet what happened.' Mark Tucker said on Facebook: ‘RIP Jazzy. Our Tia told me what you did, legend.’ Holly Wilson added: ‘A true hero, always done everything for other people, never put yourself first.’ Yesterday, dozens of flowers were laid at the scene of the crash. One message read: ‘In school, I never saw you without a smile on your . face. You brightened up a room just by your presence.

"Babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition, according to the biggest-ever study of its kind. It found that a child’s risk of being diagnosed with the developmental  disorder also doubles if they have a cousin with the condition. The study of two million children came after scientists at King’s College London were asked by  numerous parents what their chances were of having a second autistic child. Discovery: Babies are ten times more likely to develop autism if they have a brother or sister with the condition, according to a new study. The risk of being diagnosed also doubles if they have a cousin with the disorder . The study looked at the medical records of all children born in Sweden between 1982 and 2006, to see how those with autism were related. Of the two million children, 14,516 were diagnosed with an ‘autism spectrum disorder’. Those on the spectrum find it  difficult to socialise with other children, and struggle to read the subtle signs in people’s speech, faces and body language. However, there is a wide range in how badly sufferers are affected and how they respond. Research site: The study of two million children came after scientists at King's College London (pictured) were asked by  numerous parents what their chances were of having a second autistic child . Some withdraw into their own worlds, rarely smiling, while others react with aggression or obsessively follow repetitive routines. Many need substantial support into their adult lives, with some parents left struggling to cope. Study author Dr Sven Sandin, of King’s College London and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said parents with an autistic child needed to think carefully about enlarging their family. ‘Some will want to avoid having another autistic child, but for others it won’t be a problem,’ he added. But Dr Laura Cockburn, of the National Autistic Society, said parents of autistic children were ‘well aware of the significant challenges involved in raising them’. She said: ‘Parents can only make a decision about having another child based on what’s best for their family.’ She also noted that many of those who develop the condition are born into families with no history of it. Autism is much more common in boys than girls; overall, the chance of having a boy on the autistic spectrum is about one in 50. This increases to one in five if the boy is born to a couple who already has an autistic child. Accountable: 'Environmental factors' - such as premature birth - account for 50 per cent of a child's chance of being autistic, says the study. But most of these factors appear to be outside the control of parents (file picture) By contrast, the chance of a girl having autism is lower, at about one in 200. Consequently, the chance of a baby girl developing the condition if she also has a sibling with it is one  in 20. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, also found genes account for 50 per cent of a child’s chance of being autistic, with ‘environmental factors’ accounting for the remaining 50 per cent. Previous studies of twins have suggested genes play an even higher role – as high as 90 per cent. But Dr Sandin said most of these environmental factors – such as  premature birth – appeared to be outside the control of parents.","Babies ten times more likely to develop autism if sibling has it, says study .

"Hospitals were so busy last winter that staff advised patients to go to a supermarket for urgent medical treatment. They were directed to an Asda-based walk-in centre in Hereford when staff shortages forced two minor injury units to shut. The centres, in Leominster and Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, were closed after their nurses were drafted in to help at the A&E department in Hereford. Patients needing urgent medical care were told to go to an Asda-based walk-in centre in Hereford after two local minor injuries centres were closed due to staff shortages (file picture) Posters detailing alternative NHS services – including the Asda-based NHS walk-in centre – were put on the doors of the two units. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the incident showed the NHS was in 'crisis' Last night Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘It’s clear the NHS is in crisis when it tells injured patients to go to Asda, not A&E.’ The incident, which took place in January, came to light after Freedom of Information requests about serious problems faced by hospitals last winter. A spokesman for Wye Valley NHS Trust said shutting the minor injury units temporarily had been an efficient use of staff in the circumstances. He added: ‘It’s not the Asda shop we are talking about – the NHS walk-in centre is just in the Asda building.’","Hospitals were so busy last winter patients were told to go to an Asda walk-in centre for care .

"One of Britain’s most popular bacon brands contains so much salt that eating just four rashers puts people over the recommended daily limit. Tests have revealed that 100g of grilled Wall’s unsmoked bacon contains 7.1g of salt. It means that a typical breakfast sandwich containing four rashers of the bacon would provide more than the total daily recommended intake of 6g of salt. Breakfast favourite: 100g of Wall's unsmoked bacon contain 7.1g of salt, more than your daily consumption . High salt intake increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes by raising blood pressure. Last night, health campaigners urged Wall’s to ‘stop dragging their heels’ and cut salt levels. Sonia Pombo, a nutritionist with the charity Consensus Action on Salt & Health, said: ‘Wall’s seem to be completely ignoring Government advice to reduce the level of salt in their products, even though it would benefit customers’ health. Salty survey: Wall¿s was found to make the saltiest bacon in a survey by the firm Can I Eat It? Their survey looked at how much salt there was in 100g of grilled bacon from a number of leading brands . ‘Bacon can be made with much lower levels of salt. We urge them, and other companies alike, to stop dragging their heels, and make significant reductions in salt.’ Wall’s was found to make the saltiest bacon in a survey by the firm Can I Eat It?, which has developed a mobile phone app to help shoppers tell how healthy food products are. Their survey looked at how much salt there was in 100g of grilled bacon from a number of leading brands. They found Wall’s unsmoked bacon contained 7.1g per 100g, or 1.7g per grilled rasher. Second was Morrisons M Savers bacon with 5.5g per 100g, and third I Love unsmoked back bacon, containing 5.3g per 100g. Asda’s Extra Special Dry bacon has just 3.4g per 100g after grilling. Can I Eat It? founder Martin Isark described the amount of salt in Wall’s unsmoked as ‘a disgrace’. He said: ‘Just four crispy rashers of Wall’s unsmoked bacon for your breakfast would not be seen as greedy, but that would be more than the daily allowance in one go. 'That’s without beans, sausages, tinned tomatoes, eggs, ketchup, bread and butter. ‘Wall’s are out of step with health organisations and their competitors – their customers deserve better.’ A spokesman for Wall’s, owned by Irish foods giant Kerry Group, said the salt content of its unsmoked bacon was 3.11g per 100g before cooking – ‘in line with other manufacturers and other products in this survey’. When it was pointed out that all the brands were compared on a like-for-like basis, he would not explain why Wall’s was the saltiest. He said: ‘We remain committed to looking at new ways to reduce salt content of our products, without compromising on the great taste our customers love.’","100g of Wall's unsmoked bacon has 7.1g of salt - more than the daily limit .

"When Carol Roe stands at her back gate she can look out across the road and see her granddaughter's grave. On August 2 the Geraldton woman's 22-year-old granddaughter Julieka Dhu was arrested and then kept in jail over an unpaid $1000 fine, and three days later she was dead. 'My granddaughter got killed in custody,' Ms Roe told the Daily Mail Australia. 'She's laying over there when she should be sitting with me in my backyard.' Scroll down for video . Julieka Dhu, 22, died in police custody on August 4 after being held in jail for three days over an unpaid fine . The Geraldton woman had broken ribs and bleeding on the lungs, but an autopsy did not determine the exact cause of death . Almost three months later, Ms Dhu's family is still waiting for answers. They don't know what the fine she hadn't paid was for and they don't know how she died. Family have learned that Ms Dhu had broken ribs and bleeding on the lungs. They know she was taken to hospital, but they have no idea why she was moved back to the South Hedland police watch-house in Western Australia when she needed medical attention. An autopsy did not determine the exact cause of death. Ms Roe says she will never get her 'happy-go-lucky' granddaughter back, but now she wants justice. 'I want the justice and truth and to know why did it happen to my granddaughter over $1000,' she said. WA Premier Colin Barnett has admitted the police investigation into her death has 'taken longer than it should have', but has promised the coroner will uncover the truth. Ms Dhu's grandmother Carol Roe said almost three months later the family is still waiting for answers . Deaths in Custody Watch Committee WA spokesman Marc Newhouse said when Ms Dhu died she had blood on her lungs, a head injury and fractured ribs. In a change.org petition, which has almost 53,000 signatures, Carol Roe is calling on WA Premier Colin Barnett for: . 'It's unclear how she sustained those injuries and whether it was between being transported to police station, we just don't know,' Mr Newhouse told Daily Mail Australia. The man who was in the cell next to Ms Dhu, 61-year-old Malcolm Dick Wilson, said she was crying out in pain while in jail, The Australian reported. 'Police was just ignoring her. I couldn't do anything to help her, I felt so bad,' Mr Wilson said. Ms Dhu's boyfriend Dion Ruffin, 39, who was taken into custody along with Ms Dhu over the breach of a restraining order relating to a second woman, said she was taken back and forth between hospital and jail. 'When the cops finally agreed to take her to hospital the last time they were laughing and saying she was acting,' Mr Ruffin told The Australian. 'They opened the cell, and I heard one of them say ""Get up"", but she couldn't and she was begging for help to get up and I heard a big thud, and then silence.' Ms Roe is now petitioning WA Premier for a 'timely' coronial inquest into Ms Dhu's death in custody and an independent authority to investigate all custodial deaths. 'Every time another person dies, police do their own internal report,' Ms Roe wrote on change.org. 'Police officers that know each other, interview each other. 'In other countries like the UK, they have an external and independent person investigate – I don't know if the police did anything wrong, but how will I ever know if we don't have an open investigation?' Ms Roe says she will never get her 'happy go lucky' granddaughter back, but now she wants justice . At a series of rallies across Perth, Geraldton and Hedland October 23, Ms Roe and hundreds of other people marched to demand for justice for Ms Dhu . Ms Roe is also calling for another Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, more than two decades after then-Prime minister Bob Hawke established a Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1987. 'Enough is enough,' she said. 'Too many more people have died since then and now my granddaughter.' A family spokeswoman, Lara Pullin, said WA had Australia's highest rate of indigenous incarceration, with 38 per cent of those in custody of indigenous background. For juveniles, it is 64 per cent. She said there had been 400 indigenous deaths in custody since the Royal Commission and the rate was actually increasing because of the large number of indigenous people in jail. At a series of rallies across Perth, Geraldton and Hedland October 23, Ms Roe and hundreds of other people marched to demand for justice for Ms Dhu. WA Premier Colin Barnett addressed the crowd at the Perth rally and promised to complete the coroner's report as quickly as possible . Premier Barnett addressed the crowd at the Perth rally and promised to complete the coroner's report as quickly as possible. 'With respect to the loss of Julieka, it is a complicated situation, but I want to promise you that whatever happened all of the circumstances… the truth and the full truth will come out, I will ensure that,' he said. 'There is a police in investigation that should be completed very shortly, it's taken longer than it should have. 'The coroner will thoroughly review every single thing that happened and we'll try and ensure that that the coroner's report is complete quickly but done properly.' A spokeswoman for Mr Barnett told Daily Mail Australia that WA Police have indicated they will provide their internal report to the coroner by the end of October. It is unclear how long a coronial inquest will take.

"Prince Charles spoke about the emotional devastation he felt at the murder of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, by the IRA during a speech made in Bogota today. Speaking to the families of victims of Colombia’s  bloody 50-year civil war, the heir to the throne said he understood the ‘bewildering and soul-destroying anguish’ that so many of them had experienced. Charles was extremely close to his uncle, who died in a terrorist bombing in August 1979. Indeed he viewed the Queen’s second cousin and former Viceroy of India as a second father and mentor. Scroll down for video . Important: Prince Charles, seen here with Camilla and President Juan Manuel Santos, made an impassioned plea for peace . Impassioned: The speech, which was made at the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation, referenced his uncle Lord Mountbatten . All smiles: Charles and Camilla, who was stylish in a soft lime ensemble, appeared to be enjoying themselves as they arrived . Murdered: Lord Mountbatten (right) was murdered by the Provisional IRA in 1979 who placed a bomb on his boat during a fishing trip . Mountbatten, 79, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, who planted a bomb in his boat in Co Sligo, in the Irish Republic, during a family fishing trip. One of his twin grandsons, Nicholas Knatchbull, 14, lost his life, along with a local boat boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell. Another passenger on the boat, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, 82, died in hospital the day after the attack. The only person convicted for the murders, Thomas McMahon, an experienced IRA bomb-maker, was released from jail under the Good Friday peace agreement after serving 18 years in jail. A second man was acquitted. Charles is currently on a four-day tour of Colombia with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and yesterday the couple attended a Peace and Reconciliation Exhibition and Ceremony in the capital Bogota. For the past half century Colombia has been riven by the longest civil war on the globe. More than 250,000 people – many innocent civilians - have lost their lives as a result of fighting between left-wing guerrillas including the Farc (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army), government groups and right-wing paramilitary forces, set up by wealthy landowners for protection. More than five million people are also believed to have been left displaced. Serious issue: The couple arrived with President Juan Manuel Santos who in 2012 received the Shalom prize for his pursuit of peace . Tragic: Charles spoke of the Colombian Civil War which began in 1964 and is estimated to have claimed as many as 250,000 lives . A kiss for Camilla: One well-wisher planted a kiss on the Duchess of Cornwall's cheek as she arrived at the Centre . Democracy: The exhibits displayed in the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation aim to promote peace and democracy . Upsetting: During their visit, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were given an insight into the plight of people affected by war . Many of these armed factions have financed their actions through kidnapping and drug trafficking. Paramilitaries from both side have also been accused of organising widespread massacre, torture and violent crime. Accompanied by the country’s President, Juan Manuel Santos and his wife, Maria, Charles and Camilla were shown exhibition marking the plight of the victims of the civil unrest, many of whom have never been found. They also spoke to the families of some of those victims who had gathered at the Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation. Addressing his audience, Charles spoke of how ‘deeply touched’ he and his wife were to be invited to honour the victims of civil conflict in Colombia. The prince continued: ‘It is an immense tragedy that violence has cast such a long shadow across the whole of this remarkable country for the past five decades. Many of you here today will have experienced unimaginable suffering, and our hearts go out to you as you struggle to come to terms with all that has happened to you and your loved ones. ‘I suspect that many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family including one of my godsons were murdered in Northern Ireland just over thirty years ago. So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.’ Discussion: While Prince Charles made a speech, the Duchess met peace campaigners, among them Maria Eugenia Cruz (right) Pretty: During the meeting, the Duchess of Cornwall was given a traditional mochila bag made by a victim of sexual violence . Sympathy: After hearing their stories, Camilla and the Colombian First Lady, posed for a photo with some of the female survivors .

History: The small villa was the home of Simón Bolívar, a military leader who battled for independence from Spain in the 18th century . Colourful: During the visit, Camilla posed with First Lady Maria Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos in front of a  flower arrangement . Exciting stuff: Last night saw the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall entertained by ballet dancer, Fernando Montaño . Privilege: Camilla, who like her husband is a long term fan of ballet, described seeing Mr Montaño perform as a 'privilege' In recent months the president has managed to launch successful talks with the guerrilla rebels, which have given real hope that a peace deal can be achieved. Charles referred to the UK’s own peace process in Ireland, saying: ‘It is my earnest hope and prayer that Colombia will soon find a lasting and durable peace. ‘Of course, as we have learnt in the U.K from the Northern Ireland Peace Process, and the Good Friday Agreement, building conditions for peace takes time – and there are pitfalls along the way. ‘Great political and moral leadership is required from all parties to the conflict; and from society at large, which must also strongly feel the need for truth, reconciliation and forgiveness. ‘ . He concluded: ‘The dignity of those we have met and listened to today is a truly inspiring tribute to the human spirit. ‘As one who has himself experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence, it is my fervent hope that Colombians might find the strength to continue cultivating a commitment to peace and reconciliation in their own hearts. For this must surely be the key to a lasting solution in Colombia.’ After his speech Charles and his wife continued with their busy programme of engagements, the prince flying to a rainforest to highlight the ecology of Colombia, with Camilla attending round-table discussion on the issue of violence against women. On Wednesday night the royal couple were guests of honour at a State Dinner thrown by the President, at which they were treated to a surprise performance by Colombia’s great ballet dancer, Fernando Montano, recently appointed a soloist with the Royal Ballet. Both are huge fans of ballet and Duchess, wearing an elegant pink Bruce Oldfield gown with a sparkling bodice, said she felt ‘hugely privileged’. Glamorous: The Duchess of Cornwall wore a pretty sequinned gown by Bruce Oldfield for last night's dinner . Enjoying the night: The Duchess, who paired the dress with Russell and Bromley shoes, appeared to be enjoying the trip .

"The Duchess of Cornwall yesterday declared herself 'humbled' by the courage of a group of rape survivors. And she vowed to use her position as a member of the Royal Family to do everything she could to bring the issue of sexual violence against women 'out of the shadows and into the light'. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline during a four-day tour of Colombia with her husband, the Prince of Wales, Camilla made clear she wanted the difficult - and often socially uncomfortable - issue of rape and sexual abuse to be a cornerstone of her work . Scroll down for video . Courage: Camilla says she was left 'humbled' by the courage of the rape victims she met in Bogota . Gift: During the meeting, Camilla was presented with a traditional mochila bag made for her by the women . The Duchess, wearing a pistachio Anna Valentine suit, was taking part in a Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative event in the capital Bogota involving campaigners and victims. Colombia is just emerging from five decades of bloody civil war which has seen the deaths of an estimated 250,000 people, many innocent civilians. The country has also seen during that time some of the most appalling human rights abuses and violations recorded. Of 6.9 million victims registered by the Government, 6,743 are officially recorded as victims of sexual violence. But officials believe that is merely the tip of the iceberg due to the stigma of the crime. One survey estimates that between 2001 and 2009, almost half a million Colombian women were victims of rape and sexual assault in conflict zones. That amounts to an attack every 15 minutes. The Colombian government has now has set up one of the most comprehensive legal and institutional frameworks in the world to tackle he issue and declared May 25 as the National Day for the dignity of victims of sexual violence. Admiration: Camilla told MailOnline that she admired the women's determination to bring the issue into the light . Campaign: The Duchess has long worked to highlight the plight of victims of sexual violence . After listening intently to yesterday's discussion, the Duchess told the MailOnline: 'I was humbled by the courage of the Colombian women I met today, who had been raped like so many others, in horrendous circumstances, and I salute their determination to bring rape and sexual abuse out of the shadows into the light.' Camilla said that it was clear that the only way to banish the stigma of the crime and to encourage more women to come forward to receive the help they needed was to 'keep talking'. She invited the Colombian delegation - which is supported by the British Embassy in Colombia -- to the UK to look processes for survivors of sexual violence there. The Duchess is involved with a number of groups in this field in the UK and last year even created and spearheaded an initiative to offer washbags containing soap, shampoo and other toiletries for women who have reported a sexual assault and often undergone traumatic forensic examinations. One victim who met her was Jineth Bedoya, a Colombian journalist who was kidnaped and raped by paramilitary fighters while covering the conflict. For many years she kept silent about her ordeal but eventually decide to speak out and launch her own campaign against the issue. Speaking out: Charles made a speech during the visit to the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation . Colourful: After meeting rape victims, Camilla continued on to the Quinta Bolivar Museum in Bogota . Tribute: Camilla, who planted a rose, was joined by at the museum by Maria Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos . She shared a platform with the then Foreign Secretary William Hague during his visit to Colombia earlier this year. She said of the Duchess: 'To have a woman who is so committed to the topic of sexual violence - to meet her, to talk to her, to listen to her and to learn about her support of this issue -is without a doubt the memory that I take away from this Royal visit and our meeting. 'The Duchess understands our work and our commitment to making visible the women who have been victims of sexual violence. 'I believe that it is really important to highlight what the Duchess said about the need for the United Kingdom to know about our experience and work and that we get to know the efforts that are being made in the the UK to eradicate sexual violence.' Another campaigner - and victim - Maria Eugenia Cruz added: 'The situation in Colombia is very difficult. Pucker up: Prince Charles, meanwhile, found himself the recipient of a friendly kiss at a village in Macarena . Striking: Charles and President Juan Manuel Santos also visited Cano Cristales in La Macarena National Park . 'Sexual violence affects our bodies, our minds and our families. We need more people to speak out and more resources to tackle the issue. 'I want to empower women and help them understand that they have a right to justice. To make visible the crime of sexual violence and to make women realise it's not their fault and there is no shame in what has happened to them. 'I started working with displaced women six years ago and as we campaigned for change, threats against us increased and some of the women were raped. It didn't put me off because it is important that people of the world join together and eradicate sexual violence to stop this from happening to other people.

"They say you should let the train take the strain. And that’s exactly what the Queen did today as she left London for her annual festive break at Sandringham. But being the monarch, however, she also let her Jaguar do the work too. Much to the surprise of fellow passengers on the 10.44 from London’s Kings Cross to Kings Lynn, the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were driven all the way up Platform 1, right to the door of her First Class carriage. Commuters were kept behind ticket barriers without explanation, and only realise their train was being graced by royalty when they saw their official car purr past. Home sweet home! The Queen arrives at King's Lynn station accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh . Smart in a knee-length Prince of Wales check coat and a printed silk headscarf, the Queen appeared in good spirits as she marched briskly towards the waiting carriage. The Duke of Edinburgh, meanwhile, was dapper in a neat navy blue blazer, complete with polished brass buttons, and carried a walnut leather briefcase. The couple arrived at Kings Lynn on time at 12.21pm and smiled at well-wishers. The Queen’s staff normally book their tickets in advance using her senior railcard, which this year would have cost £34.30 each. A . source told the Mail: ‘The Queen encourages all her staff to buy . tickets in advance as it works out so much cheaper and would always use a . rail card if appropriate to do so.’ Surprise! Commuters were staggered to see the monarch being driven up the platform to board the train .

"Doctors and nurses should apologise to patients when mistakes are made to win back trust in the NHS, the Health Secretary has said. Jeremy Hunt said NHS staff had become ‘defensive’ and were inclined not to say sorry to patients and relatives for fear of being sued. New guidance sent to the hospitals in England and Wales tells staff that saying sorry is not admitting legal liability but is ‘the right thing to do’. Doctors and nurses are to be told that apologising is not admitting legal liability but is the right thing to do (file picture) Mr Hunt said he would like to see ‘an open NHS culture’ that ‘learns when things go wrong’. He told The Telegraph: ‘Saying sorry and supporting patients and their families when they have experienced harm is a really important part of this. It’s great to see staff being supported to do the right thing. ‘Sadly, under the last Government a closed and defensive culture developed in parts of the NHS. We are transforming this culture through a new transparency drive in our hospitals.’ To address these concerns – including the Mid Staffordshire scandal where 1,200 patients died – the NHS Litigation Authority (NHS LA) has produced a four-page leaflet for staff entitled ‘saying sorry’. It says a face-to-face apology must be given as soon as an incident has occurred. ‘A written apology, which clearly states the healthcare organisation is sorry for the suffering and distress resulting from the incident, must also be given,’ it says. The leaflet explains that saying sorry is not an admission of liability, adding: ‘The NHS LA is not an insurer and we will never withhold cover for a claim because an apology or explanation has been given. ‘ . Officials want to prevent a repeat of the poor care and culture at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust where 1,200 patients died . Catherine Dixon, chief executive of the NHS LA, said: ‘Saying sorry is the human and moral thing to do, we won’t say we’re not going to cover you because you’ve said sorry. ‘In cases where people perhaps bring a claim out of frustration, because they don’t feel that they’ve been given an explanation or that their complaints have been heard, an apology may make them less likely to pursue an action. ‘We actively support organisations being open, transparent and candid with their patients. We have seen some cases where that hasn’t happened in the NHS. It’s important that we create and support the right culture. It can win back people’s trust.’ The amount set aside by the NHS to compensate patients for medical blunders has soared by nearly a quarter between 2012 and 2013. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would like to see 'an open NHS culture' that 'learns when things go wrong' A total of £22.7billion has been reserved to deal with thousands of clinical negligence claims. The number of claims rose by 11 per cent in 2012 to 10,129 in 2013 with some payouts of around £5million. The figures, published in the annual report of the NHS Litigation Authority, are an estimate based on the number of claims the NHS believes it will be unable to defend, how severe errors are, and how much victims should receive. The report shows that by 2012/13, the estimate had risen to £22.7billion, up 22 per cent from £18.6billion. Official figures show that 104 negligence claims have succeeded against the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust over the past four years.","Apologising does not mean admitting legal liability, staff told .

"Victim: Big Issue seller Razvan Dumitru stole £50 from blind pensioner Jane Phillips, pictured, as she tried to give him some money . A Romanian Big Issue seller who stole £50 from a blind pensioner lives in a four-bedroom terraced house worth £250,000. Razvan Dumitru snatched five £10 notes from 66-year-old Jane Phillips’s purse as she tried to give him £1 so he could buy something to eat. Nearby shoppers held the 22-year-old until police arrived. Miss Phillips revealed that the same  man had stolen money from her before but that she had forgiven him and given him more money because she thought he was homeless. But last night it emerged that Dumitru and his family live on a smart street in Edmonton, North London, where properties typically sell for more than a quarter of a million pounds. In November 2011, their house was offered for rent at £1,600 a month and described by letting agents as ‘immaculate’, with ‘three double rooms, one en suite, two bathrooms, good-size garden, large reception and newly fitted kitchen’. Big Issue sellers must be homeless, in temporary accommodation or facing financial crisis to be allowed to sell the magazine, but neighbours said Dumitru and his family had lived in the property for some two years. A woman who identified herself as Dumitru’s mother laughed when asked about her son’s crime. She would not confirm whether Dumitru lived with her but acknowledged he was awaiting  sentencing, saying: ‘It’s fine.’ And Dumitru’s father, who was reached by phone, reacted by  simply saying: ‘So?’ One shopkeeper on the quiet residential street said he had banned the family from his store. The man, who did not want to be named, said lots of different people were seen arriving at the property at night in luxury cars. Thief: Last night it emerged that Dumitru, left, lives in a £250,000 house in Edmonton, North London, right . Scene: The Big Issue seller stole from the blind woman outside this branch of  Morrisons in Sutton, Surrey . The . shopkeeper said it was unclear how many people lived in the house but . they seemed to  have money because they drove BMW and Mercedes cars. It . will raise questions about why Dumitru was allowed to sell the Big . Issue magazine – a job reserved  for Britain’s homeless – especially . considering he had previous convictions. Recovering: Jane Phillips (right) is pictured with her twin sister Mary, who is also blind . Last night it was revealed that . Dumitru stole from Miss Phillips while serving a suspended prison . sentence. In December 2011 . he pleaded guilty to stealing an iPhone in Caffé Nero in Clapham . Junction, South London, and was given a six-month suspended sentence. He . had also been banned from the supermarket Morrisons in Sutton, South . London, where last Saturday’s incident took place, for shoplifting. Morrisons . security guard Lisbona Addo said Dumitru was well known in the area as a . shoplifter, adding: ‘I’ve arrested him once before. He’s not allowed in . the store.’ Dumitru . admitted the offence against Miss Phillips in front of Croydon . magistrates on Monday and has been remanded in custody to be sentenced. Miss . Phillips said Dumitru should be deported, adding: ‘I don’t think . criminals from another country should be able to stay here.’ A Big Issue spokesman said: ‘Dumitru had been selling, on and off, for a number of months. He was never a consistent presence.’ The . charity said it took referrals from councils on the homelessness status . of vendors but that this  system was ‘far from reliable’. Last . year it was revealed that an astonishing one in three Big Issue vendors . – 700 out of a nationwide force of 2,250 – come from Romania. Under a . loophole in EU immigration rules, Big Issue sellers can claim . ‘self-employed status’ in the UK and therefore claim benefits. The Big Issue added: ‘The Big Issue puts each new vendor through an induction process. ‘Each . vendor at the end of induction signs a code of conduct they must adhere . to when selling. If  they breach it, they will be disqualified from . selling.’ Founder: John Bird, right, who started The Big Issue, has said it is about decriminalising the homeless . Emil Metodiev was jailed yesterday for a burglary nine days after arriving in Britain from Bulgaria . Millions of Romanian and Bulgarian . citizens will be able to live freely in Britain when restrictions are . lifted on January 1. The move has sparked fears of an influx in which many could fail to find work, ending up destitute or selling the Big Issue. British . politicians have clashed with those in Romania, including Minister for . Labour Mariana Campeanu - who said her country's citizens take jobs . shunned by British workers. She . added the UK should be 'grateful' for the extra labour and only a tiny . minority of people will come to Britain in the hope of claiming benefits . or committing crime. However, . politicians have raised concerns over how immigrants with shady pasts . will be monitored, or how the authorities will prevent those with few . means becoming homeless or sleeping rough. Yesterday a Bulgarian citizen with a string of convictions in his homeland was jailed for breaking into a home just nine days after coming to the UK. Emil Metodiev (right) was caught after being chased by a homeowner who found him stealing a handbag, cash, war medals, mobile phones and jewellery. The 32-year-old, jailed for theft at least four times in Bulgaria, arrived on October 22 after leaving his wife and the clothes shop they ran in the capital city, Sofia. Nine days later, Denise Toms, 55, woke up to find the downstairs of her home in Southend, Essex, had been ransacked. Her son Adam, 19, saw Metodiev fleeing through the back garden and chased after him wearing  just his underpants.","Razvan Dumitru, 22, stole from 66-year-old as she rummaged in her purse .

"His matinee-idol looks and Adonis-like physique have possibly contributed as much to Urs Buhler's success as his tremulous tenor. But getting into this  kind of shape takes hard work  and no little commitment. Indeed, Urs - one quarter of hunky 'popera' group Il Divo - is a self-confessed gym addict. The singer joined the health club in his home town of Willisau in Switzerland as a teenager and likes to work out every day, often twice. True to form, when we meet he  has just come from a gruelling session of running, cycling, rowing and weights. But today is different. Urs Buhler, pictured in France with his motorbike, is a self-confessed gym addict . It is his first time in a gym in three months following an operation to repair a torn muscle in his right shoulder which left him unable  to exercise. For many, the agony of such an injury would be bad enough, but for Urs, 42, it threw into stark relief just how all-consuming his quest  for a perfect body had become. He says: 'Working out is such a huge part of my life, and I'll often schedule my whole day around  gym sessions; what to eat and when to eat it. Having that routine and purpose taken away has been psychologically hard. 'But seeing and feeling my body change, losing my muscle definition and bulk, has been even harder. I enjoy the rush that exercise gives me and I enjoy the results even more, but for the past three months I've not even been able to lift a coffee cup to my mouth.' Though all the members of Il Divo are image-conscious, Urs is the most driven of the band in terms of fitness - his total gym hours amount to about 15,000 since he signed up for his first session - and he has struggled more than most people might with what is a common injury. He says: 'It's important, how we look. A good suit can only do so much for you - the rest is up to  you, and right now, due to this injury, I'm not where I want to be.' Though all the members of Il Divo are image-conscious, Urs is the most driven of the band in terms of fitness . Although a tear is normally associated with a shock movement, Urs doesn't recall this happening. 'I snowboard a lot and although I've fallen a few times, I don't remember a sudden jolt of pain,' he says. 'I was moving furniture in January last year and vaguely remember something going “pop”. It wasn't excruciating, just a niggle, but as time went on, the irritating discomfort turned into a searing pain. 'I carried on going to the gym and worked through the pain, but as it turns out, the specific exercises  I was doing were the very ones I should have been avoiding: pull-downs behind the head, bench presses lower than a 90-degree angle, and tricep dips. 'All of these exercises make the shoulder joint very vulnerable, and if you haven't got a problem already, there is a high risk those exercises will give you one.' In March, Urs was in Las Vegas where his girlfriend Kelly Phelan, a professional gymnast who performs with Cirque du Soleil, is based. Surrounded by athlete friends who have experienced similar injuries, he was encouraged to see Dr James Dettling, a renowned orthopaedic surgeon. He discovered two separate injuries: the first was a tear between the place that the bicep arm muscle attaches to the labrum, a band of tough tissue that surrounds the entire socket of the shoulder joint holding it in place (also known as a SLAP tear), and another to the rotator cuff, the muscles and tendons that also surround the shoulder, controlling and stabilising movement. Dr Dettling says:  'I see a lot of sports people with these injuries. But anybody of any age can sustain it if they happen to fall badly on their arm or shoulder.' While SLAP tears generally happen due to wear and tear, rotator cuff injury typically happens due to a sudden trauma. Unlike Urs, most people normally know when and how they've done it. 'It's a pretty dramatic injury,' says Dr Dettling. Eventually, Urs found it was affecting everything he did. 'It got to the point where any movement of my arm above a right angle to my body was impossible. I couldn't even pick up my daughter,' he says. 'If I tried to swim, next day my arm would feel as if it was falling off.' So with Dr Dettling at the helm, in August last year Urs underwent a reconstructive operation to repair these two areas of the shoulder. These procedures used to be carried out - and still are by some surgeons - through a large incision  but now the procedure can be done via tiny keyhole 'stabs', or so-called arthroscopic surgery. Urs's operation took a little more than an hour under general anaesthetic and was done through two small incisions. Dr Dettling says: 'The tissue that anchors the bicep tendon to the labrum was torn, so we had to tie it back up to where it's supposed to be. We do this by drilling a hole in the bone and inserting an anchor attached suture wire, which will stay in place for ever.' With his arm in a sling for two weeks, Urs assumed that once it was taken off, he could start getting back to normal. 'Everyone kept telling me it would take three months to recover, but I didn't believe it. I naively thought that once the sling was off I could start doing normal things again. 'But as soon as I took my arm out, it just fell limply beside my body. I wasn't able to do anything with  it and I was pretty freaked out. I couldn't even wash my own hair.' Dr Dettling put Urs on an intense training programme, three times a week for ten weeks, to increase range of movement, and strengthen the shoulder. Urs Buhler and girlfriend Kelly Phelan . Urs says: 'I became very impatient. I'd gone from being such an active person to sitting in an apartment waiting for my next physio appointment. I couldn't even ride my motorbike because I wasn't allowed to hold the handlebars.' But gradually, his range of movement improved and he was allowed to do gentle exercises using small weights. 'I'd lie down on my hotel room floor and do simple things such as lifting an umbrella,' he says. 'Since the surgery I've also been doing more core exercises. I've pretty much got full movement back, though it's still painful to lift my arm above my head.' Adrian Wilson, an orthopaedic surgeon at the North Hampshire Hospital, says these injuries are often seen in rugby players or American footballers. So why would something so minor as moving furniture be to blame in this case? He suggests there could have been an older injury that caused a weakness that led to a minor incident, such as hauling coffee tables around, causing the rupture - which was then exacerbated by exercise. But he adds: 'There's nothing to suggest that once you've sustained an injury like this and had it reconstructed, you're at a higher risk of it happening again. These kinds of repair are very effective and, as long as you do the right physio afterwards and take it slowly, there's nothing to say you won't be back in the gym before long.' lIl Divo's album of Broadway songs, A Musical Affair, is out now. By Adrian Wilson, orthopaedic surgeon . The socket is encircled by a tough band of tissue called the labrum.  This acts to deepen the socket and stabilise the joint. It is rather like a golf ball sitting  on a golf tee.

This means the patient has no pain at the end . of the procedure. The shoulder is immobilised in a  sling for . six weeks and rehabilitated with supervised physiotherapy.

"Miss Mayes had just started studying for a degree to become a Primary School teacher . A trainee teacher died in her sleep from a rare heart condition aged only 19 despite appearing to have no health problems. A coroner described Charlotte Mayes as the ‘perfect daughter’, as she did not smoke, drank little alcohol and was anti-drugs. She had returned from travelling in Turkey with her best friend only days before being found lifeless on the sofa by her brother Ian. He called 999 and desperately tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. In the year before her death, the only signs of a potential problem were bouts of lethargy. Her mother Michelle Roberts told an inquest: ‘She had been really, really tired, so she slept lots. ‘I did tell her to go to the doctor, but she didn’t. ‘As soon as she came home, she would sleep on the sofa.’ Mrs Roberts, who remarried after Charlotte’s father Ian died in 1994, was on holiday in Egypt with her husband Paul when Charlotte died last September. ‘I returned home and was told that she had died a few hours earlier,’  she told coroner Alan Walsh at the  hearing in Bolton. Her friend Nikita Lee said Charlotte, known as Lottie, had been ‘sleeping lots, especially near the end of the holiday’, added Mrs Roberts, of Hindley, near Wigan. She said: 'She had been really, really tired, so she slept lots. I . did tell her to go to the doctors, but she didn't. As soon as she came . home, she would sleep on the sofa. 'We . hadn't seen her - Charlotte was due back three days after we left for . Egypt. She was still in Turkey and had been there since June. She went . away with her friend Nikita. She did say about her sleeping lots, . especially near the end of the holiday. 'I was really ill in Egypt that morning, as if I knew something bad had happened.' Deputy Coroner Walsh continued, . reading from Mrs Robert's statement: 'And your daughter didn't smoke, . she was very anti-drugs and she was a light drinker. She was a perfect . daughter.' Her daughter had begun a degree in education at Liverpool Hope University five days before her death. She had hoped to become a . primary school teacher. Mr Walsh said: ‘She was, in every sense, a perfect daughter.’ He added that she would have been ‘a perfect example’ to her future pupils. The court . heard Charlotte's brother Ian, had returned to the family address around . 5.30am and Charlotte was still awake on the sofa.

She was watching television and the lap top was turned on.' Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened. Around one in 5,000 people have the condition, and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood. However, . the symptoms vary depending on the severity. These include shortness of . breath, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness and fainting attacks - most . commonly during exercise. It . can cause the heart muscle to become stiff, which means your left . ventricle doesn't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped . out. It can also partially obstruct blood flow, which can make small blood clots more likely. In . some people, the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical . conducting system of the heart. This may cause abnormal heart rates and . rhythms to develop. Sudden . collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with HCM. This is . probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly . Most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised. For more information visit www.c-r-y.org.uk or www.cardiomyopathy.org . Ian woke up at 12.30pm and went into check on his sister, but she wasn't in her bed. 'She . was lying on the sofa. I could tell she wasn't breathing and her skin was . a different colour. I phoned my brother then I called an ambulance. They told me to carry out CPR but I knew it was too late.' Charlotte . was declared dead at 12.46pm that day. Dr Trisha Wahie, who carried out . the post mortem examination, sent Charlotte's heart . to pathologist Dr Suvarna, because she could not see any abnormalities . with the naked eye. It was confirmed the promising teen had died from a . heart condition - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In evidence, Dr Wahie sad it was very possible she had died peacefully in her sleep. She . added: 'It may be a spontaneous mutation or run within families. They . can have no symptoms at all. This would have been a sudden, unexpected . death without any great suffering.' Recording a verdict of death by . natural causes Mr Walsh said: 'This is a very sad and tragic death due . to natural causes. Charlotte was on the verge of studying to fulfil her . ambition of becoming a teacher. 'She . was, in every sense, a perfect daughter. She didn't smoke, she drank . little and she engaged with her family. She was someone who you would be . proud to call your daughter. 'Although . she had suffered from tiredness, I'm sure it didn't stop her enjoying . herself in Turkey. At least, in that final stage she would have enjoyed . her final time with her friend in Turkey. 'She . was obviously a very well-liked person who intended to become a . teacher. I believe that those children she would have taught will sadly . miss the benefits of her knowledge and the benefits of her personality. 'She would have been a perfect example for those children.' The . hearing was told since Charlotte's death, family members have been . scanned for heart abnormalities, but they have had no irregular results. In . a message on Facebook her friend Nikita said: 'I lost one of the most . important things you will have in life and that was my best friend, the . one who all my memories are with, she was the most beautiful, sweetest, . fun, crazy, kind, forgiving, inspirational, cheerful girl you could . ever meet.

"For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by superheroes. I don’t know if it was the good versus evil stories, the fact justice always prevailed or simply the fact that Batman will always be the coolest man on the planet. I’m 29 now, and still find myself wishing I was him. His arch enemies, The Joker and Two Face, were part of the appeal. But now I question exactly what these fictional characters mean and say about society. Adam Pearson acted alongside Under the Skin with Scarlett Johansson. Adam suffers from Neurofibromatosis, which has given him facial disfigurement . Film baddies are often scarred, marked or have a condition of some kind. In James Bond stories, the villain is always disabled or disfigured – these things are a reason for why they turned bad. In Skyfall, the most recent film, Raoul Silva was a former M16 agent turned terrorist – and this alone was enough for me not to want to follow him on Twitter. But, just to leave the audience in no doubt that this was the bad guy, to be feared, they gave him melted teeth and a sunken left cheek (the result of a botched suicide attempt – nice!). So I’m torn. I’m a fan, but I wonder, are these portrayals necessary? They are certainly not realistic, so I worry about the message they send out about people who, like me, look different. My genetic condition, neurofibromatosis, causes excess body tissue and non-cancerous tumours. 'Having had my first taste of movie making, starring opposite the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson in Under The Skin (and for much of it, we were both naked) I¿m now intrigued about what else is out there,' Adam writes . Changing Faces is the UK’s leading . charity that supports and represents people who have conditions or . injuries that affect their appearance. In 2012 it launched its Face Equality in Film campaign, which aims to readdress the balance and challenge audience perception. The . charity created a short film featuring Leo Gormley, a campaigner who . has burns, and Michelle Dockery – of Downton Abbey fame. We see pretty Michelle at home alone, and Leo outside in a car. Eventually he knocks at the door and she answers. There is a moment of suspense and then they hug, and he hands her a bottle of wine as she says, grinning: ‘You’re early!’ The screen fades to black, with the words: ‘What did you think was going to happen?’ The idea is that people would think he was about to do something horrible to the girl. I asked James Partridge, chief executive of Changing Faces – who is facially scarred himself – about why fictional portrayals matter. He told me: ‘The way that people react in the cinema can spill over into everyday life. We have to put up with people laughing at us, recoiling or staring in disbelief. 'It is vital that the film industry takes this seriously and starts to portray disfigurement in a more balanced way.’ Are we being overly sensitive? YouGov recently asked people what they deemed to be ‘villainous characteristics’ in film. Almost half of the thousands surveyed said ‘scars, marks, and burns’. Bad teeth, baldness and use of a wheelchair were also singled out. Scarlett Johansson stars in Under the Skin, which will be released in April. Adam played alongside her which he says has inspired him to take on more roles . I’m not saying we need to abolish such portrayals altogether. But if we are going to have film characters with disfigurements, why not get those who actually have them to act? We’d certainly never have a white actor ‘black up’ to play Mandela, for instance. There have been steps forward recently: Peter Dinklage, one of the lead actors in Game Of Thrones, has a form of dwarfism. He’s since been cast in films where his height isn’t even really mentioned. An episode of Call The Midwife recently featured an actress with Down’s syndrome, and an actor with cerebral palsy. Having had my first taste of movie making, starring opposite the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson in Under The Skin (and for much of it, we were both naked) I’m now intrigued about what else is out there. Could someone like me become a film star? I don’t see why not. I’d love to play Bond, but I would love to play a Bond villain too – who wouldn’t? 'If we are going to have film characters with disfigurements, why not get those who actually have them to act? We'd certainly never have a white actor 'black up' to play Mandela, for instance,' Adam writes . It might seem a counterintuitive for me to pander to the lie that looking a bit different means you’re evil, but hear me out. As a teenager, I was called Elephant Man, Scarface and Quasimodo. All three of these film characters with a scar, mark or illness is either a victim or psychotic killer. I could probably act the part, but in real life I am neither of these things. It’s all about context. Wes Anderson’s latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, features a female character with a Mexico-shaped birthmark, which isn’t dwelt upon but is still significant. These are the types of representations we need to see. Ones that are simply incidental. Likewise, if I were to play a Bond Villain, I’d want to be evil for the way I behaved and not the way I looked. It would be an opportunity to raise the profile of people like me who have a condition that affects their appearance. How would I feel if a child used my character’s name as a term of abuse? Well, I’ve been there, and hated it, but whether they’re saying ‘gay’ or ‘ginger’ or ‘Cyclops’, some children will always be bullies. What I hope I can do is help to create a society where grown-ups don’t hold these immature, naive prejudices.

"Kim Richards' pitbull terrier Kingsley savaged her niece Alexia so badly that the teen was left needing surgery. The attack on the 18-year-old saw the dog bite her multiple times, with the most severe wound ripping through the flesh on her hand to reach the bone in her thumb. She is understood to have required two different surgeries. The dog, which has a history of biting, currently remains at Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star Kim's home. Scroll down for video . Devoted mother: Kyle Richards sleeps over at Cedars Sinai hospital on Monday as her daughter Alexa is treated after being attacked by her aunt Kim's dog Kingsley in LA . According to website TMZ Kingsley went for Alexia during a family gathering, early on Saturday morning at Kim's house. A group including Alexia's mother Kyle were at the home on Halloween, and had been near the dog without incident  when it 'went into attack mode out of nowhere'. But according to an update by TMZ Kim now claims to have warned her niece not to go into the room her dog was being kept in and that she warns every house guest that Kingsley 'should not be bothered'. Family pet: Kim Richards with the dog that attacked her niece; it is not the first time Kingsley has bitten . 'The second I realized Alexia had been bitten on the finger leaving a puncture mark on her thumb,' Kim said, 'I immediately called my sister Kyle and took her to the nearest emergency room.' The wound however was reportedly more than just a puncture, but a gash to the bone requiring two surgeries. Kim went on to discuss the fate of the dog: 'At this point I am looking at options to what the next step is for Kingsley. As many of you can relate, he is my best friend. This is a very difficult decision and time for all of us, but the safety of my family always comes first.' The animal has previously featured in the plotline of RHOBH where it was seen being very aggressive towards other dogs. Aggressive: The animal previously bit a trainer hired to domesticate it . Incident: A group  had been at the home for a family celebration, when the dog 'went into attack mode' After Kim sought  help controlling the dog, it bit the trainer she hired, one of four known biting incidents. Back in March the dog savaged a friend of Kim's while she was sat on her bed chatting to the star. The bite went through to the woman's bone in her arm and paramedics were called. A further incident occurred when an unknown victim was bitten this summer. Following that attack LA's department of Animal Control Services did visit the home to assess the dog, but the animal was left in Kim's care. However as the latest attack was not reported to authorities, Kingsley remains at mother-of-four Kim's home. Attack: Kinglsey was seen biting his trainer in an old episode of the RHOBH . Unless a victim or member of their family contacts the ACS then no action will be taken. If a report is made an assessment will take place to decide if the animal is under control in Kim's care. ACS visited the star's home over the summer after it attacked another visitor, but at the time Kim was only given a warning. David Utter, who originally trained the pitbull, has also given a statement regarding the dog to TMZ. He claims the dog should be muzzled at all time and now that the dog has attacked four people direct and immediate action should be taken. Utter says the Kingsley should be immediately taken away from Kim. Kim's sister Kyle, mother to Alexia, has previously commented that she felt 'nervous' about Kingsley's behaviour. On an reunion episode of RHOBH earlier this year, Andy Cohen was seen reading a comment from a fan that stated: 'Kim I worry that I'm going to pick up that paper one day and read about your dog having eaten you.' Kyle admitted: 'I do worry a little bit to be honest. You hear these stories and I think oh my gosh. 'When she [Kim] doesn't answer her phone or a text I tell her "" I get worried that the dog maybe did something"".' Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery . Her philosophy: Kyle posted this inspirational message about her experience . And she said the attack on the trainer was a warning sign for her. 'I got nervous, just because of the stories I've heard. Nothing from what I seen, he's always sweet.' Kyle slept over at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA on Monday night, while Alexia underwent the first of two surgeries. Taking to her Instagram account, Kyle shared with 616,529 followers: 'Regarding Alexia: She was attacked by a dog and has to have surgery. 'As always, she is trying to make the best out of a bad situation .Thank you for your thoughts & well wishes'. The mother-of-four had earlier posted pictures of her daughter on a hospital bed with her family and friends around her. 'Slumber party at Cedars Sinai Hospital with @alexiaumansky @farrahbritt @sophiakylieee,' she wrote posing with her daughters. Flashback: Kyle, pictured, and Kim are on better terms these days, but the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, seen here in the RHOBH finale episode in 2010, rowing with her sister . Pointing the finger: The squabbling sisters had an infamous showdown in the back of a limousine where Kyle accused her sister of being an alcoholic . While Kim and Kyle have been on better terms in recent years, the dog attack is bound to place a strain on their fiery relationship, which has been an ongoing storyline on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills over the years. The finale of the first season in 2010 saw tensions coming to a head between the pair, with Kim's erratic behaviour and constant slurring of words leading her sister to surmise she had a substance abuse problem. The squabbling sisters had a dramatic showdown in the back of a limousine, with Kyle branding her sister an alcohol and threatening to withdraw financial aid she and husband Mauricio Umansky gave to her. Kim briefly entered rehab in December 2011, and later admitted that she was an alcoholic in an interview with Housewives mastermind Andy Cohen. Speaking about her sister's admission at the time, Kyle told Good Morning America: 'I'm proud to hear her say that. I'm proud of her. I know that's the biggest step in recovery, to admit that.' She went on: 'There were things going on that the audience wasn’t aware of. I had had a lot of pain and built up anger and frustration towards [Kim], and obviously she did towards me too. It was a vicious cycle. 'It was very difficult to have people dissect and analyse your relationship thinking they know you from a TV show when it’s been a long time in the making.' Kim, a former child Disney star, now says she is sober, which has been documented over the last couple of seasons of the reality show.","Alexia, 18, was bitten several times and required two surgeries .

"Sound of music: Actor Billy 22, can now hear 'the smallest noises' after implant . A revolutionary magnetic implant has restored the hearing of a young actor who went deaf in one ear at the age of 17 – and gives new hope to the thousands of Britons who cannot benefit from traditional hearing aids. Aspiring TV and theatre star Billy Coughlin, 22, from Hall Green, Birmingham, had the groundbreaking procedure at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, in March and says: ‘I can now hear the smallest noises, like footsteps. ‘It sounds silly but these are things I’ve not been able to hear for five  or six years. I finally feel I’m my normal self again.’ The new device is the bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) Attract, and it replaces the older version of the BAHA. While the traditional implant uses a metal screw that is embedded in the patient’s head and channels  vibrations to the inner ear, the Attract involves a small magnetic disc being inserted beneath the  skin behind the ear. This allows an electronic sound processor – the size of the bluetooth hands-free mobile phone earpiece – to be attached or removed as needed. When the receiver is not worn, the implant is completely invisible. Billy lost most of the hearing in  his left ear after developing an infection of the inner ear bones called mastoiditis. He has full hearing in his right ear. After struggling with his hearing, he was referred to surgeon Matthew Trotter at the hospital’s ENT clinic earlier this year. Billy trialled the device using a headband to attach it behind the  ear. Then, a month after surgery to implant the magnetic disc, a sound receiver was fitted, giving him full hearing again. Mr Trotter explains: ‘How we treat hearing loss depends on the physical cause of the problem. ‘BAHAs are suitable for patients who have problems with the outer and middle parts of the ear, usually due to infections or previous surgery. In these people, using a normal hearing aid in the ear canal won’t help because the transmitted sounds won’t reach the inner ear. ‘It’s important to note these are  not cochlear implants, which are  for yet another group of patients  – those with hearing loss due to problem in the inner ear. ‘BAHAs basically involve a titanium alloy peg being screwed into the skull behind the ear, so part of it pokes through the skin. In a similar way to a dental implant, the surrounding bone integrates with the screw, making it very secure and not removable. ‘The screw transmits sounds picked up by the receiver directly into the inner ear, bypassing the outer parts. But patients are left with a metal screw sticking out  of the head behind the ear, which is visible when the receiver is removed – to swim, for instance. ‘This alone puts many off, but  it also takes a lot of care and special cleaning on a daily basis to avoid infection. ‘The great thing about this new implant is there is no screw poking out. The receiver attaches to a small magnet under the skin so when  it’s removed, the head looks completely normal.’ The implant is attached during a 40-minute procedure under general anaesthetic. The surgeon cuts a 2in semi-circular flap behind the ear and the implant is drilled about half an inch into the bone beneath. The magnet is attached to the screw and the flap is the stitched back into place. Mr Trotter adds: ‘The skin heals in a fortnight, and the bone knits with the screw within a month. At this point it is stable, and we give the patient their receiver.’ Approximately 1,500 patients  with hearing loss who will potentially benefit from a bone-anchored hearing aid are diagnosed each year in the UK. Up to half of these could benefit from the Attract device. Mr Trotter hopes the Attract will be adopted throughout the NHS. He says: ‘Not every case is suitable due to the subtle differences in the causes of hearing loss, but it’s worth discussing the option of the Attract with your consultant should you be referred for a BAHA.’ Billy, who has had roles in Doctors on BBC1 and ITVs Peak Practice, had been offered an old-style BAHA but turned it down as he felt a visible screw would affect his chances of success at auditions. He says: ‘After the operation there was a bit of pain but I only needed a couple of paracetamol. ‘The moment they switched it on was a shock. Being able to hear  everything perfectly was distracting at first. But now when I take it off, it’s as if someone has stuck  cotton wool in my ear. Having it on feels normal.’","Billy Coughlin has had his hearing restored thanks to implant .

"A new form of cancer could be triggered by a type of breast implant popular with British women, scientists are warning. At least 150 cases of the disease, called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) of the breast, have been reported, including a handful in Britain. Nine in 10 cases of the disease – a cancer of the immune system – have been in women who have received breast implants with a textured outer shell, according to experts. A nurse holds defective breast implant manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) Scientists say this rougher surface is ‘the ideal breeding ground’ for bacteria which could sow the seed of cancer. Women should be warned of the cancer risk before undergoing implant operations, they argue. Textured shell implants are relatively uncommon in the US, but in Britain – where 30,000 women have implants every year – they account for 99 per cent of the market. Most women with ALCL have made a full recovery after surgery. In some cases they also needed chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, some – including one Briton – have died. Plastic surgeon Denis Boucq displays a defective silicone gel breast implant manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) after he removed it from a patient . Mother-of-two Susan Grieve, 40, from East Lothian in Scotland, passed away in July 2012, six years after receiving PIP implants. At the time her family believed the cancer may have been caused by toxic chemicals spilling into her body after the implants ruptured. But European studies have found no ingredients in the now banned PIP implants – illegally made with industrial grade  silicone – to be carcinogenic. Now scientists suggest ALCL is linked to a relatively common complication of having textured breast implants inserted, called capsular contracture. Implants can enhance women's lives but can also be a cause of long-term illness . Textured implants were introduced in the 1980s but not widely used until a decade later. Prof Anand Deva, who led the research study at the Australian School of Advanced Medicine at Macquarie University, said Britain should expect to see more cases in the future. ‘Countries that mainly use  textured implants, like Australia, have seen proportionally more cases.’ But plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘These tumours are extremely rare, treatable and patients should continue to  feel safe. There is no need to remove implants unless they develop sudden unexplained changes or swelling.’","150 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma of the breast reported .

"A British widow has made legal history by using her dead husband's sperm to try to conceive a child – even though it is still against the law. The high-flying businesswoman had his sperm extracted without his consent in an 'act of desperation' while he was in a coma and close to death with a heart condition. It is against UK law to take, store, transport and use in IVF a man's sperm without his written consent. The businesswoman – who wishes to be referred to as 'Ms H' – has since his death undergone fertility treatment abroad and is now waiting to find out if she is pregnant. Fertility triumph: Diane Blood with her sons Joel (left) and Liam (right) in 2003. Diane's husband Stephen fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died and doctors extracted his sperm while he was unconscious . Ruling: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) instructed UK fertility clinics not to treat Mrs Blood, however, after a traumatic two-year legal battle, the Court of Appeal allowed her to seek treatment abroad . Legal challenge: It is against UK law to take, store, transport and use in IVF a man's sperm without his written consent . Ms H, who is in her early 40s, obtained an emergency ruling by a judge to have her husband's sperm extracted because he was so close to death. The judge agreed to the procedure being carried out to allow her time to find proof of his consent. Despite this never being produced, she was later permitted to take the sperm to another country to begin IVF treatment. Ms H's case is the first time a British woman has gone ahead with such treatment without a court hearing. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) did not oppose her bid, meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law. Romania and Cyprus are among a handful of European countries where it is legal to use a man's sperm without his consent in IVF treatment. The Daily Mail's front page after Diane Blood won a lengthy legal battle to have her dead husband's baby in 2002 . Ms H travelled with the sperm to one of these countries and was implanted last week. Her barrister Lawrence Jones said: 'It was an act of desperation, [but] that was not her only motive. Of course she had only had days within which to think things through, but she is a stable, educated woman who sees the reality of her situation – no matter how dire. 'She was in massive distress, and yet there was also deep love and rationality.' Both the family of the deceased and that of the businesswoman are supportive of the decision. Although personal details cannot be fully revealed in order to protect Ms H's identity, The Mail on Sunday has been told the couple met seven years ago and were married two years later in an Islamic ceremony in the UK not recognised by British law. They had been planning to undergo IVF after initial attempts to become pregnant naturally had failed. Some 18 months ago, before Ms H and her partner – a financial executive – were able to commence fertility treatment, he fell into a sudden coma due to a previously undiagnosed heart condition. Doctors advised that he was unlikely to regain consciousness, and that his condition was fatal. Aware that her partner may not have long to live, Ms H appealed to their medical team to extract his sperm so that it may be stored and used at a later date. Initially the team refused as she could not provide any evidence of his consent and he was unable to give it. Such action could be legally classed as assault. A clinic storing sperm obtained in this way would also be committing an offence.  Ms H sought legal counsel and barrister Lawrence Jones successfully obtained an emergency ruling from a judge that allowed for the extraction and storage of the sperm – known as gametes – to take place. Mr Jones explains: 'Because of the grave nature of Mr H's condition, the judge agreed that there may not be time to mount a legal case – so allowed the extraction and storage of the gametes. 'Of course there was a chance he could recover and give his consent, but we also sought to find evidence – looking through letters, emails and other documents.' No evidence could be found – and Mr H died within days.  The widow proceeded to pursue further legal action and her legal team later presented a dossier to  the HFEA arguing why she should be allowed to use the sperm in fertility treatment. Her case follows that of Diane Blood, whose husband Stephen fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died. Doctors extracted his sperm while he was unconscious. The HFEA instructed UK fertility clinics not to treat Mrs Blood. However, after a traumatic two-year legal battle, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was her human right to travel to a different country to have IVF using Stephen's sperm. Happy family: Diane Blood and sons appear at the High Court in 2003 after her late husband Stephen was finally recognised by law as the father of both children . However, it also ruled that this was only because of the unique  circumstances of the case and it must not set a precedent. Mrs Blood, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, said yesterday: 'At the time of my case I felt the HFEA was very much against me. I'm glad it has listened and moved forward, which made it easier for this woman and perhaps even easier for other women in the future.' She had IVF after travelling to Belgium, which at the time permitted use of sperm extracted in these circumstances to be used in fertility treatment. She became pregnant and her son Liam was born in the UK in December 1998.  Four years later her second son, Joel Michael – again conceived using her late husband's frozen sperm – arrived. Mr Jones said of Ms H's case: 'My client knew wholeheartedly that she wanted to conceive a child with the man she had built her life with. 'I was pleased that in this case we were able to work closely with the HFEA's legal team, who were receptive to our argument and considered my client's views carefully.' However, James Lawford Davies, a solicitor who specialises in IVF and embryo research, said: 'This decision creates uncertainty. 'The HFEA is going about things in the wrong way by sidestepping the courts. Either this is against the law or it isn't – it needs to be clear.' The HFEA did not oppose Ms H's bid to seek IVF treatment abroad, meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law . An HFEA spokesman said: 'As the regulator we must act in accordance with the law on the use of gametes. In practice, the consent of the person involved has been crucial in determining whether the gametes can be used or not. 'In the case of Diane Blood, the HFEA sought to uphold the principle of informed consent and, indeed, this was confirmed by the court. 'The HFEA has not changed its position since then and the law remains unchanged; harvesting gametes (sperm or eggs) and the storage, and then the use of gametes without the appropriate consent is unlawful and may amount to a criminal offence.'","Businesswoman, known as Ms H, given permission to use late husband's sperm in IVF treatment abroad .

"Whether you are a Christmas Grinch or already irritating your co-workers with your festive cheer, there can be no avoiding the advent of the holiday season. The tree at Claridge’s hotel in London has brought joy and wonderment to hundreds for decades, with its grand unveiling each year epitomising the start of the Christmas season for many. For the past four years the tree has been decorated by a top designer and this year Claridge’s has announced that fashion duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana will be overseeing the design. A sketch of Dolce and Gabbana's design for the landmark Claridge's Christmas tree shows the Italian spirit the pair hoped to infuse into traditional Christmas designs . The tree in the Claridge's lobby has become synonymous with Christmas for both Londoners and visitors . The tree always tells a stunning visual story, and this year, under Dolce and Gabbana it will depict elements from a traditional Christmas combined with influences from the designers’ Italian heritage. Designers Stefano Gabanna, left, and Domenico Dolce join a growing list of prestigious designers who have dressed the Claridge's tree . Hand crafted Sicilian puppets, known as ‘pupi’ will adorn the tree alongside hand-painted Italian festive glass baubles and a bespoke multi-coloured ‘luminarie’ framework created in Southern Italy. The entire structure will stand at 6.8 metres and will be painstakingly transported over from Italy and erected over night by Claridge's staff to greet guests as they descend for breakfast on the morning of 26 November. Dolce and Gabbana commented on swapping clothes for conifers and foliage. ‘When we think of London we always think of Claridge’s and of its typically English atmosphere that fascinates us and makes us fall in love with the city every time as if it were the first,' they said. ‘Our Christmas tree isn’t only a celebration of Christmas as we celebrate it in Italy, but it’s at the same time a tribute to the artisanal Italian tradition, the same that we love to export worldwide with everything we do.’ Speaking about the collaboration Claridge’s General Manager Thomas Kochs says: ‘We are delighted to welcome Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana to spread their special Christmas magic in our lobby this year. ‘Both Claridge’s and Dolce and Gabbana are synonymous with timeless glamour, innovative spirit and traditional family values that are so important at this time of year.’ Last year the tree was created by Kally Ellis, founder of renowned British floral designers McQueens . In 2011 the tree was decorated by Lanvin and featured a family of puppets in a Christmas scenee . Over the past four years the tree, designed by John Galliano for Dior and Alber Elbaz for Lanvin, has become a festive landmark, drawing visitors and Londoners alike to the ancient Mayfair hotel. Last year the tree was created by Kally Ellis, founder of renowned British floral designers McQueens, who created a breath-taking natural forest tree featuring magnolia branches and lichen moss, studded with crystal and emerald jewel eggs in white, gold and silver. The new tree will be unveiled in Claridge’s iconic lobby on November 26.","Tree in the lobby of famous hotel has become a huge tourist attraction .

"Two workmen last night thanked ‘divine intervention’ for their astonishing escape from death as a helicopter crashed into their crane and turned into a fireball. The pair should have been in the cabin when disaster struck, sending burning debris cascading 700ft on to the rush-hour streets of London below. Instead, Richard Moule and his colleague Nicki Biagioni were late for work – both had overslept for the first time in years – and missed death by minutes. The crash, which happened at 8am yesterday in fog, claimed two lives, including that of the helicopter pilot, and left 12 injured. But police said it was ‘a miracle’ that the toll was not higher after the helicopter sliced through the crane ‘as if it was a piece of paper’, scattering wreckage over the streets of Vauxhall, South London.

What remains: A view today of the broken crane after the helicopter accident in Vauxhall, central London, that saw two people die and a dozen more injured yesterday . Father-of-two Mr Moule, 31, told the Daily Mail: ‘My colleague and I were both supposed to be there at 7am but we were both late. ‘It was the first time I’ve been late since starting this job three years ago. I just woke up late. Call it divine intervention if you like. ‘I went in on my motorcycle and got there about 7.45am. I was in the basement ready to go up when it happened. ‘I didn’t hear an explosion. The first I knew was when an alarm went off and people were being evacuated. ‘The first thing I did was call my wife Stephanie and tell her, “You’ll be hearing about this but I’m OK”. She gave me a big hug when I got back home.’ Mr Biagioni’s wife Leanna said that her husband, a father of three, had also overslept. She said: ‘He overslept this morning, something he never does and was late for work. He was not up the crane when it hit. Chaotic commute: Thick smoke rises from the burning debris which fell in the middle of a road. Emergency services personnel can be seen flocking to the crash site . Street of flames: An inferno rages near the crash site and encroaches on a car, after a river of aviation fuel from the downed helicopter caught light . Mangled wreckage: The crane next to Britain's tallest residential skyscraper, the Tower at One St George Wharf, was struck as the pilot 'struggled to see through the fog' ‘I thank his guardian angel.’ Mr . Biagioni, 30, who is the principal crane operator, was over an hour late . for work. Friends said he was normally woken by his three children – . sons Rocco, six, four-year-old Dino, and Luca, two – but yesterday they . had slept in. He was just arriving at the site on his motorbike and driving down a ramp to park in front of the crane as the helicopter hit. Mr Biagioni was only late for his shift because his children were not as noisy as usual in the morning. He said: ‘I was very lucky - it's unbelievable. I am still in shock. If it was not for my boys not waking me up, that would have been it. 'I was very lucky - it's unbelievable. I am still in shock. If it was not for my boys not waking me up, that would have been it' Nicki Biagioni, crane worker . ‘Normally I would have been up there in the crane but I was running late. Normally I would be have been up there, but instead I just pulled into the site as it all happened. He told BBC Essex: ‘Helicopters fly past lower than the crane all the time. You rely on the fact that it is a very safe route for the helicopters and they are meant to stick over the river. The thought of it had been at the back of my mind but it has never been something that I thought would happen.’ Witnesses . described hearing a loud bang and seeing a flash of light as the . helicopter collided with the high-rise crane on top of Britain’s tallest . residential skyscraper, the St George Tower. Pete . Barnes, who has piloted helicopters for movies such as the James Bond . film Die Another Day, was alone in the aircraft amid thick cloud when it . clipped the structure. Mr Barnes's brother said it would have been the pilot's 'instinct' to take any steps necessary to minimalise casualties. 'It's a matter of instinct, it's what . pilots do,' said Chris Barnes, 55. 'Our condolences go out to the . family of the other man who was killed, that's the last thing that my . brother would have wanted to happen.' Paying tribute to his brother, he . added: 'He was outgoing, very personable. A good-looking guy with an . irrepressible smile. When he walked into a room you knew he was there, . he lit up a room. He was a good guy.' Repair: Workmen scaled the crane today in an attempt to secure the site and allow local residents to return home . The aftermath: A crumpled piece of metal lays on the floor. Witnesses described hearing a loud bang and seeing a flash of light as the helicopter collided with the high-rise crane . The destruction happened near one of London's busiest transport hubs. Several key roads were closed off, causing commuter chaos, as the emergency services battled fires . The pilot lived with his partner Rebecca Dixon and their two children, eight-year-old Freddie and Alexandra, 12. She told the Evening Standard: 'Obviously he would have been frantic and the lives of others would have been at the forefront of his mind.'It sums up the man. I find it very comforting and so do the children.' The AgustaWestland 109 Power hurtled . to the ground and exploded into flames yards from Vauxhall Station, . claiming the lives of Mr Barnes and another person on the ground, who . was named last night as 39-year-old Matthew Wood from Sutton, South . London. London Mayor Boris . Johnson said there could easily have been many more fatalities, given . the close proximity of the crash scene to one of the capital’s busiest . transport hubs, Vauxhall Station, a major supermarket and the . headquarters of MI6. ‘It could have been much worse,’ he said. Commander Neil Basu, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘It was something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse.’ Tidying up: A specialist police team works today in the aftermath of the helicopter crash in central London . Dramatic video footage and photos of the crash, described by terrified witnesses as being like a 'disaster movie', were uploaded onto the internet, showing images of blazes and chaos . The streets were flooded with emergency services trying to help the injured and put out the flames, as police officers were in disbelief that more people had not been hurt in the collision . Dramatic video footage and photos of the crash, described by terrified witnesses as being like a ‘mini 9/11’ and a ‘disaster movie’, were uploaded onto the internet within minutes, revealing chaotic scenes, burning wreckage and buildings and cars damaged by flames. Several key roads were closed off, causing commuter chaos, as the emergency services battled fires. Initial fears of a possible terrorist attack were quickly discounted. Yesterday accident investigators were probing claims by witnesses that a light on top of the crane may not have working or clearly visible. It also emerged that pilots had been warned of the existence of the crane by the aviation authorities. Last night at his home in Harlow, Essex, Mr Moule’s two young children were repeatedly telling him: ‘I love you, I love you.’ Mr Moule said that he had no idea what he was supposed to do about reporting for work today. ‘I’m just waiting for them to ring me and let me know,’ he said. ‘They’re more concerned about what happened.’ His sister Charlotte, 22, wrote on Twitter: ‘Maybe there is a God up there! That was my brother’s crane and he was late for work today!’ A friend of Mr Biagioni, who lives in Loughton, Essex, said that he was ‘devastated’ for the families of those who died. He said: ‘He’s got three little kids. I spoke to him earlier on, he’s devastated about what was happened, but is obviously so relieved that he survived. ‘It’s a miracle that he not only lived, but was not hurt.’ Mr Biagioni has been told not to go in to work today.

"Birthday girl Clara Cowell has shown it's never too late to change your lifestyle - after giving up smoking two weeks ago aged 102. And Mrs Cowell, who lives independently in Ainscough Brook House in Ribbleton, Preston, is celebrating her milestone birthday today with five generations of family at one of her favourite places - the pub. Her daughter, Valerie Houghton, 73, said: 'We wanted to take her to the Continental because they've built a little snug, and it will be a nice reminder of the pubs she used to go to in Lancaster Road like The Painters. Valerie Houghton (left) with her mother Clara Cowell as she celebrates her 102nd birthday . Mrs Cowell, a former tailoress, lit her first cigarette in 1931, and has puffed her way through two or three a day since - a total of almost 60,000. But now, on the advice of her family, who were concerned about the falling ash, she has given up. Daughter Lynda Fowler, 69, who lives in Ontario, Canada, said: 'The secret to mum's long life is a cigarette and a cup of tea with whisky. That and hard work and poverty. She's an inspiration.' Mrs Cowell, who survived TB as a small child, said she 'doesn't believe in medication', and is so sprightly that for her 101st birthday, she wowed crowds at Blackpool Tower ballroom by taking to the dance floor for a waltz. Clara Cowell started smoking in 1931 but quit two weeks before her 102nd birthday . Mrs Cowell said: 'I used to love dancing, particularly waltzing and the foxtrot. 'We all used to walk home from Blackpool to Preston and the police guided us. There would be boys and girls arm-in-arm, singing. Mrs Cowell spent most of her life living in the Plungington and Deepdale areas, and brought up four children - Bryan, Ken, Valerie and Lynda - with her late coal man husband George. During the war, when George was called to fight, she raised the children alone while working in a local ammunition factory. Mrs Houghton said: 'She used to walk us to the childminder's every day between 5am and 6am and then she'd go to work making parachutes. 'All of the girls used to take a little material and they made themselves silk knickers.' Mrs Cowell added: 'It was hard during the war and we never had enough sleep or enough to eat, but we didn't take any harm from it. I've just tried to make the most of things.' As well as having four children, Mrs Cowell also has nine grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren.","Clara Cowell first smoked in 1931 and has had three cigarettes a day since .

"When next season’s fixtures are released in June there is a strong possibility that neither Bournemouth or Millwall will be in the casting their eyes towards the Championship. Eddie Howe’s side recorded their fifth win in a row to extend their unbeaten run to 14 games as they look set for promotion in May. But Millwall could well be heading in the opposite direction after falling to their fourth successive home defeat to leave them hovering nervously above the relegation zone. In reality this game was over and the points heading back to the South Coast before half time after goals from Yann Kermorgan and Harry Arter put Bournemouth in a commanding position at the break. Harry Arter celebrates giving Bournemouth a 2-0 lead in the first half as they win their fifth on the bounce . MILLWALL 4-2-3-1: Forde 5, Wilkinson 5 (Fuller 46 5), Shittu 6 (Dunne 67 6), Nelson 7, Malone 6, Woolford 6, Abdou 6, Williams 4, McDonald 6.5, Martin 5 (Gueye 56 6), Gregory 6. Subs not used: King, Beevers, Upson, Easter . Booked Forde, Wilkinson, Shitu, McDonald . Sent off: Williams . BOURNEMOUTH 4-4-1-1: Boruc 6, Francis 6, Elphick 6, Cook 6, Daniels 6, Ritchie 6 (Fraser 87), Arter 7, Surman 6, Smith 6.5 (Pugh 69 6, Wilson 7.5, Kermorgant 7 (Gosling 58 6) Subs not used: Camp, Cargill, Pitman, Rantie. Goals: Kermorgant 32 (pen), Arter 42 . Booked: Surman, Smith, Wilson . Referee: David Coote 7 . Attendance: 10,407 . It would have been understandable if the travelling fans had been a little nervous having thrown away a 2-0 half time lead to the same side a month ago. But there was to be no mistake this time and Bournemouth manager Howe was pleased his side learnt from their mistakes. Howe said: ‘It was a big win for us. Whenever you come to Millwall you know it’s going to be difficult. It was very hostile and we dealt with that challenge well. ‘I didn’t feel we were ever under pressure. The goals came at good times and we took them both well. ‘We needed to learn from the previous game (in November). Second half we were professional and without being at our very best it was a comfortable win.’ Bournemouth stamped their authority on the game and took the lead just after the half hour mark when Lee Martin brought down Charlie Daniels on the edge of the area and referee David Coote had no hesitation in pointing to the spot - despite protests from the Millwall players that the foul happened outside the box. Lee Martin's (right) sliding tackle on Charlie Daniels (left) earned the Cherries a penalty for their opening goal, slotted by Yann Kermorgant (not pictured) Kermorgant stepped up and put Bournemouth ahead despite the best efforts of David Forde. And Millwall were cursing their luck again 10 minutes later when Callum Wilson broke free of the offside trap and played a low cross which found Arter, who took his chance to shoot at the second attempt on the turn to double Bournemouth’s lead and score his fifth goal in five league games. Holloway tried to change things again in the second half throwing on veteran striker Ricardo Fuller, but Bournemouth were professional without being spectacular and kept the ball well. The game was up 10 minutes from time when Millwall were reduced to 10 men after Shaun Williams was shown a straight red card for an apparent stamp on Wilson after the Bournemouth man had fouled him. The win extends Bournemouth’s lead at the top of the table to four points but Howe is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. Bournemouth's Callum Wilson flips Millwall's Shaun Williams in the air . Williams reacts and is shown a straight red card for an apparent stamp on Wilson with 10 minutes remaining . Howe added: ‘After finishing 10th last season we hoped to be in and around the top six but we are very pleased where we are.’ At the final whistle the cheers of the travelling supporters were drowned out by the boos from the home fans and pressure is certainly mounting on Holloway. The Millwall manager said: ‘For the first goal I expected a free-kick to be given, not a penalty. ‘You’ve got to be 100 per cent sure, but the referee is 200 per cent wrong because it was outside the box. ‘I felt we deserved more than we got out there and a lack of confidence and spread quickly and we need to stop the rot because we want to stay in this division.’","Yann Kermorgant scored a penalty after Charlie Daniels was fouled .

"West Ham co-owner David Sullivan has revealed the club have offered a 20 per cent stake for sale in a bid to help clear their debts. Sullivan told the Sunday Telegraph he and fellow owner David Gold are seeking to raise £80million to help reduce debts which currently stand at £110million, of which £55million is owed to Gold and Sullivan. Sullivan believes the upcoming move to the Olympic Stadium means the club is worth £400million - almost four times its value when he and Gold bought the Hammers in January 2010. David Sullivan (right) and David Gold (left) are looking to sell a 20 per cent stake in West Ham . Sullivan says he believes the club will be worth £400million when they move to the Olympic Stadium . 'We've no desire to give up the whole club,' Sullivan said. 'But we're still £110million in debt - albeit now £55million of that is to ourselves. So the third-party debt has been halved, but only because we've put the money in. 'We lost £30million when we went down (to the Championship in 2011) and we made £10million on paper last year. What's on paper is not cash-flow and we have to pay down the debt all the time and we have to be clear of bank debt when we move to the Olympic Stadium. 'I'd love someone to come in and buy 20 per cent and the money would not go to us, it would go to the club. But we won't be giving it away and we'd want market value for it. The Hammers have been in excellent form and sit fifth in the Premier League table . Allardyce has been widely praised for an excellent start to the season, but has not got long on his contract . 'Going to the Olympic Stadium we are a £400million club and that would pay down most of the debt. But if it doesn't happen we'll dig deep in our pockets and keep the club afloat.' With West Ham challenging at the top end of the Barclays Premier League after an outstanding start to the campaign, Sullivan also admitted he did not yet know if manager Sam Allardyce - under pressure seven months ago - would sign a new contract with the club. 'I must say if come April we are where we are now, which is extremely unlikely but is possible, we'd probably sit down a month early and say, 'Look Sam, do you want to stay or do you want to go?' Sam may decide he wants to go out a winner,' Sullivan said.","David Sullivan seeking to sell 20 per cent stake in West Ham .

"Sheffield United's League One fixture with Scunthorpe United has been postponed due to icy conditions at Bramall Lane. Referee Mark Heywood conducted a pitch inspection at 10am and although he believed the pitch was playable, he was concerned about supporter access in and around the stadium. 'I'm calling the game off on health and safety grounds,' the official was quoted as saying by Sheffield United's official Twitter account. Sheffield United's League One fixture with Scunthorpe United has been postponed due to snow and ice . Sheffield United tweeted this picture of an icy street behind one of the stands at Bramall Lane . A scene from the Crookes area of Sheffield following heavy snowfall on Boxing Day and December 27 . Sheffield and South Yorkshire saw heavy snowfall on the evening of Boxing Day, leading to treacherous travel conditions. Temperatures in the city are not expected to rise above freezing on Sunday. Referee Heywood said: 'The pitch, by 3pm, would be playable so player safety was not a concern. But the surrounding areas, including approaches to the Kop stand, were simply treacherous for supporters and even with the man power to try and clear it, it would have still been dangerous by the time the turnstiles opened. 'Common sense has to prevail and it simply isn't safe.' The city was blanketed by snow, leaving roads and pavements icy and treacherous . United's Managing Director, Mal Brannigan, said: 'We've had a lot of staff in and around Bramall Lane working to get the game played. The pitch is fine but from a health and safety point of view, access to the ground is treacherous. 'Financially, the game being called is detrimental to the Club but the safety of supporters is of paramount importance.' The Blades, who are sixth in the League One table, now face further fixture congestion. They are into the third round of the FA Cup and travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday January 4, causing the postponement of their scheduled league match at Notts County.

"Manchester City's Mr Versatile, James Milner, is hopeful there will be a breakthrough in his contract stalemate with the Premier League champions but is refusing to let the issue distract him on the pitch. The England midfielder has emphasised his importance to City by playing as an emergency striker in the past two games after their entire front-line were wiped out through injury. City are anxious for Milner to agree a four-and-a-half year extension to his current deal, which runs out at the end of the season, with Liverpool understood to be among the clubs ready to sign him on a free transfer if he decides to leave the Etihad after five years. James Milner played as an emergency forward for Manchester City in their 3-1 win at West Brom on Friday . Milner turns 29 a week on Sunday and despite making a significant contribution this season, he is known to be concerned over his first-team opportunities once City’s injury problems ease. Contract talks have stalled in the past two weeks but Milner is determined to stay focused as City strive to defend their title. ‘I hope it will be sorted,’ he said. ‘We’re still in talks. I’m waiting for the club to come back and hopefully they will soon. 'But the main thing is to concentrate on football, there are so many games coming up. ‘If I’m not doing my job on the field because of off-the-field stuff then that’s no good. So I let others take care of it and I just concentrate on football.’ With Stevan Jovetic returning from injury on the bench at West Brom on Boxing Day, Milner’s short stint up front may come to an end at home to Burnley on Sunday. Milner braves the freezing conditions to take of his top and give it to a visiting support at the full-time whistle . Milner applauds the travelling supporters after City made it nine straight wins in all competitions on Friday . The former Newcastle and Aston Villa midfielder has played seven different positions in his City career, and Milner revealed that it could have been eight after he nearly replaced goalkeeper Joe Hart on one occasion. ‘It was different playing up front,’ he added. ‘I haven’t played there for a while and I enjoyed it. ‘I played centre-back in a pre-season friendly. I nearly went in goal once when Joe got injured but he played on in the end. The team comes first and whatever you need to do...’ Manuel Pellegrini’s side have an ideal opportunity to extend a nine-game winning run in all competitions as they complete their Christmas programme with home games against Burnley and Sunderland. And having twice won League titles with City on the final day of the season, Milner warned that they are ready to push Chelsea all the way to the finishing line. Manuel Pellegrini - pictured issuing instructions to his team against West Brom - has no fresh injury concerns . ‘Experience of winning it always helps,’ he said. ‘You know what went wrong and you try to put it right. Winning titles on the last day means we know how long it is. 'People have been writing us off, saying Chelsea have it won already. They are a strong team but we will fight them all the way for it. ‘It’s nice to know what it’s all about, to know you’ve got over the line before. ‘The fact not many teams have won back-to-back titles shows how difficult it is to do it. Hopefully we are making a better fist of it with the fact we’re still in there.’ Pellegrini confirmed strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero are the only City players unavailable for Burnley’s visit to the Etihad. ‘Edin and Sergio are out for the game but all of the other players are available,’ he said. Manchester City take on relegation threatened Burnley at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . The Chilean has been forced to shuffle his pack considerably in the pair’s absence, with Jovetic only returning from injury on Boxing Day, too. Milner has been employed as a false nine, while 18-year-old Spanish forward Jose Pozo led the City line in their 1-0 win against Leicester on December 13. ‘It was a very difficult situation. It is not normal to have three strikers injured but I think we have intelligent players, we changed our style of play. ‘And we now have more possession of the ball so we have time to arrive for the second balls inside the box and they are scoring.’ Manchester City have twice won the title on the last day of the season - the latest coming in May 2014 . On Milner’s reinvention as a centre forward, Pellegrini added: ‘I’m very pleased as he is a very intelligent player, maybe not the normal striker we are used to, but he works very hard to work the space.’ City host a Burnley side on Sunday afternoon that sit 19th in the Barclays Premier League table, however there are five points between Sean Dyche’s team and basement club Leicester. ‘I think it will be a very tough game,’ said Pellegrini. ‘It doesn’t matter that they are in the last three positions of the table. Fernando wheels away in celebration after giving Manchester City the lead against West Brom . Sean Dyche's side will be looking to pull off a big shock when they visit the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . ‘They have good players. I hope we start the game with the attitude that we have to win three points. If we think we are going to have an easy game that would be a big mistake.’ Fernando, City’s £12million summer signing from Porto, was delighted to open the scoring in the 3-1 win at West Brom, in which City went three up in 36 minutes, seeing the game out amid a snowstorm. ‘Yes, it was my first goal,’ the Brazilian midfielder said. ‘I am very happy to help the team win. It was an excellent first goal. We needed this win. ‘I wasn’t expecting the snow. It snowed a lot. It worked against us in the second half. But we stayed together. We are in a good run and hopefully we keep winning games.’","Manchester City secured a comfortable 3-1 win against West Brom on Boxing Day to remain just three points off the leaders Chelsea .

"Roma striker Gervinho had a Christmas to forget when he discovered his Italian home in Axa, near Rome, had been burgled as he spent time with family in the Ivory Coast. According to La Gazetta Dello Sport, the former Arsenal man was robbed after he posted photos on social media informing fans he was going to be out of the country. It is reported that the unknown culprits took tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods including jewellery and watches. Former Arsenal star Gervinho was targeted by thieves as he spent time with his family in the Ivory Coast . The tweet posted by the striker on Christmas Eve told his 243,000 followers he would be out of the country . Gazetta say it was Gervinho's brother who discovered the burglary and reported it to the police. It is possible that the thieves entered through a door window although it remains unclear if the alarm was turned off before they entered. Gervinho is expected to return to Rome on Tuesday, when the extent of the robbery will be confirmed. The Ivorian is not the only Roma player to have been targeted by thieves this Christmas, with Radja Nainggolan returning to Italy from London on Christmas Day to find that his car had been broken into whilst it was parked at Fiumicino Airport.

"The opening title sequence of The Crazy Gang is about to finish when Dave Bassett’s mobile phone lights up with text messages from former Wimbledon players. There is a sense of betrayal, an injustice after their former team-mate John Fashanu claimed he ruled the old dressing rooms at Plough Lane by fear and intimidation. ‘I was the leader,’ he announced. ‘Let me tell you a bit about Fash because those players wouldn’t have followed him down the pub,’ scoffed Bassett as he watched the 90-minute documentary screened by BT Sport Films on Boxing Day. Dave Bassett with the original Wimbledon Crazy Gang in the early 1980s . Bassett says he guided Wimbledon up through the leagues with players who worked hard . Bassett celebrates with Paul Fishenden after Wimbledon's victory in the FA Cup against Nottingham Forest . Bassett is a proud man and this film has wounded him. The Crazy Gang could and probably should have been the fairytale, the real, gritty story of Wimbledon’s remarkable rise from champions of the Southern League in 1977 to FA Cup winners 11 giddy years later. ‘None of the players cried, it’s complete nonsense,’ added their former manager. ‘Fashanu has betrayed us.’ There is no mention at all of Bassett’s masterplan to replicate the success of Don Revie’s Leeds side of the Seventies, or the 13 homegrown players he promoted from the youth team during his six-and-a-half years as manager. The likes of Glyn Hodges, Steve Galliers, Steve Ketteridge, Mark Morris and captain Brian Gayle have been forgotten, consigned to history. Instead they have been portrayed as a team of thugs. Bassett, who was among those paid to appear in the programme, added: ‘Fash has disrespected the legend of the club and the legacy has been tarnished because of his contribution to the programme. ‘He has embellished stories and played up to the camera. He should have been honest and shown respect to those who played alongside him and to those who achieved so much before him. John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones played up to Wimbledon's reputation as a team of thugs in the documentary . Bassett is proud of the job he did at Wimbledon but doesn't believe the documentary reflected them properly . Bassett and Fashanu walk on the beach during their days at Wimbledon - but the manager says his former striker has embellished a lot of the stories . ‘It is a shame and players from that great Wimbledon team are very disappointed in him because he has attempted to glamorise something that was already very special. ‘I am still really proud of what we all achieved, but Fash has tucked us all up. ‘Everything that team went on to achieve, even after I left and Bobby Gould won the FA Cup with them a year later, is unlikely to be repeated.’ Bassett signed Dennis Wise, who had been released by Southampton and rejected by QPR and Crystal Palace, on the recommendation of his young forward Wally Downes. He was eventually sold to Chelsea for £1.6m and went on to play for England 21 times. Goalkeeper Dave Beasant, who saved John Aldridge’s penalty in the FA Cup final, went to Newcastle for £850,000. Andy Thorn went to St James’ Park for the same fee. The list goes on. ‘Fash has made it sound like we were animals, but we worked hard on the training ground and had some very good players,’ added Bassett, who took over the Wimbledon team when Dario Gradi left for Crystal Palace in 1981. ‘It wasn’t an environment where people were bullied or intimidated at all. ‘Every team had their enforcers. Jimmy Case, Steve McMahon and Graeme Souness could all look after themselves at Liverpool. Tottenham had John Pratt, Paul Miller and Graham Roberts. It was a different era and they were all tough.’ Wise, in the transcript of his two-and-a-half-hour interview with the programme makers, backs up Bassett’s passionate version of events. ‘The players enjoyed the environment,’ said Wise. ‘They didn’t feel embarrassed if they messed it up. They didn’t think they were better than each other. Bassett insists that Wimbledon were not the only side with physical players in their side . Jones was sent off against Everton after clashing with Kevin Ratcliffe . Jones has to be restrained by Fashanu at Goodison Park in a game that ended 1-1 . Fashanu made a lot of claims in the BT Sport documentary which have been disputed by others . Like Fashanu, Jones was one of the players who glamourised the violent side of Wimbledon . ‘You could miss a volley or have a joke and no one felt uncomfortable. There’s nothing worse than going to a group and you’re feeling the pressure.’ The story about Alan Cork’s car being set on fire to claim on insurance after Bassett refused to give him a pay rise is fiction, according to Bassett. So, too, are the images of Carlton Fairweather being tied to the luggage rack of a car and being driven down the A3 at high speed by one of the Wimbledon players. ‘It just didn’t happen like that,’ added Bassett. So much for the intimidation and the wanton acts of violence that Fashanu, who was signed by Bassett from Millwall in 1986, and Vinnie Jones talk about during the film. ‘Nobody died,’ added Fashanu when he was asked about the Crazy Gang’s methods. It is a remark that disgusts Bassett. So much more could have been made of Bassett’s stats man Neil Lanham, sitting in the draughty stands to faithfully record free kicks, corners and long throws. There is no mention, either, of the £11,000 Bassett spent on video equipment for his analyst Vince Craven. Bassett beat ProZone by 20 years. Sadly, Wise’s anecdotes about coach Don Howe showing the team tapes of Arrigo Sacchi’s magnificent Milan side, with Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten in their pomp, were left on the cutting room floor. Bassett signed Dennis Wise in 1985 on the recommendation of Wally Downes . Former Wimbledon captain Brian Gayle was not mentioned in the documentary while Fashanu is accused of fabricating and making up some of the things that went on at Wimbledon . Instead the temptation, inevitably, was to lap up the numerous tales readily supplied by Fashanu and Jones about techniques they claimed to have used as Wimbledon players. You can’t blame them. Instead, Fashanu and Jones have much to answer for after this bruising appraisal of Wimbledon’s glory years. ‘When Fashanu arrived at the club he told the dressing room, “I am not in the Crazy Gang, do not cut up my clothes and I won’t cut up yours”,’ added Bassett. ‘He wanted no part in it, he was very much on his own in there at the beginning.’ To the producer and director’s great credit, Fashanu’s ability to embellish the truth is brilliantly exposed during the programme’s reflections on the 1988 FA Cup final against Liverpool. ‘John Barnes is close friend and I said things to him in that tunnel that only a black man could say to another black man,’ claimed Fashanu in a particularly awkward scene. The next shot is of the tunnel, with the two teams lined up together and filmed live for BBC and ITV before referee Brian Hill leads the teams out. There is no hint of any exchanges between the two teams and Barnes confirms this in his own interview. ‘Fash made himself look like a buffoon,’ added Bassett. Wimbledon completed their remarkable fairy tale when they won the FA Cup in 1988 under Bobby Gould . Lawrie Sanchez celebrates his winning goal in the Cup final as Dave Beasant raises the FA Cup . He is also disappointed with Jones, the man he signed from Wealdstone for £10,000 in 1986 and turned into a First Division midfielder. There is no mention of the winner he scored on his home debut against Manchester United or his spell out of the team after he was sent off for sticking one on former Arsenal midfielder Graham Rix. ‘So much for the intimidation, the verbals and all this fighting because after he got sent off I didn’t play him again until the end of the season as a punishment,’ Bassett added. Then there is the story, after Bassett left the club, of the unfortunate soul who was beaten to within an inch of his life by Fashanu behind closed doors. That man was Robbie Turner, a journeyman striker who made the mistake of accepting Fashanu’s challenge to a fight after they had finished training one day. ‘His name was left out, probably because he didn’t want to be associated with it,’ said Bassett. After watching this film, it is clear Bassett and many of the other former Wimbledon players now feel the same way.","Former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett is upset with how his former club were portrayed in the BT Sport documentary .

"Manchester United will be without Marouane Fellaini for the remainder of Christmas and New Year after it emerged the Belgian has a rib injury. United manager Louis van Gaal has put Fellaini’s absence from the squad down to a mystery ‘virus’, revealing after Friday's win at home to Newcastle that the giant midfielder would not figure against Tottenham on Sunday. However it is understood that Fellaini is also nursing injured ribs suffered in the win against Liverpool a fortnight ago and it is this that is expected to side line the former Everton player a little longer.

"Andre Villas Boas has slammed Tim Sherwood after the former Tottenham manager criticised his successor's ability to maintain a united dressing room following his departure. When speaking about the time he took over at the north London club, Villas Boas pulled no punches. 'Tim was not part of my team, but I already alerted the president that he was detrimental to the club.' Former Tottenham manager Andre Villas Boas slammed his successor Tim Sherwood's leadership skills .

Sherwood (right) was in charge at White Hart Lane for six months after taking over from Villas Boas (left) Andre Villas Boas: P 54, W 29 - Win% 54 . Tim Sherwood: P 22, W 13 - Win% 59 . Ex-Spurs player Sherwood took over from Villas Boas after the Portuguese parted ways with chairman Daniel Levy in December 2013, following a string of disappointing domestic league results. '(Sherwood) continued after I left and his leadership resulted in a extreme split between the players and the coach,' Villas Boas said. After 18 months in charge Villas Boas exited White Hart Lane with the highest league win percentage  of any manager in the club's Premier League era, until Sherwood. The Englishman assumed Villas Boas' position in the hotseat, winning half of his 28 Premier League games as manager before being sacked by Levy at the close of last season. Current Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino responded to Sherwood's criticism of defender Jan Vertonghen . Sherwood shocked fans back in March when the then Spurs boss accused his squad of lacking character following a 4-0 defeat at Chelsea in March and refused to apologise. Earlier this month, current boss Mauricio Pochettino was forced to leap to the defence of defender Jan Vertonghen, after 45-year-old Sherwood questioned his ability at the back. Pochettino – who succeeded the axed Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer – said: 'People can have their opinions but I am very happy with Jan. 'I am not aware of these comments. I give my opinions in private. I think Jan in his first season was maybe the best central defender in England.

"Brendan Rodgers believes Raheem Sterling is on course to become a top-class Premier League striker as he continues to develop his eye for goal. The Liverpool manager admits Sterling is a natural winger but has tasked him with being the focal point of the attack as Rodgers continues to tweak his side to replicate the goalscoring feats they achieved last season. After scoring three times in his last three games, including the winner against Burnley on Boxing Day, Rodgers believes that Sterling's work rate and willingness to learn are the key factors in a so far seamless transformation. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers on Raheem Sterling's development . Raheem Sterling celebrates after Liverpool's 1-0 win over Burnley on Boxing Day . Rodgers said: 'I think there are players that are natural-born goalscorers and they live to score goals, they want to score a goal. Some are not so worried about what they do in the build-up, not concerned about how hard they work, but they want to score a goal. They have that ability to get a goal. 'Then you get other players, the top-class players who work very hard, who have that ability to score a lot of goals and create goals and that's something that develops with confidence over your career. I think we see him like that and I think his numbers over his career will keep improving and improving. 'For me I'm very happy with his performance. He's gone into that role, he's offered us a real threat, his pace in every game is phenomenal but he's got that bit of composure at the end. He's going to miss some chances of course but you've seen at Burnley the one opportunity he had he took it.' Sterling takes on Burnley defender Michael Keane as he was deployed up front at Turf Moor . Sterling celebrates after he rounded Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton to give Liverpool the lead . Sterling has big shoes to fill as he bids to compensate for the absence of Daniel Sturridge. In his relatively short career to date, Sterling has only reached double figures once, last season. Stepping up could be seen as a big ask for a player who has only just turned 20 years old, but his manager has every confidence he can stand up to the weight of expectation. 'He deals with it so well but it's hard to hide the talent,' Rodgers added. 'If you have that talent you're going to be under that scrutiny and we protect the players as much as we can. 'I've seen him develop into a wonderful young man. He's got great maturity. I think back to the boy when I arrived here when he was 17 and I see him now and the maturity that he has and how he's taken it all in his stride. Of course he's had difficult moments but as I said he's a real pleasure to work with. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) was full of praise for Sterling . 'He obviously realises the harder you climb the ladder people want to criticise you more as well but that's all part of the dance. I'm delighted to work with him and hopefully we can be together for a long time.' Liverpool close the first half of their campaign on Sunday as they welcome Swansea to Anfield. A win would see them draw level on points with the visitors, although the Welsh side possess a superior goal difference. As they bid to close the gap on the Champions League places, Rodgers hopes that an improved second half of the season can see them fulfil their pre-season ambitions. Rodgers said: 'For us the objectives are very much the same - we want to finish in that top four. We know there's a long road but the points can whittle away very quickly. We're seven points behind that but we'll take each game as it comes and if we can keep this momentum going and keep the focus we can have a real good second half to the season.'","Raheem Sterling has scored three in three playing up front for Liverpool .

"It has been an amazing year of football in many different ways, from the highs and lows of the World Cup — Germany’s highs and England’s lows — to the Premier League title race. For my last column of 2014, I thought I would dish out some awards for my personal highlights. I’m looking forward to another enthralling time in 2015. Merry Christmas! My Three Kings of 2014 . Raheem Sterling — No one has grown more as a player in the last 12 months than Sterling. This time last year he had just broken into the Liverpool team and now, at 20, he is one of the best young players in the world. And if his form isn’t quite what it was, that’s only to be expected from a developing talent. Liverpool and England forward Raheem Sterling has really developed over the last 12 months . John Terry has defied those who said age had caught up with him to produce some stunning form . John Terry — He’s as solid as he was 10 years ago. When analysing on TV, nobody says, ‘He’s short for pace there’ or ‘He turned a bit slowly here’. There’s no sign of frailties and there’s not a better defender in the country. Terry with Gary Cahill would have been fabulous at the World Cup, and it would be now. Stewart Downing — He looked as though his career might ebb away, having left Liverpool with a big move not having worked out. But credit to Sam Allardyce, who has had him playing off the front in many games and seen him rejuvenated. Now the challenge is to sustain that and earn an England place. Goal of the Year . I was in the Maracana on that evening when James Rodriguez scored for Colombia in the last 16 of the World Cup against Uruguay. He had his back to play and four players closing him but the key for me was the fact he had a little glance before he shot. You teach midfielders to look frequently over their shoulder for all-around awareness — but to do that then play it off his chest and turn was unbelievable. Stewart Downing's career looked as though it was in decline but this season he has had a renaissance . James Rodriguez's spectacular effort for Colombia against Uruguay wins Glenn Hoddle's goal of the year . The finish over the goalkeeper and off the bar was sensational but, even before that, he had shown fantastic awareness and skill. The early stages of the World Cup were fabulous and James played a huge part in lighting up the tournament. Match of the Year . There can’t be any dispute about this. When Brazil took the field in Belo Horizonte on July 8, we were all anticipating a tight game with Germany as marginal favourites. What unfolded in the first half was the most extraordinary and unusual result I’ve experienced in football. It was as though Brazil were having a collective breakdown. Although they were missing Neymar and Thiago Silva, to watch a team filled with world class and experienced players capitulate in quite such a dramatic way, at home and in front of their own fans, was astounding. It was a seismic football moment. Germany beat hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final of the World Cup, it was a seismic moment in football . There can be little dispute that Brazil's capitulation was the most engrossing match of 2014 . Buys of the Year . When you look at the most astute transfers, Chelsea’s signing of Nemanja Matic last January and Alex Song’s return to English football in the summer are right up there. But Song isn’t even the best buy at his club — that honour falls on Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia. That’s a huge compliment to Sam Allardyce. Real football people wouldn’t doubt him but he has gone from being under pressure at West Ham, with the fans discontented, to having engineered their best start in the Premier League and much of it is down to clever recruitment. There aren’t many undiscovered gems any more but plucking a player like Sakho from Metz in the French second division is as close as you get. Valencia shone in the World Cup but there can always be a risk buying on the back of a good tournament — but West Ham had clearly done their homework. West Ham get the ball down and play with those two, hitting teams on the break; when Andy Carroll comes in, they go a bit more direct. They have two ways to play now — Valencia and Sakho have added a new dimension to their game. Sam Allardyce has this season guided West Ham to their best-ever start in the Premier League . Signings like Diafra Sakho (above) and Enner Valencia have helped boost the Hammers this season . Tactical Innovation of the Year . The best ideas never disappear; they simply come back into fashion in a new guise. It’s no secret that I’ve enjoyed playing the back three and did so with England in the late 90s, but the system became less used in recent years. Slowly it is has come back, with coaches such as Pep Guardiola, Steve Bruce and Roberto Martinez using it at times, but really it was the World Cup that brought it right back in to the mainstream. There’s a whole generation of players now who struggle to play against it and Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli, Costa Rica’s Jorge Luis Pinto, Louis van Gaal for Holland, Mexico’s Miguel Herrera and Algeria’s Vahid Halilhodzic caused teams so many problems with it during the tournament and I for one loved watching it. Costa Rica excelled at the World Cup, in part due to the tactical decisions of their manager Jorge Luis Pinto . New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has been a champion of playing three at the back in 2014 . Man of the Year — Jose Mourinho . It may be an obvious choice but it’s hard to get away from just how well his time at Chelsea is going — though the test will be whether he wins something. He made a profit for the club in the summer transfer window and still ended up with a stronger team. The balance of the side is lovely. Don’t forget, Mourinho is having to accommodate the desire of the owner for attractive football but he’s doing that without compromising his principles. I love the fact he fielded a strong side at Derby in the Capital One Cup — he wants to win every single game. I think he’s doing an even better job than the last time he was at Stamford Bridge. They’re chasing four trophies and I believe they will at least have the Premier League title in 2015 — and maybe they can challenge Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona for the Champions League. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho wins the manager of the year award for his stellar performance at the club . And Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is an early contender for the title for next year's awards . And the manager for next year? Eddie Howe . His Bournemouth side might have lost to Liverpool on Wednesday night but the job Eddie Howe has done on the south coast is extraordinary. He took over when they were second bottom of League Two. He had 18 months at Burnley, which just didn’t work out, but now he has Bournemouth on the verge of the Premier League, playing attractive football. They have been helped financially by Russian owner Maxim Demin but, nevertheless, Howe, at 37, has demonstrated that he should have a long career in the game. We might be seeing a lot more of him in 2015.","The goal of the year award goes to Real Madrid star James Rodriguez .

Scroll down for video... Expunged: The 31 students suspended from Scripps Ranch High School in San Diego in May for making a twerking video will now have their records expunged of sexual harassment charges . The students, mostly girls, were suspended in May after the rump-shaking video was posted online and quickly went viral. Parents of several students went to a lawyer after the school board said it couldn't overturn the suspensions. Attorney Ruth Hargrove, who represents three of the girls, says she's thrilled by the agreement and so are her clients. ‘They . have been through an enormous amount,’ the California Western School of . Law professor told KSWB. ‘They have been publicly vilified. They have . been called all kinds of names by all kinds of people.’ 'They have been through an enormous amount': Attorney for three of the girls Ruth Hargrove says the San Diego school district needs to re-evaluate its policies . Popular girls: The 31 students, most of them girls, were suspended after the video they shot and edited on campus gained massive attention on YouTube in May . Voluntary: The students decided to make a 'twerking' video during class but say they didn't know where it was going to end up. It eventually was cut into a parody music video and put on YouTube . The district, meanwhile, says now it's time for everyone to move on. ‘The . parents, students, school and district are ready to move beyond this . incident and focus on the upcoming school year,’ the school district . said in a statement. ‘The district cannot provide any further details . since this is a student discipline issue and therefore confidential.’ But Hargrove said the incident should be a learning opportunity more than just something to move on from. ‘I . look forward to having the school resolve some of the internal issues . that propelled this and to changing some of their processes and I think . they will,’ she said. The drama began when students at . Scripps Ranch High School in San Diego reportedly volunteered to 'twerk' on camera, and then another student filmed the video and edited it into . a compiled music video in order to get in on the latest internet craze. Breaking the rules: The video was filmed at the school using school property before being uploaded online . No turning back: The video has since been taken down from YouTube but it was recorded by others . Administrators at Scripps Ranch High . School argue that the students were in violation of the school's honor . code when they performed the sexually suggestive dance move, which . involves girls shaking their hips and boys watching them do so. According to NBC San Diego, . the content is considered a breach of the school's handbook which . specifically states that students are barred from 'verbal, visual, or . physical conduct of a sexual nature made by someone from or in the . educational setting.' The . whole situation started when student Lyston McNear, 17, suggested in . journalism class that they 'make a twerking video', and his classmates . all willingly participated. 'Nobody was offended or anything. It was like, ""Oh, that’s cool,""' he told The Union-Times. Part . of the problem is that it was shot and edited on school grounds, . meaning that the school's honor code allows the school to discipline . their behavior. Breaking code: Students thought that they were having fun but now they will be missing out on the fun of prom . Poor taste: The person who filmed and uploaded the video said that he has not heard of anyone complaining about the suggestive dance moves or the foul-mouthed lyrics . Blurred: NBC San Diego blurred the faces of all of the students in the video to hide their identity . McNear argues that he should not . be punished because he did not appear in the video, simply suggesting . the idea. Others feel he is the 'ringleader' who edited the footage and . added the music to go along with the video. It . is unclear what grades all of the offenders are in, but if the more . than 30 students are all seniors, that will make a difference on . graduation day as the graduating class is made up of about 600 students.

"Not content with being the largest search engine in the world, designing the most popular mobile operating system, creating a healthcare company and helping to develop lab-grown meat, Google has now explained how it plans to solve societies biggest problems - through quantum computing. Earlier this year Google bought a quantum computer called D-Wave Two, which can perform tasks 3,600 times faster than normal computers. The company is hoping to use it to find cures for diseases, fix climate problems and help robots better understand human speech, for example. In the first of a series of videos explaining a bit more about this computer and the company's work with quantum computing, Google has teamed up with Nasa to explain the basics behind the D-Wave and why it is so important . Scroll down for video . Google bought the quantum computer, pictured, earlier this year. It is 3,600 faster than normal computers and could be used to tackle disease, climate change, and develop more sophisticated robots. Google has created a video explaining the basics behind the computer and the company's quantum project . Modern day computers run on a model designed by Alan Turing in the 1930s. They are digital and use bits to transfer information and perform tasks. They use binary code and can only ever been in an active, or an inactive state - running at one or zero. This means that a single bit is either on or off at any one time. Qubits work differently and can be on, off, or in a mixed state in between. As a result, qubits are able to be in . multiple places at the same time. Whereas the original Turing computer can only make one calculation at a time, quantum computers are capable of . performing single tasks faster, and performing multiple tasks more . effectively. Tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the D-Wave. The company is hoping to unlock the . power of the computer, which was built by Canadian company D-Wave, at . the new Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, housed at Nasa's Ames . Research Centre in California. The video begins by explaining that: 'Quantum physics puts everything into question; it defies every intuition that you have about the natural world. Quantum is a very strange regime of physics.' It goes on to explain objects can exist in a state of superposition - in which they can be one thing and another at the same time. It then moves onto quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling and the multi-verse, in which there are infinite numbers of other universes running parallel to ours. A Google spokesman called Hartmut continues by explaining quantum computing uses these ideas behind quantum physics to process and calculate data at much faster speeds. D-Wave computers run on a 512-qubit processor. Normal computers are digital and use bits to transfer information and perform tasks. As a comparison, PCs found in homes run on 32-bit or 64-bit processors. The 'bits' in modern-day computers can only ever been in an active, or an inactive state; running at one or zero. This means a single 'bit' is either on or off at any one time and they can only perform calculations individually. Tasks that take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds by quantum computers, pictured. This, Google explains in the video, makes quantum computers more capable of solving 'optimisation problems' and gaining useful insights from data . Qubits work differently and can be on, off, or in a mixed state in between. As . a result, qubits are able to be in multiple places at the same time and . this means they are capable of performing single tasks faster, and . performing multiple tasks more effectively. Tasks that would take normal computers years to complete can be processed in seconds using quantum computers like the D-Wave.The D-Wave works closer to how the human brain works, but without the margin of human error. This, Hartmut explains, makes quantum computers, and the D-Wave specifically, more capable of solving what's called 'optimisation problems.' An example of a basic-level optimisation problem explained in the video is if someone wants to travel across South America, visiting 20 cities. A D-Wave 128-qubit processing chip. Unlike 'bits' found in normal computers that can only be on or off at any one time, qubits can also be in a 'mixed state' between these points . Google's video also explains the basics behind the multi-verse, in which there are infinite numbers of other universes running parallel to ours with different variations of the same people . This creates a huge number of variables, such as which . order to visit the cities in, travel times, ticket prices, airlines, seat choices, . routes, hotels, weather, attractions, events and so on. Normal computers could solve this problem eventually, but quantum computers are better equipped to solve it quickly. This becomes even more important as the variables and complexities increase,and Google is hoping to use the technology to develop cures for diseases, tackle the effects of climate change, better develop voice-activated technology . and more. 'In human civilisation we generate . vast amounts of data,' explains the video voiceover, including data on . climate, genetics, 'but it's very difficult to generate useful insights . from that data.' Google adds that quantum computers . makes humans 'consider more sophisticated notions of how the reality . around us is actually shaped.' 'We can't ask it how long we'll live, . or the meaning of life. Really we don't know what the best questions to . ask this computer are and that's exactly what we're trying to understand . now.' Google could use the D-Wave quantum computer to further develop the technology in its self-driving cars. This is the view the cars currently see. Future designs, created using the quantum computer, could better navigate the roads and react to obstacles in a more similar way to how human brains can . The D-Wave quantum computer could be used to help robots understand human speech and lead to more sophisticated robotic designs, like the Terminator in the classic sci-fi film . The video adds: 'The greatest . question is 'are we alone?' and we believe as quantum computers mature, . they're going to help us answer that question.' The D-Wave One was first announced in May 2011 by the company based in Burnaby, British Colombia. It was developed with financial backing from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. D-Wave . One was bought by defence group Lockheed Martin in 2011 as part of a . multi-year contract in a bid to try and solve some of its more . challenging computational problems. In August last year, a team of Harvard University researchers were able to use the D-Wave One to solve the largest protein folding problem ever, using the quantum computer. Protein folding is a complex system found in all living things involving amino acids. Google in particular could use the technology to improve the reaction times and processing speeds of its self-driving cars, or develop its Google Glass technology - a wearable computer that responds to motion and voice controls. To unlock this power, and test the computer's potential, the two organisations have launched the Quantum Artifical Intelligence Lab at Nasa's Ames Research Centre based in California. D-Wave is also working on a quantum computer that will run on a 2,048-qubit processor.","Google's D-Wave computer is 3,600 times faster than a normal computer .

"Lawyers should be banned from offering inducements such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in accidents to pursue compensation, MPs have said. The call comes from the Commons Transport Select Committee in an attack on ambulance chasers who encourage frivolous whiplash claims that drive up insurance premiums for all. The claims cost firms more than £2billion a year and add more than £90 to the average car insurance premium, according to industry experts. Frivolous: Lawyers should be banned from offering inducements such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in accidents to pursue compensation, MPs have said . Research dating back to 2012 has found evidence of some law firms . offering car-crash victims free iPads or hundreds of pounds in cash or . shopping vouchers to entice them to make personal injury claims. Some firms have advertised the tablets and Debenhams vouchers on their . websites. One was offering shopping vouchers to anyone who introduces an . accident victim to them. Steps taken by the Government to curb claims, such as a ban on solicitors paying referral fees to push cases their way, have been working. But the committee says more needs to be done and is backing proposals by the Ministry of Justice for a further clampdown. MPs also want a ban on payouts before whiplash claimants have been checked by an independent doctor. And they recommend that solicitors should be prevented from using their own medical experts to verify claims. There are also concerns that some solicitors are bumping up their fees by sending claimants for psychological assessment in order to boost the size of the claim. Extra checks: MPs also want a ban on payouts before whiplash claimants have been checked by an independent doctor. They recommend that solicitors should be prevented from using their own medical experts . In a report published today, the MPs state: ‘Inducements to claim . are likely to have encouraged fraudulent claims so we support the . Government’s intention to ban them.’ MPs said the Solicitors Regulatory Authority should act to stop lawyers from ‘playing the system to maximise their income from unnecessary medical reports’. Committee chairman, Louise Ellman MP, said: ‘Further action is still required to tackle fraud whilst protecting genuine claimants.’ She added: ‘Solicitors must be banned from generating more work by offering inducements, such as cash or tablet computers, to encourage people to make a claim.’ The MPs have endorsed a Government plan to change the law to require courts to strike out ‘dishonest’, specifically those that gross exaggeration. MPs first began looking at motor insurance premiums in 2011 following an extraordinary increase in claims that saw premiums for motorists rising at an astonishing rate of around 30per cent a year. Men were typically paying £2,457, while the figure for women was £1,423. Efforts to highlight the scandal and take some of the costs out of the legal process have had positive results. According to the AA, average premiums fell by 16.6per cent in the year to March 2012 and are now lower than at any time since late 2010.","Lawyers should be banned from offering inducements such as iPads to encourage frivolous compensation claims .

"Low calorie champagne contains the same amount of alcohol with almost half the calories of a regular glass . As a style editor with over 30 years experience in the fizz-guzzling fashion industry there's not much that Christa D'Souza doesn't know about champagne. One things she DOES know is that she doesn't actually like the decadent drink all that much. 'It reminds me too much of all those dreaded press launches I had to go to when I first started out in magazines, all those over made-up PR ladies with lipstick on their teeth and slightly skew-whiff hair-dos and so forth…' the 53-year-old British journalist told Get The Gloss when they asked her to review the latest skinny champagne to be causing a stir. 'I don't like champagne, or ""poo"" as we used to call it in the early 90s, but with the dilemma of maintaining one’s, um,  girlish figure and being a highly functioning alcoholic. What to do, what to do? 'Red wine gives one red veins, white wine is just too clichéd for words (don’t even talk about rose it’s WAY too fattening), so really there is only one alternative left… and that is champagne.' Champagne generally contains around 100 calories per glass. The 'dosage' is the sugar added at the end of fermentation to 'finish' the Champagne and 12 - 17 per cent sugar is standard. Whilst low sugar, and therefore low calorie, fizz is not a brand new idea - some of France's most prestigious brands offer extra dry versions of their biggest sellers - it usually comes with a hefty price tag that even regular champagne drinkers find hard to swallow. Now a new kid on the posh plonk block, created by British ex showbiz journalist Amanda Thomson, is offering a guilt-free alternative at half the price. Amanda, now a French wine expert trained at Le Cordon Blue in Paris, says she was inspired to create a low-calorie drink after her . previous job as a showbiz reporter made her worry about gaining weight . from attending VIP parties. Working with champagne maker Alexandre Penet she has created the no sugar Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru, which is now selling via her Thomson and Scott website for £49 per bottle and contains just 60 calories per glass. The drink is described as 'high end Grand Cru with almost half the calories' - which sounds like the holy grail for thirsty fashionistas and showbiz hounds doing the rounds. Contributing Vogue editor Christa D'Souza and her fashion friends put the latest brand to the test . Amanda said:'We know that the British have a history . of loving champagne, but in today’s more calorie-conscious market, I’ve . found a producer who delivers a deliciously dry champagne, but with no . added sugar. ‘The fashion crowd especially loves the idea of drinking fizz with less fat.’ So what is the verdict? Christa says: 'I seriously think it is going to be the NEW THING. Part of the reason I’ve never liked champagne is the sick-y breath it gives you straight afterwards. There’s also the stonking headache you can get the day after if it’s not super, super expensive. But here’s the thing. Because this Grande Cuvee champagne is so very, very very BRUT, you don’t get the sickly sweet taste and nor do you wake up feeling you need to take the whole day off or you seriously might die. More importantly it is less calories than a single shot of vodka. 'We had it last night at dinner and although it might not have been quite butch enough for my friend James, us ladies, we loved it, got p****d on it and woke up perfectly able to cope with the new day. 'Does that sound like a champagne for the ladies? Like that beastly despicable marketing campaign by Bic to make “comfortable” pink and purple pens “just for her”? Well, it shouldn’t.  Forget my friend James, it is perfectly robust enough to serve at the most manliest of dinners,  with the considerable upside of not making one’s breath smell like vomit. 'Doesn’t the idea of ‘Low Dosage’ for women kind of make sense given that it’s been clinically proven that we cannot  biologically keep up with men on the alcohol front? And another thing. I’m tub-thumping here, but with the mounting evidence that sugar is actually the crack cocaine of the 21st century, I think we should all — man, woman, rough-haired terrier — be cutting down wherever we can.' Amanda Thomson gave up her carrier as a TV journalist to study in Paris as a wine expert and has now launched a new sugar-free Champagne, 'Brut Nature' Anne Shooter, the Mail Online's food and drink blogger, agrees that lower calories are generally better all round, but isn't sure it works for this extravagent drink: 'Obviously it is fantastic to have low-calorie champagne but the important thing with something as delicious and luxurious as champagne is that you are not compromising on flavour. 'Zero dosage champagnes can be so dry that they taste almost sour. If you are watching your calories, it might be one of those situations where you are better off having one glass of something fabulous rather than two glasses of something that doesn't taste great. However, if this can tick both boxes, it is clearly worth buying - particularly if champagne is your aperitif of choice.'","'Low dosage' products have same amount of alcohol but 40 calories per glass less than standard champagne .

"With temperatures in the Gulf still baking hot, wealthy Arabs are seeing out the end of the summer in London's rather milder climes. And, in what is becoming an annual tradition, they have brought their supercars with them. As these astonishing pictures show, the streets of Knightsbridge and Mayfair are still currently lined with expensive motors which have been shipped over to Britain while their owners seek shelter from the sun (not to mention some retail therapy) in the capital. With their Arabic number plates they're a traffic warden's nightmare but a car spotter's dream, with marques including Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Forgiato, and Lamborghini.  And they've all had the requisite custom paint jobs. Fans of the ostentatious cars, known as the 'carparazzi', are descending upon London to photograph the often extremely rare vehicles. But local residents are not fans of the supercar spectacle, complaining the drivers take the parking spaces without respecting parking rules. Others complain of drivers revving their cars' engines and treating the well-heeled streets as a racetrack until the early hours of the morning. However, as this top picture taken outside the Dorchester shows, either the cars' owners - or perhaps more accurately, their chauffeurs, are rather good at reverse parking - no mean feat when the car involved is worth north of £1million. Flashy: This line-up of two Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupés, two gold-plated Land Rovers, a Lamborghini, a Ferrari and a Bugatti Veyron, is worth at least £3.1 million . They can afford a parking ticket or two: This exclusive Ferrari is one of many ultra-expensive cars to have hit the streets of the capital within the past few months . Summer: Wealthy residents of Arab countries frequently transport their cars to London during the summer months to escape the stifling heat in the Gulf . Glamorous: The cars - including a Forgiato C7 Corvette Widebody - have been zooming around pricey parts of the city such as Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Kensington . A Kuwaiti car covered in Arabic writing (above and below) as well as photos and social media tags is one of the more unusual sights for the 'carparazzi' fans . Sleek: The vehicles, such as this Ford GT (above and below), have been attracting admiring looks from passers-by this summer as their owners shelter from the heat . Colourful: The cars are often in eye-catching shades and have been customised with scant regard to price or, some might say, taste . You wouldn't call it understated: This gold-plated Ferrari is parked outside Harrods, where it has received a traditional British summer soaking . High roller: A Lamborghini with an Arabic licence plate parked on double yellow lines outside five-star hotel 45 Park Lane, which overlooks Hyde Park . Shopping trip: An enormous SUV parked outside Harrods, the landmark department store in Knightsbridge, a favourite for supercar owners . This matte blue Ferrari (above and below), one of several on the city's streets with a Kuwaiti numberplate, has had a soaking in a London rain shower . End of the season: Many of the supercars will soon return to the Middle East - but some, like this Audi R8, appear to be based in Britain full-time . Glitzy: This silver Mercedes (above and below) was yet another one of the glitzy cars to zoom past the Dorchester, infuriating residents on central and west London . This white Pagani Huayra (above and below) - one of the supercars transported over to London for the summer  by its rich Arab owner - was seen on double yellow lines . The sports car, which can sell for up to £850,000 and can reach speeds of more than 200mph, was seen parked out Harrods in Knightsbridge this week . Despite being built for the desert sands, a converted Mercedes G63 AMG - worth an estimated £350,000 - was among the cars stuck in traffic in west London this week .","Wealthy Arabs escape the stifling summer in the Gulf by coming to London - and they bring their supercars with them .

"They spend months of the year parading along the seafront of Dubai or locked up in the vast garages of millionaires' mansions in Riyadh. But the summer arrival of these expensive Arab-owned supercars to London has become as regular an event as the tennis at Wimbledon or the cricket at Lords. The capital has once again seen a boom in the number of Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugattis on its streets as rich Qataris, Saudis, Emiratis and Kuwaitis move to Britain to escape the Middle East's baking mid-summer months. But the growing number of sports cars around the wealthy Knightsbridge district is causing some local residents to worry about breaches of parking rules and potential dangerous driving. Scroll down for video . A queue of extravagant vehicles were parked around Harrods yesterday including a £400,000 Mercedes  AMG, a £1million Pagani Huayra and a £300,000 Rolls Royce . A Dubai-registered £1million Bugatti, parked on double yellow lines in front of a modified Rolls-Royce, attracted the attention of a traffic warden yesterday . A Qatari-owned £200,000 Ferrari 458 in front of a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. The cars are attracting gangs of camera-wielding youths, dubbed the 'Carparazzi' A £400,000 six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, similar to one which featured on Top Gear, is among the most outrageous to have been shipped across . The cars owners compete with each other to see who can carry out the most outlandish modifications, with this £150,000 Maserati Gran Turismo given a silver bonnet . The most outrageous car to make the trip over this time around is the six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, an enormous £370,000 off-roader. A 220mph Pagani Huayra, worth more than £1 million, has also attracted attention from tourists and passersby. There is also a gold Range Rover, various Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, numerous Bugatti Veyrons and a 1970s Datsun. The rich Arabs stay in the best hotels and empty their wallets in London's most expensive shops, but they also cause problems with their unique supercars. Residents in affluent Knightsbridge have complained they are behaving in an anti-social manner, revving the cars and treating the exclusive area as their personal racetrack. Panda Morgan-Thomas, a management consultant, said: 'I am not angry. I am just exhausted. After a relatively calm three years the last few days have seen the return of supercars to Knightsbridge. 'They are again racing down Sloane Street from late afternoons until 3 or 4 in the morning. We honestly thought we had made progress but it seems as though local residents are in for another sleepless August.' The wealthy holidaymakers, predominantly from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, arrived in London around a week ago following the end of Ramadan. This £50,000-plus Ferrari 456 Italia has been given a spider wrap by its Qatari owner, who was keen to show it off on the streets of central London yesterday . A gold and black Saudi-owned Bugatti Veyron - which can sell for up to £1million - was parked in a street in Kensington yesterday, causing many to stop and take photos . This heavily-modified gold Range Rover - estimated to be worth more than £150,000 - has attracted attention after its owner parked it outside the Wellesley hotel . A number of the supercars have been spotted with parking tickets while others have been driving around with incorrect registration plates. But despite residents dreading 'The Season', there is one group of people salivating at the supercars and leaping to the defence of the drivers - the Carparazzi. When the wealthy Arabs arrive in London, car enthusiasts show up with their cameras to film and photographer the million-pound motors. Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, played down their bad behaviour. He said: 'August always proves to be the best time of year for petrolheads to see their dream machines on the road. 'Having seen the change in driving styles and cars, I still can't believe the police presence and residents kicking up a fuss. For four weeks out of 52, these super-wealthy individuals come and pump millions of pounds into the UK economy. 'Not only that, they fulfil many car fan's dream by bringing super rare Bugatti Veyrons, or special edition Paganis. I feel sorry for these guys coming here with their expensive toys as they get harassed by police.' The limited edition Mercedes - which have a starting price of £370,000 - were originally engineered for the Australian Army but have become popular with Arabs as they are one of the few vehicles which can be driven safely off-road through the desert dunes . A blue and white Saudi-owned Rolls Royce, estimated at £300,000, attracts attention of pedestrians after its owner parked it outside the bay in Knightsbridge yesterday . It's not just modern sports cars that are being brought over, this classic UAE registered Datsun 240 GL was spotted on London's Sloane Street yesterday . As word got around that London's richest tourists were showing off their cars near Harrods yesterday, this £180,000 Lamborghini Huracan was soon seen driving past . He added: 'I have been filming all summer and rarely see them drive more than 25 per cent throttle, or make any noise at all. 'I don't see why the residents of Knightsbridge don't use this influx in foreign cars as an excuse to go on holiday and escape one of the busiest, loudest cities in the world for a couple of weeks of the year.' Previous summers have seen expensive cars clamped outside department store Harrods, towed for being uninsured and locals complain about being kept awake by revving engines. Westminster council has revealed the parking fines handed out to cars registered in the United Arab Emirates have nearly doubled in the last three years. A Saudi-registered Pagani Huayra, which has a starting price of around £1million, was spotted parked next to an expensive hotel in the area . A pink-tinged £350,000 Rolls Royce with Saudi number plate was seen driving through west London yesterday as part of the now-annual influx of Arab-owned cars . A Qatari millionaire has brought this £70,000 Mercedes AMG with him for his holiday in Britain and parked the machine outside Harrods yesterday . Cars from the Middle-Eastern country were given a whopping £57,060-worth of fines last year, up from just £31,780 in 2011/12. Fears have been raised that drivers feel they can flout the rules either because they can easily afford the penalties, or because they know they'll be able to move home and ignore the fines. A Westminster City Council spokesman said: 'We do all we can to ensure that all outstanding fines are paid – whatever the nationality of the driver. 'However, when cars aren't registered in this country, it is sometimes extremely difficult to track people down. 'We already work with an agency to help recover money owed by European drivers and we're currently exploring other avenues that might further our success. The start and end point here is that every driver who parks in Westminster is subject to the same laws.'

"Finally, down a quiet side street a few miles from my home, I found the address I was looking for. Spiked metal gates protected a rather foreboding forecourt where a generously sized man was standing, shirtless and missing some teeth, hosing down an old red car. Behind him were about 15 dust-covered other old vehicles, all sporting heavy-duty wheel clamps. Among them was my trusty old VW Golf. Scroll down for video . Nicole Mowbray, from London, had her VW Golf towed away from her home, 18 months after failing to pay a fine she did now know she had. She paid £694 to get her impounded car back . To cut a long story short: my car had been seized by a debt recovery agency following an unpaid ticket for a ‘traffic offence’ that had been issued by my local council. I was here to buy back my car from an auctioneer who had, in turn, purchased it from bailiffs. I only found out that my car was missing one Saturday morning recently when I went to find it in the street outside my home in South London. It wasn’t where I had left it. I scanned the road. Four of my neighbours have similar black Golfs. I could see theirs — but not mine. Nor was there any sign — such as smashed glass on the kerb — to suggest it had been broken into and stolen. Also, the car has an immobiliser and I had both the keys in my bag. Suddenly I began to panic. Had I driven it somewhere and forgotten where I had left it? Perhaps I’d parked it in a neighbouring road and my mind was playing tricks. With a growing feeling of fury, I begrudgingly called 101, the non-emergency police number to report my vehicle as stolen. This was the kind of hassle that has made me not very keen on cars. As a teenager, I wasn’t much fussed about learning to drive. I figured, as a city-dweller, it’s usually quicker, easier and less stressful to take public transport. But I then learned to drive in my mum’s car. Driving someone else’s vehicle taught me to be careful and I’ve I’ve had no points on my licence and only one parking ticket in the ten or so years since passing my test. As I waited on the phone to be connected to the police, I thought through what life would be like without a car if mine never turned up. Eighteen months earlier, Nicole had performed an 'illegal manoeuvre' by turning right where it was banned. Her car was found outside her home by an Auto Number Plate Recognition vehicle . Video courtesy of Adaptive Recognition . Certainly, I would save money, because motorists get fleeced. We all know driving is expensive — my council parking permit is more than £200 per year, then there’s the car tax, insurance, petrol etc. At last, a police operator answered. Having told him about my missing car, he asked: ‘Are there any parking restrictions on your road?’ I told him there are but that I had the correct permit, an MoT, full insurance and a valid tax disc. ‘Oh,’ said the operator, who, had checked my number-plate with the DVLA. ‘Your car has been seized for an unpaid parking offence.’ I was mystified. I hadn’t got any parking tickets — and if I had, I would have paid straight away. So I pressed a little further. It transpired that 18 months earlier (in December 2013), I’d performed an ‘illegal manoeuvre’ on a road in nearby Clapham, turning right where I wasn’t supposed to. While I don’t recall doing so, I didn’t doubt the police version of events. In any case, the incident had been caught on CCTV. It was, as they say, a fair cop. The operator said I had been sent notices of the ‘penalty charge’ which I had ignored. Yet I hadn’t received any at all. Surely only police or councils should be . allowed to have vehicle-recognition systems — not bailiffs. But even cowboy parking firms have access to DVLA . records . Eventually, I discovered what had happened. I moved house last year and despite changing the address details on my driving licence, insurance policy and council parking permit, I hadn’t got my new address put on my car’s registration document until May this year, when a cashier at the Post Office who was sorting out my new car tax disc told me that I was legally bound to do so. Apparently, under European Directive 1999/37/EC, vehicle registration documents (what used to be called log-books) must contain the owner’s up-to-date address. My failure to do so was an oversight, but naively, I’d assumed that when you changed details on your driving licence with the DVLA, they would automatically update all your details. But I was wrong, and thus all penalty notices about the traffic offences had been sent to my old address. The police operator told me this was now a ‘civil matter’ and the police would be unable to help me recover my car. He simply gave me the phone number for a debt recovery company called Equita Ltd. Let’s just say that when I phoned them, the woman who answered didn’t sound like she was happy in her work. Rude, obstreperous and obstructive, she told me that I must pay £694 to Equita if I wanted to get my car back, otherwise it would be sold at auction in a few days’ time. I also discovered that two days earlier, while I was at work, an Auto Number Plate Recognition vehicle (to you and me a ‘spy car’), owned by bailiffs and which has a computer linked to the council’s database, had located my car outside my house. A tow-truck was summoned to remove my £7,000 Golf to take it to an auction firm to be sold. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition system cameras are used by police and councils, but are also used by bailiffs . All because I hadn’t paid a £130 traffic fine I knew nothing about. I was outraged. Surely only police or councils should be allowed to have vehicle-recognition systems — not bailiffs. But I have subsequently learned that even cowboy parking firms have access to DVLA records. I’m not alone in thinking this is outrageous: the Government has announced a proposal to ban private companies such as bailiffs from using this technology to recover unpaid traffic fines. Indeed, the Department For Communities & Local Government and the Department For Transport joined together to tackle what they called ‘unacceptable parking fine collection practices’. In any case, how difficult would it have been for my local council of Lambeth to track me down without using bailiffs? While I was no longer at the address on my vehicle registration documents, the correct details were on my driving licence, insurance documents, MoT certificate, council parking permit and the electoral roll. All of this is computerised. Cynically, I felt the council didn’t actually want to find me because otherwise they couldn’t fleece me of such large sums of money! Anyway, back to Mrs Rude at the bailiffs. She told me to call back on Monday because the car pound wasn’t open at weekends. So, on Monday I called again. This time, I spoke with a fairly decent guy called Nathan. He said I had to pay the £694 to get my car back. I explained that I’d had no notification about how these charges had accrued so asked for a breakdown of the costs. He said I had to apply in writing, but only after paying the  fee. I wasn’t even allowed to know which pound my car was in until I’d paid, because, even though Nathan was sure I wouldn’t, I might otherwise ‘go down there and cause trouble without paying for the car’. So I just had to pay some guy over the phone £694 — with nothing in writing to confirm the ‘deal’. To add insult to injury, when I asked for a receipt, I was told I didn’t need one. But I wanted one, I said. Again, I’d have to apply in writing. (I’ve since had a receipt, but no breakdown of costs.) How do I complain, I asked? You have to send an email and they will tell you how, he said. Welcome to the Kafkaesque world of councils, bailiffs and traffic offences. After I’d gone through this rigmarole, I had to wait an anxious hour — £694 poorer — for Equita to locate my vehicle and ring  me back. Which explains how I found myself outside General Auctions Limited of Earlsfield, South-West London, a car auctioneers that specialise in selling repossessed vehicles. It wasn’t their fault — they’re just making a living. But I am incensed by Equita Ltd and the Borough of Lambeth who seem to be making obscene amounts of money out of the  genuine mistakes of honest drivers. Paying almost £700 to retrieve a car in which the driver had committed a £130 offence would be out of the reach of many people. While I accept I made two mistakes (the illegal manoeuvre and not telling the DVLA of my change of address so as to amend my car’s log-book) holding people such as me to ransom for minor misdemeanours — parking  tickets, entering a bus lane, turning right at a no right turn — is criminal.

Two teaser video have been released so far, with a third scheduled for 14 July. Name: Polaris Slingshot . Price: Under $30,000 . Release: 2016 . Engine: 2.4-litre Ecotec four-cylinder engine . Horsepower: 200 to 250 bhp . Top speed: 130 miles (210 kilometres) Features: ABS brakes, power steering, traction control and stability control . Steering: Front wheel drive . Seats: Two . Doors: None . In them, some of the finer details of the vehicle can be spotted. The first and most obvious observation is that the vehicle sports three wheels, rather than two for a motorcycle of four for a car. The reason for this could be so that the vehicle can be classified as a motorcycle, superseding some stringent safety checks needed for cars. The Slingshot is also devoid of doors, while it sports a windshield similar to the plastic on motorcycle helmet visors. It’s also incredibly low to the ground, with one scene from the videos showing just a tiny gap between the driver’s seat and the road. ‘This thing is going to have the seat of your pants getting warm from the asphalt passing under you at a high rate of speed,’ said NickJ on SlingshotForums. In this still from one of the teaser videos the interior of the car can be seen. The two seats, which admittedly don't look all that comfortable, are also very close to the ground so riders 'surf' the road. The slingshot It can apparently reach speeds of 130 miles (210 kilometres) per hour . Look familiar? You'd be forgiven for the three wheels of the Polaris Slingshot reminding you of a Reliant Robin (left), while the aesthetic look of the vehicle also seems to bear a striking resemblance to the Batmobile from the Batman Dark Knight trilogy of movies, pictured right in London's Leicester Square . Other rumours suggest Polaris will be gearing up to sell the Slingshot beginning in 2016, although exact dates are not known. A rumoured price tag is less than £17,500 ($30,000) but, again, that is just speculation for now. What is more concrete is what will be powering the vehicle; most think it will sport a 2.4-litre Ecotec four-cylinder General Motors engine. Estimates for the horsepower range from 200 to 250 brakehorsepower, while its top speed has been estimated at 130 miles (210 kilometres) per hour. Is this the car in the flesh? This image was snapped by a user on SlingshotForums and apparently shows the car being made by Polaris in a car park. The company has released two teaser videos, while the full reveal is on 27 July. Rumours suggest it will launch in 2016 and will cost under £17,500 ($30,000) Two teaser video have been released so far, with a third scheduled for 14 July, while a series of patent drawings have also been submitted to the U.S. patent office (shown). In them some of the finer details of the vehicle can be spotted; here can be seen the 'open' design of its back wheel . Other features, some that could probably be considered standard these days, are ABS brakes, power steering, traction control and stability control reports Digital Trends. But while the tyres look road-worthy the seats don’t look incredibly comfortable, suggesting this might be more of a ‘boy’s toy’ car than one driven for comfort. In the video the driver is also seen to be wearing gloves, further hinting that Polaris will classify the Slingshot as a motorcycle over a car. For all the final details, though, motorheads will have to keep their eyes and ears peeled when Polaris unveil the vehicle on 27 July. The Slingshot is also devoid of doors, while it sports a windshield not too dissimilar to the plastic on motorcycle helmet visors.

"Super Siri? Students have given Siri a boost by allowing it to take photos, unlock cars and play songs on Spotify (pictured) Most people use Siri to set reminders or find destinations on a map. But now four students have managed to transform Apple’s voice-sensitive personal assistant in to a super helper - making it capable of playing specific songs on Spotify, taking photos and even adjusting the lighting and temperature of your house. The technology, called GoogolPlex, combines a linguistic trick with third party apps to let users to get more from their iPhone by simply talking to it. While the technology is in its early stages, it already allows users to play music, post selfies on Instagram and control Philips Hue lights using voice commands. The student startup said: ‘Imagine being able to control your Nest thermostat and unlock your car through Siri. With GoogolPlex, these are now possible.’ When a user says ‘GoogolPlex turn off the lights,’ Siri hears: ‘Google “plex turn off the lights”' so that it thinks that the person wants to Google something. Trickery: The technology is called GoogolPlex and uses a clever linguistic trick, servers and third party apps to enable users to get more from their iPhone by simply talking to it. Here, the technology is used to play a song on a red speaker (pictured) When a user says ‘GoogolPlex turn off the . lights,’ Siri hears: ‘Google “plex turn off the lights”' so that it . thinks that the person wants to Google something. Siri then searches Google for the words . ‘Plex turn off the lights’ and the newly developed technology intercepts . the request between Siri and Google. Siri then searches Google for the words ‘Plex turn off the lights’ and the newly developed technology intercepts the request between Siri and Google, the students explained. The University of Pennsylvania students recently came third in a prestigious hackathon with their product, which they have described as ‘an App Store for Siri’. In order to intercept the request between Siri and Google, they built a proxy server - a system that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers - and found a way of connecting iPhones to a DNS server, which is the system that converts addresses like google.com into IP addresses. A better personal assistant: While the technology is in its early . stages, it already allows users to play songs on Spotify, post selfies . on Instagram and control Philips Hue lights using voice commands, (pictured left and right) By creating a server that spoofs the DNS (domain name system) of Google.com, the programme is able to send a string of words the user asked Siri to its own server, which in turn allows communication with apps like Instagram and Spotify. After receiving a string of commands such as ‘Plex turn off the lights,’ their server uses natural language processing methods to understand the command. It sends a ‘HTTP Redirect Response’ to the phone with a custom web address like ‘googolplex://.’ that launches the GoogolPlex programme. It then connects to the appropriate app and carries out the intended action. At the moment,  users can say ‘GoogolPlex, play Demons’ to start a track on Spotify, ‘GoogolPlex, turn on my lights’ to turn on Phillips Hue smart lights, and 'GoogolPlex, make it warmer,’ to interact with a Nest thermostat. The students are working on making it possible for anyone to build their own commands using GoogolPlex. The technology can be found at betterthansiri.com. It's getting hot in here: The company said: 'Imagine being able to control your Nest thermostat (pictured) and unlock your car through Siri.

"Amateur oceanographers or curious travellers no longer have to leave the comforts of home to reach the depths of the ocean floor. Researchers are creating a Google ‘street view’ of the world’s coral reefs and other underwater scenes with 360-degree photos that reveal the marvels of marine life in stunning detail. The captivating panoramas show the wonders of the ocean like they have never been seen before. Scroll down for video . Under the sea: With more than 400,000 photos, Catlin Seaview Survey is creating a 'street view' of reefs around the world . Haunting: A submerged statue of Jesus Christ is covered in corals off the coast of the Florida Keys in the US . Researchers are using a basketball-shaped camera that is capable of capturing 360-degree images in stunning detail . Catlin Seaview Survey, the team behind the project, partnered with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of National Marine Sanctuaries this week to map coral reefs in a highly-protected area of the Florida Keys in the US for the first time. One of the most fascinating images captured by the crew’s 360-degree cameras shows Christ of the Abyss, a bronze sculpture covered in corals, at the bottom of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The haunting statue was deliberately dropped in the water in 1965, and it depicts Jesus Christ with his arms raised toward the ocean's surface. Back to school: Scientists are learning how to use an underwater camera to map the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary . Christ of the Abyss, a bronze sculpture covered in corals, was deliberately placed on the sea floor in 1965 . The sanctuary surrounding the archipelago at the southern tip of Florida offers world-class diving, swimming, snorkelling and fishing for visitors, but not everyone can afford to go there. Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is the world’s third largest barrier reef with more than 6,000 species of marine life and shipwrecks. The online gallery, described as scuba diving from your computer, gives people a glimpse of what they’re missing. Mitchell Tartt, chief of the conservation science division with NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, said: ‘This allows people who can't get underwater to understand what we mean by putting up a special preservation area around this particular spot.’ The team’s basketball-shaped cameras are tethered to scuba divers and powered by small motors. Catlin is teaching US scientists to use a panoramic camera that will allow them to map and record reefs in the country’s protected areas, document any changes to the vulnerable ecosystem and educate the public about conservation efforts. New depths: Catlin Seaview Survey has already mapped portions of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and underwater mountains off Galapagos Islands in South America . By mapping reefs, scientists will be able to document any changes to the vulnerable ecosystems and educate the public about conservation efforts . Catlin started its underwater survey in 2012, snapping more than 400,000 photos. It has already shared incredible scenes from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, colourful ecosystems in Hawaii and Philippines and underwater sea mountains off the Galapagos Islands in South America. Thanks to the group’s efforts, travel buffs can now browse a collection of high-resolution images on Google Maps and other websites. The mapping is taking place as the world’s reefs are in a dramatic state of decline. Catlin says over 40 per cent of the world’s corals have been destroyed over the last 30 years due to pollution, destructive fishing and climate change. If the decline continues, it will pose a major threat to 500 million people who rely on coral reefs for food, tourism income and coastal protection.

"He is known as one of RTE’s most dapper newsreaders...but it will take more than a little concealer to cover Aengus Mac Grianna’s blushes after the News Now anchorman was broadcast touching up his  own make-up live on air. The clip, which has caused much mirth across the internet, catches the polished host giving himself a sprucing up, not realising that the cameras are rolling. At first he is seen applying a touch of foundation to his forehead – using what appears to be his own compact – then momentarily rolling his shoulders and sucking his cheeks. Scroll down to watch . Button it: RTÉ newsreader Aengus Mac Grianna was filmed readying himself for a broadcast without realising the cameras were rolling . He moves on to his tie, tugging and teasing it into its best shape and ensuring that he has not allowed it to slip down from his collar. Ever the professional, Mac Grianna then gives himself a proper grooming, sweeping his shoulders with the palm of his hand to make sure there is no hint of fluff – or anything else – on his suit shoulders. But then, as he begins to remove an errant piece of lint from his cuff, there is a terrible pang of realisation. A member of the production staff on RTÉ’s digital news channel has clearly informed him that he is in fact grooming himself live on air. The newscaster lets out a furious ‘What!?’, the clip ends – and before he knows it, Mac Grianna’s blooper is the talk of the internet. Happily, the Dubliner has taken the episode in good spirits, calling it one of the hazards of the job. Wuh oh: When the newsreader realised he was on live television he shouted 'What!' The clip has become a hit since it was posted on the internet . He said: ‘It was a technical problem and simply one of the hazards of the trade. 'I . can’t believe it’s been of such interest, but I am delighted that so . many people are watching our digital news channel News Now. And yes, I’m . back to the desk as normal again today!’ The . clip was an immediate hit online when it emerged on Wednesday night, . but much to the dismay of many, RTÉ then removed it from its own . play-back service and YouTube. A spokesman for the station insisted that it was not an effort to censor people’s enjoyment of the clip but rather to ensure that Mac Grianna approved of the clip’s circulation. Reporting the news live on air requires perfect composure – but from time to time even the most professional presenter can crumble under pressure. And in the age of viral videos, viewers from all around the world can now enjoy a chuckle at some of the most memorable news bloopers. One particularly entertaining clip shows what happened when unsuspecting jobseeker Guy Goma – who believed he was being interviewed for a job at the BBC – is mistaken for Apple expert Guy Kewney by a BBC news team and interviewed live on air. Hilariously the Congo graduate was questioned by the BBC 24-hour news team about an The Beatles’ Apple company vs Apple computers court case that was in progress at the time. In the clip from 2006, which now has been watched by over a million people on YouTube, Mr Goma is shown looking nervous but manages to answerthree questions. He later told the team that he was ‘happy to speak about any situation’ on air but would like more time to prepare his answers. Mr Goma’s ordeal has gone down in the annals of notable bloopers and there is never a shortage of others to fill the funny reels. In another memorable case, some frisky alpacas lent an unexpected X-rated edge to a presenter’s report for a popular breakfast show in New Zealand when they started to mate in the background of her clip. And when the duo failed to cease quickly, the embarrassed reporter told viewers: ‘I am sorry to all of the parents out there watching with children. You’ll have to have that conversation now.’ Closer to home, RTÉ’s Sharon Ní Bheoláin was also caught out when the camera cut to her during a link with The Daily Show and viewers watched as the news anchor pursed her lips to prepare for the update, unaware that the camera was firmly on her. A spokesman said: ‘When we knew it had been uploaded, our first instinct was to ensure that Aengus was okay about it.’ ‘He was not aware that the clip had been put up, so we took it down from our own player and YouTube. It wasn’t his fault; it was a technical error. Since then, we’ve learned that Aengus is not unhappy about it and is fine with it. So we are not going to pursue it.’ In fact, the clip has only increased Mac Grianna’s popularity. Viewer Louise McSharry wrote on Twitter: ‘I don’t think there is a person in the country who doesn’t love #aengus more now than they did when they woke up this morning.’ Stylist Ingrid Hoey wrote: ‘I’m in Love with Aengus Mac Grianna, I mean the man has his OWN compact.’ The newscaster is no stranger to the blooper reel and going viral on the internet. Just last month, a clip of him struggling with a malfunctioning autocue over a news report about the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 17 mission became a viral hit.","Newsreader Aengus Mac Grianna did not know that the cameras were rolling .

"The widow of a man killed by a shark in northern NSW says she does not blame the shark for his death, and has even been for a swim near the site of the tragedy. Paul Wilcox, 50, was mauled by a suspected great white shark at Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay on 9 September as he swam about 15 metres from the shoreline. His wife of 26 years, Victoria, was surrounded by friends and family at a memorial service on Tuesday at Wategos Beach near where the attacked occurred. Scroll down for video . A memorial service was held in Byron Bay on Tuesday for shark attack victim Paul Wilcox, pictured here with his wife Victoria on their honeymoon 25 years ago . 'I want to reach out to the Byron community. I don’t blame the shark, or the town or anyone. The beach is such a health giver,' Mrs Wilcox told local newspaper, the Byron Echo. Friends say Mrs Wilcox is heartbroken over her husband's death but she plans to keep living in Byron Bay. But she has not been able to face going back to the house the couple shared. Mr Wilcox, who was born in the UK and worked as a corporate trainer, had moved to the beachside town with his wife about five years ago. 'Our daily ritual included a swim for Paul and a run to the lighthouse for me,' she said. Paul Wilcox, 50, was mauled by a suspected great white shark at Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay last Tuesday as he swam about 15-metres from shore . Mrs Wilcox, who was seen on the beach immediately after her husband was pulled to shore by Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey, said she did not witness the attack. 'I came to the beach after he didn't turn up to where we had agreed to meet,' Mrs Wilcox said. 'As soon as I saw the police car on the beach, I ran towards it as I knew it was him.' A family friend, Jodie Molloy, said a pod of dolphins jumped out of the water during Tuesday's memorial service. '(It was) a sign telling us that his spirit lives on in the Bay, it was a very special moment,' she said. Mrs Wilcox has already been back in the water for a swim since her husband was attacked a week ago, Ms Molloy said. Mrs Wilcox, who was seen on the beach immediately after her husband was pulled to shore by Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey, said she did not witness the attack . Despite the heartbreak of her husband's death, Mrs Wilcox said she wanted to stay in Byron Bay but could not go back to the house the couple shared together . 'She is trying to get back into her routine - back into the healthy lifestyle that drew them to Byron Bay in the first place,' she said. 'Victoria cannot go home to their home in Rosebank and I'm seeking community support to help find her a new self-contained humble abode in the Bay and to cover funeral expenses. 'The Byron Bay vibe and community is what drew Paul and Victoria to the Bay time and time again before they chose it to be their home.' Mr Wilcox swam in the sea near his property at Byron every day and the experts say he may have been mistaken for a seal or a large turtle by the shark due to his dark wetsuit and flippers. The businessman was on his regular one-kilometre swim when the shark attacked, biting into his leg. Holidaymaker Mark Hickey spotted him in distress and paddled frantically to his aid, but Mr Wilcox bled to death in the water. Mr Hickey said the water had darkened so much with blood he initially thought he was looking at a patch of seaweed. Victoria and Paul married in Sydney in 1989 and moved to Byron Bay five years ago . Mr Wilcox, pictured left in 2006 and right in 1989, ran a time management and skills company through which he coached a number of high-profile company directors . He jumped on his paddle-ski and sped towards Mr Wilcox some 40 yards away, in what police called ‘an extraordinary act of bravery’. 'Then I realised he was in trouble and I had to make a decision - and that decision was to try to do what I could to help him,' he said. 'I didn't think much about the shark - I just needed to help the man. The shark had been circling and came back to him and had another go. ‘I grabbed him and got him back to the beach and tried CPR but it was too late.' Victoria had the agonising task of identifying Mr Wilcox's body on the beach. Mr Wilcox had joked about the danger of sharks with his family in the UK just 24 hours before he was attacked. Mr Wilcox came to Australia in 1986 for a six . month adventure holiday but loved the lifestyle so much he stayed. He . met his 50-year-old wife, a personal trainer who lived in Sydney, at a . friend’s wedding in Australia. The couple married in Sydney in 1989 but . decided not to have children. The couple had moved to Byron Bay five years ago. Mr . Wilcox grew up in Coventry, and his parents separated when he was a . child and both remarried. His step-father Bryan Wilcox, 79, . told Mail Online how he and his wife had urged him to be careful as they spoke on the . phone from their home near Corwen, North Wales, before the fatal attack. 'I told Paul to be careful of the sun,' he said. He made a joke and said, 'I . always wear a wetsuit and I use a lot of sun lotion'. Then he said: 'That's not the problem, the sharks are more of a problem.'

"Chief of staff to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's wife has been dating a convicted killer who has publicly denounced police officers as 'pigs,' it was revealed Thursday . Rachel Noerdlinger has been in a serious romantic relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010. This past January, she joined Mayor de Blasio's team, and in her capacity as aide to First Lady Chirlane McCray she has been allowed to attend high-level NYPD meetings. Scroll down for video . Dangerous liaison: Rachel Noerdlinger (center), newly appointed chief of staff of the first lady of New York City, has been living with convicted killer Hassaun McFarlan (right) since 2010 . Hassaun's McFarlan’s criminal record, first brought to light by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem. Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend’s Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site. Two of McFarlan’s five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger. The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network. All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media. In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.' When asked whether the bombshell revelations concerning Noerdlinger's personal life might result in her dismissal, de Blasio’s spokeswoman Rebecca Katz stated to the New York Post: 'Rachel’s not going anywhere.' Friends in high places: Noerdlinger (center) pictured with her current boss, Mayor Bill de Blasio (left), and her former employer, Rev Al Sharpton (right) Secret intel: Noerdlinger's critics have expressed concern that the top aide has been allowed to attend high-level NYPD meetings while dating a criminal . Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.' The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement. ‘It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,’ he told the Post. ‘She should not be in that position.’ Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend. ‘To her credit, she’s a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,’ said Lichtman. Hassaun McFarlan, the son of a drug dealer from Harlem, has been arrested at least five times since 1993, when he shot dead Kenneth Carter , 18, over a jacket at a housing project. Listen to the full interview here . On top of her game: Noerdlinger, pictured here in 2013 with Al Sharpton and Aisha McShaw, got her start as a publicist before joining the civil rights activist's National Action Network . In her corner: Sharpton (second left) has come to Noerdlinger's defense, saying she should not have to answer for her boyfriend’s past actions . He pleaded guilty to a manslaughter charge and spent the next seven years in prison. In 2003, McFarlan ran afoul of the law a second time after he was busted as part of an interstate crack-trafficking ring. McFarlan ended up behind bars yet again, this time in Massachusetts, after pleading guilty to a slew of drug charges. He was released in 2007. Since then, McFarlan has been arrested at least three times for vehicular violations and marijuana possession; last November, he came close to mowing down a police officer responding to an accident. Through it all, McFarlan has been a vehement critic of law enforcement, referring to officers as 'pigs' and criticizing the controversial stop-and-frisk policy. The 43-year-old chief of staff, pictured here in November 2013 - around the time of her boyfriend's latest arrest  - is a single mother of one . In January 2012, McFarlan was apparently furious after reading a story about a police officer in Staten Island who pleaded guilty to arresting an innocent black man on trumped up charges. ‘The system sucks this pig should be charged with a civil rights violation,' he wrote at the time in a post, which has since been deleted. Al Sharpton cautiously has come to Rachel Noerdlinger's defense, telling the New York Daily News that she should not have to answer for her boyfriend’s past actions.","Rachel Noerdlinger, 43, has been in a relationship with Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010 .
Noerdlinger was appointed in January as chief of staff to Bill de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray .
In her capacity as a top aide, Noerdlinger has been allowed to attend high-level NYPD meetings .
Hassaun McFarlan was first arrested at age 15 after killing an 18-year-old boy over a jacket .
His most recent arrest came last November after he nearly ran over a New Jersey police officer in his girlfriend's Mercedes ."
"Neil Warnock will hope those in the corridors of power at Selhurst Park still feel festive. The Crystal Palace manager is a man under pressure. One win in 12 games, and a run of seven points from 36 after Friday’s resounding loss against Southampton, is relegation form — the sort of form that has managers looking over their shoulder. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Crystal Palace 1-3 Southampton . Southampton made it back to back victories in the Premier League after they swept past Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . Sadio Mane (second right) gave Southampton a perfect start when he opened the scoring in the 17th minute . Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock will come under even more pressure after his side were beaten once again . Crystal Palace (4-3-2-1): Speroni 5; Mariappa 5, Dann 6, Delaney 5, Ward 4; McArthur 5, Jedinak 6, Ledley 5 (Zaha 67min, 5); Puncheon 5, Bolasie 6 (Kelly 72, 5); Campbell 5 (Gayle 49, 5).

Subs not used: Kelvin Davis, Tadic, Reed, Targett. Goals: Mane 17, Bertrand 48, Alderweireld 53. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) 6.5. Man of the match: Sadio Mane. Sadio Mane rounded off a team-move to give Southampton the lead in the 17th minute and the first goal is shown by our match zone graphic - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . There has not been a sacking in the Barclays Premier League yet this season, but chants of ‘You don’t know what you’re doing’, echoed around Selhurst Park in the second half. Warnock knew who they were aimed at, and so will chairman Steve Parish. Another loss against QPR on Sunday, then Parish could be deciding more than his New Year resolutions next week. Asked if he retained the confidence of Palace’s board, Warnock responded: ‘The answer would be you have to look at the club’s targets and at what we’re trying to do. We are with the squad we have had from the start and I think we are doing as well as we can. ‘We have to cut out the mistakes and I’m sure the chairman and the others will agree. When you lose a game you are responsible as a manager and if I was one of the players today, I would blame the manager. ‘I thought Palace had a lot of luck last year (in staying up). I don’t see us getting a lot of luck this year, so I’m sure we are due a little bit. Mane rounded Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni before slotting into the empty net to give Southampton the lead . Southampton celebrate the opening goal of the game from Mane as they take the lead at Selhurst Park . ‘You can’t concede goals like we did today, they were all very poor. I think all fans, when 3-0 down, will give their manager a bit of stick. ‘I thought they were very good today, you just have to keep going.’ Southampton, meanwhile, look to be back on track after a recent blip. Ronald Koeman’s side were dominant in every aspect, but we will learn more about Saints’ top-four credentials over the coming weeks — their next three league fixtures are against Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘It was a good performance, and we are back on a good run — winning two in a row now,’ said Koeman. ‘Three points away is important because we want to fight for the next position. Our next games are going to be a challenge, but the win over Palace makes the games more comfortable.’ Southampton took a 17th minute lead thanks to Sadio Mane’s coolness under pressure and James Ward-Prowse’s brilliant vision. The way Mane rounded Julian Speroni was excellent, but Ward-Prowse’s one-touch through ball surpassed the finish. Three minutes into the second period, it was game over. Mane was again in the thick of the action as he escaped the attentions of Joel Ward to set up Ryan Bertrand, who smashed past Speroni with his unfavoured right foot. And four minutes later Palace were three down as Toby Alderweireld rose above Ward to hammer home a powerful header from Ward-Prowse’s outswinging corner. Ryan Bertrand (third left) doubled Southampton's lead early in the second half against Crystal Palace . Toby Alderweireld rises highest to head home Southampton's third goal to put his side in command . Alderweireld (right) celebrates his goal for Southampton as they cruised past Crystal Palace on Boxing Day . Scott Dann pulled back a late goal for Palace, but it proved to be little more than a consolation . The Palace fans’ frustrations boiled over in the 72nd minute when Warnock replaced Yannick Bolasie — Palace’s biggest attacking threat — with defender Martin Kelly. Sunday’s clash against QPR was in Warnock’s mind, as was the fact that the winger’s partner is due to give birth any day now. But it was the last straw for the home supporters who gave their manager a volley of criticism. Scott Dann headed home a consolation for Palace — but that wasn’t enough to prevent Warnock and his side from being loudly booed off at full-time. Southampton's travelling supporters wore red and white Santa hats in the away end at Selhurst Park . Crystal Palace's cheerleaders, the Crystals, dressed up in festive costumes for the Boxing Day game . And three minutes into the second period, it was game over – Mane again in the thick of the action. There looked to be little danger when he collected Nathaniel Clyne's throw near the left hand byline, but the Senegalese easily escaped the attentions of Joel Ward before rifling a low cross into the Palace area that Graziano Pelle missed – but Bertand smashed past Speroni – with his unfavoured right foot – as he steamed into the area. The problems were mounting for Warnock, he was forced to replace Campbell – who was clutching his hamstring – with Dwight Gayle immediately after the goal. Four minutes later his side were three down as a result of one of the simplest goals you'll see this Christmas as Alderweireld rose above Ward to hammer home a powerful header from Ward-Prowse's outswinging cross. Warnock made the logical decision to throw on Wilfried Zaha in attempt to inject some urgency into his lacklustre attack in the 67th minute; but it was Southampton who continued to press, Mane again going close with a curling effort from the edge of the area. Palace's next substitution, perhaps wasn't so logical, replacing Bolasie – their biggest attacking threat – with defender Martin Kelly. Sunday's clash against QPR was obviously in Warnock's mind, not that the home supporters cared as they gave their manager both barrells. Scott Dann headed home a late consolation for Palace – but that didn't stop the boos at full-time. Make no bones about it, Warnock is under pressure.","Southampton secure their second straight victory as they beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park .

"The man who died after a shark attack in Byron Bay has been identified as British expat Paul Wilcox . Despite yesterday's fatal shark attack, a tanned 70-year-old man has braved the surf at Byron Bay's closed Main Beach, emerging from the water to declare the great white should not mess with him. 'I'm going to rip his head off!' keen ocean swimmer John Parkes told Daily Mail Australia on the beach on Wednesday morning. 'I'll tear his teeth out!' Mr Parkes insisted on going for his morning dip on the same stretch of beach from where Englishman Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed by the shark. Mr Wilcox's wife Victoria watched on from the beach in horror yesterday as rescuers attempted to revive her husband. All beaches in the area were closed for 24 hours following the attack. It also emerged Mr Wilcox was wearing a dark wetsuit and flippers and may have been mistaken for a seal or a large turtle by the shark. On Wednesday, Byron Bay local Mr Parkes, who wore red budgie smugglers, was adamant he would go for his daily swim, shark or no shark, despite the evident disapproval of other local ocean swimmers. 'No! Get on with it,' said Mr Parkes, who emerged from the surf only several hundred metres from a 'beach closed' sign. 'You just keeping going... you just have to keep going forward.' Mr Parkes, who used to run local business Cossies by the Sea, was the only person Daily Mail Australia saw brave the surf on Wednesday morning. Byron Bay local John Parkes ignored 'Beach Closed' signs to go for a swim on Wednesday morning, just down the beach from where Paul Wilcox was killed by a shark . Mr Parkes, who used to run local business Cossies by the Sea, was the only person Daily Mail Australia saw brave the surf on Wednesday morning . Swimmers from the local group Stingrays said they disapproved of Mr Parkes's actions as it made the situation more difficult for surf lifesavers, who patrolled the Byron coast on jetskis. Overnight it emerged that Mr Wilcox had joked about the danger of sharks with his family in the UK just 24 hours before he was fatally attacked. Mr Wilcox swam in the sea near his property in Byron Bay every day but had never mentioned sharks until his final call home, his anguished parents told the Mail. The businessman was on his regular one-kilometre swim when the large shark attacked, biting into his leg. Mrs Wilcox, who was seen on the beach immediately after her husband was pulled to shore by Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey, said she did not witness the attack . Despite the heartbreak of her husband's death, Mrs Wilcox said she wanted to stay in Byron Bay but could not go back to the house the couple shared together . A holidaymaker who spotted him in . distress paddled frantically to his aid but Mr Wilcox bled to death in . the water. His wife, Victoria, 50, is thought to have witnessed the . drama from the shore. Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey jumped into the water to pull Mr Wilcox's body from the water . Lawyer . Mark Hickey, 52, said the water had darkened so much with blood he . initially thought he was looking at a patch of seaweed. He jumped on his . paddle-ski and sped towards Mr Wilcox some 40 yards away, in what . police called ‘an extraordinary act of bravery’. He . said: ‘Then I . realised he was in trouble and I had to make a decision - and that . decision was to try to do what I could to help him. ‘I didn’t think much about the shark – I just needed to help the . man. The shark had been circling and came back to him and had another . go. He needed someone to help him. ‘I grabbed him and got him back to the beach and tried CPR but it was too late.’ Mr . Wilcox’s body was identified on the beach by his distraught wife of 26 . years, the Russian daughter of an eminent surgeon. Mr Wilcox ran a a time management and . communication skills company - through which he coached a number of high-profile company directors. Mr Wilcox, 50, pictured with his wife Victoria in 2005, as they visited Bondi beach. Their relationship was described as 'love at first sight' Mr Wilcox, pictured left in 2006 and right in 1989, ran a time management and skills company through which he coached a number of high-profile company directors . Mr Wilcox went out to Australia in 1986 for a six-month trip but stayed after meeting his wife. They married in 1989, pictured above . He went out to Australia in 1986 for a six . month adventure holiday but loved the lifestyle so much he stayed. He . met his 50-year-old wife, a personal trainer who lived in Sydney, at a . friend’s wedding in Australia.  The couple married in Sydney in 1989 but . decided not to have children. The couple had moved to Byron Bay, 480 miles north of Sydney in northern New South Wales, four years ago. A shark expert from the Department of Primary Industries (left) was seen looking for the shark on a search and rescue boat near Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay on Wednesday . Mr Wilcox and his wife lived in Byron Bay and had run local businesses. Police officers are pictured on the beach following the attack . Lawyer Mark Hickey performed CPR for 20-30 minutes on the victim before rescuers arrived. Police officers are seen on the beach following the attack . Mr . Wilcox grew up in Coventry, and his parents separated when he was a . child and both remarried. Yesterday, his step-father Bryan Wilcox, 79, . told how he and his wife urged him to be careful as they spoke on the . phone from their home near Corwen, North Wales, earlier this week. He . said: ‘I told Paul to be careful of the sun. He made a joke and said, “I . always wear a wetsuit and I use a lot of sun lotion.” Then he said: . “That’s not the problem, the sharks are more of a problem.” An aerial photo taken by Helirescue showed a search team member on a jetski near a two-metre shark off Main Beach, Byron Bay . Byron Bay's beaches will remain closed for at least the next 24 hours . I . told him he must be joking. Then he started to laugh and said, “They . are very very rare here – I’ve never seen one.” He had never referred to . sharks before,’ Mr Wilcox said. Marie . Wilcox, 74, said her son  – who took her husband’s surname – had said . he planned to go for a swim in the sea the following morning. She said: . ‘The last thing I said to him was: keep safe, I love you.’ Speaking . of the couple, she said: ‘It was love at first sight, they adored each . other. They had found their paradise in Australia.’ Mr . Wilcox, a keen swimmer since his youth, was a member of Byron Bay . swimming club, and was in the shallows on the eastern side of the  main . beach when he was attacked. Shocked onlookers stood on Clarkes Beach as emergency services responded to the fatal shark attack . A large shark was spotted off the coast of Byron Bay on Tuesday morning after the attack . The shark is believed to have bitten through his wetsuit on his upper right thigh. ‘It . was a fatal bite with major blood loss. He probably died in the water . because there was no blood loss on the beach,’ New South Wales Ambulance . paramedic Andrew Chapman said. Lifesavers who usually patrol the beach . and check for sharks are not due to begin their summer duties until next . week. All the area’s . beaches closed and helicopters were patrolling the coastline checking . the shark had gone back out to sea. Police said that despite it being a . protected species it would be shot if it returned. Police officers stayed at the beach until around 2.30pm on Tuesday when the body was taken away . Police moved a family from the water at Clarkes Beach at Byron Bay in far northern New South Wales after the incident . Lifeguards have spotted a shark in the water off the beach, believed to be a Great White . 'It was so horrible': Witnesses have told how they were yelled at to get out of the water . A shark was spotted near where the surfer was attacked and witnesses said it was around two metres in size . The last fatal shark attack in Byron Bay was in 1993. Mr . Wilcox’s sister, Jane Richmond, a 54-year-old grammar school teacher, . lives in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, with husband Paul, 56. The . couple declined to comment last night. Mr Wilcox’s . birth father, Ignatius McCabe, 76, a retired licensee, still lives in . Coventry with his second wife, Beryl, 81. The couple said they had last . seen the managing director 30 years ago when he visited a pub that they . were then running outside the city.

"Pope Francis has announced he will no longer used a bullet-proof Popemobile as the glass 'sardine can' keeps him away from the people. The armoured vehicles were introduced after the 1981 assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II in a bid to prevent further attacks on the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. During the interview with a Spanish newspaper which was reported by Vatican Radio, Pope Francis said: 'It is true that anything could happen, but let's face it, at my age I don't have much to lose.' Scroll down for video . Pope Francis said he no longer wants to use a bullet-proof Popemobile as it is a 'sardine can' which keeps him away from the people, claiming that 'at my age I don't have much to lose' He continued: 'I know that something could happen to me, but it's in the hands of God.' The Argentinian pontiff was more diplomatic when questioned on the World Cup claiming he will be neutral when it comes to who he will support during the competition. When asked about his legacy, Pope Francis said: 'I have not thought about this. But I like it when you recall someone and say ""he was a good guy, he did what he could, and he was not that bad."" With that, I would be content.' Pope Francis has told his security officials he wants to be able to interact with crowds when he is out in public and cannot do so effectively behind a screen of bullet proof glass . Already during several high profile visits Pope Francis has rejected his custom-built high security vehicle and used ordinary cars. On a visit to Brazil, Pope Francis used a small Fiat from the airport to the centre of Rio which caused problems for security officials. While on  his high profile trip to the Middle East, Pope Francis made an unscheduled stop to an Israeli security wall in the West Bank where he paused to prayer in a highly symbolic but controversial gesture. The specially designed Popemobiles were introduced after Pope John Paul II was hit several times when Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca opened fire in St Peter's Square in May 1981. The Pontiff has established a regular routine of hugging children as he arrives for his weekly general audience at the Vatican despite this being the location where Pope John Paul II was shot . Pope Pius X refused to use the first car which arrived at the Vatican in 1909 which was a gift from the archbishop of New York. Since the 1930s, many Popes have used various types of Mercedes with the special number plate SCV 1. However, it wasn't until Pope John Paul II that the Popemobile became internationally recognised due to the level of international travel he took. During his 1982 visit to Britain, Pope John Paul II had a highly modified Leyland truck to transport him. It weighed 24 tonnes and was able to survive small-arms fire. Pope Benedict used a highly modified armoured Mercedes G Wagon capable of driving at speeds of up to 160mph. However, after his election, Pope Francis refused to travel in the Popemobile and instead went on the bus with his cardinals. Pope Francis was given a 40-year-old Renault 4 by a Fr Renzo Zocca from northern Italy as a gift last year.","Pope Francis claimed the bullet-proof Popemobile was a 'sardine can'

"West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce believes a serious FA charge could have been potentially avoided had referee Mark Clattenburg handled better the powder-keg incident from last weekend's 2-1 defeat at Everton. A strong tackle from Everton's James McCarthy on Morgan Amalfitano in the 40th minute, which was not initially penalised by Clattenburg last Saturday, prompted an angry reaction from several Hammers players. A melee ensued and players from both Everton and West Ham started pushing each other. Republic of Ireland international McCarthy and West Ham defender Winston Reid were later booked for their parts in the first-half altercation. West Ham's James Collins confronts James McCarthy during the match at Goodison Park last Saturday . Referee Mark Clattenburg books James McCarthy after the brawl between Everton and West Ham players . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, on the touchline at Goodison Park, feels the melee could have been prevented . Following the match, the Football Association charged both clubs for 'failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion'. Everton and West Ham have until 6pm on Monday December 1 to respond to the charge. Asked for his reaction to the FA charge, Allardyce said: 'I can't argue with (the FA Charge). We got so frustrated probably by the decision of the referee at the time. 'We lost our control a little bit. I don't condone what we did but I can understand why the frustration crept in. McCarthy and West Ham's Winston Reid clash at Goodison Park last Saturday, both players were booked . 'We have to try to control ourselves better in those situations because we could have easily lost a player to a red card in that congregation of players, prompted by the feeling of frustration that they felt at the time. 'To be fair to my players they don't often do that. Very rarely do they lose control, rarely have they done that sort of thing in my time here.' Asked if the way Clattenburg handled the situation actually exacerbated the incident, Allardyce responded: 'I don't think it helped. West Ham captain Kevin Nolan argues with referee Mark Clattenburg during the 2-1 defeat at Everton . 'Particularly the first one. If he gives a free-kick and deals with the situation straightaway, because of the bad tackle that had Morgan had suffered at that time. 'Because he didn't give a free-kick that spilled over into frustration. When you see your teammate is, what you feel, unfairly treated, then you want to stick up for each other. 'Obviously, you just don't want it to extend to levels that we saw last Saturday.'","Everton and West Ham have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an 'orderly fashion' last weekend .

"David Moyes was at Ewood Park on a Christmas break from Real Sociedad and he witnessed the Championship's version of tiki-taka with Middlesbrough continuing their excellent form under Spanish manager Aitor Karanka. Boro stand third in the table after a run of one defeat in 11 games and justice says they should have gained the victory needed to leapfrog Ipswich into an automatic promotion spot with the Tractor Boys not playing until Tuesday. Blackburn's stand-in goalkeeper Simon Eastwood was the clear man-of-the-match and made three spectacular saves he can be proud of while the visitors also hit the woodwork three times. Blackburn goalkeeper Simon Eastwood keeps out an attempt by Middlebrough's Adam Reach . Middlesbrough's George Friend (centre) attempts to beat Blackburn's Lee Williamson and Ben Marshall . Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka watches on as his side can only manage a goalless draw at Blackburn . Blackburn Rovers (4-4-2): Eastwood 8; Baptiste 6.5, Hanley 6.5, Duffy 6, Olsson 5.5 (Cairney 34 5.5); Marshall 6, Tunnicliffe 5.5, Williamson 6 (Taylor 83), Conway 6; Rhodes 5.5, Gestede 5.5 . Subs: Kean (Gk), Kilgallon, Dunn, Brown, Varney, Brown . Booked: Gestede, Tunnicliffe . Middlesbrough (4-1-3-2): Konstantopoulos 6; Whitehead 5.5, Gibson 6, Ayala 6, Friend 6.5; Velijkovic 6 (Clayton 90); Wildschut 6 (Bamford 59 6), Leadbitter 6.5, Reach 6.5; Kike 6.5, Vossen 7 (Tomlin 63 6.5) Subs: Mejias (Gk), Omeruo, Nsue, Adomah . Booked: Whitehead, Gibson, Ayala . Referee: Carl Boyeson 6 . Attendance: 22,340 . Even so, Rovers nearly snatched it in injury time with Rudy Gestede – whose scoring record in 2014 has only been bettered in all four divisions by Chesterfield's Eoin Doyle – having a header kicked off the line by Grant Leadbitter. Karanka, who used to be on Jose Mourinho's coaching staff at Real Madrid, grimaced afterwards: 'It should have been three points. We had many clear chances. 'I have played against Blackburn three times and every time their goalkeeper has been man-of-the-match. I am pleased we showed we are a good team but I know we will have to play different styles in some games to win.' Rovers manager Gary Bowyer was proud of his young side managing to claim a point: 'It was a hell of a 0-0, how it ended like that I am not entirely sure,' he said. 'Middlesbrough are a very good team with momentum but it could have gone our way in the second half with the one that was cleared off the line. We had a good go at them. 'Simon has played twice for us in goal now and we haven't lost. It's something I will have to think about because you have to reward performances like that. Mr Karanka offered £200million for him afterwards!' With Boro in the play-off positions and Blackburn just outside, there was plenty at stake for former Everton and Manchester United boss Moyes to enjoy as he chatted with his close friend, Rovers chief executive Derek Shaw. Boro resembled a red tide as they bossed the opening 45 minutes only to find Eastwood in inspired form. Eastwood was only playing because Blackburn's first-choice keeper Jason Steele is on loan for Middlesbrough and was ineligible to face his parent club. And the 25-year-old made the most of his rare opportunity as he dived full-length to tip a Jelle Vossen shot onto the post and then kept out an Adam Reach header from four yards. Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes fights for possession with Middlesbrough's Ben Gibson (left) and Daniel Ayala (right) Blackburn's Craig Conway gets away a shot at goal in search of a solution to break the deadlock . Rudy Gestede (centre) rises highest in a crowded Middlesbrough box but Blackburn were still unable to score . Rovers fan and I'm a Celebrity winner Carl Fogarty was invited onto the Ewood Park pitch to do the half-time draw and it seemed to temporarily rouse Bowyer's side, who had been forced into a reshuffle when Markus Olsson limped off after 33 minutes to add to Blackburn's casualty list and leave the manager to quip: 'Our dressing-room looks like A&E at the moment.' The home side improved after the interval with Alex Baptiste denied by Boro 'keeper Dimitri Konstantopoulos after a stinging shot. Karanka sent on England under-21 forward Patrick Bamford to try and break the deadlock and the Chelsea loanee became the latest Jose Mourinho player to go to ground easily when he went down claiming a penalty after being held off by Grant Hanley. Referee Carl Boyeson remained utterly disinterested. The seven thousand travelling Boro fans sensed it wasn't their day when Eastwood then tipped a Kike shot onto the post and Bamford hit the top of the crossbar with the rebound. But even if they thought one point wasn't reward for their performance, they nearly ended up with nothing when Gestede rose majestically at the end to head a Craig Conway corner, with Leadbitter in the right place to hack away the danger. But despite drawing a blank, Rovers won't be able to go into the market in January to buy more firepower – they are one of three Championship clubs who have been hit with a transfer embargo for violating Financial Fair Play rules.

"Diamonds may be a girl’s best friend but, according to the Royal Mint, gold can also be a staunch ally if your nest egg is languishing in a low-interest savings account. To encourage more ordinary savers to invest in precious metals, the Mint has set up a website to simplify the process. It estimates that an extra £4billion could be invested in gold if the process of buying it or converting it into savings was easier. The price of gold, which is valued internationally in US dollars, soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011 . Experts said consumers had been put off because they thought buying precious metals and keeping them secure was too complex. They were also worried about finding a reputable dealer or being ripped off. Buying bullion is also a gamble. Investors traditionally turn to gold as a haven in times of economic crisis and its value often falls when the going gets good. The price of gold, which is valued internationally in US dollars, soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011, rising from £168 ($273) an ounce to £921 ($1,500). However it has since fallen back to around £778 ($1,268). But the Royal Mint said its website would make buying gold and silver as in investment rather than as jewellery ‘relatively affordable’. The site allows consumers to buy bullion in either gold or silver coins priced according to the fluctuating global rate, plus a premium. Customers can have the coins delivered to their home, or opt to have them stored in the Royal Mint’s secure storage vault, which is protected around the clock by the Ministry of Defence (File photo) Diamonds like these may be a girl’s best friend but gold is where it is at these days (File photos) The size of the coins is given in troy ounces, which are slightly heavier than standard ounces and are used for precious metals and gems. Ordinary investors can buy just a single gold coin, such as the 22-carat George & Dragon 2014 Sovereign, which weighs 0.2354 troy ounces, for around £199. Alternatively, there is the 1oz Britannia Gold Bullion coin, which comes in at around £807. However, there is no limit to how much bullion people can buy and the Mint has set up a special advice and storage service for people spending more than £50,000. Customers can have the coins delivered to their home, or opt to have them stored in the Royal Mint’s secure storage vault, which is protected around the clock by the Ministry of Defence. Storage fees are charged annually at 1 per cent plus VAT of the market value of the gold being held. The Royal Mint will also buy back customers’ gold coins that have been stored in its vault. No VAT is paid on gold bullion coins, and the Britannia, Sovereign and Lunar bullion coins are also free of capital gains tax for UK residents because they are legal tender. Shane Bissett, the Royal Mint’s director of commemorative coin, said: ‘Where the average consumer may have shunned gold due to perceived complexities, the Royal Mint can help make this option a much more accessible opportunity. ‘The quality of our bullion coins is of a standard which cannot be rivalled. We have been a highly respected and trusted source of coins for kings, queens and governments for over 1,000 years, and we are globally recognised as a reliable source for bullion coins.’","Mint estimates extra £4billion could be invested if process of buying or converting gold into savings was easier .

It is understood Farah moved to Britain from Somalia with this 31-year-old brother, but never became a British citizen. It is thought the pair no longer keep in touch. The runner's agent refused to comment on the case. The case comes just a week after the athlete's other brother, Omar, was jailed after trying to break into an elderly couple's home. The 21-year-old of Brentford, who has 15 previous convictions, was caught trying to break into the pensioners' home after visiting his girlfriend in west London. He pleaded guilty to one count of attempted burglary with intent to steal at Kingston Crown Court last week. He had previously spoken about the support Mo, 31, had given him, seeing him as a role model, while in a 2013 interview he said he had been training as a graphic designer in a bid to avoid getting into trouble.

"Two days after being sacked as England’s one-day cricket captain, Alastair Cook put his troubles behind him on Monday night with two superb centuries. Unfortunately for the opener, he was using darts, not a bat. And he was a long way from the pristine surroundings of Lord’s. Many of the boisterous punters at the PDC World Championship were wearing Christmas jumpers and there were even a couple of reindeer present . Jimmy Anderson (left) took on Alastair Cook (right) in a one-leg challenge at Alexandra Palace . VIDEO Cricket meets Darts: Cook vs Anderson . The 29-year-old, who remains England’s Test captain, took the stage at Alexandra Palace shortly before 7pm for a challenge match against fast bowler James Anderson. And Cook looked a natural in the one-leg shootout. ‘I was nervous,’ admitted Cook. ‘I scored a hundred — and it’s the first time I’ve done that on TV for a while. My legs were shaking.’ Asked for his thoughts on being ditched from the England one-day set-up, he added: ‘I am frustrated and disappointed that I am not joining Jimmy on the plane (to the World Cup) Cook competed in the challenge match just days after being stripped of England's one-day captaincy . The England Test captain celebrates a victory on stage against his team-mate Anderson . ‘I have to take it on the chin. It’s hard to talk about at the moment because of the way I feel. I will get away from it for a couple of weeks now.’ England cricket chiefs approached the PDC to arrange the match after darts became a hit with the players on tour. Cook did the full walk-on, wearing a shirt with ‘Alastair ‘Bed n Breakfast’ Cook’ emblazoned on the back. Anderson’s top read ‘The Swinger’. In practice, Cook had achieved a 13-dart leg and he brought that form to the oche. He scored 100 and 140 — and despite missing seven darts at double 13, he hit double 11 to clinch the game and see off his team-mate. Cook admitted to being nervous on the Alexandra Palace stage to the point where his legs were shaking . Anderson and Cook regularly play darts while on a cricket tour with England .

"Northampton Saints have stemmed a recent player exodus to France by securing Stephen Myler and George Pisi on new Franklin's Gardens contracts. The Aviva Premiership champions have suffered the double blow of losing Samu Manoa and Salesi Ma'afu to European and Top 14 champions Toulon, and Myler and Pisi were also subject to interest from France. The Saints have fended off competition to retain England fly-half Myler and Samoa centre Pisi, however, with backs Tom Stephenson and James Wilson also completing new deals. Northampton Saints duo Stephen Myler (left) and George Pisi (right) have signed new deals at the club . Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley rejected overtures from across the Channel, with Hartley tempted by a strong offer from Montpellier before committing his future to Saints. Saints rugby director Jim Mallinder admitted relief at tying down two of his backline mainstays in the wake of losing tight-five duo Manoa and Ma'afu for next term. The new deals also offered Northampton a boost with England hooker Hartley facing a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday evening following his red card for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith in Saints' 23-19 win on Saturday. 'We're delighted that all four of these players have decided to stay with us and continue their career at the Saints,' said Mallinder. 'They are all quality players who have shown time and again that they have the ability and composure to compete at the highest level of the sport, and they will remain important members of the squad for years to come.' Tom Stephenson (centre) is another to sign a new deal at Franklins Gardens after coming through the ranks . Former St Helens rugby league star Myler switched codes to join Northampton in 2006 and proved integral to Saints' title triumph last term. The 30-year-old's composed goal-kicking and tactical play proved a feature of Northampton's run to their first league crown. Former Auckland Blues and Clermont centre Pisi had drawn widespread interest from France's top clubs, so Northampton will view his retention as a mini coup. The 28-year-old has excelled in his four years in the Premiership, with 24 tries in 88 appearances. 31-year-old James Wilson has also signed a new deal after making 58 appearances for the club so far . England Under-20s Junior World Championship winner Stephenson has risen quickly through the ranks at Saints, featuring in last term's Premiership final victory. Utility back Wilson completes Saints' quartet to confirm new terms, the 31-year-old boasting 58 appearances since his switch from Bourgoin in 2012.

"Billie Jean King understands that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and that is how she is taking the advent of the International Premier Tennis League in Asia. The American legend was not just an inspirational driving force behind the growth of women's tennis, but also the playing of the sport in the team format, having first founded the concept with her own league in the mid seventies. On Sunday night she was bringing her Mylan World Team Tennis event to London's Royal Albert Hall, at a time when players joining up under the banner of a group outfit is suddenly all the rage. VIDEO Scroll down to see Billie Jean King speak about the Elton John Aids Foundation . BIllie Jean King and Tim Henman share a joke before the Mylan WTT Smash Hits event . King says she is flattered by the International Premier Tennis League copying her competition's format . Her opposing captain in the charity event was Sir Elton John, who actually penned his classic Philadelphia Freedom song in 1975 as a favour to her, providing a theme tune for one of her professional tennis teams. King has looked at the four-team league currently going in Asia, and might be excused for envying the nouveaux riches of the format, given the eyewatering sums they are paying the players taking part. Roger Federer is reliably said to be collecting at least £2.5 million for his two appearances in India while Andy Murray's fee for representing the Manila Mavericks in three matches is believed to be around £1m. Even the veterans taking part, such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, are reckoned to be pocketing well in excess of £500,000. Jamie Murray, Kim Clisters, Henman and Sabine Lisicki pose with King (centre) on Sunday . Sir Elton John (left) and John McEnroe (right) are involved in the event which takes place at the Albert Hall . Before the London event - featuring the likes of John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis – King spoke of her delight that her longstanding concept appears to be proliferating. It does not trouble her that her own version in America, which takes place after Wimbledon, cannot afford to attract the world's top players in the way that the IPTL has done. 'I'm thrilled, it's a form of flattery,' she said. 'We are celebrating our fortieth year next summer. This is fantastic. It's really important to support tennis, whatever the level. The IPTL is taking professional tennis to new cities with great players. 'I have always been in favour of the team format, always thought that children signing up to tennis should be in a team, they like to be with their friends. Team sports are the biggest in the world, that was my background originally and that of my brother, who played Major League Baseball.' In a sport where players are often resistant to any form of innovation, those participating in Asia and the Middle East have clearly been enjoying themselves and embracing the concept (as they ought to with its rewards). Andy Roddick and Martina Hingis will be among the stars of the game involved in King's tournament . It is a lively product and television-friendly, fitting in to modern tastes, with players showing their personality. It is certainly hooking people in a way that is making the worthy week-in, week-out event the WTA and ATP Tours look very samey by comparison. What nobody in the game is quite sure is how the IPTL is making its sums add up, and how it will go forward after what looks already to have been a successful first year purely in terms of the product. But then in light of the deep pockets of some of the franchise owners they might not have to balance the books in the same way that more regular events do. McEnroe is also a supporter of the team concept: 'You've got to remember that in the seventies team tennis was packing out stadiums, with players like Jimmy (Connors) and Bjorn (Borg) taking part,' he said on Sunday afternoon. McEnroe, Hingis, Sir Elton and Roddick pose with  Heather Watson at the pre-tournament press conference . 'I think the key is this having its own time slot. Maybe the game changer part of this is that the schedule is a bit less year-round than it was. It's got a bit more chance of being a success.' The least that the IPTL is going to do is fuel the current debate in tennis, traditionally resistant to change, about how it needs to broaden its appeal to cater more for modern demands. Sir Elton, who for twenty years has captained his team in charity matches against that of King, is also a keen advocate of the team format despite his enthusiasm for the game's traditions. His sporting loves are football and tennis and, as he pointed out, he goes back a long way with both. He joked 'I'm so old I can even remember (Jaroslav) Drobny beating (Ken) Rosewall at Wimbledon in 1954.'","Billie Jean King has long been a promoter of team events .

"Roger Federer gave a lukewarm response to the International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) after making his debut for the Indian Aces on Sunday. 'My mind was definitely scrambling trying to remember all the rules,' a smiling Federer, a late replacement for the injured Rafa Nadal in the Indian team, said. With its emphasis on speed, fun and noise, an IPTL tie comprises five one-set shootouts in men's and women's singles, men's and mixed doubles and a past champions match with the team that wins the most games, not sets, declared the winner. Roger Federer hits a return shot during his game againstd Tomas Berdych in New Delhi . Additional features include a 20-second serve clock, a 'Happiness Power Point' in which a point is worth double once per set, no advantages, no lets, coaching timeouts and a five-minute shootout if a match is tied at 5-5. Federer won his men's singles, doubles and mixed doubles against Singapore Slammers at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium but the 17-times grand slam champion said he found some of the rules 'strange' and others unnecessary. 'The one I think is most unnecessary here is like when you start the motion and let's say you miss the ball toss, that counts as mistake,' he said. Federer (centre), Ana Ivanovic and Indian Aces players pose for a photo on the second day of the tournament . 'I think that's probably most unnecessary.' Traditionalist Federer said he understood the drive to speed up the game but felt it put a lot of pressure on the players. 'The way it is right now, I don't think it will work as a Tour event,' said Federer, who agreed to play only the Delhi leg. 'Maybe there's something we could take away from this but at the end you know how I am. Federer (centre), relaxes on the side of the court with Pete Sampras (left) and Gael Monfils . 'I'm very traditional and I like the way the game is on tour. I like the scoring system.' Federer, however, liked the team format of the league which has also attracted world number ones Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams and Andy Murray. 'It's not going to replace how we play the tour but it definitely has a place in our sport to have more interaction, more fun, different rules,' he said.

"Manchester City academy graduate Kieran Trippier will return to the Etihad Stadium for the first time with Burnley on Sunday afternoon and admits that his chances of breaking into City’s first team were handicapped by the club’s massive spending.

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet insists he is ready to step back into the firing line after making an unexpected return to the team. A thigh injury to Brad Jones just 15 minutes into the 1-0 Boxing Day victory at Burnley meant the Belgium international's exile was ended sooner than he could have anticipated. Having been dropped a fortnight ago because of poor form, and missing the last three matches, his comeback was not all plain sailing. And, while he made one good save from Ashley Barnes in the first half, he was far from convincing, and allowing a Mamadou Sakho backpass to go out of play before he kicked it still requires some explaining. Simon Mignolet replaces the injured Brad Jones (second left) during Liverpool's match against Burnley . Mignolet (left), pictured making a save from the feet of Scott Arfield, kept a clean sheet on his return to action . But the 26-year-old is confident he can get back up and running quickly, as he will be in goal for the visit of Swansea on Monday with youngster Danny Ward on the bench. 'I just take every game as it comes,' Mignolet said. 'I work hard and keep my head down like I've always done - nothing changes. 'Sometimes things get tough but you still have to step up and I am a positive guy and will try to go again. 'You always have to be ready when you are on the bench. When you are second-choice goalkeeper, anything can happen in the warm-up, so I prepared myself as normal. Jones has his head in his hands after leaving the field with a thigh injury after just 15 minutes on Boxing Day . Mignolet was playing his first game back after being sidelined for three, but it wasn't all plain sailing . 'I was still warm from the warm-up so that helped a bit. I tried to stay relaxed. I'm not a guy who gets flustered easily, so I tried to focus on my own game. 'Me and Brad get on really well. It is unfortunate for him to pick up an injury, but he will be back soon. 'We focus on ourselves and do our best every day in training to get better. 'When you get the chance you hope you do well and we got three points, so I am pleased with that because it is a difficult ground to go to and it was a difficult battle.' Mignolet kept only his fifth clean sheet in 23 appearances this season, but it was a crucial one with such a slender margin of victory. Raheem Sterling (right) secured Liverpool all three points with a second-half strike at Turf Moor . Sterling rounds Burnley keeper Tom Heaton to slot home and put Liverpool 1-0 up on Boxing Day . It secured a first win in four league matches and, with Swansea and Leicester both to visit Anfield over the next week, there is a chance to build some much-needed momentum. 'At half-time it was still 0-0 and in the second half we went out and did the job,' Mignolet added after Raheem Sterling's second-half winner. 'We knew it was going to be tough, but we fought really hard as a team and worked well. 'When you step onto the pitch, you have to do a job and I am pleased how we played. We got the three points and that is what mattered.

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet intends to use his axing from the side as a positive experience as he returns looking to prove he has benefited from the break. Manager Brendan Rodgers said the Belgium international would be sidelined for an 'indefinite' period after dropping him for the match at Manchester United a fortnight ago. However, the 26-year-old earned an unexpected reprieve when Brad Jones was forced off with a thigh injury 15 minutes into the 1-0 Boxing Day win at Burnley, and Mignolet now looks set for a second chance against Swansea on Monday. Simon Mignolet replaced Brad Jones in the Liverpool goal on Boxing Day, and is expected to continue . He and Rodgers held a frank meeting in the manager's office ahead of the Old Trafford clash, and Mignolet went away to work on his game during his spell on the sidelines. While he has returned ahead of schedule, it does not mean he has not learned something from his exile. 'We spoke together and cleared up a few things and I think that was a positive discussion,' the Belgian said. 'I will not discuss what we spoke about, but it was an honest meeting - why not? 'There is always a reason and discussion why, and I am a guy who always tries to speak and be positive and work hard on my game, and that is what I have done in this period with the goalie coach (John Achterberg) and Jonesy. Mignolet revealed he had tried to take positives from his time out of the Liverpool side . Brendan Rodgers initially said he would drop Mignolet for an indefinite period of time . 'Sometimes you have to make something positive from a negative thing like going out of the team, which I've tried to do. 'It is always difficult at first but I am a 26-year-old goalkeeper and I know what I have to work on, things in your game can still improve. 'You can reflect on your game and look at certain things where maybe, with the busy period we've had, you wouldn't have had the chance, and that is what I have done. 'You learn a lot and you can move on and hopefully we can build on that. 'I don't have to prove anything. The only thing I can do is work hard and do my best and show what I am capable of on the pitch.' Mignolet was mercilessly taunted by Burnley fans with almost every touch of the ball and he did not help himself by drilling one clearance into Danny Ings and scrambling to claim the loose ball while somehow allowing a Mamadou Sakho backpass to run out for a corner before he attempted to kick it. Mignolet revealed he had been working hard in training with the goalkeeping coach and Jones . Mignolet makes a save from Burnley's Scott Arfield during their Boxing Day clash . But the goalkeeper, who has been under scrutiny all season, insists he does not hear the barracking, let alone allow it to affect him. 'I don't hear it. You get on with the game,' he said. 'When I was in the Belgian second division, sometimes I played in front of 500 people and that is a lot more difficult than when you play in a ground with atmosphere because it is more difficult to focus yourself. 'You just focus on the job in hand, saving the balls that come across you.' Everton counterpart Tim Howard last week suggested it was a long and difficult road back after being dropped, but Mignolet rejected that suggestion. 'That is his opinion - I don't have to agree with it,' he added. 'You have to deal with the game how it comes. 'I played 75 minutes and kept a clean sheet and we got three points (at Burnley). I'll see what happens in the next game.'","Simon Mignolet was dropped by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers .

"Michael Schumacher is paralysed and in a wheelchair, according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff. The 45-year-old seven-time champion cannot speak and has memory problems. Streiff, who is himself wheelchair-bound since a crash in Brazil during pre-season tests in 1989 left him a quadriplegic, was speaking on French radio. Michael Schumacher with his wife Corinna Schumacher in Madonna di Campiglio in January 2005 . The Frenchman, who is a good friend of Schumacher's, said: 'He is getting better but everything is relative. 'It's very difficult. He can't speak. Like me, he is in a wheelchair paralysed. He has memory problems and speech problems.' Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France. Schumacher (left) is a seven-time world champion and is widely regarded as the greatest F1 driver of all time . VIDEO Schumacher is paralysed but improving - Streiff . Schumacher, was transferred to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva. Official news on Schumacher, who suffered a freak ski accident in the French Alps on December 29 last year, which left him brain damaged and fighting for his life, have been scant. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. Schumacher (second right) celebrates on the podium after his 2012 Formula One Grand Prix win in Valencia . But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Corinna Schumacher (left), with brain specialist Gerard Saillant, now cares for her husband in their home . Schumacher suffered brain damage after a freak ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps last December . Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. And then on April 4, his spokeswoman Sabine Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. Ms Kehm said Streiff's comments were 'his opinions' and she therefore did not want to comment. She added: 'He did not have contact with us.' Schumacher's wife Corinna has been a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Former racing driver Philippe Streiff made the comments on French radio today . She once said: 'Michael's passion for racing is just huge, it would have been impossible without this deep passion; this passion has made him who he is. I got to know him as a racer, and I had previously always had fullest confidence in him.' He has referred to his marriage as 'total harmony', saying: 'We have the same vision of how we want to spend our lives. My wife Corinna and our harmonious family - that is my main force always at play in the background.' With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Former F1 champion suffered brain damage in December ski accident .

Kramaric's father isn't sure whether a switch to Stamford Bridge would be the best move for his son . Speaking to T Portal, he said : 'They [Chelsea] are really persistent. The thing we disagree over is Andrej's loan over the next six months. The question is where would he go on loan? We have no guarantee that he would return to Chelsea when the loan ends. 'The financial conditions wouldn't be the same if Kramaric is with the Chelsea first team or somewhere on loan. True, it's a great club, but I'm not sure if it's the right way to go.' At the start of September Chelsea had 26 youngsters and fringe players out on loan at clubs around the world.

"Southampton's Toby Alderweireld began 2014 playing alongside Diego Costa and ends it trying to shackle a player he believes is one of the best in the world. This has been quite the year for the 25-year-old, having made the loan move to Saints fresh from helping Belgium to the World Cup quarter-finals and Atletico Madrid shock the football world. Alderweireld was part of the Los Colchoneros side which won a first La Liga title in 18 years and came off the bench in the Champions League final, where rivals Real Madrid cruelly denied them a famous double. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Toby Alderweireld scored his first Premier League goal against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day . Alderweireld (right) celebrates his goal for Southampton as they cruised past Crystal Palace . It took extra-time for Real to eventually triumph and things could have been so different had star man Costa not been forced off just nine minutes into what proved his last match for Atletico. The bustling forward moved to Chelsea in the summer and has so far justified his £32million price tag, with the Boxing Day strike against West Ham making it 13 goals from his first 15 Premier League matches. Alderweireld faces the unenviable task of attempting to stop Costa adding to that tally on Sunday, with the defender well aware of the threat his former team-mate poses. 'It is very difficult because he is fast, he is strong, he has technique,' he said. Alderweireld knows all about Diego Costa (right) and Eden Hazard's qualities having payed with both . Costa scored his 13th Premier League goal of the season against West Ham on Boxing Day . 'He can score goals, is good with his head, so I have to be at my best to stop him.' Costa is not the only threat Alderweireld knows all too well about, having this year also played alongside Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis. 'They are the best players in the world, especially Diego and Eden Hazard,' he said. 'We have to be at our top to beat them.' Despite that, he says Southampton will head into the match brimming with confidence after continuing their impressive resurgence at Selhurst Park. Southampton defender Alderweireld is an international team-mate of Hazard with Belgium . Fresh from ending their worst losing streak of the 21st century against Everton, Ronald Koeman's men triumphed 3-1 against Crystal Palace thanks to goals from Sadio Mane, Ryan Bertrand and Alderweireld. 'It's the best feeling, even for a defender,' the latter said after his first Premier League goal. 'I am very, very pleased that I could help the team and after we made it 3-0 it was over, I think. 'It is always difficult to win here and play here, especially over the Christmas period. 'They need the points and we knew that before, but I think we played very good, defensively it was fantastic and in important moments we killed the game. The 25-year-old defender also played alongside Costa as Atletico Madrid won the La Liga title last season . 'It is very important after a couple of difficult weeks to win again. 'They were two difficult games, Everton and now here at Crystal Palace, but we got six out of six points, made six goals and conceded one. We are getting our confidence back.' Chelsea will be a much bigger test, though, as will having to deal with such a quick turnaround - a new issue for manager Koeman and number of his players. 'Two days after a game, play another game - that has never happened to me before,' Alderweireld added. 'I will prepare myself the best way I can and I hope to be 100 per cent for Sunday.'","Southampton welcome league leaders Chelsea to St Mary's on Sunday .

"Former Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett has revealed how country-and-western singer Dolly Parton helped to create the club's Crazy Gang image as they rose from non-league football into the First Division and a victorious FA Cup final win at Wembley. Bassett, a former Wimbledon player as well, was in charge of The Dons between 1981 and 1997 and built a team including Dennis Wise, Vinnie Jones and John Fashanu that famously beat Liverpool 1-0 at Wembley under Bobby Gould in 1988. In a programme piece written for Saturday's League Two match between AFC Wimbledon and Mansfield, Bassett makes the surprising confession that a lot of the Crazy Gang stunts he instigated in the early days, like building team morale by attending army boot camps, were inspired by the unusual source . Dave Bassett revealed a lot of team bonding exercises at Wimbledon were inspired by Dolly Parton songs . The Crazy Gang famously beat Liverpool 1-0 in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley . AFC Wimbledon supporters pictured supporting their team at the League Two play-off final . 'Our game plan was built on the words I once heard from country singer Dolly Parton,' he said. 'She was talking about appearing in films with the likes of Jane Fonda and admitted to being starstruck, and that the only way should could truly compete was to learn the lines of all the other actors, knowing she could fill in at any time. 'That struck a chord with me. It was one of the reasons we spent pre-season training at various army training camps around England and Europe. They were tough 'beasting' days, but I wanted to build characters, make players feel at ease in different surroundings. 'I also wanted bonding. I wanted mates who would rush to the rescue of mates if they ever felt they were in trouble. It was Leeds thinking again – never leave a mate behind. 'Some players saw it as a hell-hole. Steve Ketteridge hated heights, but by the end he was abseiling down mountains like a veteran. Andy Sayer hated tunnels, but in the end he was being called an underground rat. 'We sat down afterwards with army specialists and analysed the players, making sure they were not square pegs in round holes. We wanted them to feel comfortable in uncomfortable positions, so they could take this onto the field and be happy wherever and whenever they played. Bassett said songs and quotes from singer Dolly Parton gave him ideas on how to improve Wimbledon . Bassett had a contribution in appointing Neal Ardley as the current manager of Wimbledon . We also wanted character- building. I like to think we were ahead of our time. I also had every player going to Lilleshall to achieve their FA preliminary coaching badge to get a wider picture of the game. We had fun at those army training camps – and also scares. One night, Corkie (Alan Cork), Frenchie, Wally (Downes) and I were dropped off by the army in a remote part of the Mendip Hills with just a map and compass to get home. 'We soon got lost and decided to cut across a field. We were halfway across when a farmer raced out and started shouting and waving his arms and telling us to get off his land. When we ignored him, he raced back home, got his shotgun and started firing over our heads! We ran for our lives. Now that was real character- building!' Bassett is still involved in AFC who were formed after the original club moved to Milton Keynes. He helped to appoint former player Neal Ardley as the club's current manager. Ardley will lead his side into an FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool on January 5 in a rematch of the '88 final. Bassett, who won a record seven automatic promotions in his managerial career, also use his article in the programme to explain his criticisms of a BT Sport documentary called The Crazy Gang which will air on Boxing Day. In the original cut, Bassett and chairman Sam Hammam felt the programme concentrated too much on a reputation of violence and intimidation that surrounded the club and not enough of the fun. Vinnie Jones (left) of Wimbledon kisses the FA Cup as it is held by team-mate Mike Phelan (right) Vinnie Jones describes in detail an attack Fashanu launched on a team-mate though BT Sport have now edited parts of the original version. Bassett explained his connection with the club. 'Forty years ago I had a dream. I hope part of it still lives on in Wimbledon today,' he said. 'Our plan was to produce a group of young, mostly home-grown players who bought into my ideas. I am proud to say that when I left Wimbledon, the club was sixth in the table and in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the side were 13 of the 21 players who began the journey with me. Brian Gayle, Kevin Gage, Andy Thorn, Mark Morris, Wally Downes, Glyn Hodges, Paul Fishenden, Vaughan Ryan, Simon Tracey, John Gannon, Andy Sayer, Andy Clement and Dennis Wise: all take a bow. Jones (left) celebrates a Wimbledon goal that was scored by team-mate John Fashanu (right) 'There certainly wasn't the thuggery or bullying that has been depicted. I would never have tolerated that. I have also read that we flooded the opposition dressing room, ripped out toilet seats and blocked drains to make the place stink. Total and utter rubbish. 'Critics accused us sometimes of being tough, but they also forget that Spurs had Graham Roberts in their side, and there were Steve McMahon and Jimmy Case at Liverpool. Arsenal had a few that could knock you over, and so did Chelsea. You had to stand up for yourselves. 'Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, 'If we can sell Newcastle Brown to Japan and if Wimbledon can make it to the First Division, then surely no achievement is beyond our reach.' I'll settle for that legacy.'","Wimbledon's Crazy Gang  beat Liverpool 1-0 in the 1988 FA Cup final .

It has not quite got the experience but we have a lot of strength in depth and in the deeper end of the squad we have a lot of good players to step in when needed. 'That was not the case at Bolton. We had a strong 14 or 15 but nothing more than that. That is why it never lasted at Bolton, sadly.' The 60-year-old is not allowing himself to get too carried away with the club sitting in fourth going into the busy festive period.

Asked if maintaining a place in the top four was possible, Allardyce replied: 'We don’t think that is the case at the moment – we’ll cross that bridge when Christmas is over as it can all change so quickly. 'Being a manager who predicts what might or might not be is very dangerous because you get times where you don’t get beaten for six games like Alan Pardew and now he is back in losing form because of injuries, particularly with his goalkeeper. 'Likewise, Southampton have lost five on the trot. There are swings and roundabouts in this game that is all so unpredictable. There is no good spouting off what you might or might not do because it might leap back and kick you right in the goolies.'","Bolton finished seventh in 2006-07 under the stewardship of Sam Allardyce .

"The Ukip donor who helped to mastermind the stunning defection of Douglas Carswell would consider switching back to the Conservatives if Boris Johnson became leader, he said yesterday. Stuart Wheeler, the multi-millionaire former Tory stalwart who lit the fuse on the ‘Carswell coup’ over a secret lunch, would not return to the Conservatives with David Cameron as leader. But that could change if Boris took over and introduced Ukip-friendly policies. Wheeler dealer: Mr Wheeler, left, has been wining and dining disaffected Tory MPs – a process which culminated in last week’s bombshell announcement by Douglas Carswell, right, that he was defecting . Mr Wheeler, a former Tory donor who was expelled from the party in 2009 after diverting his funding to Ukip, has been wining and dining disaffected Tory MPs – a process which culminated in last week’s bombshell announcement. One senior Tory, Mr Wheeler now reveals, was even wooed by being invited to his 17th Century Jacobean castle. Dan Hannan, an MEP socially and ideologically close to Mr Carswell, has stayed at the Grade I listed Chilham Castle in Kent where Mr Wheeler lives with wife Tessa and their three daughters, including the Vogue model Jacquetta. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Wheeler explained how he had held court with ‘potential defectors’ at discreet lunch venues. ‘I wrote to about ten Eurosceptic Tory MPs saying “Would you like to have lunch with me? Just the two of us, an out-of-the-way restaurant, we won’t be seen. The only other person who will know is Nigel”. And Douglas was one of them.’ He dined with Mr Carswell two years ago at Central London’s Pearl restaurant, which food critics say offers a ‘sensual dining experience’ involving dishes such as scallops, squid  and lamb Wellington. Conditions: Multi-millionaire Mr Wheeler said that he would not return to the Conservatives with David Cameron as leader. But that could change if Boris, right, took over and introduced Ukip-friendly policies . Guest: Dan Hannan, an MEP socially and ideologically close to Mr Carswell, has stayed at the Grade I listed Chilham Castle in Kent where Mr Wheeler lives with wife Tessa and their three daughters . ‘We discussed everything to do with the EU and Cameron’s leadership,’ said Mr Wheeler.  ‘I don’t think I said “How about defecting?” but I would have said “Would you like to meet Nigel Farage?” And now he has. ‘My guess is that he only made his final decision a fortnight ago.’ Mr Wheeler, 79, who made his £90 million fortune in the spread betting industry, refuses to divulge the names of the other MPs he lunched – including two he believes are ‘close to’ following Mr Carswell in defecting – but he is an admirer of former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis and rebellious Tory MP Jesse Norman. In Vogue: Ukip donor Stuart Wheeler's daughter Jacquetta . He invited former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, but the peer declined on the grounds that it would ‘not be appropriate’. Mr Wheeler said: ‘There are a lot of Tories I admire. An MEP I greatly admire is Dan Hannan. He has been to stay with me in Kent,’ said Mr Wheeler, adding that he couldn’t remember what was discussed but: ‘I am sure we discussed the EU and everything like that’. Mr Hannan stated last week that he did not intend to defect to Ukip. No 10 is furious with Mr Wheeler, arguing that his ‘turncoat’ actions are helping to split the right-wing vote and could allow Ed Miliband to win next year’s General Election. But Mr Wheeler refutes their analysis. ‘I don’t think it is going to be like that. Labour is terrified of us. There are a lot of Labour constituencies, particularly in the North, where we are a close second and the Tories are a long way behind – it would be greatly to the advantage of the Tories if we take the seat. So I don’t think it is likely to let Labour in, as the Tories are so keen to put about’. What could the Tories do to persuade him to return to the fold and bring Ukip voters with him? ‘Well, perhaps if Mr Cameron said “You are right, Stuart, we should be campaigning to leave the EU and introduce grammar schools and I was wrong about climate change [existing]”. ‘But that’s something which is undoubtedly not going to happen. And I think I would prefer not to have David Cameron as a leader either.’ He sees an obvious, stand-out alternative. ‘Boris Johnson would be best for getting votes. However, him being leader is not enough in itself – if Boris introduced those policies [on the EU, grammar schools and climate change] then I should think there would quite likely be a deal between the Conservatives and Ukip. But that is not going to happen’. The businessman said he also rates former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and Jesse Norman as potential Tory leaders. Mr Wheeler –  who added that he regards Mr Carswell as a potential future Ukip leader – knows that the ‘Carswell coup’ has caused panic in No 10. ‘We have got them rattled,’ he said. ‘They should be rattled.’","Stuart Wheeler lit the fuse on the 'Carswell coup' over a secret lunch .

"Penguins have long been studied for the way they behave in colonies, their mating patterns and relationships. But their squawks and calls have only ever been identified at a basic level. For the first time, researchers in Italy studied 48 African penguins to not only discover they make six distinct calls  – they were also able to identify these sounds in context. Scroll down for video . Researchers from Italy studied the vocalisations of African penguins (pictured). This included 32 adults and 16 chicks at Zoom zoo in Torino, Italy. They discovered four distinct calls in adults, and two in chicks, including display songs, contact calls and begging ‘peeps’ and moans . Bird calls are made through the syrinx, which differs from the mammalian larynx. In particular, the syrinx is at the base of the trachea, while the mammalian larynx sits above it. The syrinx is made of two parts and the sound is made by an independent set of muscles, alongside membranes that sit and vibrate on the right and left sides of the syrinx. Unlike mammalian vocal folds, this means many birds, including penguins, can produce two independent sounds at the same time. For example, the ecstatic display song is made of various ranges and sounds. The researchers, led by Dr Livio Favaro from the University of Turin, collected, categorised, and acoustically analysed hundreds of audio and video vocal recordings. All were taken from a captive colony of 48 penguins at the Zoom zoo in Torino, Italy. This group was made up of 15 males, 17 females, eight juveniles aged between three and 12 months, and eight nesting chicks. The results revealed that all the penguins have four essential vocalisations: a contact call emitted by isolated birds, an agonistic call used to signal aggression, an ecstatic display song uttered by single birds during the breeding season, and a mutual display song made by pairs at their nests. The authors also identified two distinct vocalisations interpreted as begging calls by chicks, in the form of a begging ‘peep’, and a begging moan. The results revealed four basic vocalisations: a contact call emitted by isolated birds, an agonistic call used during aggression, an ecstatic display song used during breeding, and a mutual display song made by pairs at their nests. The authors also identified  a begging ‘peep’ and moan among the chicks . ‘The African penguin is a highly social and vocal seabird. However, currently available descriptions of the vocal repertoire of African Penguin are mostly limited to basic descriptions of calls,’ said the researchers in the journal PLOS One. ‘Here we provide, for the first time, a detailed description of the vocal behaviour of this species by collecting audio and video recordings from a large captive colony. ‘Establishing a comprehensive classification of bird vocalisations is important, it allows comparisons between species and individuals, and also contributes to planning effective management and conservation strategies. ‘Indeed, vocalisations have the potential to provide a variety of information about bird sex, age, behavioural state, condition, and relationships with surrounding animals.’ Contact call . The contact call is a short call consisting of a single sound. The vocalisation has a clear harmonic structure and during the call, the beak is half-open and the bird stands up, extending the neck upwards as much as possible. It is made by chicks and adults of both sexes. Agonistic call . Similar to the contact call, the agonistic call is a short single utterance that shows a clear harmonic structure. During the call, the birds stand up and extend the neck towards the recipient of the aggression. Ecstatic display song . The ecstatic display song is the longest  and loudest vocalisation. Penguins make this sound resting with their feet apart, their neck and beak facing upward, and their wings positioned horizontally. The song is composed of a sequence of vocal syllables combined in a phrase. It begins with a sequence of short syllables  during which the keeled sternum moves upwards and downwards and culminates with the emission of a long syllable  during which the sternum remains upwards. These spectrums reveal the different vocalisations. Contact call is shown at (a), agonistic call (b), ecstatic display song (c: arrows indicate short initial syllables 1, longest syllable 2, inspiration syllable 3), mutual display song (d), begging moan (e), begging peep (f) Mutual display song . This call begins with pulsed noises and ends with a clear low-pitched harmonic structure. All the while, the penguin's body is horizontal, the neck is extended as much as possible, and the beak is wide open. Begging moan . The begging moan was only emitted by juveniles and featured a clear harmonic structure and a short duration. Juvenile penguins emitted long sequences of one to 10 begging moans, but they immediately stopped calling when they were fed, or when the parent moved away. During the calls, juveniles performed quick lateral movement with their heads. Begging peep . The peep is a begging call emitted by chicks  inside the nest. The average duration of a single peep recorded in this study was only 0.36 seconds but this call was repeated by chicks in long sequences lasting for several minutes, until they were fed. The peep is a high-pitched vocalisation, up to 17 kHz. The calls are made through what’s called the syrinx, which differs from the mammalian larynx. In particular, the syrinx is at the base of the trachea, while the mammalian larynx sits above it. The syrinx is made of two parts - an independent set of muscles, and membranes at the right and left sides. Unlike mammalian vocal folds, this means many birds, including penguins, can produce two independent signals at the same time. Since the colony is captive, the authors said they can’t be sure they've identified all possible vocalisations, but suggest this analysis helps to standardise the known sounds. This chart reveals the six distinctive sounds recorded from the penguin colony. It plots where they sit in terms of discriminant function analysis (DFA). DFA is a statistical way of grouping objects together and predicting patterns. The mutual display song, agnostic call and begging moan overlap, but the begging peep is distinctive .","Researchers from Italy studied the vocalisations of African penguins .

"Brendan Rodgers insists he had not lost faith in Simon Mignolet as he backed the Belgian to return a better goalkeeper from his spell out of the side. Liverpool's manager took the decision to remove Mignolet from his starting line-up for an 'indefinite' period ahead of the trip to Manchester United earlier this month after his performance levels dipped. Brad Jones has taken over between the posts and Liverpool would certainly be in the market to add a goalkeeper in January if the right option became available. They have been linked with Petr Cech once more but Rodgers would not comment on his plans for the impending transfer window. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet was dropped for his side's match against Manchester United . Brad Jones has started Liverpool's last three games following Brendan Rodgers' decision to drop Mignolet . What Rodgers was eager to stress, though, was the fact Mignolet has not been frozen out and he expects the spell on the sidelines to enable the 26-year-old to regather his focus and be sharp once he decides the time is right to bring him back in. 'In terms of Brad, he has come into the team. When called upon during my time here, he has done very well,' said Rodgers. 'He is a very loyal goalkeeper. When he is asked to come in he does very well. Simon's response has been fantastic. His training has been really good. That time coming out of the team can do you good. We have been looking at the areas that he can improve. 'Sometimes that little period out can help. Brad is in the team at the moment. The one thing that impresses me is he is consistent all the way through. You need your No 2 to be loyal. He comes in and does his work religiously. 'He is a wonderful professional so when he comes in he does his work really well. Simon has been very impressive in how he has responded. I haven't lost any belief in him. He is still a top goalkeeper.' Rodgers heaped praise on Mignolet's professionalism and refused to comment on Chelsea's Petr Cech . Rodgers, who has revealed Liverpool will look to lay a new Desso pitch at Anfield in the summer, is urging his players to finish 2014 with a run of victories that will enable them to attack the second half of the campaign. He is adamant Liverpool can bridge a nine point deficit and qualify for the Champions League, especially now they have a system in place that is allowing them to attack. When asked how he will look back on 2014, Rodgers said: 'We had a wonderful end to the season, we got better and better and exceeded expectations as we nearly won the league. The summer was busy and we lost a top player. 'The opening to this season has been less than impressive but there have been reasons. Our performance level is starting to return. We now want to finish the year with a number of wins so we can go on and attack the second half of the season. 'We are at our best when our game is aggressive. We needed to get some results after we had played against Crystal Palace. We needed to steady the ship and it was about finding a solution. We have seen that. We now have a platform to dominate the ball.' Liverpool travel to Burnley on Boxing Day. They will be without the injured Dejan Lovren, Joe Allen and Glen Johnson as well as the suspended Fabio Borini but Mario Balotelli will return to the squad after a serving a one-match ban.

"Bones belonging to a giant penguin that existed 37 to 40 million years ago have been unearthed by palaeontologists. The latest findings have enabled researchers to conclude that the so-called 'colossus penguin' was bigger than any penguin that came before or after it. The species known as Palaeeudyptes klekowskii measured a staggering 6.63 feet (2.02 metres) from the tip of its beak to its toes, making it bigger even than the modern emperor penguin. Bones belonging to an extinct giant penguin have been found in Antarctica. They suggest a species existed that was once up to 6.63ft (2.02m) in length. Pictured are various views of the humerus (A to E) and tarsometatarsus (F-K) that were found, the latter of which was used to measure its size . The find was made at Seymour Island, part of a chain of islands off the Antarctic peninsula. Researchers, led by Dr Livio Favaro from the University of Turin, collected, categorised, and acoustically analysed hundreds of audio and video vocal recordings from penguins. All were taken from a captive colony of 48 African penguins at the Zoom zoo in Torino, Italy. This group was made up of 15 males, 17 females, eight juveniles aged between three and 12 months, and eight nesting chicks. The results revealed that all the penguins have four essential vocalisations: a contact call emitted by isolated birds, an agonistic call used to signal aggression, an ecstatic display song uttered by single birds during the breeding season, and a mutual display song made by pairs at their nests. The authors also identified two distinct vocalisations interpreted as begging calls by chicks, in the form of a begging ‘peep’, and a begging moan. According to Dr Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche of the La Plata Museum in Argentina this region was much warmer 37 to 40 million years ago. It was ‘a wonderful time for penguins, when 10 to 14 species lived together along the Antarctic coast,’ she told New Scientist. Dr Hospitaleche found the most complete skeleton of the colossus penguin earlier this year, but these latest finds include part of a wing, the humerus, and the joint between the ankle and foot bone, known as the tarsometatarsus. Although the humerus cannot be used to make estimates of a penguin’s size and mass, the tarsometatarsus is usable in this regard. At 3.6 inches (9.1 centimetres) in length, this tarsometatarsus set a record for penguins and led Dr Hospitaleche to conclude that the penguin stood 5.25 feet (1.6 metres) tall from head to toe - and 6.63 feet (2.02 metres) tall if its beak was extended upwards. This makes it larger than any penguin known to exist, even the emperor penguin that exists today. At 3.6 inches (9.1 centimetres) in length, this tarsometatarsus set a record for penguins and led Dr Hospitaleche to conclude that the penguin stood 5.25 feet (1.6 metres) tall from head to toe. Shown is a size comparison to an average adult male and three species of penguin alive today . The find was made on a chain of islands off the tip of the Antarctic peninsula known as Seymour Island .

On the right, this pigeon skeleton illustration shows at number 8 where the left and right tarsometatarsus are found on birds . The skeletal data also indicates the colossus penguin would have weighed more than 115 kilograms (250 pounds) - more than twice the weight of an average emperor penguin. Its huge size also meant it was probably able to stay underwater for at least 40 minutes. ‘According to estimates, the tarsometatarsus would belong to the largest and most massive penguin described so far,’ the researchers write in their paper. ‘This bird was probably a piscivorous [fish-eating] penguin, with high diving ability for catching prey.’ This illustration shows what Palaeeudyptes klekowskii might have looked like.

"Writhing on stage to Warrant's sleazy hit Cherry Pie, Duke porn star Belle Knox made her debut last night as a stripper in New York City. Adding erotic dancing to her burgeoning resume of 30+ pornographic movies , Belle Knox - whose real name is Miriam Weeks - claimed to have watched YouTube stripping videos to practice beforehand. Dressed in a suggestive school-girl-style plaid mini skirt, bra and of course, stilettos, the 18-year-old shed her clothes at Manhattan's HeadQuarters gentleman's club, telling her ever-growing band of followers she was apprehensive but sure she would find it 'empowering'.

Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body . 'I’ve never stripped before. I’m nervous,' said the women's studies major as she giggled prior to her debut. Losing her bra and skirt on stage during her routine, Weeks snaked through her sexiest moves at around 10.30 pm last night for the enjoyment of the patrons of the Hells Kitchen club. 'I chose the song Cherry Pie. It’s young, it’s cute, it’s fun to dance to,' said Knox to the New York Post before her five-minute dance. 'I’m still shocked that I have fans.

"Tottenham continued a happy pattern of results with Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen both scoring again to heap more misery on Nigel Pearson’s Leicester, who have now gone 13 games without a win. Walthamstow’s finest and the man from Middelfart, Denmark, have scored one apiece in three of Spurs’ last four Barclays Premier League away games, going on to win 2-1 each time. As the sequence often goes, Kane scores, then Eriksen seals all three points — even on occasions like this when Spurs possibly don’t deserve it. It happened at Hull first, then Swansea and this game unfolded accordingly with Kane netting the opener before Leonardo Ulloa grabbed one back for the home side.

I’m happy for the team, too. It was a very important three points from a difficult game.’ For vast swathes of the second half Leicester dominated but lacked a final devastating touch. Pearson, whose side are now six points from safety, is aware of the ominous statistic that only two sides have escaped relegation after being bottom at Christmas. He was Bryan Robson’s assistant in 2005 when West Bromwich Albion secured Premier League survival on the final day of the season, a feat since nicknamed the Great Escape. ‘It’s not Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, there’s no one answer,’ said Pearson this week after being asked what Leicester needed to do to avoid relegation. He might first look at bolstering his strike force. ‘I’m not digging my head in the sand, we’re in trouble,’ he said. ‘But performances like this would suggest we have capabilities to turn things around. We certainly had them defending pretty desperately at times.

Kane did not bowl anyone over with his ability when he spent a short time at Leicester in 2013. The striker spent the majority of his loan spell watching from the bench, scoring just twice in three months. It took only 58 seconds for him to prove to the King Power Stadium crowd he is much improved since then. Now a focal point of Tottenham’s campaign, the 21-year-old’s opener in the first minute was his 15th in 23 games. Only Sergio Aguero boasts more this season. Kane, who was heavily taunted by Foxes fans, looked like a player riding on the wave of confidence when Nacer Chadli’s ball found him in the box inside one minute. He controlled with his right foot and slotted it past Ben Hamer with his left. But he was left holding his head in his hands just before half time when he missed a gilt-edged opportunity to as good as seal all three points for his side, wasting a free header from six yards out by somehow steering the ball wide of the post. His opposite number Ulloa could sympathise — the Argentine failed to capitalise on two good chances in the first half. First Danny Drinkwater slotted a neat ball through but the striker wasted a delicate first touch by scuffing his effort well wide. Then Riyad Mahrez played a pinpoint ball into the six-yard box, but Ulloa’s diving header bounced off the inside of the post. Ulloa finally got the leveller in the 49th minute, after a ball into the box by Mahrez. There was justice for Ulloa, who was being grabbed around his chest by Federico Fazio. Despite that, Ulloa managed to direct the ball past Hugo Lloris at the near post. Spurs' Danny Rose (front) goes down under the tackle of Leicester defender Danny Simpson .

It looked like Mahrez, who was probably Leciester’s best player, might put his side ahead when his sweetly struck dipping free-kick from 22 yards out evaded the wall but bounced off the crossbar. Eriksen popped up with the winner in the 70th minute. Kane won a free-kick on the left-hand side of the box and Eriksen’s curling effort bounced awkwardly and sneaked past Hamer at the near post. Mahrez troubled Spurs again in the 88th minute when his superb effort saw Lloris palm the ball into the path of Jeffrey Schlupp, who couldn’t get his shot away. Mahrez and Schlupp were excellent but Pearson is without both for six weeks when they are away for the Africa Cup of Nations. Another blow for the struggling manager.

"A baby bird in California has made history after becoming the world’s first penguin to be conceived using artificial insemination. The unnamed female Magellanic penguin was hatched in May at SeaWorld California after sperm was frozen and then thawed. The 12-week-old penguin was hand-reared at the attraction’s Penguin Encounter nursery, but is now feeding on fish. Scroll down for video . The female Megallanic penguin (pictured) hatched in May. Although she doesn't have an official name, she is referred to as 184. She was conceived using frozen semen that had been thawed, and is now 12 weeks old . Although she doesn't have an official name, she is referred to as 184. She has now joined other Magellanic penguin chicks that were conceived naturally at the attraction. Magellanic penguins are typically found around the Falkland Islands and South America. They are also known as jackass penguins. Their name comes from the Strait of Magellan in South America. They grow to around 27 inches (70cm), and have an average weight of 8.8lbs (4kg). In the wild, adults begin the breeding process in September, by building a nest, before laying an egg in mid October. Incubation takes around 40 days. When the chick is 30 days old, they should have developed their plumage, and are encouraged to leave the nest. There are said to be around 1.8 million breeding pairs of Magellanic penguins around the world. Researchers are hoping to use these artificial insemination techniques to increase the genetic diversity of penguin species, and learn more about their biology. This research could then be used to sustain, or improve, penguin populations around the world. After the bird hatched, she was fed a special formula of ground herring fillets, krill, minerals, vitamins and water five times a day during the first four weeks. The scientific first is the result of a decade of research by Dr. Todd Robeck, SeaWorld’s vice President of Theriogenology, and Dr. Justine O’Brien, the reproductive centre’s Scientific Director. Dr. Justine O’Brien said: ‘The goal of our research centre is to study a species’ reproductive biology, to learn as much as we can about that, and use this to not only monitor the health of not only our zoological populations but wild populations as well. Researchers are hoping to use these artificial insemination techniques (pictured) to increase the genetic diversity of penguin species, and learn more about their biology. This research could then be used to sustain, or improve, penguin populations around the world . ‘We have also use this information to develop system reproductive technologies such as artificial insemination and semen preservation. ‘These technologies are important conservation tools as they allow us to maximise the genetic diversity of these populations and ensure there’s sustainability into the long term.’ For more than 30 years, SeaWorld San Diego has run a successful penguin breeding program. Since 1980, more than 600 penguin chicks have been hatched and raised at the marine park, including the first-ever chinstrap and emperor penguins.

"Parents, fear not: another shipment of merchandise for Disney mega-hit Frozen is on its way to the UK. Disney has confirmed more clothing, dolls and soft toys based on the blockbuster animated musical has been ordered to deal with the shortage in British shops. It follows the runaway success of the film which, despite a lukewarm response from critics, has become a massive hit among children. Out of stock: Clothing, dolls and soft toys based on the blockbuster animated musical Frozen have sold out. Pictured here is a teenage Elsa the Snow Queen, voiced by Maia Mitchell . That, of course, meant the inevitable demands followed for toys and costumes like Elsa's shimmering blue dress or Anna's caped ensemble and plaited wig. But demand became so high both sides of the Atlantic that Disney started selling out as stock ran low. Disney even had to impose quotas on some of the . merchandise to create an 'equitable way' to buy the most popular . stuffed animals and dolls. Shoppers on the Disney website can put only . one of the £15 Elsa and Anna dolls in their basket and in the U.S. some . stores have even been running lotteries to buy the products. In the UK, as Frozen-mania gripped Britain's schoolchildren, Disney admitted that the industry had underestimated the film's success. Now, Disney says relief is on the way.

Dresses based on Disney's mega-hit Frozen have been selling on eBay for £600 . At the end of March a post on UK parenting forum Mumsnet showed the extent of . the problem. User olafthesnowman wrote: 'I need desperate help . mumsnetters!' before explaining that the only place to find an Elsa . dress costume in size 7 to 8 was on eBay, where the £18 dress was selling . for upwards of £80. The post received several replies, with users saying . they had found 'Frozen stuff a nightmare to get hold of'. And while Disney Elsa costumes are selling for as much as £600 on eBay and more than 25 bids on some lots, costume-makers are jumping on the bandwagon to create their own Frozen-inspired outfits for young fans at the price of up to £100. Online marketplace Amazon tells a similar story, with dresses on sale for more than £150. 'The popularity of Frozen has been . phenomenal,' a Disney UK spokesman told The Observer. 'We are thrilled that . audiences have connected with the characters and story in the way that . they have and we are working hard to keep bringing additional product . into stores as quickly as possible.' On the Mumsnet website, members regularly swap intelligence on how to track down the coveted 'Elsa dress'. While on eBay, sellers are making a healthy profits flogging products for as much as £600.

The only clothing I could find was a T-shirt in Tesco that I bought in desperation in the end!' Frozen, based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, is officially a blockbuster franchise after it overtook Toy Story 3 in March to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1 billion (£644.5 million) at the box office. It was in the UK box office top 10 for more than three months and now ranks as the 10th highest grossing film in cinema history. Despite a lukewarm critical response, the film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 13 consecutive weeks. A Broadway musical is also now in development.","Disney confirms more clothing, dolls and soft toys are on their way .

"Facelifts can be the object of derision - with many people seeing them as vanity, even if they do have the desired rejuvenating effect. But for Jackie Phillips, the operation represented the closing chapter in her battle with skin cancer which ate away part of her cheek and half  of her nose. The 67-year-old feels transformed after state-of-the-art surgery took years off her appearance. Not only has her jawline been tightened  but her face, which was left lopsided despite reconstructive surgery, has been evened up, with fat suctioned from her tummy, then injected into her cheeks. Jackie Pillips, 67, feels transformed after state-of-the-art surgery took years off her appearance . Recalling the terrifying hours before surgeons first operated to remove the cancer, Jackie says: 'They said they didn't know whether they would have to remove half or all of my nose. 'I'm not proud of my looks but I challenge anyone to be told this and not feel desperately worried. I know I was one of the lucky ones - when I woke up from the operation, at least I was alive. You draw your reserves from that. In the end, I felt huge relief that they hadn't taken my whole nose.' Jackie was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a slow-growing form of skin cancer, in her right nostril after her dentist expressed concern about blistering inside her nose. What Jackie had thought was a small, painless blackhead - which had been there for  six or seven years - started to bubble up and blister. Her GP referred her to a private consultant, who immediately recognised it  as a sign of cancer. Like most skin cancers, BCCs are triggered by sun exposure, and Jackie believes she  and her 73-year-old husband Howard's hobby of travelling the world in open-top cars may have been to blame. The couple, who now live on the Isle of Man, retired in 1997 after selling their business, a firm that designed and manufactured food-processing equipment. BCCs don't respond to chemotherapy, so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options . After a six-hour operation to remove the cancer at Winterbourne Hospital in Dorset, surgeons discovered the carcinoma had burrowed upwards through the muscle and fat in her cheek, beside her nose, and the main root was found dangerously close to the outside corner of her right eye. BCCs don't respond to chemotherapy, so radiotherapy or surgery are the only treatment options. 'A round hole more than 1in in diameter on my cheek was taken away,' says Jackie. 'They stretched skin from my cheek over to close it up. The lower portion of my right nostril was removed and I had further work carried out the following year to improve this.' She was initially pleased with the cosmetic result. But the right side of her face had a tighter appearance than the left, and she  lost the normal groove down the right-hand side of her nose. As time went on, her face began to appear more and more uneven. 'I hated having my photo taken and even avoided looking in the mirror as much as possible,' Jackie adds. Last year she sought help from Kevin Hancock, who works at the Private Patient Unit of the Noble's Hospital in Douglas on the  Isle of Man. He says: 'Jackie had been left with a significant deformity. She asked me to improve the symmetry of her face, but we can do better than that.' Mr Hancock began by releasing the scar tissue from Jackie's original operation to make it less tight and carried out the lower facelift, making several incisions starting in the hairline above her ear and going down around her ear. Then about 150ml of fat was suctioned from Jackie's abdomen, and centrifuged to remove blood and oil. The remaining 50ml of fat was injected into her cheeks. Mr Hancock says: 'Traditional facelift surgery tightens and pulls up but doesn't restore volume lost in the face. Fat filling creates a fuller, younger-looking face.' Jackie says: 'I looked like a Cabbage Patch Doll when I first came round, but Kevin had warned me that this would be the case. 'They put in twice as much fat as you really need because your body absorbs a lot of it, so I was very puffy and bruised.' Demand for cosmetic procedures has increased but for cancer patients, survival is the priority . Three weeks later, her face had settled down and Jackie was delighted. 'It's a massive turnaround from thinking I would always be unhappy with my appearance to feeling like I look the best I ever have,' she says. 'My husband is just happy that I'm happy.' Because of the extra time, equipment and expertise involved, Jackie's procedure costs about 25 per cent extra on top of the price of a normal facelift, and patients can expect to pay about £7,000 or more for the surgery. The latest figures from the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons showed that demand for cosmetic procedures, including facelifts and fat-filling like Jackie's, increased by more than ten per  cent in the past year. But for patients in the immediate aftermath of a cancer diagnosis, survival is the priority. 'We'd never carry out this sort of facelift surgery at the same time as removing a cancer as we wouldn't want to compromise the cancer treatment,' says Mr Hancock, who also carries out facial reconstruction for  skin cancer patients on the NHS. 'With skin cancer it's obviously important  to cut it out completely and leave a safety zone around it to make sure it doesn't  come back. 'With someone's back or tummy you have loads of slack, but if what you're cutting out is on someone's face, you're going to leave a  big hole. 'The most important thing is to treat the skin cancer properly. But it's important that patients know it isn't simply a choice between survival and being left disfigured.'","Jackie Pillips, 67, had basal cell carcinoma, slow-growing skin cancer .

"What a derby! Three great penalty claims, one red card, perhaps two others missed and a superb winning goal. So many questions were asked of referee Michael Oliver that his head will be buzzing well into the week as he analyses what he got right and what he should work on. The penalties . 1. Marouane Fellaini on Sergio Aguero (42mins) - A clear penalty as the Belgian kicked the Manchester City forward on the Achilles from behind. For  Felliaini to then turn and have a go at  Aguero was disgraceful. There were some suggestions on Twitter that Fellaini spat at Aguero as he lay on the turf. However, it looked like saliva falling from his mouth as he shouted at the striker. Marouane Fellaini appeared to catch Sergio Aguero from behind in the penalty area . The Argentine striker falls to the ground after the makeshift defender clips the back of his ankle . Fellaini had some choice words for Aguero after he remained on the deck following the tackle . 2. Marcos Rojo on Yaya Toure (45mins) - Right on half-time a fascinating challenge as Toure was played clean through, but Rojo made a last-ditch lunge and appeared to kick the ball away from between Toure’s legs. From Oliver’s central position, while Rojo’s follow-through certainly caught Toure, it was almost impossible to determine if he caught the Ivorian before he played the ball. As doubt existed, Oliver was right not to give the penalty. Had it been a foul, it would have been a red card as well. Yaya Toure got the wrong side of Marcos Rojo before the defender caught him from behind . Rojo was attempting to clearer but Toure got his body between himself and the ball . Toure was sure it was a penalty, which surely would have resulted in a second sending off for United . 3. Michael Carrick on Aguero (61mins) - Makeshift centre-half Carrick was drawn into tripping Aguero as the brilliant Argentine weaved across the penalty area. Ten years ago, almost to the day (November 7) I reffed a Manchester derby at Old Trafford and denied a host of penalty claims for the home side. Sir Alex Ferguson waited in the tunnel and after berating me claimed that ‘to get a penalty my player would have had to be felled with an axe!’ I guess Manuel Pelligrini must feel the same. The red cards (that were... and weren't) 1. Chris Smalling (39mins) - The one red card that was issued is beyond dispute: Smalling’s first yellow card was a routine one, but not mandatory, when he raised his leg to stop Joe Hart kicking the ball from hand. The second yellow was for a poorly timed tackle on James Milner which was as clear a caution as you could see. No choice for the referee but to send him off. 2. Joe Hart (31mins) - The City keeper could have been red carded when, for some inexplicable reason, he raced out of his goal to challenge Oliver over a decision. Hart appeared to overrun and get too close to the referee. His head appeared to go down and into Oliver’s face (below) which left the referee the option to dismiss. Joe Hart approaches Michael Oliver near the half-way line after being incensed by Smalling's block on him . 3. Marcos Rojo - If the Yaya Toure incident was a foul, then a red card would have had to follow for the United defender. Perhaps it was this fact which swayed Oliver into ignoring the penalty claims and blowing for half-time instead. Marcos Rojo had a day to forget at the Etihad, going off injured in the second-half after struggling . The lessons . 1. Be brave - Give penalties even in the furnace that is a Manchester derby. In the case of Fellaini and Aguero, if you don’t give the penalty, you need to deal with the aftermath. Fellaini could have been booked for raging in Aguero’s face, but Oliver just ran away from the scene. You have to deal with behaviour like that or it can escalate. 2. Get wide – You see contact better from side on and too many referees are lazy and stay central due to the pace of the modern game. 3. Use advantage wisely - Yes, it’s good to let the game flow but there is a balance. Those who are fouled can feel aggrieved and seek retribution. We saw this happen on a number of occasions after Wayne Rooney and Toure had been fouled. Referee Oliver rode his luck as the penalty decisions didn’t affect City winning the game . At the final whistle Oliver appeared to breathe a sigh of relief and smiled. He knows that he rode his luck as the penalty decisions didn’t affect City winning the game. He is a promising referee who is being pushed ahead of the controversial Mark Clattenburg, but he is by no means the finished article yet.","There were three big penalty claims at the Etihad Stadium .
Marouane Fellaini brought Sergio Aguero down but nothing was given .
Chris Smalling's sending off wasn't in doubt, but Joe Hart and Marcos Rojo risked more dismissals in City's 1-0 win .
Referee Michael Oliver rode his luck on occasion in the derby ."
"Christmas, they say, is a time for reflection. At 3.01pm, Steve Bruce wore the horrified look of a beaten man left to wonder where it had all gone wrong, and if it would ever go right again. Curtis Davies, his captain no less, had just gift-wrapped Sunderland’s opening goal inside 30 seconds and his side were staring at an 11th league match without victory. Then, though, came a hearty helping of festive fortune; two home penalties denied and an equalising goal – against the run of play – which only looped into the back of the net thanks to a Stadium of Light divot after Gaston Ramirez had taken aim from 25 yards. Hull City defender James Chester (left) scores their second goal against Sunderland at The Stadium of Light . Chester's header flies past Sunderland keeper Costel Pantilimon and into the roof of the net in the 51st minute . James Chester headed the visitors in front after half-time and Nikica Jelavic made certain of their first away win since the opening day of the season in stoppage-time. Bruce’s luck was in and his side were out of the bottom three. And, after his fourth straight victory over the club who sacked him three years ago, the Geordie reflected: ‘We needed a victory. I take no real pleasure in that it’s four straight wins here. But the vast majority might just have a little look and think “he didn’t do a bad job here after all”. 'People say I'm a black and white (Newcastle fan), well today I'm pleased to be.' It had been a nightmare start when Davies' blunder allowed Johnson to score. ‘Sometimes there is no hiding place,’ said Bruce. ‘It was awful, a horrible mistake. After that it would have been easy to capitulate. It took us about 20 minutes to settle but after that the best team won at a canter.’ Sunderland winger Adam Johnson  rounds goalkeeper Allan McGregor to score the opening goal against Hull City .

Gus Poyet, meanwhile, had urged his team to build on the euphoria of last weekend’s win at Newcastle and, when Tyne-Wear derby hero Johnson punished Davies’ error to put them in front, he must have thought victory was theirs. Complacency, though, was to prove their undoing, as was the failure of Andre Marriner to award a penalty when both Alex Bruce and Stephen Quinn handled inside the area. Poyet fumed: ‘It was one of the worst afternoons in terms of decisions. ‘You don’t need to ask if they were penalties. I’ve got a great life and I’m not going to give the FA a penny. ‘But we had the perfect start and didn’t take advantage of that. ‘Until the penalty incidents it was a normal game. After the penalty incidents the game changed completely. Johnson slides the ball into the net to put Sunderland ahead in the Premier League clash on Boxing Day . Hull went into the match without a win in 10 games and were behind after a minute following a defensive lapse . Johnson followed his late winner against Newcastle by grabbing an early goal against Hull on Boxing Day . ‘The atmosphere inside the stadium and the emotion of the players changed, it was strange. We spent too much energy thinking why they were not given. ‘But I was disappointed with the second-half performance.’ Of the penalty appeals, Bruce said: ‘For me, the referee has got them right. Quinn had his hand protecting his face. When it’s that close how are you supposed to get out the way? The referee showed common sense.’ Davies, though, had threatened to ruin Bruce’s return to Wearside. It was a day too late for the Own Goals and Gaffs stocking filler, but the skipper made a late entry for defensive howler of the year. Having rolled his backpass hopelessly short, he had a chance to spare further embarrassment by swiping the ball to the stands. Instead, however, he attempted to shepherd possession back to Allan McGregor and was very quickly robbed by Johnson. He duly rounded McGregor – whose indecision was in part culpable to the farcical concession – and slotted into the empty net. Bruce’s face told its own sorry story. Sunderland should have doubled their lead with the visitors shaken but the closest they came was when Seb Larsson fired on goal from Johnson’s pullback only for Liam Rosenior to slide and deflect wide. Gaston Ramirez's shot skipped up off a divot and looped into the back of the net in the 33rd minute . Gaston Ramirez (right) of Hull City celebrates his equaliser against Sunderland with team-mate David Meyler . Ramirez (second left) is congratulated by Hull manager Steve Bruce after scoring the equaliser at Sunderland . Then came the equaliser. Ramirez drifted infield and dispatched low towards the bottom corner. Costel Pantilimon had it covered, or so he thought, and the big Romanian was helpless as the ball skipped up off a divot and into the net. Bruce needed luck on his side twice more before the break as well. Johnson strode into the area from the right and when his dribble was cut short by the hand of Bruce, the 44,817 inside the stadium expected Marriner to point to the spot. He didn’t. Two minutes later and the whistler was refusing the hosts another penalty when Quinn’s palm blocked Jordi Gomez’s cross, albeit from point-blank range. Bruce junior then bailed out his dad with a goal-line clearance from Larsson’s header and McGregor shovelled Santiago Vergini’s near-post blast around the upright. Half-time was a welcome arrival for the Tigers chief but whatever he said during the interval served as inspiration for his side and they were ahead on 52 minutes. Ramirez swung over his corner from the right and Chester escaped Sebastian Coates to flash home his first since the opening day of the season. The hosts offered nothing in response and substitute Jelavic made sure of the points as he broke clear before tucking beneath Pantilimon in stoppage-time. Bruce, at last, was reflecting on victory.","Steve Bruce's men were behind within 30 seconds after Adam Johnson punished Curtis Davies' calamitous error .

"In the latest instalment of his weekly column, chief sports writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver... WHAT'S HOT . Mob justice . Ten days ago, Sheffield United announced convicted rapist Ched Evans would be training with them, as he bids to restart his career in football, following his rape conviction. Dismissing those that considered this unwise, the club issued a high-minded statement: 'In a nation of laws, served by an elected parliament and duly constituted courts of law, there can be no place for ""mob justice"".' On Thursday, following the resignation of several club patrons and sponsors, widespread disgust and Jessica Ennis-Hill's statement that she would no longer wish a Bramall Lane stand to be named after her if Evans returned to the club full-time, 'mob justice' would appear to have found its place after all. VIDEO Scroll Dave Whelan apologising on Sky Sports for controversial interview . Sheffield United have done a U-turn on Ched Evans (left) after action from the likes of Jessica Ennis-Hill . The Olympic gold medalist has a stand named after her at the Blades' Bramall Lane ground . An angry mob is never shy in taking action in The Simpsons' cartoon world of Springfield . Confirming that Evans's training privileges had been withdrawn, Sheffield United said: 'Members of the Board have consulted dispassionately with the club's supporters, vice presidents, Community Foundation members, executives, staff, sponsors and other relevant stakeholders in order to help it reach this decision. The club initially accepted a request from the PFA for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced.' Actually, it could. A first-year GCSE Media Studies student could have called this one. Still, at least we know where Sheffield United stand. Against mob justice. Unless it's a really big mob. Judy Murray . Travelling up to Glasgow this week, I bumped into Judy Murray fresh from her memorable turn on Strictly Come Dancing. She wasn't the best mover. We know that. But she was a fantastic sport – and the British public love that even more. Between posing for countless selfies with admirers, she said she realised how big the programme was when after the first episode she went up to watch the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles and was forced to abandon walking the course a hundred yards down the first fairway. I said she did well to survive the backlash from son Andy's declaration for Scottish independence. 'He said if I got voted out in the first week, it would be all his fault,' Judy confirmed. 'I told him not to be so silly. If I went out in the first week it would be because I was s****.' A true mum, Judy Murray. Marvellous.

When Fabio Capello said he was one of the best right backs in the world, it was the first sign the England manager was losing it. Yet who else was there? Kyle Walker? Worse. Phil Jones or Chris Smalling. Central defenders at heart. John Stones. Not yet. Southampton fans have been raving about Clyne for over a year now, and this week he took his chance. He was beaten for pace by Scotland's Ikechi Anya early on at Parkhead. But only the once. After that, Anya barely got a kick and was eventually substituted. Lee Dixon, no slouch at right-back himself, was raving about Clyne's defensive strengths after the game. Danny Mills said the way he reacted to Anya's threat, adapted and won the day, was the hallmark of a good player. One imagines England coach Gary Neville might know a good full-back, too. Problem solved? Let's hope so. Nathaniel Clyne (left) got the better of Scotland winger Ikechi Anya (right) to help England win at Celtic Park . WHAT'S NOT . Dave Whelan . You are the chairman of Wigan Athletic. You have just made a controversial managerial appointment, engaging a man currently under Football Association investigation for using racially charged and homophobic language, albeit in private conversations. What do you do? That's right: deflect attention from him, by repeating the same material yourself in an interview with a left-leaning newspaper. Whelan thinks everyone calls the Chinese 'Chinks' and it is a statement of fact that Jews chase money. He probably doesn't see the harm in slurs and stereotypes, even now. So here's a reminder of where it leads. This is a page from an educational book, Der Giftpilz, published in Germany in 1938. The first line of the narrative beneath reads, 'The God of the Jew is money.' Not so far from what Whelan said, if you think about it.

Anti-Republican Chanting . F*** the IRA? Of course. F*** all terrorists. F*** anyone who so lacks empathy for their fellow man that they can slaughter, not combatants, but innocents. Yet is this really a message that needs underlining during England internationals? When Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored his first goal for England in more than a year on Tuesday, he might have thought it would have been received with more than a reminder of a bloody chapter in British history, thankfully resolved. It has nothing to do with football. Stop it. A 'No Surrender' banner, inreference to the IRA, was spotted at Celtic Park on Tuesday evening . Radamel Falcao . Another two weeks out. So now we know for certain. There was no plan. There was no grand scheme, no brilliant strategy. Manchester United went for the marquee names that were available, and here is the consequence. They bought a very expensive, injury prone, player in a position that was already well staffed. Still, no doubt Twitter was abuzz.

"Lewis Hamilton fixed his inquisitor with his coldest stare. ‘Why would I crash?’ he bristled. ‘Have I crashed all year?’ He paused. Considered biting back again. Decided against it. ‘I’m pretty good at this, you know,’ he murmured. Nobody asks Hamilton about crashing most weeks. But this isn’t most weeks. It is the week. Final week. Double points week. The week of truth. The week of destiny. The week of pure racing freedom. The next 48 hours, Hamilton agrees, are the most important of his professional life. ‘I’m fully aware of that,’ he adds. ‘Of course I know that.’ Crashing is suddenly on the agenda because with the stakes higher than at any time this year, the liberty to be good, or bad, when racing begins is also at its greatest. Lewis Hamilton greets his many fans at the Yas Marina circuit as he prepares for the final race of the season . Hamilton puts his gloves on in the garage as Mercedes prepare to crown their first world champion . Hamilton soars around the track in Abu Dhabi knowing that his second world title is within his grasp . Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg are the only drivers capable of winning the prize. With the constructors’ title long decided, instruction will now be kept to a minimum. Within the reasonable parameters of team support, there will be no limit on selfish ambition and that carries risk. Ayrton Senna took Alain Prost out at 160mph in 1990 in similar circumstances. If Hamilton did the same thing to Rosberg, he would be champion. ‘That’s not me,’ Hamilton insisted. ‘I want to win by winning.’ There’s no temptation to be naughty? ‘I want to win by winning. I’ve never raced that way.’ Ayrton Senna was your hero and he could be naughty. Small pause. Quietly, almost a murmur again. ‘I don’t think Ayrton was naughty,’ Hamilton said.

Senna leads the way as the warring drivers leave Suzuka track in 1990 with the Brazilian crowned champion . Hamilton takes a picture with an adoring fan as the British driver meets and greets the public . We don’t get Lewis Hamilton, the way we didn’t get Andy Murray. We don’t get what drives them, their desires, their furies. We wonder why they can’t be like everybody else, lose those outer prickles. We compare Murray to Tim Henman, and Hamilton to James Hunt, Damon Hill or Nigel Mansell, grouping them by sport. Yet whiie Henman and the drivers are familiar products of their sporting culture — the way Alastair Cook typifies English cricket or Wayne Rooney has the background of many captains of the England football team — Hamilton and Murray are men apart. World tennis champions do not come from nondescript towns north of Glasgow; grand prix greats are not born in Stevenage council houses. Andy Murray became the first British winner at Wimbledon for 76 years, yet he is still not universally liked . Hamilton won the world title in his second season in Formula One at the tender age of 23 . Even in Abu Dhabi, when Hamilton spoke at the pre-race press conference on Thursday he was the only black man in the room. His attitude, like Murray, is that of the outsider. Your former kart boss Dino Chiesa had a lot of nice things to say about you. ‘He wasn’t a kart boss.’ He was an adviser, or whatever role he had there... ‘He was a mechanic.’ Hamilton’s mantra this weekend is that it is just another race. Fastest in practice on Friday, he did not appear a man with weight on his shoulders. Maybe he isn’t. Maybe his spikiness — the look of disdain for Rosberg’s proffered hand in the photoshoot was priceless — is just the suit of armour he has donned through the years. Nico Rosberg offers Hamilton his hand, but the Briton looks less than impressed with the gesture . Hamilton and Rosberg were friends growing up but their relationship has been severely tested as team-mates . Hamilton will know he is not a natural fit with men like Bernie Ecclestone; he will know he has never been widely popular back home. Certainly, he will know playing the game will not change that. So he pleases himself. He wins — just as Murray won to change public perception. ‘I am very much aware that this is a platform,’ Hamilton said. ‘There are people turning up with my caps on, turning up with flags, people I meet at the airport or on the street who are shaking because they watch me every weekend, are nervous for me, excited for me, who are with me, wishing they could be me. I do feel like I’m living the dream for others — that’s why I like to share it through posting pictures and by saying positive things rather than just waving a bunch of cash around.’ Like Floyd Mayweather? ‘Yeah. I’ve no interest in inspiring people like that,’ Hamilton continued. ‘I want it to be more than, “Hey, here’s me by a car... here’s me by a mountain”. I want to tell them, “If I can do it, you can do it”.’ Hamilton admits Sunday's race will be the biggest test of his Formula One career . The Mercedes team undertake a pit stop ahead of a potentially mesmeric weekend in the Persian Gulf . If Lewis Hamilton finishes second in Abu Dhabi he will win the title, but things have not always gone well for him in the season finale. In his debut year in 2007, a first-lap error and a gearbox issue meant he lost the World Championship while he only won in 2008 on the final corner of the last lap. Not the best omen for Sunday’s race. One of Hamilton’s latest posts quotes Martin Luther King. His dream is more mundane, obviously, but that does not make it worthless and it should be Hamilton’s prize on Sunday. He has not been out of the top two in the last six grand prix races, and if he replicates that finish he will be champion. As this will be his second title, it will be a modern milestone. He would be the first British driver to win multiple championships since Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971 and 1973), and join an exclusive band of British racers comprising Graham Hill (1962 and 1968) and Jim Clark (1963 and 1965). Hamilton claimed not to have considered his place in the pantheon before it was mentioned, but maybe that is a defence mechanism, too. He already knows he has a way to fall if unsuccessful, without adding the gaze of history to the equation. There is so much that is random to go wrong in Formula One, plus the spanner in the works of arbitrary double points. If Hamilton finishes first, second or simply ahead of Rosberg, he wins. If Rosberg wins and Hamilton finishes seventh or lower, the German wins — under the scoring system used for the previous 18 races. The controversy arises if Rosberg wins and Hamilton finishes third, fourth, fifth or sixth; or Rosberg comes second and Hamilton finishes between sixth and 10th. In this situation, the German is champion because this race — and only this race — counts double. Hamilton goes wide at Interlagos in 2007, his seventh-place finish ending his bid to become world champion . David Coulthard comforts Hamilton after the rookie lost out on the title to Kimi Raikkonen by a single point . Hamilton would still claim a place in history — but only in the most gypped category. With the randomness of technical malfunctions, a twist of fate here could have greater professional consequence than any event in Hamilton’s career. This is his to lose, and he knows it. ‘I’m excited,’ he insisted. ‘Why shouldn’t I be? I’m in the best place in my whole life. I’m with the best team, I’ve got the best car, I’m in the best shape — I’m excited, man. I’m excited. The last two times I went into the championship, I was probably nervous. It’s a lot different now. ‘I’ve got to control it but I’m good at that. I guess it’s the same as keeping pretty chilled when I get to drive a Formula One car every weekend. That’s a pretty huge thing — but controlling it is how I’m built. I can’t wait to get in the car. ‘I have a plan. I’m working with my guys, we’ve already spoken about it, all the things I need to focus on, all the things I’ve learned through the year. I don’t need to drive the race of my life; just my best. I feel I’m here like any other weekend. If you build it up that’s when the issues come.’ It is perhaps a sign of Hamilton’s resolve that he will be without his family in Abu Dhabi. Asked for the guest list, he became tight-lipped again. ‘No-one,’ he said. ‘A few friends in the grandstand. Generally, through the year, I’ve not had people come.’ Another beat. ‘I’ve got a job to do.’ He stared that cool stare. A very singular man, Lewis Hamilton.","The stakes are high for Hamilton ahead of the most important weekend of his professional life .

"There will be the usual fanfare on Saturday when Wayne Rooney wins his 100th England cap. But whilst it’s obviously a source of pride, it is nothing to shout about, and deep down he knows that. I’m a big Rooney fan – regular readers of this column will be well aware of that. I have never questioned his passion to play for England, even when he has sometimes channelled that desire in a counter-productive way (abusing the fans in South Africa, getting sent off in Germany). England captain Wayne Rooney gestures during the friendly against Norway at Wembley back in September . England captain Wayne Rooney returned to his first school ahead of his 100th cap. Click here to read more and see our exclusive pictures. Of course you have to be a very good player to play a century of games for England. But is it something to celebrate? Rooney has been a regular for his country in an era when England have been desperate for strikers. David Nugent, Kevin Davies, Carlton Cole and a fast-fading Emile Heskey have all won international caps in the Rooney era. Had Rooney played in the mid-1990s he might not have reached 100 caps. He would have been competing with the likes of Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham, Ian Wright, Robbie Fowler, Les Ferdinand and Andy Cole. Emile Heskey pictured in action for England against the USA at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . Carlton Cole misses a chance to score for England in the 2-0 defeat by Spain in a friendly in 2009 . So a dearth of strikers over the past 10 years has helped Rooney’s total, without doubt. But Rooney is on the verge of breaking the all-time scoring record for England, and his international quality cannot be questioned. Until you get to tournament football. Rooney will be well aware how atrocious his record is at World Cups – three of them, only one goal. European Championships are better: two tournaments, five goals. But four of them were back in 2004. Alan Shearer scores England's second goal in their 4-1 victory against Holland at Euro 96 . Andy Cole slides the ball home to score his only goal for England in a 3-1 victory against Albania in 2001 . On the face of it 100 caps is an achievement. Breaking the scoring record for England will be something for Rooney to cherish, if and when it happens. But I know how passionate this guy is when it comes to representing his country. And I suspect he would trade some of the caps and goals if it meant he could lead England to victory in France in 2016, or even Russia in 2018. Some players have represented their country very well – in the modern era David Beckham, Ashley Cole and Rooney all spring to mind. They’ve all won a ton of caps. Wayne Rooney (centre) shows his dejection after Italy scored the winner in their 2-1 World Cup victory in June . Rooney celebrates after scoring England's sole goal in a 1-0 friendly victory against Norway in September . Is it too harsh for me to declare my belief that, regardless of caps and goals, an England international’s career can be respected, but must be considered a failure without a major tournament victory? Isn’t that what they’re all aiming for? Wayne Rooney’s dream of such glory is still alive and I hope he goes for it. Be proud to represent your country 100 times but remember that isn’t the goal. Lifting a major trophy is what it’s all about.","Wayne Rooney will win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday .

"Jack Wilshere's critics need to pipe down... he can become world class . Scotland fans are deluded . If Daley Blind, Michael Carrick and David de Gea are all forced to miss Saturday’s Premier League game at Arsenal through injury then Manchester United should be allowed to request the game is postponed. Having any player injured on international duty is unfortunate – as Liverpool will testify. But to have three of their starting XI all crocked while on European Championship qualifying duty in the past few days has been spectacularly unlucky. If you think this is ridiculous, imagine if it happens to your club. Now you can see the logic, right? Stop hating United, and think about this as a ruling that could benefit football, and would possibly help all clubs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wesley Sneijder and Daley Blind scoring against Mexico . Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind injured knee ligaments while playing for Holland on Sunday night . Manchester United keeper David de Gea dislocated a finger while training with the Spain squad last week . Michael Carrick - seen here (right) training with England last week - was also injured on international duty . Blind (knee ligaments), Carrick (groin) and De Gea (finger) have all picked up injuries away from Manchester United, and yet it’s Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal who has to pick up the pieces. So it’s about time the clubs who suffer were given some sort of compensation, other than a token financial gesture. There is a problem establishing a rule: how do you decide how many players must be injured before a club can request a postponement? For me, three seems reasonable; as long as they’re all regular first-team players. Squads should be big enough to cope with one, even two injuries. But three players coming back from international games crocked creates a situation that’s much harder to work with. And let’s face it, if a trio of regular first-team players are out through no fault of the club’s making, what kind of spectacle will it be? The Premier League is brilliant for many reasons but one of the main ones is the competitive spirit from top to bottom – Stoke can go to the champions and win while Southampton and West Ham can find themselves in the top four and newly-promoted Leicester can put five past Manchester United. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has been left with a depleted squad to choose from on Saturday . A United second-string side, with three injuries dumped on them by international football, away to Arsenal, is potentially lambs to the slaughter, and in simple terms it’s unfair. There is no logical reason that says Arsenal should benefit. One question that arises from this idea: how many games can be postponed by the club that suffers? In my opinion, just one. That should be long enough for any club to work with the remaining players in the squad and get their act together. There is another aspect to this. Last month I interviewed Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill and asked him how he felt about the Everton pair Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy missing the game in Germany, and then playing for their club a few days later. The issue has cropped up again with Ireland assistant Roy Keane saying Roberto Martinez didn’t play for his country, so he doesn’t understand the situation from the point of view of an international manager. Keane says it’s a relief when he sees Coleman and McCarthy turn up for the national side. Seamus Coleman (right) has been involved in a tug of war between Everton and Republic of Ireland . Martinez protecting his players is understandable. But the pressure of the situation might be eased – and Martinez more likely to be flexible - if a way of helping clubs AFTER the international break is put in place, if they’re unlucky enough to suffer injuries. It’s an unlikely scenario but imagine Wayne Rooney, Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw are all injured in Glasgow on Tuesday night. That would make a total of six Manchester United players injured on international duty. It’s a situation that needs addressing – most clubs would agree with that. Clubs and countries can work together and this is one way to help improve the relationship between them.","Arsenal host Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday .

"The one thing a referee must have is credibility – the confidence of the players to do his job. Neil Swarbrick clearly did not have that at Villa Park. This was not a derby or a game with history. Nor was it a game between two physical teams and that was probably why Swarbrick was appointed. To be fair the players didn’t make the game easy for the match officials by pressurising them to caution and dismiss fellow professionals. However, there were only 23 free kicks awarded and they resulted in six yellow and a straight red card. Not enough control from the referee and perhaps too much advantage.

Benteke gets involved in a melee near the dugout as players from both Villa and Spurs get involved . Benteke walks down the tunnel at Villa Park after being shown his marching orders for a petulant incident . The incident which led to the dismissal of Christian Benteke was the one to grab the attention but that stramash was the result of earlier ill feelings. Certainly Jan Vertonghen’s sliding feet-up challenge was one which showed how the players didn’t trust Swarbrick to take the action required. Four of five of each team screamed at the hapless Swarbrick and each other and hopefully the FA will review the video and charge the clubs at their lack of control. Then in the 65th minute the disrespect for each other and the referee erupted as players completely lost their discipline. There was pushing and shoving, barging and posturing by players from both teams. Benteke started it by barging Erik Lamela who responded by barging him back. As others joined the melee Ryan Mason pushed his head into Benteke’s face and the Villa forward responded by slapping Mason. Ron Vlaar and Benteke look incredulously at Swarbrick after he brandishes a red card . Jan Vertonghen was booked for a studs-up challenge on Ashley Westwood - he knew he would not be sent off . Tempers fray as Swarbrick gives Vertonghen a yellow card for his challenge . Once the dust settled Swarbrick, after advice from the fourth official, sent Benteke off but took no further action. Mason was certainly fortunate not to be dismissed as well and not content with the part he played he then demanded the red card for Benteke. It was easy to see why Villa were so frustrated. The fact Tottenham ended up winning the game just rubbed salt into Villa’s wounds.","A referee must have credibility, and Neil Swarbrick lacked that on Sunday .

"Arsene Wenger admitted before the Champions League draw that he was dreaming of a tie against former club Monaco, it's a dream he'll be living come February. The Arsenal manager spent seven years at Monaco between 1987 and 1994, winning both the Ligue 1 title and the Coupe de France. Just as he would in both Japan and north London, Wenger re-shaped Monaco upon arrival. He persuaded Glenn Hoddle to join on a free transfer from Tottenham while defender Patrick Battiston also moved to the principality after his Bordeaux contract expired. Forward Mark Hateley joined too after a successful three years in Italy with AC Milan. Then-Monaco manager Arsene Wenger in training with Glenn Hoddle in 1987; Hoddle was one of the Frenchman's first signing's upon moving to the club, he persuaded the England international midfielder to join on a free transfer from Tottenham Hotspur . Wenger stands with his two new signings in the summer of 1987; Mark Hateley (left) joined the Ligue 1 side after three seasons in Italy with AC Milan and said at the time that the opportunity to play alongside Hoddle (right) was won of the factors that encouraged him to do so . Wenger (centre left), pictured here in 1989, leads his Monaco players on a run during a training session - he is joined by midfielder and current Nice manager Claude Puel (left), midfielder Jose Toure (cente right) and France international midfielder Fabrice Poullain (right) The Frenchman, pictured here in his final two years (left - 1993, right - 1994) at the Ligue 1 club; Bayern Munich came calling for Wenger in his penultimate season with Monaco but the club refused to let him leave, they sacked him early in the 1994-95 season after a poor start . Wenger sits in the dugout with his coaching staff during the 1992 Cup Winners Cup Final against Werder Bremen at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon - the Bundesliga side ran out 2-0 winners courtesy of goals from New Zealand international Wynton Rufer and German Klaus Allofs . 1987-88: Wins Ligue 1 in his first season . 1988-89: Finishes third in the league, loses in Coupe de France final to Marseille . 1989-90: Finishes third in the league . 1990-91: Wins Coupe de France . 1991-92: Finishes second in the league, loses in Cup Winners Cup final . 1992-93: Finishes second in the league . 1993-94: Finishes ninth in the league . 1994-95: Sacked in September with Monaco 17th in the table . Wenger's success was instantaneous, he won the league in his first season and managed to sign a young George Weah the following summer. But the second season was one of frustration for Wenger after he lost in the final of the Coupe de France to bitter rivals Marseille and finished third in the league behind Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain. Wenger tasted success again in 1991 when his side got revenge on Marseille by beating them in the final of the Coupe de France. But the years that followed saw a steady decline both in terms of trophies won and also final league positions. He did, however, reach the final of the European Cup Winners Cup in 1992 and helped to develop a number of talented players at the club, including Arsenal's future record goal scorer Thierry Henry. In his penultimate season at the club Bayern Munich made an approach for Wenger. Monaco refused to let him join the Bundesliga giants but then sacked him early in the 1994-95 season after a string of poor results that left them 17th in the table. The Frenchman could have stayed in his native country but problems with domestic match-fixing and bribery, which Marseille were found guilty of in 1994, had tainted his view of the league and he instead opted for a move to Japan.

Wenger sits in the dugout for a Ligue 1 match in 1989 next to his assistant Jean Petit (right) - Petit spent almost his entire playing for Monaco and won the league title with them as a player in 1978, in total he scored 76 goals for them in 428 senior appearances .

Wenger is lifted onto the shoulders of a Monaco player by Weah and Dib in Paris after his domestic cup success - it was the last trophy that Wenger won while in charge of the club, although he came close to winning others in the seasons that followed . Wenger talks to Ajax, Barcelona and Holland legend Johan Cruyff; the two men shared a philosophy of attacking football in their managerial careers - at Monaco this was represented by players such as Glenn Hoddle, Jurgen Klinsmann and George Weah .

Wenger and Roger Lemerre in August 1994, just one month before he was sacked as manager of Monaco - Lemerre was, at the time, manager of the French army team but had previously had spells in charge of Red Star, Lens, Strasbourg and Paris . Wenger and Petit in the dugout in 1990 - Petit had three separate spells as assistant manager at Monaco that were punctuated by two brief periods as caretaker manager, including after Wenger was sacked by the Ligue 1 club in 1994 . Wenger's time at the club may have ended on a sour note with the his arguments over corruption in the league and his eventual sacking by the club, but Monaco fans will look back fondly on his tenure after he brought them a league title, the French cup and two European finals . Between his appointment on July 1 1987 and his sacking in on September 17 1994, Wenger took charge of 266 games at Monaco - he won 130, drew 53 and lost 83, giving him a win ratio of 48.87 per cent during his time there, which was 20 per cent better than his time at Nancy .","Arsenal have been drawn against Monaco in the Champions League last 16 .

"Calum Chambers must be so relieved to be joining up with England this week. At least Roy Hodgson won’t hang him out to dry like Arsene Wenger did at Swansea on Sunday. When you’re starting to think the England manager has more of a grasp of in-game management than the Arsenal boss, then it’s time to ask some serious questions of Wenger.

Arsenal defender Chambers (right) claims his innocence after a challenge on Swansea's Wilfried Bony . Chambers (right) can only watch as Montero (centre) advances with the ball at the Liberty Stadium . I like Chambers, and I think his signing was a shrewd investment from Wenger in the summer. But he’s not quick, and the defender was left exposed, alone, dealing with a winger who was having a brilliant game and rinsing his man for pace every time he got the ball. Mathieu Flamini didn’t go across to help out, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain preferred to go forward, the speed demon Hector Bellerin stayed on the bench. What was the Arsenal manager actually doing? Wenger’s grasp of the problems at Arsenal, which have led to the team losing a three-goal lead at home to Anderlecht, and then losing a game they were winning at Swansea, is virtually non-existent. Alexis Sanchez (left) can't hide his dismay after Swansea score a second goal against Arsenal . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger watches his side lose 2-1 away to Swansea City on Sunday . To back this up let me give you a selection of quotes from Wenger which were posted on the official Arsenal website after the Swansea defeat... Wenger: 'We were quite solid defensively and didn’t look in the need to change.' So he couldn’t see how exposed Chambers was? Wenger: 'I think he (Flamini) had a decent game.' And then on Alexis Sanchez: 'He didn’t have the best game today.' After those answers, do you trust his judgment of a player’s performance? Wenger: 'We were struggling a bit on the right side but I have no experienced players on the bench. It was unfortunate. I don’t think there was a need to change.' There was clearly a need to change. But bringing on Yaya Sanogo for Chambers in the final minute was laughable. And why were there no experienced players on the bench? Because Wenger’s squad management and transfer policy are so excruciatingly pathetic. Letting Thomas Vermaelen go was bad, failing to replace him was shocking. Wenger: 'The free kick is difficult to predict he would score from there. It’s not like we gave a great goal chance away. I feel the free-kick was a bit harsh.' Bafetimbi Gomis (second left) rises above the Arsenal defence to put Swansea 2-1 ahead . Gomis looks elated as he runs away after scoring what proved to be the winner for Swansea . It was a free kick 25 yards out! Why is it difficult to predict Gylfi Sigurdsson could score from there? This is a player who has scored free kicks from that distance for club and country in the past (for Iceland away to Slovenia last year, for Swansea at Wigan in March 2012, for Reading against Swansea and at Ipswich). So how come Wenger wasn’t aware? Given Sigurdsson’s quality, a free kick conceded 25 yards from goal was obviously a 'great goal chance'. And was it harsh? Kieran Gibbs was guilty of sliding in, nowhere near the ball, and bringing down a player as Swansea broke away. And when asked why Chelsea have made such a good start, Wenger’s reply was: 'There is no obvious reason.' Gylfi Sigurdsson (left) fires a free kick towards goal to claim the equaliser for Swansea . The reasons are clear: Jose Mourinho identifying Chelsea’s weaknesses and solving them with two signings, one of whom was a player Arsenal could have signed but didn’t, allowing the Blues to take him. The answers Wenger gives could possibly be twisted by his more deluded supporters into some sort of desperate attempt to protect his players. The Arsenal manager needed to protect his teenage right back on Sunday, but failed to do so. The irony is that despite the game being played in front of him, Wenger does not see it. Old habits die hard, I suppose. He used to be brilliant. But he isn’t any more.","Arsenal lost 2-1 away to Swansea in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Liverpool will be hoping to better a record of just two wins in 14 against Arsenal in all competitions when they welcome the Gunners to Anfield for Sunday's vital Premier League clash. Neither side has enjoyed the first few months of this campaign, with both Brendan Rodgers and Arsene Wenger under increasing pressure to get things right.

The Gunners have also stuttered so far, with fan frustration reaching boiling point. However, Anfield has represented a happy hunting ground for Wenger and his side in recent years - getting the better of some thrilling encounters. Aside from last season's first-half capitulation at Anfield, Wenger has masterminded three wins from his last four visits to Liverpool, with just one solitary defeat at the Emirates the only blot on the copybook for the Frenchman. That victory in August 2011 was Liverpool's first win at Arsenal in 11 years. Helped by the dismissal of Emmanuel Frimpong, the Reds took full advantage with an Aaron Ramsey own goal and substitute Suarez helping Kenny Dalglish's men earn a crucial three points. Certainly the most famous clash in those 14 games was the memorable 4-4 draw at Anfield, with forgotten man Andrey Arshavin grabbing all four goals as the Gunners left it very late to snatch a dramatic point. The scene of one of the most dramatic moments in footballing history - Michael Thomas' last minute winner which snatched the Division One title in 1989 will always live long in the memory. But determined to further avenge that encounter and numerous other more recent defeats to the Gunners, coupled with the need for a vital three points to get their season up and running, Liverpool have plenty to spur them on when Arsenal come to town this weekend.

"Three of Arsenal's key defensive players showed they are ready for a busy festive period as they joined in with carol singers at the club's training ground. Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, centre back Per Mertesacker and holding midfielder Mathieu Flamini were accosted by the singers as part of BT Sport's new Christmas football marketing campaign. Szczesny is given a blast of the classic 'shall we sing a song for you?', but looks surprised before walking away. Per Mertesacker smiles at the carol singers while enjoying a shower at Arsenal's training ground . Defensive midfielder Mathieu Flamini offers a wave at the request of the singing fans . The group of carol singers sneak up on Wojciech Szczesny while he is training, much to the keeper's surprise . Flamini, despite looking somewhat confused, offered the singers a wave when they came into the dressing room, but it was Mertesacker who steals the show in the new adverts. The German, who is set to captain Arsenal through the Christmas period, in the continued absence of Mikel Arteta, joins in with the singers' chants of 'Big Festive German', a play on his nickname at the Emirates stadium. The Gunners stars also revealed their favourite Christmas songs, with Mertesacker a big fan of Wham's classic 'Last Christmas', while Szczesny prefers 'Rocking around the Christmas Tree'. Flamini and Szczesny both agreed that Santi Cazorla would be the best choice of Aresnal player to be Santa Claus, because of his tendency to put on a bit of weight during holidays. The advert is the second featuring BT Sport's Christmas choir - another shows the group outside a house singing songs often heard on the terraces at Manchester United and Chelsea games. BT Sport's Christmas choir feature in two funny adverts as the channel gear up for their festive coverage . PER MERTESACKER . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? We have a lovely chef who would love to be Santa Claus! There's no particular player who could be a good Santa Claus! What's your favorite thing about Christmas? In Germany we celebrate on Christmas Eve and in England you celebrate on 25 December so in England, now I have two days to celebrate, so its an extra Christmas for me. What's top of your Christmas list this year? I want to stay as healthy as possible until the last day of this year. And then I'm going to try to put my focus on family time. I will be there for my family and take care of them. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? I just concentrate on celebrating my Christmas! What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Last Christmas', it comes up every Christmas and is kind of a one hit wonder and is loved by everyone! Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? You can't go crazy. You can celebrate but you have to always be aware that there's going to be a match one or two days after Christmas. So really we're focused on the next games. I try as much as I can to celebrate with the family and to feel that its Christmas time. Time to relax and I really look forward to it. MATHIEU FLAMINI . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? Santi Cazorla. That would be funny. We have a chef, the cook, who really looks like Santa Claus. Or Santi. What's your favorite thing about Christmas? The best thing is the opportunity to be together with the family and be with family members that we cannot always see during the year. But Christmas is a great opportunity to be with all family and to be united. What's top of your Christmas list this year? For me the most important thing is to be healthy. To be happy, to have the love of family, love of friends. And after, in terms of professional aspects, to be successful. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? Everyone is very excited about Christmas and generous and giving to others. So I don't think we have anyone like that in our team. What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Jingle Bells'. Definitely my favourite. Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? We don't drink, with playing every 3 days, its not a good thing to do. So we leave the alcohol on the side to make sure we are focused on the games. WOJCIECH SZCZESNY . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? I'd love to see Per Mertesacker dress up as him. But when he retires I think Santi Cazorla will look just like Father Christmas as he has a thing when he goes on holiday he can look just like him and put on some weight! What's your favorite thing about Christmas? Just the family getting together and spending time with my cousins. What's top of your Christmas list this year? I'm not too much into presents. I'm looking forward to spending time with family. It's the only time when my whole family comes to London. That's top of my wish list. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? Podolski. He moans all the time and he doesn't even enjoy Christmas! What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Rocking around the Christmas tree'. I love that. In my first year at the club I had to sing for the first team! Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? We have to stick to the diet. I do love Christmas food. I try to enjoy it without being silly. But we have to look after ourselves.

"Champions Manchester City will again be without any senior strikers for their Barclays Premier League trip to West Brom on Boxing Day. City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 on Saturday with midfielders David Silva and James Milner operating in central roles in the absence of Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko. Montenegro forward Jovetic is the closest of the trio to being fit after a hamstring injury but has been ruled out of the game at The Hawthorns. David Silva could start in an advanced attacking role again with Manchester City's strikers all still injured . Joe Hart makes an acrobatic save during training ahead of City's clash with West Brom on Boxing Day . Captain Vincent Kompany, the influential Belgium defender, also remains on the casualty list but is close to a return. Pellegrini said: 'The injuries are the same as last week. The strikers - Sergio, Edin Dzeko and Jovetic, and Vincent Kompany. 'I am not a doctor so it is difficult for me to know exactly but maybe Jovetic and Kompany will be soon, the end of this week or next week. 'Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero will be the second part of January.' After Friday's game at West Brom, City host Burnley on Sunday and then face Sunderland on New Year's Day. There looks to be a possibility of Jovetic and Kompany featuring for part of that programme.

Manuel Pellegrini (left) has a chat with Yaya Toure in training ahead of the Boxing Day trip to West Brom . Pellegrini is hopeful that discussions over the the future of on-loan midfielder Frank Lampard will reach a positive conclusion soon. The former England star's loan from sister club New York City is due to expire at the end of this month but Pellegrini has expressed hope the player can stay. Lampard, 36, has also indicated an interest in staying longer, but it remains to be seen how long an extension can be secured given the start of the Major League Soccer season in March. Lampard is a key figure in City's bold plan to make an impact in the United States but Pellegrini is hopeful a deal can be agreed that suits all parties. Asked if he risked upsetting his American counterparts, Pellegrini said: 'I don't think so. That is why we have long conversations with all of them. 'That is just one club so I think that what is better for the club is better for all the clubs. Lampard (left in training with Toure) could extend his stay in the Premier League with Manchester City . Lampard is on loan from New York City until January but Manchester City want him to stay longer . 'I hope Frank's situation will be resolved in the next days. I said in the beginning it will be during December we are going to have the last decision. 'I repeat, Frank is very important for our team so I hope he will stay here.' City head into the festive fixtures trailing Chelsea by three points at the top of the table. The champions did pull level with their victory at the weekend but Chelsea responded to the challenge by winning their game in hand at Stoke on Monday. City, with momentum after six successive league wins, will hope to keep up the pressure but Pellegrini insists he is not concerning himself with Chelsea's fortunes. He said: 'We are not thinking about Chelsea, we are thinking about just our team. We know it is important to have our own pressure. 'You never win the title in December. We have a long five months to continue playing as well as we are doing so far and we will see at the end of the season which team has most points.'","David Silva and James Milner played as forwards against Crystal Palace .

"Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez have been two of the stand-out performers so far this season. Di Maria is like a modern-day Ryan Giggs, changing defence to attack in an instant. He makes lots of high-intensity runs but dribbles from central areas and from deep.

"A sickness bug has left at least 100 British tourists ill, with several on drips after it swept through an Egyptian holiday resort. Holidaymakers at the Coral Sea Waterworld complex have been affected by the bug, thought to be Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. People staying at the four star resort in Sharm el Sheikh say some tourists have been confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel, with some on intravenous drips. The Coral Sea Waterworld resort in Sharm el Sheikh, where at least 100 British tourists have come down with a sickness bug . Many of those affected have blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers. It has also been reported that extra doctors have been drafted in to cope with the sickness outbreak and that staff at the resort are now wearing latex gloves and using hand sanitisers. According to the Daily Mirror, legal firm Simpson Millar, acting for the holidaymakers staying at the hotel, say there had been 50 cases of the illness reported to them in the past 24 hours alone. Tourists staying at the resort have also been taking to the hotel's TripAdvisor page, where many complain that the bug had ruined their holiday. Tim308 posted: 'All was fine until the Tuesday when I was struck down with sickness and diarrhoea for 3 days.  Just as I was recovering from my illness my wife was struck down with one far worst, sickness, diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever that continued for the duration of our holiday and is still not 100 per cent now. Holidaymakers at the resort have complained of diarrhoea, fever and stomach cramps, thought to be linked to the Shigella bug . 'Instead of enjoying the second week around the water park or on the beach we were confined to the room or trips to the pharmacist for antibiotics and an injection.' While Bristol S posted: 'I became ill on the second night and was unable to eat, drink, use the pools or waterpark for the whole holiday.

'Reported cases of sickness have reduced and an independent health and safety consultant has been undertaking a thorough investigation.'

"In New York, a 78-year-old woman strolling in her neighborhood was punched in the head by a stranger and tumbled to the ground. In Jersey City, a 46-year-old man died after someone sucker-punched him and he struck his head on an iron fence. Most recently, a New York State representative was hit over the head while walking home from dinner in Washington DC. In each case, police are investigating whether the attacks are part of a violent game called 'knockout,' where the object is to target unsuspecting pedestrians with the intention of knocking them out cold with one punch. Authorities and psychologists say the concept has been around for decades - or longer - and it's played mostly by impulsive teenage boys looking to impress their friends. 'It's hard to excuse this behavior, there's no purpose to this,' said Jeffrey Butts, a psychologist specializing in juvenile delinquency at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 'When someone runs into a store and demands money, you can sort of understand why they're doing it, desperation, whatever. But just hitting someone for the sheer thrill of seeing if you can knock someone out is just childish.' Scroll down for video . Out of nowhere: Police across the U.S. have been noticing an increase in violent attacks they believe to be part of a game called 'Knockout'. Above, a Liveleak video showing one such attack . Attacked: Someone comes up behind the victim before striking and then running . At least two deaths have been linked to the game this year and police have seen a recent spike in similar attacks. New York City police have deployed additional officers to city neighborhoods where at least seven attacks occurred in the past few weeks, including the assault on the 78-year-old woman. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said some are smacked, some are more seriously assaulted, and some harassed. The department's hate crimes task force is investigating, because some attacks have been against Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. In Washington, D.C., police were investigating two assaults in the past week, both of which resulted in minor injuries but not unconsciousness. One victim, Phoebe Connolly, of Brattleboro, Vt., said she was randomly punched in the face by a teenager while riding her bike during a work-related visit to Washington last Friday. Connolly, who is 32 and works with teenagers in her job, said the blow knocked her head to the side and bloodied her nose. Hit and run: Phoebe Connolly was struck while riding her bike in Washington, DC last Friday . New York State Democratic Representative Grace Meng is another possible victim of the game in Washington. She was walking home from dinner in the district when someone punched her and stole her Gucci purse . 'I don't know what the goal was,' she said. 'There wasn't any attempt to take anything from me.' While some of those attacked have been white, and some suspected attackers black, experts said the incidents are more about preying on the seemingly helpless than race or religion. 'It's about someone who is seemingly helpless, and choosing that person to target,' Butts said. New York State Democratic Representative Grace Meng is another possible victim of the game in Washington. She was walking home from dinner in the district when someone punched her and stole her Gucci purse. 'She doesn't know for sure, but you . can't rule it out,' Meng spokesman Jordan Goldes told U.S. News about . the knockout possibility. A . recent media blitz about the game circulating on television stations . and online isn't helping, Connolly and experts said, especially because . images are being repeatedly broadcast of victims in a dead fall, . smacking the ground with a limp thud. The viral footage comes from older . incidents: In one instance from 2012, 50-year-old Pittsburgh English . teacher James Addlespurger was punched in the face and falls to the . curb. The image was caught on surveillance cameras, and a 15-year-old . was arrested. Struck: High School teacher Jim Applespurger was attacked by a group of teens near the school where he taught in October 2012 . Out cold: The English teacher (left) dropped to the ground and bashed his head on a curb. He fell so quickly, he didn't even attempt to catch himself with his hands . 'The behavior of the sudden assault of someone who seems helpless has appealed to the idiotic impulsive quality of adolescence forever,' said Butts. 'But there are now bragging rights beyond your immediate circle, when this is on television and online.' Paul Boxer, a psychology professor at Rutgers University who studies aggressive behavior, said Thursday the media stories may perpetuate the assaults, but most teens clearly aren't unfeeling sociopaths. 'You've got some impressionable kids, already with a propensity for violence who could be affected by this,' he said. 'But not because they are hoping to hurt somebody, it's more about risk taking, and new, different and exciting ways of getting into trouble.' In Lower Merion, a leafy suburb near Philadelphia, two attacks may be related to the game. Arrested: Nineteen-year-olds Samuel Hayles (left) and Marcus January (right) were charged last October for knocking down a 63-year-old man who was out walking his dog in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania . Random attack: Last May, Michael Daniels was killed after being knocked out with a single punch leaving a grocery store in Syracuse, New York. The group that punched him went on to stomp and beat him to death . 'We do worry that it's something like . that ... because we've had two similar assaults, neither one of which . resulted in a robbery,' said Lt. Frank Higgins of the Lower Merion . Township Police Department. In . one, two 19-year-olds were charged with knocking down a 63-year-old man . out walking his dog the evening of Oct. 29. They were arrested nearby a . short time later, and have been charged with assault, Higgins said. No . arrests were made in the other incident from September. Also in September in Jersey City, N.J., . two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old were charged as juveniles in the . murder of 46-year-old Ralph Eric Santiago. He was found Sept. 10 with . his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts. Hudson . County Prosecutor's Office spokesman Gene Rubino has said prosecutors . believe the teens were playing the game. In late May in Syracuse, a group of teenagers attempting to knock Michael Daniels out with a single punch wound up beating and stomping him to death, according to police. A 16-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter, and his 13-year-old co-defendant pleaded guilty to assault, admitting he started the fatal beating by trying to knock out Daniels with a single punch. Both were sentenced to 18 months behind bars. And earlier in May, Elex Murphy, now 20, was sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years in St. Louis for killing a Vietnamese immigrant as part the game in 2011. Gruesome: Ralph Santiago was discovered murder this past September with his neck broken and his head wedged between iron fence posts . Caught on camera: Prosecutors believe three teens were involved in Santiago's death and were spotted on CCTV getting on the train . Juvenile delinquency experts say a . good punishment for these teens would be empathy training, such as . volunteering at a homeless shelter. But a New York lawmaker proposed a . bill this week that would make stricter sentences not only for those who . do the punching, but for those who publish images online and watch the . attacks. 'These . twisted and cowardly thugs are preying on innocent bystanders and they . don't care if the victims are young, old, a man or woman,' GOP state . Assemblyman Jim Tedisco said.

"A holidaymaker who fell seriously ill while on a dream holiday in the Dominican Republic has won a £20,000 pay out from Thomas Cook. Mark Bidwell, 33, from Bristol, suffered lethargy, diarrhoea and abdominal pain while on the ‘nightmare’ trip with his pregnant partner Nicola Greathurst. The father-of-two became unwell just five days into two-week stay at the four-star Bahia Principe Hotel in San Juan. Family holiday: Mark, pictured with his partner Nicola and their children Madison, four, and Harry, 18 months . Dream destination: The couple were on holiday in the Dominican Republic when Mark fell unwell . Mr Bidwell lost weight as a result of falling ill the holiday in October 2009, and says he still suffers ongoing health problems. The builder sued tour operator Thomas Cook and this week, two weeks before the case was to go to trial, a £20,000 pay out was agreed. Mr Bidwell said: ‘The holiday was a nightmare for both of us. The food was awful and we have both been put off travelling to the Dominican Republic ever again. 'Nightmare holiday': Mark and Nicola were staying at the the four-star Bahia Principe Hotel in San Juan . 'My life has completely changed': Mark, pictured with Nicola and their two children, fell unwell while on holiday in the Dominican Republic . ‘I regret ever staying at the hotel. It was a terrible experience for us and I am still suffering the consequences today as I am still experiencing ongoing symptoms. ‘I feel as though my life has completely changed and it will never be the same again.’ Ms Greathurst, who was 24 weeks pregnant with daughter Madison at the time of the holiday, was not unwell, but received a sum of cash from Thomas Cook at an earlier date. Irwin Mitchell, which represented the family, has now secured more than £5.5m in settlements for holidaymakers who have stayed at the hotel since 2007. Amandeep Dhillon, spokesman for the legal firm, said: ‘We are pleased that Mark's case has been settled and that both of them can now move forward and put their awful experience behind them. ‘Sadly, we have had a long history of having to take legal action due to illness at this hotel. ‘This was meant to be a relaxing luxurious holiday for the couple before the arrival of their baby, and they had worked hard to save for it but instead Mark fell badly ill and they were unable to enjoy the facilities the resort had to offer. ‘Severe gastric illness can lead to long-term health problems and it is essential that the appropriate health and safety guidelines are followed to prevent illness to guests at hotels wherever they may be in the world.’ A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mr Bidwell fell ill while on holiday at the Bahia Principe Hotel in San Juan, Dominican Republic in October 2009. 'We have extended our apologies to the party, while reaching an agreement with their legal representatives. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'

At least 100 people – including staff – were thought to be suffering from Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever, at the Sharm el-Sheikh resort earlier this summer. No reason to smile: A doctor, left, poses with Kate Andrews after she became ill at an Egyptian resort . However, some holidaymakers have accused the hotel of trying to blame the outbreak on people spending too much time in the sun. After the resort's medical centre was inundated with sick tourists – and extra doctors were brought in to cope - a letter was circulated to guests called 'Sunstroke and How to Stay Healthy'. It informed holidaymakers about the dangers of high temperature, lack of fluids and overexposure. It also advised guests to 'avoid handling food with bare hands as bacteria multiply in hot weather', and it suggested staff had been following the same practice. On-site doctors also later suggested sunstroke as the cause of their illness – after prescribing medication to fight infections. Despite the outbreak one of the docs even found time to pose for a smiling snap with an ill patient in their room. Many guests who fell ill complained about poor hygiene among staff and in the buffets. They claimed chefs and waiters handled raw and cooked food and served with their bare hands and dirty utensils. Holidaymaker Kate Andrews, who fell ill along with her 16-year-old son Samuel, said she was confined to her room for a week while they were both attached to drips. At least 100 people, including staff, were thought to be suffering from Shigella at Coral Sea Waterworld . The 42-year-old from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said she was unable to leave her bed and had blood in her faeces, and her husband, also ill, had to clean up after her and their son. She was shocked when on-site medics blamed the sun for the sickness that ruined their getaway in July. Kate said: 'One of the emergency doctors said we had too much sun I couldn't believe his cheek. We have been in much hotter weather in Thailand every other year and we take all the precautions so I knew it wasn't the sun. 'My husband tried to get the reps to close the hotel but they refused so new people were arriving all the time and then getting ill. 'It was horrendous, I wouldn't wish what I had on my worst enemy, I was so sick that I thought I might die. It was very scary.' Nightmare: On-site doctors prescribed medication and suggested sunstroke as the cause of the illness . She said the dining room tables were never wiped down properly in between meals and the food was always lukewarm. She said: 'There were no real hygiene practices but overnight that all changed as if someone had flicked a switch. All the staff had gloves on and everyone was forced to use sanitiser in the buffets but by then it was too late.' It was reported that extra doctors were brought in to cope with the outbreak. After she collapsed in the toilet, Kate encountered a queue of ill people, including the catering manager, at the on-site medical centre. She said the tour operator, First Choice, refused to admit anything was wrong, and the rep was confronted by queue of angry guests. When her husband snapped a photo as evidence a smiling doctor posed beside her on her bed. The hotel later told guests they were flushing the water system with chlorine, leaving Kate to wonder why staff would do that if everyone was just suffering sunstroke. 'It was horrendous': It was reported that extra doctors were brought in to cope with the outbreak . After the nightmarish trip Kate and her son spent a week quarantined at home and are still feeling the effects. She is vowing never to travel to Egypt again. First Choice said: 'All guests at the hotel get a letter addressing the risks of heat-related illnesses in welcome packs. 'It is given throughout the season and is not as a result of any reported cases of sickness.' Tracy Roscoe, from Kent, spent most of her family's £3,000 trip ill in bed and said the letter was given to her two days before she returned home with her husband and 15-year-old son, who also became ill. 'It stinks. They were trying to shift the blame on to the sun when they knew it was a bug doing the rounds in the hotel. 'I think it's disgraceful. They were using the letter to try and make people think they had sunstroke instead of a bug. There is nothing in it to suggest an illness that's going round which was the case.' She added: 'It was very sneaky of them and they knew there was an outbreak as their own animation staff were all ill as well and they had to cancel events. 'All they wanted to do was to sweep it under the carpet rather than admit a problem which would probably have saved lots of people from getting very ill and ruining their holiday.' Shigella: Most reported cases of shigellosis in the UK are travel related, public health officials say . She said First Choice offered a 'paltry' amount of compensation just days after the family returned home. She added: 'I couldn't believe it. I told them not until we get the result of hospital blood tests to see what was wrong. 'Since then we haven't been able to get hold of them. I just think they wanted to buy our silence.' Last night Nick Harris of Simpson Millar who is handling claims from 250 guests who fell ill at the hotel said: 'Tour operators have a duty to make sure that their customers are safe and should be advising people who are ill to seek medical treatment, not passing off or covering up illness with shoddy excuses such as sunstroke or a change in climate. 'The bug behind the illness Shigella can be devastating with 2% of victims going on to suffer chronic arthritis in later life. It is vital that appropriate medical treatment is received immediately – especially for the young, elderly and those with weakened immune systems . 'It would be outrageous if the tour operator was attempting to muddy the waters by intimating to its customers that the massive outbreak of sickness was caused by sunstroke, which is what the letter seems to imply. 'This letter went out when the tour operator knew that numerous guests were being hooked up to intravenous drips in their bedrooms and being fed a barrage of antibiotics because the medical centre was over-crowded.","Holidaymakers were confined to their beds and hooked up to IV drips .

"Men and women are happier in single sex offices because they are more comfortable without the other gender around, a new study claims. Researchers found a higher level of contentment for men if they did not have to ‘walk on eggshells’ around women, while women were happier when not dealing with a 'testosterone-fulled atmosphere.' But the study revealed that, although they might prefer single sex offices, workers are actually more productive when they share their workplace with the other gender. Study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claims men and women are happier in single sex offices. However they are more productive when sharing with the other gender (stock image shown) Dr Sara Ellison, a senior economics lecturer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who co-authored the study, said: ‘We all think that we want to be in this pluralistic society in a diverse setting. ‘But when push comes to shove, when our co-workers don’t think like we do, that can cause some friction. ‘[Workers] liked the idea of diversity more than they liked actual diversity’. The researchers looked at a US employee survey from an unnamed Boston professional services company carried out between 1995 and 2002. More than half of women are bullied or harassed at work - often by members of their own sex, a major poll has revealed. Based on interviews with nearly 23,000 women and more than 2,000 men, the survey is the largest of its kind in the UK. It revealed that the biggest enemy facing women in the office or other workplace is often other women, rather than their male colleagues. Women who had been bullied by a member of their own sex said they felt they may have been targeted because their senior colleague felt threatened by their abilities. The firm had 60 offices around the world, some of which were men-only, and some were women-only. The survey measured cooperation, trust and work enjoyment, and the researchers cross-checked the data with figures on company revenue and diversity. Overall, single sex offices reported being happier, but there was a twist when it came to company profits. The researchers found that if single sex offices had been mixed sex then revenue would have gone up by about 41 per cent. Dr Anne Litwin, a Boston organisational development consultant, said that she was not surprised by the findings. She said men in particular found it harder with women around because they had to watch what they say, and that 'they feel like their equilibrium is being thrown off, and it’s uncomfortable. Dr Litwin added that women by contrast ‘feel like they have to be assertive to be heard, and then they get accused of being the ""B"" word. They get told that they’re hard to work with.’ However, the research challenges the theory that happier workers are more productive. The researchers looked at a US employee survey from 1995 to 2002. Overall single sex offices reported being happier (stock image shown). But the study found that mixed sex offices would turn a larger profit .","Study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claims men and women are happier in single sex offices .
