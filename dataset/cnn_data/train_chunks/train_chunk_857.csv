"By . Ted Thornhill . Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he will not interfere in court rulings, a day after three Al-Jazeera journalists were sentenced to seven years in prison in a verdict that prompted an international outcry. The ruling, on terrorism-related charges, stunned their families and brought a landslide of condemnation and calls for el-Sissi to intervene. According to Egypt's constitution, the president has the right to issue a pardon or commute the sentences. U.S., Australian and other officials have urged el-Sissi to use this right to immediately release the journalists. Scroll down for video .

Al-Jazeera journalists stand inside court's cage . Australian journalist Peter Greste (left) and Canadian-Egyptian journalist Mohammed Fahmy (right) hold on to each other as they listen to the proceedings . The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation . Rights groups have described the trial as a politically motivated sham reflecting the tense relations between Egypt and the Qatar-owned station. Qatar has been a strong supporter of Islamists in the region and in particular Egypt's former president, Mohammed Morsi, overthrown by the military last summer. Sounding a defiant tone, however, el-Sissi said he had always said he will not interfere in judicial affairs, and would respect the courts' independence. He said he called the justice minister late Monday to repeat that sentiment, despite what he described as debate over the rulings against the journalists. 'I told him one word: We will not interfere in judicial matters because the Egyptian judiciary is an independent and exalted judiciary,' he told a military graduation ceremony in a nationally televised speech. He also urged people to stop commenting or criticizing court rulings. Repeating it again, he said: 'We will not interfere in court verdicts.' El-Sissi said to ensure respect for state institutions, there should be no interference in their affairs. 'If we desire (strong) state institutions we must respect court rulings and not comment on them even if others don't understand these rulings,' he said. El-Sissi's comments came at the end of a speech mostly devoted to economic affairs. David Cameron said that he was ‘completely appalled’ by the verdicts against former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, while Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the Egyptian ambassador in London for crisis talks. The three were arrested in December as part of a sweeping crackdown on Islamist supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi. The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation. They also faced charges of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war. The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them. The journalists and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi was ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president.

The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison. 'I swear they will pay for this,' Fahmy shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced. Greste raised his fists in the air. 'They just ruined a family,' said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session. He said they would appeal against the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. 'Everything is corrupt,' he said. The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and were being tried in absentia. Al-Jazeera English producer Baher Mohamed, centre left, Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, centre, and correspondent Peter Greste, second right, appear in court in March . Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. British ambassador James Watt, who was in court, said he was 'very disappointed' by the verdict. 'Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy,' he said. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, speaking on a visit to Cairo, described the sentencing as ‘chilling and draconian’. Conservative MPs called for an urgent review of UK and EU aid payments to Egypt. There were similar calls in the US, which has just handed Cairo a huge slice of foreign aid. Tory Peter Bone said: ‘It’s fundamentally wrong to give taxpayers’ money to corrupt foreign governments that are imprisoning people for reporting facts. The Arab Spring is turning into a disaster.’ The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood. The latest official figures show that the UK gave £8.4 million to Egypt in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office. But Britain also contributes to a £4.2 billion EU aid package that was agreed in 2012 . However, MPs also warned that, following the Leveson Inquiry, proposals for a form of state regulation of the British press made it more difficult for this country to lecture others about media freedoms.

"By . Leesa Smith . Wallabies cult hero Nick Cummins has selflessly put aside his dream of playing in next year's Rugby World Cup to provide for his sick family. Nicknamed the ‘Honey Badger’, the loveable larrikin has been reluctantly granted a release from his ARU and Super Rugby contract to play in Japan under ‘unique and extreme personal circumstances’. The Japanese league is known for offering massive cash incentives usually taken up by players nearing the end of their careers, but the in-form 26 year old is making the move to support his father Mark Cummins who is battling prostate cancer. Scroll down for video . Nick Cummins will join the Coca Cola West Red Sparks in Japan's Top League which runs from the end of August until the beginning of February . The in-form 26 year old (left) is making the move to play in Japan to support his father Mark Cummins (right) who is battling prostate cancer . Cummins, (pictured with his extended family) has seven siblings, three brothers and four sisters, two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis . The 15-Test winger is currently at the height of his career with the Force in 2014 and started in all three Tests in the clean sweep victory over France last month. But at the end of the Super Rugby season Cummins will join the Coca Cola West Red Sparks on a lucrative deal in Japan's Top League, which runs from the end of August until the beginning of February. Named The Queensland Father of the Year in 2012, Mark, who became a single dad five years ago, has eight children - two of whom suffer from cystic fibrosis. Cummins said it was time for him to give back to his family and provide them with some much-needed certainty. ‘My family is currently enduring some extremely difficult times in terms of their health and well being,’ he said in a statement on Friday. 'The boys were on it like seagulls at a tip' 'Sweatin’ like a gypsy with a mortgage, actually' 'My old man woke me up in the morning. He was going off like a bag of cats' 'You’re as tough as woodpecker lips.' 'Yeah mate I bloody was like a rat up a drainpipe in one of them runs there.' ‘It was a difficult decision to make in the context of a Rugby World Cup next year, but the health and well being of my family is paramount,’ he said. ‘I now must put my own interests in the world cup aside.’ Under ARU rules, players are ineligible to play for the Wallabies if they are playing outside of Australia. The wild-haired, knockabout winger's Test-winning percentage (77 per cent) is up there with the most successful Wallabies of all time. His success rate increases to 100 per cent when he ‘bags some meat’ as only Cummins would describe it. The Honey Badger has gained a cult following around his persona with an impressive total of four Facebook pages dedicated to his endless entertaining quotes, and even a song has been written in his honour. The 'Honey Badger' has gained a cult following around his persona with an impressive total of four Facebook pages dedicated to his endless entertaining quotes and even a song has been written in his honour. While Cummins will be out of Test action for the foreseeable future, the Force are working out ways for the Japanese club to loan the cult hero back to them - a la George Smith with the Brumbies in 2013 - for next year's Super Rugby season, which will begin in mid-February. 'It's hoped the conditions of Cummins' release will allow him to play with the Force again next year,' a statement from the Force said on Friday. Cummins' decision to accept the Japanese offer wasn't necessarily a surprise to the Force, but the timing of the unexpected West Red Sparks' announcement certainly was.

"By . Darren Boyle . This is the stunning luxury £530,000 home Oscar Pistorius planned to move into with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp until she was shot dead in his bathroom. Pistorious paid a deposit on the enormous 4-bedroom property after agreeing a nine million rand price with the owner after visiting it with his girlfriend. The pair had told friends of their plans to move from Pistorius' house in Pretoria to their new home in Johannesburg. Oscar Pistorius agreed to purchase the luxury Johannesburg property, pictured, for nine million Rand (£530,000) after visiting it with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The property is located in the prosperous Sandton suburb of Johannesburg and features a massive open-plan living area leading to a wonderful barbecue terrace . Along from the state-of-the art kitchen is a marble-topped breakfast bar area, right, while there is also a more formal dining room area, left, with seating for ten people . The couple had been dating for just four months when she was shot on Valentines Day 2013. Pistorius had planned to install a state-of-the-art security system in the house which is located in the affluent suburb of Sandton. According to the Daily Telegraph the athlete told friends that he wanted to move into the new home because he was afraid for Ms Steenkamp's safety. Much of Ms Steenkamp's career was based around Johannesburg and Pistorius was afraid for her safety driving between to his home and work. A friend said: 'He trained in Pretoria but could do his gym workouts in Johannesburg. They had talked about moving in together and were really excited about it.' The couple . had planned to move into the magnificent 8,000 square foot two-storey . property after Pistorius agreed to buy it in December 2012. Pistorius . especially liked the property because of its location at the end of a . tree-lined road surrounded by high walls and electronically controlled . security gates. The property is on half-an-acre of land and even has accommodation for domestic staff. The grounds had a large pool and gardens with four garages. Oscar . Pistorius, right, wanted to move to Johannesburg so his girlfriend, . Reeva Steenkamp, left, could be far to her modelling assignments and . business meetings . The luxury property sits on a half-acre of land and is located at the end of a tree-lined avenue behind high walls and protected by electronic security gates . Each of the property's four bedrooms has its own en-suite facility and there are even quarters for the domestic staff as well as four garages and a large garden . Pistorius' trial resumed last week after a lengthy adjournment so the Olympian could undergo intense psychiatric evaluation. The trial had heard earlier that Steenkamp had spent part of the night she died looking at interior design websites. The couple had intended decorating their new home together. His trial heard that Pistorius has a 'split personality' with a superstar status in front of the cameras and a private life as a disabled man. His legal team described said he was acting out of 'morbid fear not anger' when he shot dead his girlfriend. As the Paralympic star’s lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal team have been at pains to paint a picture of Pistorius as a highly vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every day of his life,  rather than the self-obsessed, gun-toting hothead that the prosecution has portrayed him to be. Reading from a psychiatric report into Pistorius’ mindset, defence counsel Kenny Oldwadge told Pretoria’s High Court the runner was 'the international superstar more confident and in control' standing six feet tall on his famous carbon blades 'versus the vulnerable and fearful disabled person' barely five feet on his stumps. Pistorius, 27, is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp by shooting four bullets through a locked toilet door at his home in the South African capital on Valentine’s Day last year during a heated argument.  The double amputee told the court he was convinced she was an intruder and fired his 9mm pistol accidentally out of fear and panic, having gone to investigate noises coming from the cubicle. Professor Wayne Derman,  who specialises in treating disabled athletes, is the final witness to appear in defence of the sprinter who,  the professor said, in his daily life is a far cry from the image Pistorius shows to the world. 'Although he loathes to be pitied in any way, the hard truth is that he does not have lower legs.  You’ve got a paradox, of an individual who is supremely able and an individual who is significantly disabled,'  Prof Derman said. Prof Derman will face a second day of gruelling cross-examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel when the trial resumes on Monday. Pistorius, whose carbon running prosthetics have earned him the nickname  the ‘Blade Runner’, denies murder and three firearms charges.","Oscar Pistorius agreed to pay £530,000 for the 8,000 square foot house in Johannesburg in December 2012 .

"By . Dan Miller . Fewer than half the people in the UK realise that the First World War extended beyond Europe, a new report has shown. Research by the British Council found most people's knowledge of the Great War - which began 100 years ago - is limited to the trench warfare and fighting on the Western Front. The document - Remember The World As Well As The War - reveals a lack of understanding of the global scale and impact of the war, and calls on the UK and the rest of the world to use the centenary commemorations to better understand of the global nature of the conflict. American troops advance wearing gas masks in France in 1918.  Fewer than half the Britons questioned knew that North America played a role in WWI . The report was produced from research carried out for the British Council by YouGov, which surveyed between 1,000 and 1,200 people online in the UK, as well as in Egypt, France, Germany, India, Russia, and Turkey. It found that in the UK, fewer than half of the 1,081 people questioned were aware that North America and the Middle East played a part in the First World War (38per cent and 34per cent respectively), while less than a quarter realised that Africa and Asia were involved (21per cent and 22per cent). The research also found a widespread lack of understanding about the impact of the war - while 62per cent of people in the UK were aware of its connection to the rise of the Nazis in Germany, far fewer (37per cent) were aware of the link with the rise of Communism in Russia.

Lord Kitchener inspects trenches during Gallipoli campaign . Less than a third of UK respondents associated the war with the fall of the Ottoman Empire (32per cent) or the creation of the United Nations (27per cent), and just 11per cent were aware of its connection with the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Across the seven countries, almost three-quarters of people surveyed (72 per cent) believed that their country was still affected by the consequences of the war, the research found. And the conflict still influences overseas views of the UK, with 45 per cent of people questioned in India and 28per cent in France and Russia saying the UK's role in the war had a positive effect on how they view it today. But in contrast, 34 per cent in Turkey and 22 per cent in Egypt said it had a negative effect.The report, published today, calls on the UK and the rest of the world to use centenary commemorations to help people recognise the ongoing impact of the war on relationships between countries around the world.

'But we shouldn't forget that the war touched many other parts of the world. Far more countries fought and were affected than we generally think. 'Even a hundred years later a person from the UK travelling for business or pleasure will find the war still influences the way people overseas view the UK. Sacrifice: The report calls on the UK and the rest of the world to use centenary commemorations to help people recognise the ongoing impact of the war on relationships between countries around the world . 'So knowing a little about the global reach of the conflict and its lasting effects will help anyone better understand and navigate the many different reasons people from other countries see us as they do.'

"By . Steve Hopkins . A football researcher claims to have identified an 'unsaveable zone' in the goal area, which could boost players’ chances of scoring in the World Cup penalty shoot-outs. Dr Ken Bray has analysed hours of footage to determine the reach of a goalkeeper when attempting a save, known as a diving envelope. He believes players who aim outside the diving envelope - the 'unsaveable zone' - have more than an 80per cent chance of success at scoring during a shoot-out. Scroll down for video . David Beckham lines up to take a penalty kick against Argentina during the 2002 World Cup . The unsaveable zones have been identified in the study as the left and right top corners of the goal, which sit just outside the goalkeepers diving envelope . Frank Lampard watches on hopefully as Portgual goalkeeper Ricardo Pereira saves his penalty kick during their quater final World Cup match in 2006; Portugal went on to win 3-1 on penalties . Statistics from previous competitions suggest that around a third of matches from the knock-out stages - starting this weekend with host Brazil playing Chile - will be decided by a shoot-out. Dr Bray, of the University of Bath, claims good physical and mental preparation could 'dramatically improve' the chances of the remaining 16 teams. 'Success in the shoot-out is something that teams can improve. From my research I’ve shown that there are really three key points to take the perfect penalty,' Dr Bray said. 'Firstly, coaches must choose from the best available group of players when the shoot-out comes around. Secondly, players must ensure they use good placement technique. And lastly, teams need to work on players’ mental preparation for penalties.' England's David Batty watches as his penalty is saved by Carlos Roa of Argentina during the 1998 World Cup . Chris Waddle misses his penalty attempt during a World Cup semi-final against Germany in 1990 . Dr Bray’s research, based on statistics from previous competitions, shows that for some teams left in the World Cup, such as Germany, success in shoot-outs seems to come naturally. Germany has won about 80 per cent of their penalty encounters, while England has been successful in just 17 per cent of theirs. Dr Bray said his research to identify the 'unsaveable zone' could help teams left in the World Cup who are less talented at shoot-outs, such as the Netherlands - who have won 20per cent of penalties shootouts. This graphs shows various teams success rates in taking penalties with Germany leading the pack at 83per cent, while England is successful just 17per cent of the time . 'Our research at Bath shows that goalies have only a finite reach when attempting a save,' Dr Bray said. 'We call this reach the ‘diving envelope’. Strikers can place the ball close to the diving envelope, or even a little inside, with reasonable chances of successes. 'We call the area outside the diving envelope the unsaveable zone. Our research shows that just over 80 per cent of shots, around four out of five, played into this area succeed.' In a video named How To Take The Perfect Penalty, Dr Bray argues that coaches must be in charge of selecting players for the shoot-out, instead of waiting for the players to decide between them. The researcher, author of How To Score: Science and The Beautiful Game, also prescribes techniques such as mental imaging for dealing with stress, with players visualising a perfectly placed shot in the ‘unsaveable’ zone.","Researcher analysed hours of footage to determine a goalkeeper's reach .

The thirteen Iguanas, one of which was dead, had been stuffed inside a sock and then wrapped in a towel . All their clothes had been stuffed into one suitcase and Border Agency officers checked the second one they had. 'In . the other suitcase the thirteen Iguanas, one of which was dead, were . found. Each had been wrapped inside a sock and then wrapped in a blue . towel. 'They had been in the hold in the suitcase during the eight-hour flight. 'They come from a hot country and were in the cold hold all that time and must have suffered. 'Brita said she did not know what they were and was given them by a man called ‘Robert’ in a beach bar and was not paid.' It . is unknown what the final destination was for the reptiles, but Miss . Reiss added: 'They are valued at ten thousand pounds each and that’s a . minimum, they could be sold illegally for up to twenty thousand pounds . each.' Judge Phillip Matthews told the first-time offenders, who have been . locked-up in HMP Holloway since their arrest: 'You are two . highly-intelligent, well travelled young women who chose to act in the . way you did free of pressure. 'There is a market for such creatures . and for as long as people such as yourselves perpetrate the facility for . them to be smuggled out of the Bahamas that trade will continue.' Grant . Miller from the Border Force’s endangered species team said: 'This . particular species of iguana in incredibly rare - only a few hundred are . believed to be left in existence - so this was remarkable and very . important seizure. 'Given the circumstances we found them in it seems incredible that all but one survived such a long flight.' The animals were dehydrated and placed into the care of a specialist vet where they remain. One of the 12 surviving iguanas smuggled which were discovered by customs at Heathrow Airport. The haul had a potential black market value of £260,000 . 'The rarity of this particular species made this an incredibly significant seizure. The iguanas are critically endangered and in effect priceless. 'This makes it all the more shocking that someone was willing to take them from their habitat and transport them halfway around the world in these kinds of conditions. 'We are now working with the Bahamian authorities to try to return them to where they belong.' The women were on their way to Dusseldorf, Germany, with the San Salvador rock iguanas, which are native to the Bahamas and classed as being under threat of extinction. The 12 lizards which survived the trip were given to experts in the UK, who aim to return them to the Caribbean. Sarah Goddard, from WWF, said: 'At a time that criminal gangs are threatening the very future existence of some of our most precious animals, it is good to see UK authorities clamping down on the traffickers posing a serious threat to the survival of endangered species such as these iguanas. 'These convictions are a victory for all those fighting wildlife crime.'","Romanians caught at Heathrow after stepping off flight from the Bahamas .

The group of 58 workers have been holed up in the now defunct Bosal-le-Rapide auto factory in Beine-Nauroy, northern France, since the business shut down in February and are demanding bosses pay them an extra €40,000 (£32,922) on top of the €8,000 (£6,584) they have been offered as a severance package. They have told the factory's parent company, Bosal, that if they want the building to be handed back over intact, they must agree a better deal for the workers.

To prove their seriousness, they have set fires outside the building, which firefighters had to deal with today. When Bosal, the company which owns the factory, laid off 86 workers in 2012, due to falling market share, workers halted production for two weeks and twice kidnapped executives for several hours. In this previous dispute, the laid off workers were also initially offered €8,000. The strike was called off after the company agreed to boost this to €25,000 (£20,576).

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It’s 40 times more aerodynamic than a Bugatti Veyron, has a top speed of 90mph (145kph), and generates enough power to light the average home. And while it might not look anything like it, this strange design is in fact a pedal-powered bike enclosed in a aerodynamic carbon fibre shell. Dubbed the Arion1 Velocipede, the bike is being designed by a team of UK engineering students who believe it will become the fastest human-powered vehicle in history. What is this strange design? While it might not look anything like it, this unusual vehicle is in fact a pedal-powered bike enclosed in a aerodynamic carbon fibre shell . The University of Liverpool Velocipede Team (ULVT) are hoping their design will break the 83.13 mph (133.7kph) record set in September 2013 by TU Delft and VU Amsterdam universities. Arion1 will be designed, manufactured and ready to race by May 2015, and will attempt the record in September 2015 at the World Human Power Speed Challenge in Battle Mountain, Nevada. ‘This is no ordinary bicycle you would see cycling up and down the high street,’ team Leader Ben Hogan, 22, told MailOnline. ‘The rider is positioned almost lying down, as close to the ground as possible. This style of cycling is known as “recumbent” cycling. An aerial view of the Arion1 Velocipede at the early design stage (left) and a view of the current design (right) The bike is encased in a lightweight carbon fibre shell with the rider cycling in a near-horizontal position. The . design of the Arion1 exterior shell uses the same science used in the . design of aircraft wings – adopting an inverted ‘teardrop’ shape to cut . through the air as easily as possible. The vehicle emits zero carbon emissions, weighs less . than 55lbs (25kg), is 98.4 per cent efficient and will travel at almost . double the current sprint cycling record. The rider will be just five inches (13 cm) from the floor and will need to generate over 700 watts of pure human power to get to top speed. It’s 40 times more aerodynamic than a Bugatti Veyron, has a top speed of 90mph (145kph), and generates enough power to light the average home. The team said they will reveal more secrets about their design in the near future. ‘The whole bicycle is enclosed in a lightweight carbon fibre shell, giving the vehicle a streamlined shape which allows it to cut through the air more easily. ‘ . The unusual shape of the Arion1’s exterior shell improves the aerodynamic behaviour of the vehicle as air resistance is the biggest challenge to maintaining speed. The design uses the same concept as aircraft wings adopting an inverted ‘teardrop’ shape to cut through the air as easily as possible. ‘The frontal area of the vehicle is as as small as possible, seating the rider in a l position as low to the ground as possible ensures that air resistance is further minimised,’ said Mr Hogan. The rider will be just five inches (13 cm) from the floor and will need to generate over 700 watts of pure human power to get to top speed.

Move over Bugatti: The bike is 40 times more aerodynamic than a Bugatti Veyron (pictured), has a top speed of 90mph (145kph), and generates enough power to light the average home . Philippa Oldham, head of transport at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: ‘To get to the speeds they intend to, the team will have to make sure everything is perfect, from the vehicle’s aerodynamics to the size of its wheels. ‘It’s an extremely tough ask to get a human powered vehicle to travel at 90mph (144kph) – and a leap into the unknown – but with the right engineering approach it is possible. ‘ . The bike also needs to house a rider, a frame and a transmission system powerful enough to allow the vehicle to reach the tremendous speeds required to clinch the world record. ‘The project is no simple undertaking, but at this stage, after just six months on the project, we are in a great position,’ said Mr Hogan.

"By . Darren Boyle . A woman was taken to hospital in a fire engine after being cut free from a car crash because there were no ambulances available. Saira Khalid, 22, was trapped inside her brand new BMW One Series after colliding with another car in Preston, Lancashire, and had to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance which never turned up. But firefighters came to the rescue by driving her the one-mile journey to the Royal Preston Hospital on a spinal stretcher. Firemen cut off the roof off Saira Khalid's new car while they waited for an ambulance to take her to hospital . A bystander, who phoned 999 twice in a desperate attempt to summon paramedics, said: 'It was unbelievable. 'The woman was in distress and complaining of neck pain. The fire brigade were brilliant in the way they dealt with it. But no-one could believe an ambulance didn’t show.' Miss Khalid, a customer services advisor from Ribbleton, Lancashire, had to be cut out of her vehicle after colliding with a Volkswagen on Wednesday evening. The fire crew cut the top off the vehicle and removed her using a spinal board  and neck support, before securing her on the engine’s floor to transport her to  safety. Her sister Nadia Hussain, 34, said: “I can’t praise the fire crew enough. They stayed with her, supporting her head all that time. 'The police made several phone calls to the ambulance. The fire service were  also talking to them. But we waited and waited and nothing happened. 'In the end the fire crew decided they needed to get her to hospital, so they lifted her up and slid the spinal board into the back of the fire engine and off they went.' Firemen carefully slid Ms Khalid on a spinal board, top left, before removing her from the wrecked car, top right . The fire crew moved Ms Khalid, bottom left, and put her in the fire engine to take her to hospital, bottom right . North West Ambulance Service said it has now started an inquiry into why an emergency crew didn’t attend the scene. A spokesman said: 'Our initial views are that it was down to the numbers of life-threatening and serious cases we were dealing with at the time. 'There isn’t an awful lot we can say at the moment as this incident is being investigated.' Miss Khalid, who is now recovering at home, suffered just bruising in the accident and X-rays at the hospital showed she didn’t have any spinal damage or broken bones. Ms Khalid suffered bruises and some minor burns from the airbags deploying in the crash . Her sister said: 'When I got to the scene I was shocked to see her trapped inside the car. 'I lost another sister in a traffic accident at the age of four and it brought all that trauma back. My first thought was: ""Oh my God, not again."" 'We’re all relieved Saira is OK. I don’t blame the paramedics, I blame the Government for cutting back so much on the emergency services. 'There may have been other 999 calls to deal with that night, but you’d like to think there are enough ambulance crews to deal with every one of them. It shouldn’t be up to firefighters to take their place.' A local resident who lives yards from the accident scene said: 'The poor girl was crying and clearly in pain and shock. She was cold, as well. 'We all waited, expecting an ambulance to come. But after 90 minutes they still hadn’t shown, so the fire brigade took her to hospital. We’re all glad she’s OK.' A spokesman for Lancashire Fire and Rescue said: 'The driver had neck pain, arm injuries and burns from the airbag, so we asked for an ambulance to attend. 'But there were no ambulances available in Preston at that time, they were all  dealing with higher priority cases. Our crew stayed with her to see if an ambulance would arrive. But later the ambulance service contacted us and asked if we could take her to hospital, which we did. 'It is quite rare for this to happen, although it isn’t unheard of. It is not something we do without getting permission from the ambulance service to move the casualty. 'On this occasion they were very busy and it made more sense for the fire engine to take her.' Ms Khalid's brand new BMW One Series car was completely destroyed in Wednesday night's accident . Bob Parkinson, Unite branch secretary for North West Ambulance Service, said: 'We are very concerned to to hear about this incident and are demanding urgent answers as we have now reached a position which is unacceptable. 'We and the people of Lancashire need a thorough explanation as to what has  happened and reassurances that it will not occur again. 'This has happened at a time when we are fighting cuts to front-line services across Lancashire.'","Saira Khalid was trapped in her brand new BMW One series after the crash .

"By . Darren Boyle . A John Lennon fan has become an internet sensation after his tattoo of the singer looked more like Harry Potter than the Beatles star. The inking has been branded a 'tattoo fail' by Still Game actor Greg Hemphill who Tweeted: 'Imagine all the wizards*'. The hilarious image was sent to a specialist Twitter account that deals with unfortunate tattoos before going viral. Imagine there's no resemblance . . . it's very easy if you try: An un-named John Lennon fan wanted to get a tattoo featuring the image of the former Beatles star, right, but ended up with one looking like Harry Potter, left . Social media users began immediately sharing the image including their own acerbic comments on the artwork. One Twitter user called Ahammersfan said: 'It looks like John Lennon after a stroke.' A second, Lubo1967 added: 'Jesus H Christ looks like Harry Potter with a broken nose.' It is unlikely that the artist intended drawing the popular fictional wizard after including the word 'Imagine' and a peace sign underneath the dubious portrait. A charitable Matt McFarlane said the image resembled 'a young John Lennon', although another user suggested Harry Potter would be able to 'magic all the spots away'. The tattoo is being widely lampooned on Twitter as it looks far more like Harry Potter than John Lennon . Blue, manager of the Into You tattoo studio in Clerkenwell, London said: 'Obviously this is the work of a very bad tattoo artist. It is unforgivable for a client to go in looking for an image of John Lennon and go home with Harry Potter. 'Before getting any tattoo a client should fully research the studio beforehand. There are very good studios with excellent artists. They will have extensive portfolios in the studio and in many cases online so you can assess the quality of this work. 'In cases such as this, it is possible to get the tattoo removed by laser although that is incredibly expensive. Maybe it would be cheaper for the person involved to buy a few Harry Potter books and become a fan.'","The un-named man posted the photograph of his 'John Lennon' tattoo online .

"By . Sam Creighton . The government has abandoned plans to hold a vote on repealing the controversial hunting ban before the next election. Despite the coalition agreement pledging that MPs would be allowed a free vote on the highly-strung issue, senior Conservatives have decided there is no point holding a vote before the election as most MPs support the status quo. However, The Times reports that David Cameron has been issued a stern warning by countryside groups that rural communities will be less inclined to support the Conservative's election campaign if a promise to repeal the ban is not included in the Tory manifesto. Fox hunting has been banned since 2004 and the Tories have now dropped their pledge to reverse this decision before the next election . Some pro-hunting groups already feel let-down by the Conservatives, who promised to lift the ban in their 2010 manifesto. However, others accept that waiting until a vote is more likely to pass is the right move. Simon Hart, Tory MP for Carmarthen West, who is also on the board of the Countryside Alliance, told The Times he would not 'shed too many tears' over the decision to drop the vote. He said: 'I would much rather vote on the real thing when we think we have got the numbers to alter the outcome. The manifesto has got to be clear and unequivocal [about repealing the act].' The Hunting Act is one of the most controversial measures of Tony Blair's premiership and he has since expressed regret and pushing it through the Commons . Abandoning the vote has avoided another potential bust-up in the Coalition, as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that even if the vote went ahead and the majority of MPs favoured lifting the ban, the Liberal Democrats would not agree to scrap the Act. The Hunting Act was introduced by Tony Blair in 2004 and has proved to be one of the most controversial domestic measures of his premiership. Mr Blair has since expressed his regret at pushing the legislation through.","Senior Tories drop pledge to hold vote despite it being signed off in coalition agreement .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . From folk-rock legends to reformed West African idols, WOMAD really is the place to find all the world’s music in a single weekend. New Orleans brass bands, Peruvian psychedelists, jungle MCs, one-string bluesmen, cello-carrying troubadours… There’s even a duo playing scorching post-rock as an accompaniment to recordings from public information films. The full line-up features around 100 artists from 40 countries performing over the festival weekend, including such luminaries as Youssou N'Dour, Bobby Womack, Alice Russell, Nitin Sawhney and Fat Freddy's Drop. Bobby Womack will be a surefire pull for the mainstage this year. Very few of the great, great soul singers are still with us, a species nearing extinction with the dimming of the day. Legend: Great soul singer Bobby Womack, left, may well touch glory on the mainstage while. right, Yossou N'Dour has still got the powerful voice he launched onto the scene over three decades ago . A festival like no other: Families, teens, 40-something world music aficianados - everyone loves Womad . Charlton Park in Wilshire is the idylllic setting for tents, vans, campers and picnics for the weekend of July 24-27 . But Bobby Womack is enjoying the golden, late-afternoon glow of a career that, while undeniably bumpy, has also touched glory on many occasions. Over the last three decades, Youssou Ndour has achieved plenty: touring with Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman on the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! shows; scoring pop hits alongside Neneh Cherry, launching an unsuccessful presidential campaign back home in Senegal… . But one of the most notable observations of such a highly colourful, extraordinarily successful career is the preservation of that voice, which is as keen and insistent as it ever was. Richard Thompson is back by popular demand while, right, English folk singer Kathryn Williams also makes a welcome return to the stage . Groovin on a sunny afternoon: The crowd at Womad are a friendly, enthusiastic bunch . Recently the third wave of performers has been confirmed and includes Richard Thompson, Amjad Ali Khan, Kathryn Williams, and Public Service Broadcasting. From his teenage years in the embryonic Fairport Convention to his impeccable 30-year career as a solo artist, Richard Thompson has been a colossus in the kingdom of folk-rock. A peerless guitarist and a biting lyricist, it’s been a long time since he was last welcomed to a WOMAD stage. Meanwhile aficionados of classic-era West African bands will be pleased by a strong line up, including the reformed Les Ambassadeurs. Amjad Ali Khan, renowned Sarod player with his sons Amaan and Ayaan will inject wonderful Indian music into the mix . No introduction needed: Fat Freddy's Drop will add in their inimitable style to the Womad vibe . WOMAD . After huge solo success, Salif Keita will once again be fronting them at Charlton Park. There's a fine tradition of British female singers taking soul music back to its American source. Dusty Springfield was the first, followed in more recent times by Amy Winehouse. Brighton's own Alice Russell is the latest - her smouldering track Breakdown will stay with you long after this gig ends. Admirers of Indian classic music are catered for with Amjad Ali Khan, arguably the foremost master of the sarod, the Hindustani stringed instrument. He will be accompanied by his sons Amaan and Ayaan, both distinguished sarod players themselves. One of the most interesting projects to rise out of the UK music scene in recent years is Public Service Broadcasting, the inventive duo who use the narration of public information films to create stirring soundscapes. The 14-legged reggae-soul groove machine that is Fat Freddy's Drop will also draw the crowds. 'We're a motley bunch of dudes, really. We're all from different backgrounds and different appreciations of music and styles,' says Mark Williams, aka MC Slave of the reggae-soul juggernaut known and saluted the world over as Fat Freddy's Drop. Stylish: Alice Russell, left, soul singer extraordinaire hails from Brighton and will please the crowds with her slinky soulful voice. Right: 'Can I have my toy back now mum?' Another inventive combo to emerge of late is the Mercury-nominated Dave Omuku & The Invisible, who make their WOMAD debut in the company of Noisettes singer Shingai Shoniwa and a 40-strong choir for a vocal-based performance entitled Stars Align. British singer Kathryn Williams, fresh from rave reviews for her latest album Crown Electric also graces the main stage. Congo Natty was one of the original jungle pioneers and, a couple of decades on, the MC is still defiantly telling it like it is, his lyrics both spiritual and street-wise. One-third of reggae legends The Gladiators and a session musician at iconic Jamaican studios like the Black Ark and Studio One, Clinton Fearon is a roots-reggae veteran who’ll be playing both solo and with his diamond-hard outfit The Boogie Brown Band. Arts and crafts: As well as a variety of workshops for children, resident crafty people will be on hand to keep little ones entertained . The answer is blowin in the wind: Around 40,000 people will be wandering the site enjoying themselves every day . With WOMAD attracting musicians and revelers from every corner of the globe, the festival also welcomes an amazing array of culinary backgrounds, and in 2014 will celebrate this annual fusion of flavours by becoming a foodie heaven in its own right. Culinary institution the Taste the World Stage, and WOMAD’s poly-ethnic range of food traders will this year be joined by a new Taste the World Restaurant and a Children’s Cookery Workshop. A live cookery session comes with lively discussion, a party atmosphere and, more often than not, ends with an impromptu gig. Local, seasonal, wild and natural food will come from all around the globe, using the best ethically sourced ingredients. Quite apart from the big name players, one of the delights of WOMAD is being able to make a journey without maps, to wander around the site to wherever the music guides you. Such intrepid exploration will doubtless uncover some new musical heroes. The first wave of performers announced included Youssou N'Dour, Bobby Womack, Manu .

"By . Sam Creighton . The world's most complete preserved mammoth will go on display at the Natural History Museum next month. The baby mammoth, discovered in Siberia in 2007, will be the centrepiece of a special three-month exhibition at the London museum. It will be the first time is has been shown in Western Europe. The female mammoth is a little larger than a dog and is thought to have died 42,000 years ago when it was only one month old. Lyuba the baby mammoth (pictured) who is housed in a glass case in the exhibition, measures 33inches (85cm) tall and 51 inches (130cm) long - a little larger than a dog . The remains were found by reindeer Yuri Khudi and his sons, left, while they were gathering firewood. It was then sent to the Shemanovsky Musuem, right, in Russia, which is now Lyuba's permanent home . Lyuba's body was preserved when it sank into mud which later froze. It has been buried for 40,000 years in a vacuum, which has meant that oxygen has not decomposed the remains . It was found by Siberia's Yuribei river, several mammoth remains have been unearthed in the area . The discovery in 2007 caused excitement in the scientific community because of Lyuba's completeness. Here, scientists make observations in Siberia where the body was found . The discovery by Lyuba Yuri Khudi and his sons, one of whom is pictured with the mammoth, was a complete accident . Experts believe that its body was buried in wet clay and mud which then froze, preserving it until she was found by reindeer herder Yuri Khudi and his sons while they were searching for firewood along the banks of the Yuribei river. The mammoth has been nicknamed Lyuba - after Mr Khudi's wife, whose name is Russian for 'love' - and is one of a number of the animals to have been found close to the north-west Siberian river in recent years. The mammoth is 130 centimeters long by 80 centimetres wide, similar in size to a large dog . After being discovered, it was examined by scientists at Russia's Shemanovsky Museum, pictured . Lyuba has previously been displayed in Russia, Hong Kong and Chicago but this will be the first time in Western Europe . Until recently, Lyuba was held by the Shemanovsky Museum in Russia - and has previously been part of exhibitions in Chicago and Hong Kong - but will go on display to the British public on May 23. Professor Adrian Lister, a mammoth researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: 'It's an honour to be showcasing the world's best preserved mammoth for the first time in western Europe. 'Lyuba is hugely important for helping us to understand the lives of ice age animals.

"By . Sam Creighton . Timothy Millender continued working for the clinic despite being a convicted paedophile . A paedophile was allowed to run a clinic offering treatments to young children for two months after a court found him guilty of his sickening crimes. Timothy Millender, 32, continued to work at Redwood Health Therapies, in Winchester, Hampshire, which offered hypnotherapy to youngsters under 16, despite being given a six month suspended sentence for hoarding vile images of babies being raped and tortured. Millender pleaded guilty at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court to having 740 pictures and 106 videos of children as young as six months being abused. Some of the films were level five, the most extreme level possible. On top of his suspended sentence, he was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register but still went back to work at the clinic. Millender was listed as a director of the company which, according to the Sunday Mirror, was hastily shut down last week. However, the website is still live and claims the hypnotherapy sessions 'help children to free themselves of their bottled up emotions' by using the 'Blowaway Technique' - a popular form of therapy where children are hypnotised into a physically relaxed state and then told to literally 'blow away' any bad feelings or problems they may have. A former employee told the Sunday Mirror: 'It's shocking a convicted paedophile could carry on running a business advertising services for children. 'The images he was looking at were of the very worst kind yet he walked free from court and was able to carry on running the clinic for two months after he pleaded guilty. It's disgusting.' Redwood Health Therapies in Winchester, the clinic run by Millender for months after his conviction . The clinic rebranded itself St Giles Health and Beauty earlier this month. It claimed to be under new management, although Millender was still listed as a director. However, clients who turned up for appointments last week found the door locked. The clinic has been approached for comment.","Timothy Millender, 32, collected pictures and videos of child abuse .

"By . Sam Creighton . A war hero praised for his bravery in Iraq died after being buried under an avalanche while on a skiing training exercise. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney, 26, who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq, was taking part in a training trip in the German Alps in preparation for deployment in Afghanistan with 15 Squadron of the RAF Regiment. The exercise, named 'Snow Eagle' was designed to expose servicemen to hostile terrains and during one descent, SAC Mahoney and two of his comrades were engulfed by a snow slide. While the other two were rescued, SAC Mahoney was buried and, by the time he was dragged clear nine minutes later, was dead. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney was praised for his service as a gunner in Basra during his six month tour in Iraq . After the incident, on February 4, 2010, a major investigation was launched and the leader of the expedition, Flight Sgt Stephen Henderson, was charged with manslaugher - although later cleared at a court martial. It was alleged Flt Sgt Henderson failed to comply with safety regulations and ignored avalanche warnings when he led the 23 serviceman down a slope. However, an inquest into SAC Mahoney's death, held at Warrington Coroners' Court yesterday, recorded a verdict of accidental death. On the morning of the tragedy, the inquest heard Flt Sgt Henderson, who was leading the trip along with four other qualified instructors, was warned about poor weather conditions and that a level three avalanche warning - out of a possible five levels - had been issued for the area. However, he evaluated the slopes and decided the expedition should go ahead. The group left the Grasgehren ski resort in Bavaria, Germany, with the plan of climbing the Reidberger Horn mountain and then skiing down to a hut where they would spend the night. SAC Mahoney had been in the RAF for two years at the time of his death . It was on the descent that the group heard a 'woomph' sound, indicating that a weak layer of snow had collapsed beneath the surface. However, while Flt Sgt Henderson sent some students back to the ridge, he concluded the snowpack was stable and the group could continue. Two instructors stayed at the top and the students descended at 20 metre intervals with everyone intending to meet at the bottom. The avalanche struck while the group was halfway down the slope. The inquest heard that the slide was caused by sun and wind conditions, although the earlier court martial was told that it could have been triggered by the serviceman skiing over the unstable service in too large groups. Many . of the 23 servicemen were either at the bottom or within their final . stages of descent when the 400 metres wide and 200 metres long . avalanche hit. Along with SAC Mahoney, SAC Shepherd and Cpl Murray were also caught up in the collapse. SAC . Shepherd was only buried up to his waist and managed for free himself and while Cpl Murray was completely covered apart from his hand, he was quickly pulled free. SAC Mahoney was 'completely buried' and it took nine minutes later to find him, by which point he was not breathing. His comrades tried to revive him and rescue helicopters were sent to the scene but SAC Mahoney was declared dead on the mountainside. Paul Mahoney's, centre, family said they knew 'how proud he was about being in the RAF regiment' SAC Mahoney was only 26 when he died in 2010, shortly before he was due to be deployed in Afghanistan . During Flt Sgt Henderson’s court martial his legal team said that 'backcountry skiing' involved an element of risk-taking and that the he had viewed the slope as shallow and not avalanche prone. Chris . Hill, defence counsel, said: 'This is adventurous training and not a . leisure facility. The purpose was to make a journey and hopefully get to . the next hut,' he said, adding that 'rules are not to be adhered to . slavishly.' At . the end of the four-week court martial in July 2012, the six-member . board acquitted Flt Sgt Henderson. Two other servicemen were caught in the avalanche, but were pulled out in time. It was nine minutes before SAC Mahoney was dragged clear of the snow, by which point he had died . SAC Mahoney had driven armoured vehicles in Basra and was one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq . At the time of his death, SAC Mahoney - who had joined the armed forces in 2008 - was praised as a 'brave and determined' gunner who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. He had been driving Bulldog armoured vehicles on patrols in Basra. The RAF Regiment is the ground fighting force of the RAF, providing security for bases and carrying out patrol functions. In a statement released by his family at the time of his death they said: 'We wish to convey how proud we were of him and we knew how proud he was about being in the RAF Regiment. He was ""one of the lads"" who was always there for his mates.' Paying tribute to SAC Mahoney the RAF said: 'He kept us safe as he steered his armoured vehicle through the outskirts of Basrah. 'He lived life to the full and has been taken from us unexpectedly and far too early. 'Our thoughts are with his family and close friends at this difficult time. 'He will not be forgotten and his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.' A full . service inquiry was also carried out in the aftermath of SAC Mahoney’s . death by the Ministry of Defence which has since made eight . recommendations in relation to the Snow Eagle exercise and seven . recommendations in relation to the wider conduct of service training. The inquest was told that 11 of the recommendations had been fully implemented and a further four were underway. A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'Our thoughts remain with SAC Mahoney’s family and friends at this difficult time. 'A full Service Inquiry has been conducted, and all the recommendations from this have been or are in the process of being implemented, so that we can prevent something like this from ever happening again.'","Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney died in a training accident in 2010 .

"By . Sam Creighton . A fifth person has been arrested over a savage hammer attack at an upmarket London hotel that hospitalised three wealthy tourists. The 32-year-old man was picked up by police today, in Islington, north London, on suspicion of attempted murder and is currently being questioned. Three other men, aged 56, 34 and 32, have already been arrested in connection with the attack, and police have been given more time to quiz them about what happened. A fifth person has been arrested over the attack at the upmarket London hotel, police are still investigating . The Cumberland Hotel, near Marble Arch, has a four-star rating and 1,000 rooms, including a Jimi Hendrix suite . A woman, 31, has also been held on suspicion of handling stolen goods. The attack took place when a lone man managed to get into the seventh-floor room at the four-star Cumberland Hotel, near Marble Arch in London’s West End, in the early hours of Sunday morning. The three victims - sisters from the United Arab Emirates - were asleep in the room at the time and, when one woke up, the man set upon her with a hammer and then turned on the other two before fleeing the hotel in bloodstained clothes. One of the victims, Khuloud Al Muhairi, 36, is still in a critical condition more than four days after the attack. The other two, Fatimah Al Muhairi, 31, and Ohoud Al Muhairi, 34, remain in hospital but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. A fourth woman, who was staying next door when the attack took place and ran down to the first screaming for help, is believed to be 18-year-old relative Shekha Al Mauhairi. The sisters were part of a large family group staying at the hotel while on holiday from the United Arab Emirates . Police believe the suspect entered a room on the seventh floor (stock image of a Cumberland Hotel room) The teenager posted messages on Twitter just moments after the incident. She wrote: 'I am 18 years old and someone has attacked my family.' She then tweeted: 'I'm in London. Some foreigner from London came and attacked us.' In a final tweet she said that she has now moved to another hotel and is being looked after by security. Her tweets have since been deleted. Khuloud Al Muhairi, 36, remains in critical condition but her sisters, while still in hospital, are stable . The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree . It is understood that the three women had deliberately left their door unlocked because they were staying in the hotel as part of a large family group. The wealthy family, arrived in the UK between April 3 and 5 for a holiday of shopping and sightseeing and the women had visited large West End stores the day before they were attacked. No keys were stolen from the hotel and police said there had been no breach of security at the venue. Detectives are scouring CCTV to establish the movements of the women and their attacker earlier in the day. The Cumberland Hotel is near Europe's busiest shopping street, Oxford Street, and has 1,000 rooms including a Jimi Hendrix suite.

"By . Sam Creighton . James Barlow was a successful scientist and pianist before his failing health forced him to give up work . A classically trained pianist has died penniless after government assessors deemed him fit for work and stripped him of his benefits - despite doctors explaining he needed a new heart. Robert Barlow, who died aged 47 in his native Liverpool, had his Employment and Support Allowance stopped after benefit assessors Atos ruled he was healthy enough to hold down a job. Mr Barlow had worked for the Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as a microbiologist for 15 years before poor health forced him to give it up nine years ago. Doctors diagnosed him with severe cardiomyopathy - failure of the heart muscle - and recommended a heart transplant, saying that without it he might have as little as 18 months left to live. However, despite never having a transplant he survived for a further nine years. After years on benefits and despite his diagnosis, in January 2012, Mr Barlow was ruled healthy enough to work and, three months later, his benefits were withdrawn. He also lost his right to free NHS prescriptions. He died almost two years later, in November 2013. Towards the end of his life, Mr Barlow developed a brain tumour, could not walk and struggled to even read due to poor eyesight. His family - backed by Labour MP Luciana Berger - now want the Government to learn lessons from the tragic case. His aunt, Joan Westland, 85, said: 'I don’t know how they expected him to work. Nobody would have loved to work more than him, but he simply couldn’t. 'Robert said he wouldn’t have the heart transplant. 'He . had no commitments and thought it would be better if there was a heart . for it to go to somebody else. We tried to talk him into having the . operation but he wouldn’t do it. 'It’s too late for Robert but there must be so many other people out there who are going through the same thing. It’s horrible. Atos faced criticism for its judgments in a number of cases and has quit its £500million government contract . 'They need to rethink the whole system because they are ruining people’s lives.' A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said Mr Barlow initially challenged the decision to stop his benefits but then withdrew his appeal. His aunt - who was awarded the British Empire Medal for her work for the Government - claimed that was because he became too ill to fight the case. She added: 'Robert had very little money on benefits and nothing at all when his money was stopped. I know there are scroungers but he was not one of them. 'I want these fitness-to-work tests to stop because I don’t want other people going through the same trauma. Robert was very, very distressed after his assessment.' Roger died after a fall at home last November and since then Atos has quit its £500million contract to carry out fit-to-work tests and ministers are looking for a new provider. Wavertree MP Ms Berger, a shadow health minister, raised Mr Barlow's tragic story in the House of Commons last month. She said: 'It’s not enough to change the provider. The whole process needs to be totally redesigned. 'My constituent is someone who lost his life at a time when his ESA was suspended. 'He was too sick to appeal the decision and died while he had no access to benefits.' A DWP spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with Mr Barlow's family. However, it is not true to say he died after being found fit for work. 'Mr Barlow appealed to the Tribunal Service, but the appeal was then withdrawn so we couldn't continue the benefit claim. He died over a year later. 'The WCA was introduced by the previous Government and we knew it wasn't working as well as it should, which is why we introduced a series of independent reviews and have made significant changes to make it better.'","Robert Barlow was a scientist before poor health forced him to give up work nine years ago .

"By . Sam Creighton . Play fights are a long honoured tradition on many a family swimming trip - although they are not usually between mother and son. However, this was the situation today when a mother otter and her pup jokingly came to blows at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey. The pair pushed, prodded, strangled and scrapped in a bid to stay afloat and dunk the other and the whole raucous affair was caught on camera by photographer Sue Edwards, 51. The otters were playfighting so the child could learn how to defend itself before striking out on its own . The scrap between mother Emmy and child Franklyn went on for a little over ten minutes . From the pictures the fight might seem vicious but neither animal was seriously hurting the other . She said: 'These two European Otters were play fighting with each other in open water. 'Otter pups stay with their mum for up to a year after birth and play fighting is an essential part of their development to hone their skills for survival. 'I was fascinated to watch their antics, pushing each other under the water, grabbing, boxing, biting, and wrestling each other. 'However, I was also very much aware that there is a serious side to their behaviour. 'On river systems otters are extremely territorial and fighting is common, particularly in populations that are nearing carrying capacity, and this may result in death.' The fight between the two otters, nicknamed Emmy and Franklyn by the centre's staff, went on for ten minutes and Mrs Edwards took these snaps from only 12 metres away. The snaps were taken by photographer Sue Edwards at the British Wildlife Centre, Lingfield, Surrey . Emmy eventually admitted defeat to Franklyn and went to sleep on the bank to recoup her energy . Otter pups stay with their mothers for up to a year after birth and play fighting is important for development . She said: 'Emmy, as any mother would, admitted defeat and went to sleep on the bank. 'I hope that future generations will continue to have the opportunity to see our native wildlife in their natural habitats. 'I believe we should respect our natural heritage and that our existing countryside. 'The return of otters to most of England has been one of the major conservation success stories of the last 30 years.' Sue Edwards was standing only metres away from the animals to take these fascinating pictures . Hopefully, Franklyn will be able to fend for himself thanks to his mother's training .","Otters Emmy and Franklyn were play fighting at the British Wildlife Centre in Lingfield, Surrey .

"By . Sam Creighton . Giant robots have invaded China. But never fear, it's not the start of some alien takeover or hi-tech world war, it's just a Hollywood publicity stunt. The man behind the multi-billion dollar Transformers movie franchise, Bay, 49, has sent his fleet of Autobots on a tour of the country to drum up interest in the fourth installment of the series. Big, brash and full of explosions, the Transformers movies - which have taken more than $2.6billion at the global box office - embody American cinema's gonzo inclinations. Bumblebee, one of the autobots from Michael Bay's film, strikes a pose as the tour stops in Shenyang, China . It is a hugely popular franchise in China. When the last film was released 2011, it raked in $177.3 million and holds the record as the second highest grossing foreign film ever screened - after James Cameron's Avatar. Three of the key robots from the films - Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and Sentinel Prime - are travelling around China and have been pictured today in Shenyang, in the northeast of the country. Standing at more than 15ft tall, the models cut imposing figures as they tower over local buildings. China plays a key role in the new film, with part of the film's funding coming from Chinese financiers and several sequences being filmed in the region. Transformers: Age of Extinction will be released in the UK on July 10. Sentinel Prime, left, and Optimus Prime, right, cut imposing figures as they stand taller than nearby buildings .

"By . Sam Creighton . The Queen is well known for her love of all things equine. So, there should be little doubt that when she made her historic trip to Ireland in 2011, one of the highlights would have been meeting the country's top trainers, jockeys and racehorses at the Irish National Stud in Kildare. It only seems fair then that, as Irish President Michael D. Higgins - himself an avid racing fan - does the rounds on his state tour, she returns the favour. Meet and greet: Enliven (right) was among the horses to be introduced to racing fan President Higgins . President Higgins was able to admire Micras close up, as he and he wife were given the tour by Mr Balding and his wife Anna Lisa, left . President Higgins and wife Sabina Higgins watch a horse exercise in the Equine Pool at Kingsclere Park House Stables . It was in this spirit that Mr Higgins was invited to admire the Queen's finest animals at the Kingsclere Park House Stables in Berkshire. The Irish Premier and his wife, Sabina Higgins, were given the tour by trainer Andrew Balding - brother of TV presenter Clare - whose family are the current custodians of the prestigious stables. Mr Higgins had the chance to get up close with two of the Queen's prize fillies, Micras and Enliven - who is running at Newbury tomorrow. He was then show the stable's facilities, including the exercise pools. It is not only the Queen who keeps her horses at Kingsclere, they also look after animals from other notable owners - including former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. President Higgins, left, who is an avid race fan, is talked through the facilities at the stables by Andrew Balding, right . The trip to the stables is one of the events on the president's historic state visit to England . However, not all of the trip has been so lighthearted. There was a political fallout when Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness attended a state banquet on Tuesday, especially after former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit commented: 'There's always the possibility that a member of the Real IRA will be so outraged by Mr McGuinness bowing to the Queen that they might shoot him in the back for it. We can but hope.' President Higgins is a regular at the Galway Races . Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said it was unacceptable for a member of the House of the Lords to support the shooting of a political leader. 'I fully understand that Norman Tebbit has himself been a victim of the political conflict and I regret that he has suffered grievously,' said Mr Adams, a former West Belfast MP and now TD for Louth in the Irish parliament. 'However, to publicly advocate the assassination of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness is a shocking throwback to a violent past from which we are seeking to move on.' Mr Adams said his party colleague and ex-IRA commander Mr McGuinness has worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the peace process at considerable risk to himself. Lord Tebbit was injured with his wife during the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton. Mr McGuinness met the Queen again this afternoon, at a reception held at Windsor Castle. It is extremely rare for the Queen to host a second reception - in addition to the banquet - during a state visit. This is being seen as a sign of the importance the Queen attributes to President Higgins's trip, following her own state visit to Ireland, with the Duke of Edinburgh, in 2011. There has been a level of controversy over the attendance of former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, left, at events during the tour .","President Higgins visited the Kingsclere Park House Stables in Berkshire .

"By . Sam Creighton . A Nobel Peace Prize has sold for a staggering $1.16million after being unearthed in a South American pawn shop - more than 11 times what experts estimated it would fetch. The gold medal - only the second Nobel Peace Prize ever to be sold at auction and the first in the United States - was originally awarded to Argentina's Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas in 1936, for his role in ending the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia. Brian Kendrella, president of New York-based Stack's Bowers Galleries, which oversaw the medal's sale at the Whitman Expo conference, in Baltimore, yesterday, said the auction drew half a dozen bidders from six countries. Much of the history of the 1936 Nobel Peace Prize is shrouded in mystery and has sold to an unknown buyer . Carlos Saavedra Lamas was the first Latin American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize . The winning bid, which came in via phone, was from and individual collector from Asia who asked to remain anonymous. The prize sold for $950,000 but buyer's commission brought the final price to $1.16 million. This is only the second Nobel Peace . Prize to come to auction. This award marked the first time someone from . Latin America received the honor. The 1936 recipient was Argentina's . foreign minister, Carlos Saavedra Lamas. Engraved on the side of the medal is the year it was awarded, the recipients name and the words 'Nobel Peace Prize' in French. The prize sold for far more than the gallery's estimate of $50,000 to $100,000. John Kraljenich, a consultant who worked with Stack's Bowers to verify and value the coin, said the publicity drove up the value astronomically. He said: 'The fact that it went internationally viral and people who are not experts or collectors knew about mean meant that we knew it could easily hit seven figures.' Mr Kraljenich was called in to verify the authenticity of the medal, something he said was easy to do. Carlos Saavedra Lamas, born in Buenos . Aires in 1878, was the first Latin American to be awarded the Nobel . Peace Prize. There have since been four more recipients from the region, . most recently Guatemalan campaigner Rigoberta Menchú Tum in 1992. Mr . Lumas was made his country's foreign minister in 1932 and held the post . for six years. When he was appointed, he immediately began work to end . the war that was raging between Paraguay and Bolivia and, after years to . treaties and diplomacy, brought the conflict to a negotiated end in . 1935 - by this point, up to 130,000 people had been killed. He died in 1959, at the age of 80, from a brain hemorrhage. 'It all checked out and everything was as it should be, after 20 or 30 years in this business you can tell if something is fake after about 15 seconds.' He said was a particularly exciting piece to work on. 'This is the most valuable medal that I've gotten to catalogue for auction, it's definitely top of the pyramid in terms of value.' Little is known about what happened to . the medal after Mr Lumas's death in 1959. In 1993, the person who owned . the prize sold it to an unknown South American pawn shop, receiving . only the value of its gold - the 222.4g of the 23-carat precious metal . that makes up the medal would be worth $9,168 (£5,490) on today's . market. It has passed . through the hands of two collectors over the last two decades before . turning up for auction yesterday. Before its sale, it was part of the . Charles A Wharton Collection that was being sold off after its owner's . death. The only other . Nobel Peace Prize known to have sold at auction was the medal awarded to . English MP Sir William Randal Cremer in 1903. It was sold at Sotheby's, . London, in 1985 for £11,550 ($17,440). The medal was awarded in recognition of Mr Lamas's work to end the Chaco War that raged from 1932-1935 .

"By . Sam Creighton . Dozens of teenagers turned out to a vigil on Wednesday evening to pay tribute to three classmates who died in a tragic car crash. Ohio state troopers are investigating the accident that claimed the lives of Wesley Culpepper, 15, Daniel Tittle, 17, and Charles Luthe, 16, at 5.30am on Wednesday morning. Hours after the crash, friends of the teens, who were all students at Tecumseh High School, in Springfield, Ohio, attended a vigil, held behind the school. Wesley Culpepper was the youngest victim, aged 15, his father remembers him as a lover of the outdoors . Daniel Tittle, 17, left, and Charles Luthe, 16, right. All three teen died at the scene of the accident . A spokeswoman for Ohio State Patrol said it is not yet know which teen was driving the Hyundai Sonata or who the vehicle belonged to. Officers say it may be weeks before they can give definitive answers as to why the car flew off the road and crashed into a tree with enough force to split the vehicle in half. All three teens died at the scene. Lieutenant Brian Aller, commander of Ohio State Patrol's Springfield base, told the Dayton Daily News: 'I’ve seen some bad crashes, but to have the vehicle split the way it is, it definitely involves high speed and just some very careless, reckless driving.' The teens' school is currently on spring break but the district will be providing councilling for any students who need support. Jeff Culpepper, Wesley Culpepper's father, told WTDN he will remember his son as an active young man. He said: 'Wesley loved the outdoors. He was a country boy. He liked to wear his cowboy hats and his cowboy boots. 'I thought that they might have been fishing or camping out. That’s about all I know that the boys were going to spend the night and they probably had a camp fire somewhere. 'I know there’s a million thoughts going through my head, different moments and sometimes I can be strong and sometimes I’m really weak and break down.' Officers believe the car was driving at high speeds - well above the 55mph limit - when it veered off the road . It could be weeks before the investigation provides definitive answers as to what caused the accident . Investigating officers have said the speed will have played a key role in the accident - the car is thought to have been going well over the 55mph speed limit - and Mr Culpepper wants teenagers to take a lesson from the tragic event. He said: 'I want them to know to slow down and be careful and just because there’s two or three kids in the car, don’t egg each other on, don’t egg the driver on, don’t get excited about going fast. I mean it’s serious on the road and life is fragile.' Tributes have flooded in for the boys, both left at the tree where they crashed and also online. Writing on an online memorial, a friend of Charles Luthe's, identified only as John, said: 'For someone only 16, he was remarkably open, honest, and hard working. 'He was a delight to be around and kept me laughing. May I extend my deepest sympathies to his parents Suzanne and Gary as they struggle with the loss of their son. 'He will be missed by all who knew him. Because of his smile, he will be missed by those who'd only met him.'","Wesley Culpepper, 15, Daniel Tittle, 17, and Charles Luthe, 16 were killed in the crash on Wednesday morning .

"By . Sam Creighton . General Sir Richard Shirreff is the country's third highest ranking officer . One of Britain's top generals has branded the planned cuts to the armed forces as 'one hell of a risk'. By 2020, the Army will have been slashed by a fifth - from 102,000 to 82,000 troops - and will be far more reliant on reserves. General Sir Richard Shirreff, the Army's third most senior officer, has warned that the shifts will make the country far weaker on the world stage. In an interview with the Sunday Times, the general said defence cuts had . 'hollowed out' the armed forces, particularly the Royal Navy, which has . been 'cut to the bone' and left unable to take part in Nato maritime . operations. Sir Richard, who is leaving the Army is August, said the 'jury is out still' on plans to make up for smaller standing forces by expanding the Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - from 19,000 to 30,000 troops. He said it would need a 'complete . shift in culture' and support from the wider public and employers if it . is to succeed, saying: 'The nation needs to get behind this. It's not . just the armed forces - this is everybody's business.' The general stepped down as Nato's deputy supreme commander on Friday, a role in which he was coordinating the organisation's response to Russia's takeover of the Crimea. He said Russian aggression made it more important for the UK to protect its defence budget, even if that meant other departments suffered.

He said: 'A hollowed-out navy means you can't project power. I've heard this said in the Ministry of Defence: ""The yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight"".

"By . James Tozer . For years he charmed members of the smart country set, from the wife of the 9th Earl of Bathurst to the teenage daughter of a Cotswolds millionaire. But former vagrant Oliver Lomasney – once renowned for his ‘Lady and the Tramp’ relationships – is  a ‘deeply unpleasant man’ who women should avoid at all costs, a judge has warned. He imposed a three-month prison sentence on the 42-year-old for assaulting his latest lover, with whom he previously enjoyed an ‘Olympic’ sex life, a court heard. Taking pity: Oliver Lomasney (left) and Lady Apsley (right) pictured in 1997. At the time, the wife of the 9th Earl Bathurst, said: 'Oliver seemed such a nice chap. Everyone deserves fair treatment as far as I'm concerned' In 1997, Lomasney was in the headlines . when Lady Sara Apsley took pity on him when she saw him begging near her . estate, Circencester Park, in Gloucestershire. The wife of the Earl . of Bathurst found him work and a roof over his head, but he repaid her . kindness weeks later by running away with Cheltenham Ladies’ College . schoolgirl Christine Hulbert. The 16-year-old, whose millionaire New . York academic father lived in the Cotswolds, professed her enduring love . for Lomasney, saying she would rather they be homeless together than . agree to her horrified family’s wishes and end the relationship. He . fathered a son, Kane, with Christine before leaving her for another . teenager, Pearl Nepgen, months later, going on to wed dental nurse Helen . Carter. But the marriage ended in dramatic fashion, with Lomasney . jailed for three and a half years in 2007 for brutally assaulting her . following the break-up. The judge at the time said Lomasney was . ‘prone to abusive behaviour with partners and I agree that anyone in a . relationship with you is at risk’. Now a second judge has warned . women to stay away from him after hearing a depressingly similar saga . following his latest relationship. Caring: Lady Apsley, pictured with her husband the 9th Earl Bathurst. The Earl himself is a conservationist who has campaigned to preserve rural areas and various historic buildings . The lover this time, a mother of . two from South Brent, Devon, spent five months in a ‘slightly avant . garde’ relationship with Lomasney, during which they ‘indulged in an . adventurous sex life’ where role-playing reached new levels, Plymouth . Crown Court was told. Defence barrister Rupert Taylor told the judge: . ‘Mr Lomasney is a colourful character who in the old days had a Lady . and the Tramp experience.’ Describing the latest relationship, he . said: ‘Things had become more Olympic and there was some unacceptable . violence and he has pleaded guilty to that.’ Prosecutor Greg . Richardson said the woman decided to end their relationship because of . his aggression towards her, telling him it was over after they had a . meal and some drink and going upstairs to her bed. Past: In 1997 Oliver Lomasney (left) ran away with Cheltenham Ladies College schoolgirl Christine Hulbert (right) - the 16-year-old daughter of a millionaire New York professor . But she was woken . by a blow to her face and he was standing over her. ‘His hand was . clenched around her throat and she could barely breathe,’ Mr Richardson . said. ‘She could not push him off and he grabbed her hair. ‘He made . various threats to beat her up, hit her again and told her he knew . people in prison who would cut her up. He brandished a Stanley knife in . her face.’ The terrified woman’s children, aged between six and nine, . were in the house. The court heard Lomasney had four previous . convictions for ‘offences against the person’ and now lives in a caravan . on a farm in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, where he works as a labourer. Recorder Steven Levene told him: ‘You are a deeply unpleasant man. You are a bullying, controlling, unpleasant man.’ The . judge said he hoped the publicity surrounding the case would be wide . enough to warn ‘any unfortunate woman’ Lomasney might meet in the . future. He imposed a three-month jail term – which meant Lomasney . could walk free immediately due to the seven months he has spent on . remand – and an indefinite restraining order, which the judge said . ‘protects one woman at least’. Lomasney’s first brush with polite . society came when Lady Apsley saw him begging outside her local Tesco in . 1997 and began buying him sandwiches. At the time, she said: ‘Oliver . seemed such a nice chap. Everyone deserves fair treatment as far as I am . concerned.’ But her faith proved misplaced after he eloped with the . teenaged Miss Hulbert, forcing her to admit that she had been ‘perhaps a . little misguided’ in taking him in.","Oliver Lomasney, 42, sentenced to three months in prison for violent attack .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Taking inspiration from the forbidden fruit that tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a bio artist wants to create his own version of the tree of knowledge - using Wikipedia. Joe Davis from Harvard’s genetics lab has devised a mathematical formula to add layers of data to DNA. He now plans to add a decoded version of the online encyclopaedia into the DNA of a 4,000-year-old strain of apple, which he claims is the closest he could get to fruit from the biblical tale. Scroll down for video . The Malus ecclesia project is the brainchild of bio artist Joe Davis from Harvard Medical School's genetics lab. He created a mathematical formula to add layers of information to the DNA of a 4,000-year-old apple, stock image pictured, because it is 'the closest thing to fruit grown in the Garden of Eden' Every DNA molecule can be represented by three unique numbers. One number is the DNA itself, the protein it’s translated to creates another number, and then there’s the redundant codons. Davis wrote a mathematical genetic code to add layers of information to DNA by inserting it under areas . occupied by these redundant codons. The apple genome can be described as a 750 million letter book, using the four letters of DNA - A, T, C and G. The . words are translated into these letters of DNA using a code, . similar to how Morse code and shorthand compress words to single marks. Once coded, these letters . are placed within the apple using bacteria that evolves to . inserts its genome through the cell walls. By inputting the information into the gaps in the DNA, it shouldn’t affect the taste or texture of the apple. Davis, 63, is the artist in residence at George Church’s genetics lab, at Harvard Medical School. The apple he is creating has been dubbed Malus ecclesia. Malus is the apple's Latin genus name that means ‘evil apple tree’, while ecclesia is Latin for church which works both in a religious sense, and represents the name of Davis' lab. Along with scientists and mathematicians Dana Boyle and Madeline Prye-Ball, Davis searched for years to find an of apple old enough for the project, and was sent the roots and leaves of the 4,000-year-old strain at the end of last year. During the 30c3 conference in Germany in December, Davis said: ‘I couldn’t stop thinking and maths and DNA. 'I came up with a way to not only put one layer of information under a gene, but lots and lots of layers – like Babushka dolls. ‘Every DNA molecule has three pages of information available. 'This is because DNA can be represented by three unique numbers. One number is the DNA itself, the protein it’s translated to creates another number, and then there’s the redundant codons. Along with scientists and mathematicians Dana Boyle and Madeline Prye-Ball, Davis is planning to add the top 50,000 pages of Wikipedia, stock image pictured, to the fruit. This equates to 50 per cent of the most visited pages and contains around 350MB data . Every DNA molecule can be represented by three unique numbers, a slide taken from Davis' recent conference talk in Germany is pictured. Davis will translate the words from Wikipedia into the four letters of DNA, then use bacteria to add these letters to the apple's genome without affecting its taste . ‘So then I made this mathematical genetic code that let me write three layers of information using these numbers, inserting it under areas occupied by the redundant codons. ‘ . During the conference, Davis also said he wanted to 'create fruit that would tempt the devil.' Davis, pictured, won the Golden Nica of the Prix Ars Electronica in 2012. He previously inserted the words of a Greek philosopher into the genes of a fly . Due to the size of Wikipedia, Davis and his team chose to decode only the top 50,000 pages of the online encyclopaedia , which make up 50 per cent of the most visited pages across the site. The amount of data equated to around 350MB. Davis told the New Yorker the apple genome is like a 750 million letter book, made up of the four letters of DNA - A, T,C and G. The words are translated into these letters of DNA using a mathematical code, similar to how Morse code and shorthand compress words to single marks. Once coded, these letters are placed within the apple using bacteria that evolves to inserts its genome through the cell walls. By inputting the information into the gaps in the DNA, Davis said t shouldn’t affect the taste or texture of the apple. Davis’ first project, using a similar technique, was to put the writings of Greek philosopher, Heraclitus into the genes of a fly. ‘[The project] draws together science and religion in very close proximity,’ Davis continued. The fruit has also been dubbed forbidden because eating genetically modified plants in the U.S is strictly governed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In the book of Genesis, Adam and Eve were described as living with God in the Garden of Eden. In the garden were two trees - the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life. The Bible claims God had forbidden eating fruit from these trees, but a serpent took an apple from the Tree of Knowledge and tempted Eve into eating it. She was then said to have consequently corrupted Adam. God banished them from the garden to prevent them from eating more fruit, especially from the Tree of Life which would have made them immortal. Many Christians refer to this as the Fall of Man and believe the sin corrupted the natural world and meant people were born into original sin, meaning believers can't attain eternal life without the grace of God.","The Malus ecclesia project is the brainchild of bio artist Joe Davis .

"By . Sam Creighton . Alan Tait was on a golfing holiday with a group of friends when he was drugged and attacked by the gang . A BBC sports presenter was left in a 'coma-like state' after being drugged and attacked by thugs while playing golf in Spain. Alan Tait, who presents The Golf Show on BBC Radio Scotland, was on a three-day golfing holiday in the Costa del Sol when a gang spiked his drink with the horse tranquiliser ketamine, robbed him and left him for dead, on Friday night. The 45-year-old, who is also the golf pro at Edinburgh's Marriot Dalmahoy Hotel and Country Club, had hundreds of pounds, his iPhone and his watch - a 40th birthday present from his parents - stolen in the mugging. Mr Tait issued a stern warning to tourists heading out to similar destinations. He told Scotland's Daily Record: 'I’m a 6ft 2in guy who can look after myself. If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. 'The Spanish police said they hear about this sort of thing all the time – but we rarely hear about it.' He added: 'At least I came home alive. I just want people to know about it and be careful.' He had spent the evening drinking in a bar with seven friends in the town of Puerto Banus, near Marbella, on Spain's popular Costa del Sol. According to his friends, Mr Tait vanished shortly after 10.30pm and the golf pro has only snatches of memory before coming to at 8.30am the following morning, covered in blood with his clothes badly torn. He took a taxi to the airport, where he was able to contact the police and his girlfriend, Katernia. After failing to show up at the golf course the following morning, his friends scoured the exclusive marina town before reporting him missing to the police. The Costa del Sol, on the southern coast of Spain, is a popular destination for the 1million UK ex-pats living - at least part-time - in the country. It is also a bustling tourist spot for UK holidaymakers, with 2.5million Brits visiting Andalusia, the region of Spain where the Costa del Sol is located, each year. Mr Tait had been drinking in Puerto Banus, near Marbella, in Spain's popular Costa del Sol region . The golf pro and BBC presenter has warned people to be wary when visiting the area on holiday . There have been a number of high profile crimes in the sunny region over the last few years. The recent murder of British millionaire Andrew Bush, 48, took place at his Costa del Sol villa. Just days before that, the body of Francis Brennan, 25, who fled the UK after stabbing a man at a pop concert, was found murdered having last been seen in the Costa del Sol town of Javea.","Alan Tait, 45, was drugged and attacked while on a golfing holiday in Spain .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Gangs have been stripping away LED headlights from luxury Range Rovers and using them to grow cannabis in the latest car crime trend. In the past month there have been a spate of thefts with the costly lights targeted by criminals, prompting police to launch a special investigation, dubbed Operation Emporia, to deal with the thefts. Victims say the thefts can be completed in as little as 30 seconds and calls have been made for manufacturer Land Rover to take action. Stolen: The front headlights and grill of this Range Rover, owned by Michael Roper, were among those taken by thieves in Bradford, West Yorkshire . One theory is that the powerful headlights - costing around £1,000 each - are being stolen to be used in cannabis production. Michael Roper, 53, licensee of the Dog . and Gun in Oxenhope, had the lights and front grille stolen from his . Range Rover Sport outside his pub in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on April 16. He said the crooks caused £8,000 in damage to his vehicle. 'It is rife,' he said. 'But . it is such an easy crime - it is so fast. It took them about ten . minutes maximum. They put a crowbar in between the front wing and the . headlights. 'They wrecked the wing. There was no noise. They know how to disable the alarm on the cars.' Mr Roper said he knew of at least 40 other Range Rovers in the area that had been targeted in similar thefts. Probe: This CCTV image shows a van which was allegedly used in the theft from Mr Roper's car . 'The rumour circulating among other victims is that the headlights are being used to cultivate cannabis. 'I’m not sure how it would work, presumably because they are quite strong.' 'But it could be more simple in that they’re stealing them to order so they can put them on other vehicles.' He added: 'I've heard the lights are being shipped abroad, then sold on eBay to come back over here.' He has now fitted his own security measures to his car to prevent similar thefts in future. Mr . Roper said the the garage where he took his car to be repaired reported . at least ten other damaged vehicles following similar thefts, and that a . supplier had also been targeted. Peter Earwaker, of Bingley Car Bodyshop, said: 'The manufacturers have got to take the brunt of the blame. 'It is far too easy - it can take 30 to 60 seconds to steal a full set of headlights and grille from a Range Rover.' Full beam: A Range Rover Sport model, which has the LED headlights . On April 30, during a theft from a . Range Rover in a car park in Bradford city centre, a witness who tried . to intervene was threatened with a knife. The woman owner spoke of her fear at driving her £60,000 car and also insisted Land Rover had to do something. She said: 'I am frustrated because I feel like Land Rover should be recalling vehicles. It is so easy to get the grille and the lights out - that is a design fault.' West Yorkshire police Chief Inspector Suzanne Akeroyd said one of the other motives of the gangs was to use the parts to fit to other vehicles. 'West Yorkshire Police is taking this issue very seriously and recently launched Operation Emporia specifically to target the theft of 4x4 vehicle parts,' she said. 'That work has already had some significant success with a number of people arrested and stolen parts recovered. 'Officers are also working closely with manufacturers and using a range of tactics to target the thieves and those who deal in stolen car parts.' Land Rover said they were investigating the problem.","Expensive lights targeted by criminals in spate of thefts in Bradford .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A farmer spoke of his anger today after having to repeatedly rescue stranded drivers from his estate due to sat nav blunders. James Cookson has saved an average of one motorist a fortnight from Meldon Park Estate near Morpeth, Northumberland, over the past 18 months. Each time, the driver had turned on to a narrow dirt path at the guidance of their sat nav, before getting stuck in the muddy, 'rutted' conditions. Angry: Farmer James Cookson has saved an average of one motorist a fortnight from Meldon Park Estate, near Morpeth, over the past 18 months. Above, Mr Cookson with a sign warning the lane is 'unsuitable for vehicles' This is despite a sign at the 3,852-acre estate warning the country lane is 'unsuitable for vehicles'. Today, Mr Cookson said he was 'frustrated' at having to constantly pull cars, lorries and even fuel tankers from the path via tractor. 'I could understand it if it looked pretty accessible. But the farmers do not use the track with their tractor for the simple reason it is a bit too narrow,' he said. 'It is one of these tracks where you are going to think twice, it is not Tarmaced. It is rutted. It is quite rough. Muddy: Each time, the driver had turned on to a narrow dirt path at the guidance of their sat nav, before getting stuck in the muddy, 'rutted' conditions. Mr Cookson was forced to rescue the stricken motorists via tractor . Diversion: Most of the drivers are believed to have been travelling from the centre of Morpeth to nearby High Angerton when their sat navs directed them down the path to Mr Cookson's estate . 'Surely when you go down there you just think, ""This can not be right"". How they get down there I do not know.' Mr Cookson said a number of drivers, believed to have been travelling from the centre of Morpeth to nearby High Angerton had told him their sat navs had directed them down the path. The lane, which adjoins the B6343 road and has a dead end, was designated a byway open to all traffic (BOAT) around 18 months ago. Since then, the farmer claims at least one vehicle wrongly turns on to the lane every two weeks, before getting stuck in the ground. Frsutrated: Today, Mr Cookson said he was 'frustrated' at having to constantly rescue vehicles from the path . Grand: Mr Cookson is the seventh generation of his family to live at the estate after it was bought in 1832 from the Greenwich Hospital Trust. The building features a walled garden which is open to the public and a café . On one recent occasion, a motorist even opened a gate along the path and failed to shut it - allowing horses to escape from a field, he said. 'There is a sign up which clearly says not suitable for motor vehicles, but they do not read that,' said Mr Cookson, who is the seventh generation of his family to live at the estate after it was bought in 1832 from the Greenwich Hospital Trust. 'Either they can not read or they choose not to.' Path: Mr Cookson said he is considering imposing a £500 charge on anyone who has to be rescued in future . Mr Cookson likened the situation to that at Holy Island, where motorists ignore signs warning them not to cross its causeway outside safe times. He added that he is considering imposing a £500 charge on anyone who has to be rescued in future. The estate, featuring a walled garden open to the public and a café, has 15 miles of public rights of way.","James Cookson rescues one driver a fortnight from estate near Morpeth .

"By . Tara Brady . A pen hiding a secret pistol that was once given to Lord Mountbatten for his protection is going under the hammer. The gold-plated pen was given to Lord Mountbatten by his friend The Maharaja of Jodhpur in case he ever got into trouble. It remained with his family until recently when it was bought by an unknown collector in Yorkshire. Nicholas Holt holding the gold-plated pen which hides a secret pistol . But now the handmade pen - worthy of a James Bond-style scene - is due to be auctioned once again in March and is estimated to fetch between £5,000 and £7,000. Nicholas Holt, founder of Holt’s Auctioneers which is selling the item, said: 'The Maharaja of Jodhpur built it for his friend in case he got himself in a position where he had to sign something which he did not wish to sign - either to kill himself or the enemy.' The weapon was this week on display at Holt’s Auctioneers gun valuation day at Orvis, in West Park, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Mr Holt said the deadly pen pistol would have been specially built for Mountbatten. The pen, also referred to as a pencil pistol, was built in 1948 and features a 2 3/4in smooth-bore barrel containing a removable propelling pencil mechanism with a concealed trigger. The outer body is inscribed with the words ‘Gun Shop Jodphur, 1948’. Present: The Maharaja of . Jodphur gave the pen to Lord Mountbatten for his protection . The gun will be sold by Norfolk-based Holt’s Auctioneers to be included in the sale of Fine Modern and Antique Guns at Princess Louise House, Hammersmith Road, London, on March 21. Mr Holt said any sale would be subject to strict laws governing the sale of arms and said he hoped that a museum might be interested in buying the item that has played such an important role in the nation’s history. When the item was last up for sale it was one of a number of military items that belonged to Lord Mountbatten, some of which he used during the Second World War. They reputedly helped to preserve his life. Old friends: Picture shows The Maharaja of Jodphur with Lord Mountbatten who gave his friend a gold plated pistol pen . The collection had been at the Imperial War Museum after legislation following the Dunblane massacre in 1996 banned the ownership of handguns. But Lord Mountbatten’s family later decided to sell the items. James Doyle, store manager at The Orvis Harrogate Store, said: 'It really is a fascinating little thing. 'This item I believe was a part of the mystique which went through that community which led to stories like the Bond stories.'

"By . Sara Malm . Rumours were rife in a Slovakian town this week when a river running through turned bright red. The river in Myjava, a small municipality on the border to the Czech Republic, had changed colour over night and turned into 'blood'. Police have been called in to investigate the matter, but it is believed to be a faulty filtering system from a slaughterhouse upstream. Riverrun: Residents in the small town of Myjava in Slovakia awoke to a river red as blood . Roman Podbrezova, 65, had gone for a . morning walk when he saw the drastic change to the river which runs . through the centre of the town. ‘I just could not believe my eyes,’ he said. ‘The river was dark red. It was like something from a horror film. Blood cascading through the centre of town.’ Another local said: ‘This is really creepy. Yesterday evening I walked past here and it was its normal colour. ‘Now . it looks like someone slaughtered 1,000 virgins or something. I'm not . superstitious, and we've never had any serial killers or anything like . that here, but this isn't normal. 'Slaughter of 1,00 virgins': Locals feared the colour change was an result of mass murder or 'evil', although the most likely explanation is that of a broken filtration system at a nearby slaughterhouse . Police spokesman Elena Antalova said: ‘We are checking the source of the blood and what caused it. ‘At the moment we are thinking it could have come from dead fish or maybe someone washed a barrel containing blood in the river. ‘It seems it came from the drains directly above the museum,’ she said. The waste from a slaughterhouse higher up the River Myjava is usually pumped into a retaining pool where it is filtered before being released into the river.","River flowing through Slovakian village turns blood red .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . 'Ring leader': Sgt 1st Class Gregory McQueen faces charges of abusive sexual conduct for allegedly recruiting female soldiers in Fort Hood to work as prostitutes . Two female soldiers testified Tuesday that a non-commissioned sexual-assault prevention officer at Fort Hood recruited them and other cash-strapped servicewomen to work as prostitutes. Their testimonies came during an Article 32 hearing to determine whether Sgt. 1st Class Gregory McQueen will face a military court-martial on more than 21 criminal charges filed in March that include pandering, adultery and sexual assault. The first to testify was a female private who said she was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony. ‘Basically, it was having sex with higher-ranking officers for money,’ the private said, according to the Killeen Daily Herald. She was 20 at the time of the alleged misconduct and said she confided in McQueen, telling him she was experiencing money problems after her husband left her and her 3-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. The woman . alleged that McQueen visited her home on the Texas base and asked her to . 'act out' on him what she would do with clients. Another soldier at the Army base in central Texas, Master Sgt. Brad Grimes, 37, has already been demoted and reprimanded in the case for conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. The private testified Tuesday that McQueen arranged for her to have sex with Grimes for $100. A second female soldier testified that McQueen sexually assaulted her and also attempted to recruit her to join the prostitution ring, but she declined. The names of the female soldiers who testified — three in all — have not been released. Anu Bhagwati, executive director of Service Women's Action Network and a former captain with the Marine Corps, said prostitution rings are not uncommon within the military and the allegations against McQueen were no surprise. Hearing: Sergeant Gregory McQueen appeared before a Fort Hood military court on Tuesday over claims he set up a prostitution ring . ‘Institutionally, a lot of . inappropriate behavior is condoned,’ she told The Associated Press. ‘Women are so few within the military still that I think predators look . at women as fresh meat and the military as an institution where they can . get away with criminal activity.’ More testimony is expected Wednesday, including from Grimes. The investigation into McQueen began in . May last year, and he was charged in March with abusive sexual contact . and other alleged misconduct. If convicted, the former coordinator for the base's sexual assault and harassment program could face court-martial. The case has brought renewed focus on the prevalence of sexual assault within the military. In March, the U.S. Senate blocked a bill that would have stripped military commanders of their authority to prosecute or prevent charges for alleged rapes and other serious offenses.","Non-commissioned Sgt 1st Class Gregory McQueen faces charges of abusive sexual conduct .

"By . James Tozer . Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans, who now sits as an independent MP, denies all charges . Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans should not be convicted of rape just to ‘salve the conscience’ of a man who regrets having sex with him, a jury was told yesterday. A 22-year-old politics student who claimed the MP assaulted him after a dinner party had in reality given ‘every indication of consent’, said Peter Wright QC, representing Evans. ‘In the cold light of day, the complainant may regret what had taken place and how far it had actually gone, but such sentiments are some considerable distance removed from an incident of sexual assault and rape,’ he told Preston Crown Court. ‘Salving his conscience is not the basis on which to convict a man of rape and sexual assault.’ The former Tory MP, who now sits as an independent, is accused by the prosecution of using his influence at Westminster to target politically ambitious young men, knowing they would not complain about his advances. Evans admits having sex with the student but insists the young man – who admits he never said ‘No’ – appeared to be an entirely willing participant. Mr Wright also said that two incidents in 2003 when men claim that the 56-year-old MP tried to put his hands down their trousers – one in a Soho bar, one at the Tory conference in Blackpool – did not support the prosecution case of a politician abusing his influence. ‘They are a high watermark of over-friendly, inappropriate behaviour by a drunken man, rather than the ingredients of an indecent assault,’ he added. Evans is also accused of trying to kiss a 21-year-old gay man in 2009 and grabbing a heterosexual man between the legs the following year, both at the Strangers’ Bar at the Houses of Parliament. Mr Evans's lawyer told Preston Crown Court that the allegation were motivated by the claimant's regret . But Mr Wright said police learnt of both complainants from another of the alleged victims, a bisexual man who claims Evans assaulted him while he slept on the sofa of his constituency home in Lancashire in 2009. The barrister said this complainant gave police details of these alleged incidents to ‘bolster’ his account but had initially mixed the pair up. He said the version given in court by the man allegedly grabbed between the legs bore ‘little resemblance’ to what he told police. Meanwhile, the bisexual man’s account ‘does not sit comfortably’ with the fact he continued socialising with Evans afterwards. The MP denies all the charges. The case continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 13:40 EST, 15 August 2011 . A former FBI man used a tracking device to find his own laptop after it was stolen during the London riots - leading police straight to the suspect. Greg Martin turned detective and used his technical skills to track down the stolen computer. Not only did tracking device pinpoint the location of the laptop, but it also activated the webcam enabling the super-snoop to watch the suspect surfing the web. The 29-year-old Texan had gone to stay at his girlfriend's house to escape the trouble in Fulham, south west London, when his flat was broken in to, it has been reported. Caught in the act: Mr Martin took this picture of the alleged laptop thief using tracking software installed on the machine . Nailed: Mr Martin took a number of pictures of the thief using his computer, before giving the information to police so his laptop could be recovered . When he returned to the property in West Kensington the next day he discovered the security bars to the basement window had been prised open with a scaffolding pole and his computer and other valuables had been taken. According to the Evening Standard, Mr Martin, who has worked for the FBI and Nasa, had installed a tracking device on his laptop which allowed him to hone in on its location the moment it was switched on. Mr Martin told the Evening Standard he was desperate to find his computer as it contained his work on it, adding: 'The police came round and dusted for fingerprints but . said I was unlikely to get it back. It was at that point I remembered I . had tracking stuff on my laptop.' Mr Martin received a notification on his iPhone alerting him to the software being activated and he was able to watch the suspect - who lived just four streets away - as he surfed the internet. Recovered: Former FBI man Mr Martin said he was keen to get the laptop back as it had his work on it . He added: 'This guy's face popped up at me and I nearly lost it. It was the most incredible feeling. 'I sat there and basically stalked him. I got the guy on a silver platter.' Mr Martin alerted police to the fact the laptop was being used and officers raided the flat and recovered the computer. He said: 'My hope was I was going to watch him being arrested from my laptop camera - that would have been the perfect ending. 'I was able to immediately go to the police station and got my laptop back there and then.'

"By . Rob Waugh . Muscle, tendons, skin and hair on a sharp obsidian knife from 2,000 years ago have proved that the stone weapon was used for human sacrifices. The forensic samples prove that brutal human sacrifices were being carried out in the region 1,000 years BEFORE the Aztecs. Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said the finding clearly corroborates accounts from later cultures about the use of sharp obsidian knives in sacrificing humans. Researchers in Mexico announced that they have found blood cells and fragments of muscle, tendon, skin and hair on 2,000-year-old stone knives, calling it the first conclusive evidence from a large number of stone implements pointing to their use in human sacrifice . Human blood cells seen through an electronic microscope, found in sharp obsidian knives discovered in Cantona, in the central Mexico state of Puebla . The forensics show that the little-known 'Cantona' people were practicing human sacrifice 2,000 years ago - the region has a long history of the practice, also carried out by the Mayans as depicted in Mel Gibson's Apocalypto . Researchers in Mexico called it the first . conclusive evidence from a large number of stone implements pointing to . their use in human sacrifice. Other physical evidence such as cut marks on the bones of ancient human skeletons had previously offered indirect proof of the practice. Researchers in Mexico had noticed what they believed were fossilized blood stains on stone knives as long as 20 years ago. But the institute said it took a methodical examination using a scanning electron microscope to positively identify the human tissues on 31 knives from the Cantona site in the central Mexico state of Puebla. The collection of stone knives is from the little-known Cantona culture, which flourished just after the mysterious city-state of Teotihuacan. Cantona preceded by more than 1,000 years the region's most famous human sacrifice practitioners, the Aztecs. The archaeologists who found the knives gave them to researcher Luisa Mainou at the anthropology institute's restoration laboratories about two years ago. With help from specialists at Mexico's National Autonomous University, they were studied under the scanning electronic microscope and found to contain red blood cells, collagen, tendon and muscle fiber fragments. While historical accounts from Aztec times, as well as drawings and paintings from earlier cultures, had long suggested that priests used knives and other instruments for non-life-threatening bloodletting rituals, the presence of the muscle and tendon traces indicates the cuts were deep and intended to sever portions of the victim's body. ‘These finds confirm that the knives were used for sacrifices,’ Mainou said. A sharp obsidian knife found in Cantona, in the central Mexico state of Puebla . The acropolis or unit 11, Precolumbian city dated between 700-950 AD, Cantona, Puebla, Mexico. New evidence shows that the 'Cantona' people practiced human sacrifice . Susan Gillespie, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who was not involved in the research project, said it was the first time to her knowledge that such tissue remains had been identified on obsidian knives. ‘This is a compelling demonstration that these knives were used to cut human flesh,’ Gillespie said in an email. She said other studies have found trace elements of organic remains such as food on ancient artifacts, so ‘with the right conditions such remains can preserve for long periods.’ Gillespie said human sacrifice practices either described by the Spanish conquerors or depicted in pre-Conquest paintings include heart removal, decapitation, dismemberment, disemboweling and skinning of victims. Interestingly, the find announced Wednesday has already begun to shed some new light on the murky sacrifice practices of pre-Hispanic cultures, which believed that human blood was a sort of vital liquid needed to keep the cosmos in balance. For example, some knives in the test had more traces of red blood cells, while others had more skin, and others more muscle or collagen, ‘which suggest that each cutting tool was used for a different purpose, according to its form,’ Mainou said. Gillespie said the find also suggested the intriguing possibility that the sacrificial knives were ritually deposited, unwashed, in some special site after being used. The Spanish conquerors have long been suspected of perhaps exaggerating accounts of mass human sacrifice in pre-Hispanic cultures, to make their Indian subjects appear more brutal and less deserving of sympathy. ‘The archaeological confirmation of human sacrifice is important both for supporting or contesting the many post-conquest historical accounts and pre-conquest imagery of sacrifice,’ Gillespie wrote.","'Cantona' people used stone knives for sacrifices 1,000 years before Aztecs .

"By . James Tozer . Hitting back: Jeanette Winterson said people need to understand where meat comes from . Novelist Jeanette Winterson yesterday hit back at claims that she was ‘callous’ for posting photographs of a rabbit she had killed, skinned and cooked for raiding her vegetable patch. She said too many meat-eaters were ‘squeamish’ and needed to face the reality that animals were slaughtered to put food on their plates, adding: ‘They are not made of fairy dust, they don’t drop out of the sky.’ This week the author, best known for the bestseller Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, sparked a frenzy on Twitter after posting pictures of the unfortunate animal lying disembowelled on her chopping board with the caption: ‘Rabbit ate my parsley. I am eating the rabbit.’ Miss Winterson, 54, who lives in the village Upper Slaughter in the Cotswolds, went on to describe how she had cooked it in cider with rosemary and thyme for a meal with ‘no waste, no packaging, no processing and no food miles’. But she managed to antagonise some of her 34,000 followers by pointing out that its head would make a ‘great glove puppet’ before feeding its entrails to her cat. Yesterday animal rights campaigner Mimi Bekhechi, associate director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), said the public were right to be ‘outraged’. She added: ‘Jeanette Winterson makes a solid point about the horrors of modern farming, but that doesn’t diminish her own callousness. ‘Rabbits are sensitive, smart, social animals who form life-long bonds, and each has a personality in his or her own right. ‘Snuffing them out for a fleeting moment of taste is arrogant, ignorant and cruel, whether they are trapped, factory farmed or shot.’ However the author hit back at her critics, insisting unprecedented hordes of bunnies had been munching her flowers and vegetables. ‘The rabbit population is out of control this year – nobody knows why,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s World At One, adding: ‘You can’t simply leave them to breed. One of the pictures posted on Twitter by author Jeanette Winterson after she killed and skinned a rabbit that was eating her parsley . Jeanette Winterson, the author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, also used the social media site the tell her 32,700 followers that the offed bunny would make a 'great glove puppet' ‘It seems to me if you’re going to cull a rabbit, you might as well eat it – why waste it?’ She went on to say: ‘I have got a rabbit population which is decimating my vegetable garden and my flower garden. ‘Now, either I stand by and let that happen or I deal with it. I live in the country, I’ve lived here for 20 years, I’m going to deal with it.’ She told the programme she had not expected her photographs to go viral, describing some of her critics as trolls who ‘just love to go online, they are not interested in having an argument, they just want to fire abuse’. But she welcomed the debate her posts had sparked, saying: ‘There ought to be a discussion, because I would like people to understand what it means to eat animals. They are not made of fairy dust, they don’t drop out of the sky. ‘If you eat meat, why are you squeamish about seeing someone gut a rabbit with her own hands and eat it?’ One follower had branded her ‘sick’ and said she would boycott her books – prompting Miss Winterson to suggest that a reading list confined to vegetarian authors would be extremely restrictive. Rabbits are legally classified as pests and cause an estimated £100million of damage every year, wrecking crops as well as undermining riverbanks with their burrows, increasing the risk of floods. Legislation dating back to the 1950s puts an ‘obligation’ on landowners to kill wild rabbits, but says that this has to be done in a humane manner. Yesterday some reactions online were supportive, with Rachel Moon posting: ‘Funny how people who eat meat can be offended by this. What do you think you are eating in your Sunday roast?’ And Cotswolds pest controller Adam Eastwood, 28, backed Winterson, saying: ‘I’ve never known a year like it for rabbits – it’s down to the mild winter which gave them more time to breed. ‘People who’ve lived around here all their lives see trapping rabbits as an everyday thing that’s happened for years. If it controls the rabbits and puts a meal on your table, who can argue with that?’","WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES .

The vehicle's speed can be limited to suit road laws for its class of vehicles. It can typically travel at up to 45km per hour (28 mph) but has a maximum speed of 60kph (37mph). A spokesman told MailOnline that anyone who can drive a car can 'jump in and drive the i-ROAD as there is nothing special to learn - you don't have to know how to drive a motorbike' as the leaning motion happens automatically and while the driver experiences a 'different sensation' to driving a car, it is no different to operate. He also said that the driver and passengers so not 'heave to one side' of the vehicle like when a car takes a corner a little too quickly. Despite the vehicle being narrow, its smart, moveable wheels mean that drivers do not need to stabilise the vehicle when it is stationary - like motorcyclists putting their feet on the road surface at traffic lights.

"By . James Tozer . A senior Conservative ‘sighed with irritation’ at being told Nigel Evans had sexually assaulted a Parliamentary employee, and refused to demand his resignation, a court heard yesterday. Patrick McLoughlin, then Tory chief whip, told the alleged victim that with the General Election looming, ‘the timing wasn’t right’ to ask Evans to step down, concluding: ‘It can’t be done.’ Instead, Mr McLoughlin – now Transport Secretary – agreed the Conservative MP for Ribble Valley should seek help for his drinking and publicly come out as gay. 'He can't resign': Former Tory chief whip Patrick McLoughlin (right) 'sighed with irritation' at being told Nigel Evans MP (left) had sexually assaulted a Parliamentary employee, and refused to demand his resignation . But four years later, a male friend of the complainant accused Evans of raping him after drinking heavily, and he reported his own allegation to police. Evans, 56, who stepped down as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons following his arrest and now sits as an independent, is accused of rape and sexual assaults against seven men in and around Westminster or Lancashire. Yesterday his trial heard from a man who claims Evans targeted him as he slept on the sofa of his constituency home in Pendleton after an alcohol-fuelled evening in July 2009. The openly bisexual politics student, then aged 23, said he twice awoke to find Evans sitting on the sofa. Later he awoke again to find Evans with his hand inside his boxer shorts, he told the jury at Preston Crown Court. He said he pushed Evans, who ‘flew’ across the room and shouted: ‘What the f*** do you think you’re doing?’ Lying on the floor where he had fallen, Evans answered: ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.’ Election looming: Preston Crown Court heard Mr McLoughlin- now Secretary of State for Transport - told the alleged victim that with the General Election looming, 'the timing wasn't right' to ask Evans (pictured arriving at court) to step down. Evans is facing nine counts of sexual assault against seven alleged victims . Seek help: Instead Mr McLoughlin (pictured) is said to have told Evans to seek help for his drinking and publicly come out as being gay . Nigel Evans, faces nine allegations of sexual offences against seven younger men.Count 1: indecent assault of a male between 2002 and 2003. Count 2: indecent assault of a male between 2003 and 2004. Count 3: sexual assault (intentional touching) between 2009 and 2010. Count 4: sexual assault (intentional touching) between 2009 and 2009. Count 5: sexual assault (intentional touching) between 2010 and 2011. Count 6: sexual assault (intentional touching) between 2011 and 2012. Count 7: sexual assault (intentional touching) between March 29 and April 1, 2013 . Count 8: rape between March 29 and April 1, 2013. Count 9: sexual assault (intentional touching) between March 29 and April 1, 2013. Counts 7, 8 and 9 all involve the same complainant. Earlier in the evening he said he had put his arms around Evans, who was upset over the sudden death of his elderly mother. After the alleged attack, he said the MP apologised by saying he thought the embrace had ‘meant something’, which he told the jury was ‘ridiculous’. He said he told Evans he regarded it as ‘a particular betrayal’ as he had previously confided in the MP about being sexually abused as a toddler. He told the jury he agreed to stay the rest of the night before Evans gave him a lift back to London. The following day – a Sunday – he informed Conservative whip Michael Fabricant of what had happened. On the Monday he was called into a meeting with Mr McLoughlin and his deputy, John Randall, at the Houses of Parliament where ‘I told him exactly what happened’. He told the jury Mr McLoughlin’s reaction was ‘one mainly of irritation’ and that he ‘sighed and huffed and blew’ while he listened. He said the politician asked: ‘So what . do you want to happen now?’ He replied that he wanted Evans to resign . his seat, to which he said Mr McLoughlin responded: ‘It can’t be done – . the timing isn’t right. Position: Evans served as deputy speaker of the House of Commons from 2010 until September 2013 . ‘I would find it very difficult to explain why an MP is leaving his seat at this point before a General Election. It can’t be done.’ The accuser said Mr Randall by contrast seemed ‘genuinely concerned’, and it was agreed that Evans – who the witness branded ‘a high-functioning alcoholic’ – would be ordered to seek counselling about his drinking and coming out as gay. When a friend told him Evans had attacked him in May 2013, he approached another Tory MP who referred the two men’s claims to Speaker John Bercow, and the police were called. Evans denies counts of indecent assault and sexual assault and one of rape. The case continues.

She had even changed her partner’s name to, 'Babe' in her phone to show her affection for him. Adedjumo-Dani . married her groom, who has not been named, at a Birmingham registry office in June 2013 and she . had a picture of her wedding day saved on her mobile phone. However, officers from the Home Office were not convinced by any . of the McDonald’s selfies and Adedjumo-Dani was found guilty after a two-day trial in March this year. Romantic meal: Adejumo-Dani poses with her Hungarian 'husband' while enjoying another McDonald's dinner . She . was jailed on Friday at Birmingham Crown Court for 22 months, along . with three other brides and the main 'fixer' of the sham marriages, 38-year-old Azuha Izegbune, who was . crucial in setting up fake weddings in order to grant to women visas. Adedjumo- . Dani, who is expecting a baby in October, has been warned that she could . face possible deportation once she completes her prison sentence. The court heard that ex-security guard Izegbune, from Birmingham, was paid to arrange fake weddings between Hungarian and Nigerian nationals so they could remain in the UK. The weddings, staged at registry offices in Birmingham, Stoke and Glasgow, were arranged so both brides and grooms could secure European Area Residence Cards. Cosied up: Investigators even found pictures of the Adedjumo-Dani and her husband relaxing in fluffy dressing gowns on a bed together . Some of the grooms were flown in to the UK just hours before the fake ceremonies took place, with the scam exposed following a Home Office probe. Sentencing, Judge Elizabeth Stacey said Izegbune had undermined . the UK’s border controls and described him as 'the lynch-pin, the . organiser and the fixer' of an eight-month conspiracy between December . 2012 and September 2013. She said: 'You met . registrars, bought plane tickets, acted as witness and interpreter and . recruited Ivett Szanto to help you find Hungarian grooms and brides. 'I have read the wonderful testimonies . about you. It’s just desperately sad that you have used your . considerable charm and skills to take part in these activities.' Izegbune is himself married to a . Hungarian and has lived legally in the UK since 2009 with dual Nigerian . and Hungarian nationality. Wedded bliss: Adejumo-Dani during her wedding to her Hungarian groom - whose number was saved as 'babe' in her phone . Jailed: Adejumo-Dani (left) was jailed on Friday at Birmingham Crown Court for 22 months alongside scam ringleader Azuka Izegbune (right) who would arrange for Hungarian and Nigerian nationals to wed . The father-of-two was jailed for 31 months after pleading guilty to five counts of . conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law. Meanwhile, . Hungarian national Ivett Szanto, 31, admitted taking part in one fake . marriage with a Nigerian man who was also seeking a visa. She had conspired with Nigerian-born . ringleader Izegbune to help set up two further marriages with men she . knew from her native Budapest. Szanto had her sham marriage stopped mid-ceremony on May 30, 2013, in Stoke, Staffordshire, the court heard. Sentencing her to 20 months, Judge . Stacey said: 'Your role in this was much more peripheral. You were a . small cog in the wheel. It was Izegbune who was directing you.' Ivett Szanto, left, was jailed for taking part in one marriage and conspiring with Izegbune to arrange two others. Chioma Nwangwu, right, married her groom in Birmingham in June 2013 and was jailed for 16 months . The court heard the fake brides . handed over an unknown amount of cash in a bid to win the residence . cards - which would have given them the legal right to remain in the UK . and Europe. But two of the weddings were stopped halfway through and a price list for a £7,500 ceremony was later recovered. It showed just a £20 budget was allocated for the wedding dress, rings and shoes. Nigerian women Nwabunwanne Eze, 35, . and Chioma Nwangwu, 28, both from Birmingham, were all jailed for taking . part in their own fake marriages. Sentence: Nwanunwanne Eze, left, was jailed for 17 months for her attempted scam marriage in Glasgow - which was raided by investigators . Nwangu married her groom Birmingham registry office in June 2013. Eze attempted to marry at Glasgow registry office in August 2013 - but the ceremony was raided by investigators. She . and Nwangwu pleaded guilty to one charge of breaching immigration law . and were jailed for 16 months and 17 months respectively. The . court heard that four members of Eze’s close family, including her own . mother, were murdered on their farm in Nigeria in 2009. She had studied Health and Social Care at South Birmingham College after arriving legitimately on a student visa in 2010. She exhausted all the appeals to stay . in the country and took part in the sham marriage just before she would . have been forced to leave the country. She has since lodged an . application seeking asylum. Nwangwu worked in a bank in Nigeria before arriving in Birmingham to study at Birmingham City University in 2011. She . returned home, but came back on a six-month visitor visa and wanted to . stay in the UK after that expired to be with her genuine partner - a . Nigerian who is legally in the country. The Nigerian women were all warned they would face possible deportation once they complete their prison sentences. A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is scheduled for Izegbune to be heard in September. Speaking . after sentencing Andy Radcliffe, from the Home Office’s Criminal and . Financial Investigations Team, said: 'Izegbune thought he could profit . from abusing the marriage system and the UK’s immigration laws. 'He . was seen by the other individuals as their ticket to either stay in the . UK, or gain financially. But all five are now behind bars. 'We . will continue to work with registrars to tackle this issue. The message . to anyone involved in this sort of criminality is clear. 'The Home Office has the resource and expertise to catch up with you and bring you to justice.'","Bride Hellen .

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the heartbreaking moment a mother wept over her daughter's hospital bed after the four-year-old was found unconscious at the bottom of a holiday swimming pool. Kate Miller says she is living every parent's 'worst nightmare' as she helplessly watches doctors battle to save her daughter Cally Simpson in a Barcelona hospital. Cally was found unconscious at the bottom of a swimming pool on Monday during her first holiday abroad at the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Catalonia. Tragic: Kate Miller tearfully kisses her daughter Cally Simpson, four, who is fighting for life after she was found at the bottom of the pool on her first holiday . After being rushed to a children's hospital she was placed in an induced coma amid fears of severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. Mrs Miller said: 'This is every parent's worst nightmare. I just want to swap places with my girl and make everything OK for her.' The girl, from Arbroath in Angus, Scotland, had . gone to the pool with her father Steven and grandmother when she is . thought to have fallen in earlier this week. She was pulled unconscious from the pool by another tourist and attempts were made to resuscitate her. Her . mother, who was at home in Scotland at the time of the tragedy, fought . her way through a strike by French air traffic controllers to get on a . flight to join distraught relatives at her bedside. She said: 'Thank you so much to everyone who has taken time out to pray for our wee girl also to all your kind words. 'Can I ask you all to keep praying as Cally is still in critical but stable condition. 'There . has been a wee bit of improvement as Cally has been given protein - . still makes no change as we need these scans done Sunday or Monday. Holiday: She was at the pool at the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Catalonia, with her grandmother and father when another tourist found her unconscious, pulled her to the side and made attempts to resuscitate her . Emergency: After being rushed to Barcelona children's hospital, Cally (pictured with her mother months before) was placed in an induced coma amid fears of severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen . 'Thanks again to all you lovely people as all your messages are keeping us going.' But despite their best hopes, the child's father said doctors had told them to prepare for bad news. Steven . Simpson said: 'The doctors have just spoke to me and Kate and have told . us to prepare ourselves as our baby could be brain dead. 'They . are going to start taking her off one medication in the next 24 hours . and if she has another seizure it's really bad and that means her brain . won't wake up. 'Please god help us wake our baby up. Please.' Cally . had been to see the dolphins Aquopolis Water Park in Salou earlier in . the day and was planning to visit the zoo before the incident. Fears: Cally may have been filling up her bucket in the pool as she played with her younger cousin when she fell, according to her aunt Debbie who was there . She was found by another British tourist and efforts were made to resuscitate her at the scene. Her . aunt Debbie Robertson, 27, who was staying at the same hotel said: 'I . just want her to wake up so I can take her to the beach with her bucket . and spade. 'We are all absolutely crushed, but we are hoping and praying that she will get better. 'She . really wanted to do two things, go and see the dolphins and go to the . zoo. We went to see the dolphins the morning of the accident, but we . didn't get to go to the zoo. 'She . is such a crazy, happy little girl, always happy, smiling and bossing . people about. We are so grateful to Ash who rescued her. 'We owe him so much. She is in a stable condition and she is getting colour back in her cheeks.' Cally was playing with Debbie's 22-month-old son, Darren, just before the accident happened. 'We think she was trying to fill her bucket up by the side of the pool,' said Mrs Robertson. 'She might have slipped in but we're just not sure exactly what happened. 'I remember someone was screaming and the next thing I saw she was being pulled out of the pool.' Speaking out about the tragedy, her distraught grandmother said they still did not know how the youngster ended up in the pool. Wendy Simpson, also from Arbroath, said: 'This was her first ever holiday. She can't swim. 'We . are all praying that she will pull through. There has been a slight . improvement. They have started to raise her temperature to 36.5 degrees. She is now stable. 'We were all there, but we don't know what happened. 'The last time we saw her she was walking behind her dad to the main building. We have no idea how she came to be in the pool. 'A man called Ash found her after a couple of minutes in the pool, I don't know his full name.' A Facebook page, Saving Cally Simpson, was set up to raise funds to pay for Kate's travel costs and now has more than 1,500 supporters. Messages of support have flooded in on the site and Cally's family have been adding to the page to update people about the young girl's condition. The incident took place during the girl's first holiday abroad to the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Spain, pictured . On the site, her mother wrote: 'Ill . see use the moro at 4 oclock tea time wow cant believe how much support . every1 has gave us. A massive thank you to all use guys we really . appreciate it xxxx' Sara Warren wrote: 'My heart goes out to you and your family.' And Louise Cargill wrote: 'Come on cally auntie lous needing to see that cheeky smile love u loads xxxxx.' Family friend Koula McCracken said the whole of Arbroath is praying for Cally. She said: 'Everyone is praying for Cally to pull through. We all did a whip round so Kate has money when she is in Spain. Kate is an amazing mum and Cally is her world.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national in Spain. We are providing consular assistance.'","Cally Simpson, from Arbroath, Angus, was on her first holiday abroad .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Weight-loss surgery - including gastric bands - helps to 're-wire' the brain, leaving people less interested in food, a study has found. Scientists in the U.S. examined MRI scans of patients who chose various different methods to shed the pounds. They discovered the brain reacts differently to images of food once the weight has been lost, depending on the method used. The study, carried out at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, compared those who lost weight after bariatric surgery, and those who opted for more conventional dieting methods. A new study carried out by scientists in the U.S. has found that weight loss surgery, like gastric band operations (file picture), help to 're-wire' the brain, leaving people less interested food . Following their weight loss, when confronted with images of pizza and other appetising food, scientists noticed the brains of the dieters were more active in the medical prefrontal cortex - the part of the brain known to regulate emotion and evaluate how we feel. The new study suggests that food means more to those who lose weight by changing their behaviour - i.e. reducing the number of calories they take in every day, and by increasing the exercise levels. On the other hand, people who undergo laparoscopic banding surgery appear to be more 'disconnected' from hunger pangs. 'They're not as interested in eating,' said lead author Amanda Bruce, psychologist at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of Kansas School of Medicine. 'They're not as motivated by food.' The study, which was published in the journal Obesity, is the first to assess changes in the brain associated with different methods of weight loss. Sixteen people who lost weight via dieting and 15 who had undergone bariatric surgery took part in the new research. They were of similar age, education level, and importantly had similar BMI's - body mass indices. 'A huge strength of this paper is that the people in the two different groups were a match on the weight that they had lost,' Ms Bruce said, reported futurity.org. The results showed the bariatric participants lost about 9.3 per cent of their body weight, while their dieting peers shed 10.8 per cent. The study compared brain scans of 16 people who underwent bariatric surgery with those of 15 people who lost weight through dieting and more conventional methods. Two scans were taken, before and after weight loss, and each time a person was shown pictures of appeal foods including pizza . Each participant was then given an MRI scan and scientists studied their brain activation levels as they looked at pictures of food. They were tested before and after losing weight. Dr Bruce said she expected to see differences between the groups' brain activity, but the differences recorded were not those she had anticipated. 'The brain area that showed greater change in activation for the diet participants is an area that is associated with attentional processing, salience, how much you value something,' she said. 'When people are working hard to lose weight, they’re still really focused in on food stimuli. 'They’re thinking about food a lot. That’s one of the challenges. They’re often thinking about the foods they maybe shouldn’t eat. They’re still very motivated by these food stimuli. They’re focused on them.' Meanwhile the bariatric surgery participants were not as bothered by food. Their second set of scans, carried out after they lost weight, showed decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. The study notes that evidence 'supports the notion that surgical weight loss patients undergo a 'forced' dietary restriction in avoiding discomfort that renders food cues to be less rewarding and less salient'.","Scientists in the U.S. examined brain scans of 16 people who lost weight after bariatric surgery and 15 people who shed the pounds through dieting .

"By . Daniel Miller . Picking up the dry cleaning can be such a tedious chore. But one enterprising businessman believes he has solved the problem, by delivering people's freshly-cleaned clothes using a military-style aerial drone. Manayunk Cleaners in Philadelphia have started using a four-bladed DJI Phantom quadracopter to whisk orders over the city's crowded streets direct to their customers' front doors. Scroll down for video . Just the ticket: A dry cleaning company has begin delivering clothes by aerial drone . Test flight: Manayunk Cleaners boss Harry Vartanian uses the drone to fly a customer's order through the streets of Philadelphia . The remote-controlled device may only be powerful enough to carry just a few light items, but could be the perfect solution in an emergency. It's the middle of rush hour, the roads are jammed, a customer needs their favourite dress or suit for an evening engagement, and they need it fast. Could a drone be the perfect answer? Manayunk Cleaners owner Harry Vartanian admits that the service is only in its infancy and there is still a long way to go before it replaces the traditional methods of popping along in person to pick up your clothes. While the current drone is only able to carry a couple of pounds over a short distance, Mr Vartanian is already planning an advanced model that can carry up to 10 pounds over a greater distance, according to NBC. In the meantime he said he will hold a lottery at the end of each month with the winner getting their order flown to the door. It's off: The radio-controlled drone whisks the item out of the dry cleaners shop and down the street . All of as flutter: It carries the item along a residential street . Prompt delivery: The order arrives fresh and clean at the customer's front door . Mr . Vartanian told the Huffington Post: 'It’s not just like all of a sudden . we are going to change the whole dry cleaning service. It is more of a . stepping stone.' Aerial drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, are normally used by the military or the police for spying or launching missile attacks on enemies. Their use in war has become extremely controversial with drone strikes blamed for hundreds of civilian casualties.

"By . James Tozer . A mother who took her five-year-old daughter to have a tick removed by a doctor was sent away to see a vet instead. Paula Binns, 26, took Lilyanna to her local surgery after finding the tiny parasite while plaiting the girl’s hair. But the GP tried unsuccessfully to remove the tick by hand and then said that Miss Binns needed to take her daughter to a vet. Paula Binns claims her GP advised she take her five-year-old daughter Lilyanna to a local vets practice to have a tick removed . When the family contacted a vet’s . practice, they were told it did not treat humans but could supply a tick . removal tool. Lilyanna’s discomfort was eventually relieved by a . neighbour who sterilised tweezers and extracted the parasite. Yesterday . Miss Binns, from Walkden, Salford, said: ‘My daughter’s a human being, . not an animal – it’s a shocking way to treat a little girl.’ Miss Binns spotted the tick last week after the youngster had been doing cartwheels on grassland. Aware . that removing the blood-sucking creature by hand can spread infections . such as Lyme disease, she took Lilyanna to Gill Medical Centre in . Manchester. Ms Binns has made a formal complaint to the doctors' surgery in Walkden, Greater Manchester . ‘When we first . went in she told me Lilyanna just had a scab, not a tick. She didn’t . believe me,’ the mother-of-two said. ‘But she had another look and . spotted the tick. Then she tried to pull it out with her fingers, but I . told her that that wouldn’t work. ‘She . Googled it and eventually told me there was nothing she could do. The . doctor kept saying, “It’s really stuck in there” and Lilyanna started to . panic and burst into tears … she thought something was seriously wrong . with her. ‘The only option [the GP] gave us was to take her to the vets. That’s not normal though, you can’t just say that to people.’ Lilyanna’s . stepfather Chris Hargreaves, 28, called Pet Medics where their Labrador . is registered, only to be told: ‘Sorry, we can’t do anything with . humans.’ The couple, who have an 18-month-old son, Bradley, complained to the surgery and are considering moving to another. Miss . Binns added: ‘I could have tried to take it out myself, but instead I . tried to do the right thing and take Lilyanna to see a professional who I . thought would know what they were doing. I’m disgusted they could try . to send a child to a vet.’ Kate . Armitage, manager of Gill Medical Centre, said its GPs consult the . website of charity Lyme Disease Action when dealing with ticks, adding: . ‘In the event a patient has a tick still attached we advise it should . only be removed using a specialist tick removal device.’ The . charity’s Sue Ockwell said vets can often supply removal kits ‘so as . far as we’re concerned the medical practice hasn’t done anything wrong’. But Louise O’Dwyer, . clinical director of Pet Medics, said she had never heard of their vets . treating children with ticks. She added: ‘I’d certainly be shocked if a . doctor told me to see a vet about a child’s medical condition.’ Guidance . from Public Health England advises that ticks – which can be as small . as a poppy seed – should be removed as soon as possible without . squeezing or crushing the creatures, and to see a doctor if symptoms . develop. The parasites can be spread from long grass or contact with . pets between spring and autumn. Because their bites do not cause . itchiness they can remain on the skin, sucking the person’s blood, for . days before falling off. Experts suggest using insect repellent and tucking trousers into socks when camping or hiking during warmer months. Ticks feed on the blood of humans and animals, and can pass on the debilitating Lyme disease . Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas. The parasites feed on the blood of humans and animals. Their bites often go unnoticed, leaving the tick to remain for several days gorging on blood, before dropping off. The longer the tick is left in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection. Lyme disease can affect a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system.What are the symptoms?The earliest and most common symptom is a pink or red circular rash around the bite site. It can develop three to 30 days after a person is bitten. The rash is described as being similar to a bull's-eye on a dart board. An infected person may also suffer flu-like symptoms, including tiredness, headaches and muscle or joint pain. If left untreated, further symptoms, including muscle pain and temporary paralysis of the facial muscles, can develop months or even years later. In its late stages the disease can trigger symptoms similar to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Lyme disease is not contagious but is the most common tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. Public Health England estimates there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales each year. Most tick bites happen in late spring, early summer and the autumn - the times when people are most likely to be outside, hiking or camping. There is currently no vaccine to prevent the disease. The best way to avoid it, is to avoid being bitten. Experts advise people walking in woodland areas wear long-sleeved clothes, tuck trousers into socks, use insect repellent, and importanly check for ticks when they return home. What to do if you find a tick: . If you do find a tick they can be removed by gently gripping the parasite as close to the skin as possible, preferrably using fine-toothed tweezers, and pulling steadily from the skin.Never use a lit cigarette end, a match head or essential oils to force the tick out.Source: NHS Choices .","Paula Binns took five-year-old Lilyanna to the GP after noticing the tiny parasite on her head while she plaited her hair .

"By . David Mccormack . Once seen as the bastion of . counter-culture a common criticism leveled at the Burning Man festival in recent years . is that it has blanded out and become overrun with too many . business-minded from the tech industry. And Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz did nothing to dispel that image when he revealed in a blog entry on Thursday that he took his boss Mark Zuckerburg along to last week's event in the Nevada Desert. Moskovitz met Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, dropped out at the same time and is now worth an estimated $4 billion. So inspired was Moskovitz on his return from a week in the desert that he wrote a blog post ‘Radical Inclusion vs. Radical Self-Reliance at Burning Man’ in which he revealed that Zuckerberg had stayed at the camp he built. Burning Man veteran and Facebook co-founder David Moskovitz has revealed that this year he took his boss Mark Zuckerberg along and that he mucked in and helped to put his own tent up . Party in the desert: Over 60,000 revelers converged on the Black Rock Desert in Nevada last week for the Burning Man festival . The blog featured a lengthy explanation of Moskovitz's . cool Burning Man credentials - because he’s been the past five years - and he . went on to give an interesting insight into what all those geeks were up . to out in the desert. He . confirmed that Zuckerberg had been in attendance, but was quick to deny . any suggestions that his boss had ‘paid into a turnkey experience.’ ‘Along with its other inhabitants, he helped pitch his own tent,’ wrote Moskovitz. ‘I . wanted him to experience the city and to experience gifting because I . thought it would make him grow as a person and the world better off as a . result; I believe that’s exactly what happened, however marginally (he . was already a pretty great person).’ Facebook co-founder David Moskovitz has revealed that he bumped into the Winklevoss twins at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert and that all is forgiven for when they tried to sued him . Moskovitz also revealed that he had . an emotional meeting with former arch enemies the Winklevoss twins, who . had famously sued the Facebook founders. Even . though Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss ‘are among the only people on earth . I might describe as real antagonists in my life or even enemies,’ Moskovitz said he went up and introduced himself to them. ‘In . spite of our tangled history, I had never actually met them; we only . communicated through lawyers. My first instinct was that I quite . obviously needed to introduce myself and start with hugs. ‘They . had just arrived so I wasn’t sure how they’d react, but they were very . gracious at the time and I knew they’d understand more deeply by the . time they left. 'Almost . immediately when I got back, I had a Facebook friend request from Tyler . and we started a thread mutually extolling the virtues of the festival. Each night at the Burning Man festival another art installation is set on fire, on Saturday night it was the turn of the man . 'In no uncertain terms, he described a . spiritual awakening. I had created all kinds of dark fantasies about . how meeting them would go (Tyler assures me it would have been cordial . regardless), but on playa it was laughably clear. There, we were all . part of the same community. We were always part of the same community.' Renewed . by ‘a deep appreciation of the fully connected and mutually supportive . community,’ Moskovitz went on to encourages more ‘entrepreneur invaders’ to experience the event. ‘When . I hear about anyone going for the first time, my immediate thought is . “that is so great for them” and when they are a person who has pooled . power or capital around them, it is usually followed by “that is so . great for the world.”’ The joke in Silicon Valley is that . last week was the worst time possible for starts-ups to fund-raise . because all the venture capitalists and leaders from the tech world had . gone to the Nevada desert to experience the Burning Man festival. This year's event was the largest ever with a capacity crowd of 68,000 people from all over the world - and a substantial number of tech billionaires . The . week-long art, music and everything-else festival where each night is . capped by the torching of elaborate large wooden sculptures was . celebrating its 27th year and ended on Labor Day. Once . seen as the bastion of counter-culture a common criticism leveled at . the event in recent years is that it has blanded out and become overrun . with too many business-minded from the tech industry. In . the past Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have attended and . so too has their CEO Eric Schmidt, in fact they’ve joked that that's how . he got the job in the first place, reports Verge. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos is another billionaire who enjoys the party in the Black Rock Desert, some 120 miles north of Reno. As well as a sizable number of tech billionaires, this year’s event was also attended by celebrities including P Diddy and George Clooney's ex-girlfriend Stacy Keibler who have both described going as a ‘life changing experience,’ while Former NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark was also 'spotted' at the festival.

Pictured for the first time, this is the housekeeper mistress Rolf Harris moved into his family home as he had an affair right under his wife’s nose. Harris has admitted that his secret affair with ‘spiritual healer’ Andrea Kingston – known as Andi – devastated his wife Alwen when she eventually found out about it and almost destroyed their marriage. The TV star boldly moved the pretty brunette – who died at the age of 49 from breast cancer – into the family home in the 1990s. Their affair is thought to have lasted a number of years. Scroll down for video . Housekeeper: Andi Kingston, pictured, lived rent-free with Harris and his wife at the family home in Bray, Berkshire . Harris also shamelessly accepted massages from his mistress, who was almost 20 years his junior, in front of his daughter Bindi when she was visiting, it was revealed in his trial. The mother-of-one, who died in 1999, had separated from her ex-husband Clive Kingston several years earlier. Retired Mr Kingston said that although he had stayed in contact with his ex-wife, he had no idea of the affair. Mr Kingston said: ‘Andi was an incredibly giving and supportive person. I knew she was friends with Rolf, but I had no idea they were involved in that way. ‘As far as I was concerned they were just friends, but he was obviously very fond of her as he visited her when she was dying.’ Miss Kingston, who adopted a son with learning difficulties, ran into financial problems in the mid-1990s and turned to Harris. Harris convinced his wife to let Miss Kingston live rent-free at their multi-million-pound riverside home in Bray, Berkshire, pictured . Mr Kingston said: ‘Andi was hopeless with money and she found herself in a bit of difficulty. ‘I know Harris said she could stay in his summer house in exchange for her house-sitting and taking care of his pets. But she didn’t ever mention that they were involved.’ Harris convinced his wife to let Miss Kingston live rent-free at their multi-million-pound riverside home in Bray, Berkshire. She moved in to the converted boathouse outside the main home which was originally used by Harris’s daughter when she was a teenager and had been dubbed ‘the Bindi House’. In return for her accommodation, Miss Kingston’s tasks were said to involve housekeeping, looking after the family pets and chauffeuring the entertainer around. But Harris also relied on her ‘spiritual guidance’ – and more. When the star’s daughter visited after the birth of her son in 1996, she was disturbed by the chemistry between the couple and confided in a friend – who, unbeknown to her, was one of her father’s victims. Rolf Harris walks from court accompanies by his wife Alwen, second left and daughter Bindi, right . During Harris’ trial, it was revealed that she told the woman: ‘I don’t know why Andi’s here. She’s giving my dad massages.’ She . told the court: ‘I thought there may have been a sexual relationship . going on and I was getting a bit fed up with her being around and I . wanted her to go.’ She said her friend, who had herself been in a relationship with Harris up until a few years earlier, reacted by saying: ‘The bitch, the old cow, she is so ugly, what on earth does he see in her? How dare he? What a s*** he is. Your dad is a right b******.’ It was after this reaction that Bindi asked the friend if her father had ever touched her, and the woman revealed he had abused her for more than 16 years. Harris admitted in court his affair with Miss Kingston continued until she had to move to a hospice after becoming ill with breast cancer. Miss Kingston, a former artistic director’s assistant, had initially refused treatment as she believed she could heal herself. Mr Kingston said: ‘I know he came to visit her in the hospice when she was dying on several occasions, she was on oxygen and in a bad way. He appeared to be quite caring towards her.’","First picture emerges of Rolf Harris's housekeeper mistress Andrea Kingston .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Engineers from Sichuan University have designed an LED projector that can be fitted to bicycles and help cyclists see the road ahead more effectively at night. Lumigrids projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike. As the road surface changes, the grid bends, curves and changes shape to highlight the potential hazards ahead. Lumigrids, an LED projector that can be fitted to bicycles to help cyclists see at night, has been designed by a team of engineers from Sichuan University. Lumigrids projects square grids onto the ground in front of the bike, as the road surface changes, the grid bends, curves and changes shape to highlight the hazards ahead . The Lumigrids projector is fixed to a bicycle’s handlebars. It can be powered by either an internal battery, when the bike is waiting at traffic lights or stationary. When the bicycle is moving, the rotation of the wheels can also power the gadget. Lumigrids only uses one button so that the rider isn't distracted when trying to use it while cycling. The . first press turns it on, the second press changes the mode of . projection, and holding the button down for two seconds turns the gadget . off. Lumigrids has three modes with different grid sizes that can be used to adapt to different situations. These are normal mode (14x18cm), high-speed mode (14x26cm), and team mode (30x20cm). Lumigrids has now been awarded the Red Dot Design Award for 2012 in the 'best of the best' category. The Chinese designers came up with the idea because they thought traditional bicycle lamps hindered the rider's judgment. In the award entry, they said: 'It can be difficult for night cyclists to get a good sense of the condition of the terrain ahead, even with a typical bicycle lamp. 'In many cases, a bicycle lamp will cast shadows on both concave and convex areas of the ground. 'This can hinder the rider's judgment of the road surface ahead, and increase the potential for danger.' On a flat road surface, the Lumigrids is made of standard squares. On a rough road surface, the grid's squares deform to correspond with the shape of the hazard in the road, or hole. Cyclists can monitor the motion and deformation of the grids and read the road ahead . On a flat road surface, the grid is made of standard squares.

"By . Shari Miller . Time for debate: Nick Clegg is calling for a review of drugs laws after his recent visit to Columbia . Nick Clegg is calling for Britain to undertake a major review of drugs laws after seeing first-hand the devastating consequences that rising cocaine demand has wrought upon Columbia. Despite robust legislation against A-class drugs, the deputy prime minister added that cocaine use has tripled in 20 years, while one in five young people have admitted to taking drugs in the last year. His calls for reformation come just a week after he visited Columbia, where he met President Juan Manuel Santos, as well as former paramilitaries, guerillas and human rights representatives. Columbia is just one of a number of Latin American countries that are demanding an alternative to the war on drugs. They argue military action does little to quell demand for drugs, but instead perpetuates conflict and violence. Writing in today's Observer, Clegg said: 'Many people in Britain and the rest of . Europe will be unaware of the impact drug use in western nations has on . countries on the frontline of the drugs trade.' He added: 'If Britain were fighting a war where . 2,000 people died every year, where increasing numbers of our young . people were recruited by the enemy and our opponents were always a step . ahead, there would be outcry and loud calls for change.' Instead, Clegg argues, Britain has resisted 'a proper debate' about the need for a change of strategy. He revealed the Lib Dems are conducting a review of alternative approaches adopted by other countries and said he wished to see the issue brought to the table in 2016, when the UN is due to hold a meeting to discuss potential drug reforms. Clegg wrote: 'The UK can lead the debate in Europe and . Europe can lead the debate in the world. But we must be prepared to . start afresh with a new mindset and be prepared to do things . differently.' The deputy prime minister's comments will be seen by some as designed to distance the Lib Dems from the Tories ahead of the next general election - and will dismay those who say reform will encourage drug taking. However, his pro-reform stance will bolster the argument of campaigners who say alternatives are needed to help not just drug users, but also countries like Columbia which have been heavily affected by the growing drugs trade. Impact: Clegg also saw the devastation wrought by drugs during his visit to Brazil in 2011 . War on drugs: Demand for Columbia's coca leaves, used to produce cocaine, are on the rise despite drugs laws (file pic) Just this week, Canada revealed one of its new approaches to the drug problem after Vancouver became home to the country's first crackpipe vending machines. Installed on the city's Downtown Eastside, the machines offer Pyrex crackpipes for only 25 cents and are intended to curb the . spread of disease among drug users. Kailin See, the director of the Drug Users Resource Centre in Vancouver argued that harm reduction strategies lead to overall decreases . in the infectious disease rates and make addicts more likely to get . treatment by introducing them to health professionals. 'This . is one piece of a larger puzzle,' See said. 'You have to have . treatment, you have to have detox, you have to have safe spaces to use . your drug of choice, and you have to have safe and clean supplies.' See . argued that as every new HIV or hepatitis case could cost taxpayers up . to $250,000 in medical treatment a mere 25 cents for a new pipe was a . bargain.

"By . Associated Press . Tragic: Surfing legend Ricky Grigg has died of pneumonia in his Honolulu home aged 77 . Ricky Grigg, a former top-ranked big-wave surfer and oceanographer whose work confirmed one of Charles Darwin's theories about the origin of tropical islands, has died aged 77. His wife, Maria, said that Grigg died of pneumonia on May 21 at his home in Honolulu. The celebrated surfing pioneer was also a marine researcher who explored undersea volcanoes and once spent 15 days submerged off the California coast in an experimental capsule called Sealab II, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Richard Wayman Grigg was born in Los . Angeles and grew up in Santa Monica. As a youth he traveled the . California coast in search of big waves. In . the 1960s, Grigg was the world's top-ranked big-wave surfer. He . appeared in more than a dozen surf movies and did a turn as a surfing . coach for a 1964 episode of the TV drama 'Dr. Kildare'. As a surfer, Grigg was known for exuberantly raising his arms over his head at points during his ride. Grigg had 'a classic style', Fred . Hemmings, a former world champion surfer who went on to become a Hawaii . state legislator, told the newspaper. 'He stood erect, and his lines were long and clean. I was a half-generation behind him, and he was one of my heroes.' As an oceanographer, much of his research . centered on the atolls and submerged islands of the Hawaiian-Emperor . chain, an archipelago extending nearly 4,000 nautical miles into the . Pacific. Scroll down for video . Champion: Ricky Grigg Grigg was the world's top-ranked big-wave surfer in the 1960s known for standing erect on the board . Classic style: As a big-wave surfer, Ricky Grigg was known for exuberantly raising his arms over his head at points during his ride . At its northwest reaches, he discovered the 'Darwin Point' — a latitude at which, for various reasons, the growth of coral colonies slows and the volcanic islands built upon them start to 'drown', the Los Angeles Times reported. To measure the growth of coral in a vast ocean realm and get a sense of islands rising and sinking, Grigg organized dozens of researchers in airplanes, boats and submersibles. Their study, which took five years, was the first to probe the remote reefs, a collaborator, University of Hawaii oceanographer Steve Dollar, told the newspaper. Grigg also explored volcanic activity beneath the waters off Hawaii. In 1971 he and Dollar dived into a sea steaming with molten lava from a volcano. Passionate about the ocean: After Ricky Grigg made a name for himself as a top surfer, he became an oceanographer and studied the atolls and submerged islands of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain . Dodging a layer of scalding water and streams of cascading lava, they came upon a twisting, ropy tangle of exploding volcanic debris. 'We decided to collect a couple of samples, take a dozen or so quick pictures and then get the hell out of there,' Grigg wrote in his 2012 book, 'In the Beginning: Archipelago, The Origin and Discovery of the Hawaiian Islands'. They were the first divers in history to witness such a spectacle, he said.

"By . Associated Press . The widow of a man who died in New York City police custody after apparently being placed in a chokehold says he wasn't violent. Esaw Garner said Saturday that her husband, Eric Garner, 'was a quiet man, but he's making a lot of noise now.' Members of Garner's family spoke at the Harlem headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton. Comfort in death: Esaw Garner, right, is consoled by family members at the funeral for her husband, Eric Garner, at Bethel Baptist Church.

A quiet man: Esaw Garner said her husband was a quiet man but that 'he's making a lot of noise now' Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said she wants justice for her son. Garner died last week as he was being arrested on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. An amateur video shows a plainclothes officer placing Garner in what appears to be a chokehold. Garner gasped, 'I can't breathe!' Autopsy results are pending further testing. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice Department is 'closely monitoring' the investigation into Garner's death. Victim: . Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer . Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has . said he was 'not in great distress . NYPD .

The . commissioner, who met with FBI officials following Garner's death, said . he anticipated a civil suit by the family and 'would not be surprised . if the U.S. attorney 'decides to open a civil rights violation . investigation.' An . initial report into Garner's death released earlier this week did not . mention a chokehold, claiming he 'was not in great distress' and his . health 'did not  get worse' as he was held down. The . omission has sparked an angry reaction from City Hall, with state . senator Bill Perkins shouting: 'This is murder' during a rally.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Almost 25 years ago, McDonald's arrived in the Soviet Union and delighted Russians with their first taste of American fast-food culture - but now the company is the subject of a lawsuit that that could ban it from selling some of its signature products. The company is being taken to court by the Russian consumer protection agency for selling foods that contain more fats and carbohydrates than are allowed by national regulations. The lawsuit cannot come at a more difficult time as relations between the United States and Russia worsen as a result of the Ukraine crisis. Scroll down for video . Tensions: Russia's consumer protection agency has filed a lawsuit in a Moscow court seeking to ban some of McDonald's Corp's burgers along with its milk shakes and ice cream . Propaganda: Russian food regulators say the company is deceiving consumers about the energy value of its Cheeseburger Royales, Filet-o-Fish, Cheeseburgers and Chicken Burgers and about nutritional value of its milkshakes and ice creams . The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine for allegedly supporting separatist rebels who are fighting in eastern Ukraine. Although there's no demonstrable connection between the McDonald's suit and the tensions, the consumer protection agency, Rospotrebnadzor, has a history of actions that appear to dovetail Russia's political agenda. As tensions between Russia and Georgia escalated before their 2008 war, Russia banned the import of Georgian wine and mineral water — two of its major export products — for failing to meet sanitary norms. Last year, as tensions heated up over Ukraine's desire to sign a trade pact with the European Union, Russia banned imports of chocolates made by the company of Petro Poroshenko, a tycoon who supported the EU deal and is now Ukraine's president. Rospotrebnadzor said on its website that it brought the case after inspections of two of the company's restaurants in Novgorod. According to the statement, some food was found with microbial contamination and several items had caloric values two to three times higher than allowed by national regulations. Fast food: McDonald's said in a statement it had not received any complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit. It said its food was produced according to methods approved by Russian authorities . Products that were mentioned for incorrect nutritional information were cheeseburgers, Royal Cheeseburgers — the local equivalent of the Quarter Pounder — fish sandwiches and several milkshake varieties. The suits asks that sale of McDonald's products that do not meet the regulations be declared illegal, but it was not clear what penalty the company could face. The two restaurants in Novgorod were to be fined 70,000 rubles ($2,100). McDonald's prompted the ire of Russian nationalists earlier this year after it closed its outlets in Crimea. The animosity is a far cry from the fascination that Muscovites had for McDonald's when it opened its first outlet in the Soviet Union in 1990; customers waited in hours-long lines to experience the efficient service and reliable availability of items — rare novelties in the Soviet era. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, other American and European chains staked out their own territory. Russian malls now have food courts virtually identical to America's, except that Cinnabon, Sbarro and other familiar names are written in Cyrillic.","Food agency has accused the restaurant chain of violating government nutritional and safety codes .

"By . Darren Boyle . Hard-core Argentinian football fans have been camping out on Brazilian beaches despite the World Cup finishing almost a month ago. It is estimated that 160,000 Argentines travelled to Brazil for the World Cup with the majority of them leaving following their extra time defeat by Germany. However, tens of thousands have vowed to remain in Brazil and start a new life despite running low on cash. Thousands of Argentina fans have refused to return home following their World Cup defeat to Germany . Lucas Bazan Pontoni arrived in Rio de Janeiro almost a month ago and is surviving on heavily subsidised meals from a soup kitchen. The 23-year-old actor said: 'Brazil is amazing, and I want to stay It could be weeks or months or longer. I'm going to see where life and the road take me.' Local media reports say tens of thousands of Argentine fans remain in the country. They appear to be overwhelmingly young and male. Most are in their 20s, and less than a third of them are women. Brazil's Federal Police did not respond to email and telephone requests seeking confirmation of how many Argentines are still here. Brazilian authorities are now worried that many of these fans will try and claim welfare benefits or seek a living by scrounging. Argentina is suffering an economic meltdown with high unemployment rates. Antonio Pedro Figueira de Mello, who heads Rio's tourism promotion agency, has acknowledged that controls along Brazil's 780-mile land border with its southern neighbor may have been too lax during the tournament. 'We were taken by surprise. In any place in the world, people have to state where they're going, how much time they're staying, what resources they have and whether they have health insurance. That was not done.' Many of the migrants have refused to return home because of the economic turmoil in their home country . Argentines don't need a visa, or even a passport, to visit Brazil. A government ID card will do. Mello spoke at the Sambadrome, which was turned into a makeshift campsite to help accommodate the waves of Argentines who arrived by car, bus and motorhome during the World Cup. The site was closed last week, and the last campers were evicted. Media reports said Argentine consular officials were there to help organise return transportation for people whose money ran out or whose documents were lost or stolen, but many reportedly weren't interested in such help. The stragglers dress mostly in raggedy shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops, bathing infrequently at public water fountains or outdoor showers at the beach. There is no need for warm clothes in Rio, where the temperatures currently hover around 28 degrees Celsius. Brazil and Argentine harbor a deep rivalry over soccer, and scattered fights between young men from both nations were seen in Rio and other cities during the Cup. But the lingering presence of the Argentines hasn't seemed to ruffle any feathers. Officials fear the the influx will place an additional burden on Brazil's over-stretched welfare system . In fact, Fatima Souza de Oliveira, a 60-year-old high school Portuguese teacher, said she saw the stragglers as an homage to the Brazilian way of life. 'I think it's our relaxed attitude, our beaches and the warmth of the climate and the people that enchanted them,' she said. 'Everyone who came for the Cup loved it and they all probably wanted to stay.' The Argentines are not the only World Cup fans intent on remaining in Brazil. Last week, police in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul said several hundred fans from the West African nation of Ghana applied for asylum after coming in on tourist visas to follow their national team. Brazil is studying the applications. It could prove much more difficult to control the Argentines, without any visa requirements. Following their eviction from the Sambadrome, Pontoni and 10 or so of his compatriots moved to a nearby park, where they lounged on the grass with their oversized backpacks. They knotted friendship bracelets and prepared other handicrafts to hawk on the beach. 'I don't think I'm going back,' said 25-year-old Martin Sichero, a friend of Pontoni. 'I came for the World Cup, but now I think I'm here for good.'","Thousands of Argentine football fans refuse to return home after World Cup .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Singer, songwriter ... agony aunt? Taylor Swift is known for turning her heartbreak into hits - but now the 24-year-old is providing personalized love advice to her devoted fans. When lovestruck Hannah asked the Grammy-winning singer on Instagram for tips on unrequited love, Swift quickly responded with heartfelt words of wisdom. Scroll down for video . Agony aunt: Love-struck Hannah wrote to Taylor Swift on Instagram seeking advice and was shocked when the country singer responded . Hannah, using the name 'sherbetswift', posted a picture of herself with a question: 'There’s a guy Taylor, a guy who’s sweet and charming and makes me laugh... 'A guy who I have the biggest crush in the whole wide world on, and he’ll never like me back. (And he has a girlfriend who he adores and she’s pretty and has an amazing figure and is actually nice to me)... @taylorswift can you give me some advice maybe. I love you.' To her amazement, her music idol swiftly responded. 'Hannah. Eyes, eyes, eyes. Woah. You have . the prettiest, widest, most child like eyes. (Composes herself) Okay. About this guy. I think we grow up thinking the only love that counts as . true love is the kind that lasts forever or is fully realized. When you . have a broken heart, the first thing a stranger will ask is ‘how long . were you two together?’ 'As if your pain can be determined by how long . you were with someone. Or if you were with them at all. I don’t think . that’s how it works. 'I think unrequited love is just as valid as any . other kind. It’s just as crushing and just as thrilling. No matter what . happens in this situation, I want you to remember that what you are . doing is selfless and beautiful and kind.' Out and about: Taylor Swift was spotted walking through Central Park in New York on Thursday with a male friend . Swift continued: 'You are loving someone purely . because you love them, not because you think you’ll ever have your . affections reciprocated. 'You are admiring something for its beauty, . without needing to own it. Feel good about being the kind of person who . loves selflessly. I think someday you’ll find someone who loves you in . that exact same way.' Hannah was clearly surprised the 'Love Story' singer replied to her post, writing back, 'I feel like you’re the big sister I don’t have. Thank you, I really did need to hear that from you.' Taylor is no stranger to heartbreak, known for penning songs about her famous past loves - and infamous breakups - including Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer. Romantic: Some of singer Taylor Swift's songs are inspired by love and relationships . The blonde beauty has even compared music to being in a relationship, saying that discovering new artists or albums can be like anything from 'a passing fling' to finding 'the one'. 'Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to),' she wrote for the Wall Street Journal earlier this month. 'Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past. 'However, some artists will be like finding 'the one'. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren.'","Love-struck fan Hannah asked Taylor Swift's advice on Instagram .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An ESPN host has been taken to task by one of his own colleagues for comments he made during a discussion of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's two-game suspension for allegedly knocking out his fiancee. The punishment has been criticized as too lenient for such an act, but Stephen A. Smith made an ill-advised attempt to come at the issue from both sides during a First Take segment Friday. Ray Rice was captured on camera knocking his then-fiancee (now wife) unconscious at an Atlantic City casino and dragging her limp body from the elevator. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Provocation: Stephen A Smith won the ire of many who watched First Take Friday and heard him advise women not to 'provoke' men into abusing them . In a meandering comment, Smith comes to the conclusion that while no man should ever hit a woman, women, for their part, should learn not to behave in such a way as to 'provoke' his anger. Smith appears to believe that being a man 'who was raised by women' and has himself raised daughters, he is well-qualified to advise women on how to behave. 'Let's make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,' he says, presumably to his female viewers. '...I think that just talking about what guys shouldn’t do, we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn’t happen.' Taken to task: ESPN host Michelle Beadle didn't let her work relationship with Smith get in the way of her indignation at his comments . Scathing: Beadle didn't hold back in her condemnation of Smith's comments . Victim-blaming: Beadle alluded to the victim-blaming culture surrounding rape . His colleague Michelle Beadle, cohost of SportsNation on ESPN2, tweeted a response to Smith's rant, insinuating that he was victim-blaming. 'So I was just forced to watch this morning's First Take. A) I'll never feel clean again B) I'm now aware that I can provoke my own beating,' she wrote. In another tweet, she said, 'I'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend...I'd hate to think what I'd be asking for by doing so @stephenasmith. #dontprovoke.' She went on: 'Violence isn't the victim's issue. It's the abuser's. To insinuate otherwise is irresponsible and disgusting. Walk. Away.' Smith responded to his critics with a series of tweets that have since been deleted. Lenient punishment: Ray Rice was caught on camera knocking his then-fiancee out cold and dragging her body from a casino elevator and was given a two-game suspension . 'Enough is enough,' he wrote. 'I simply asked: now what about the other side … what about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them?' In subsequent tweets, he essentially reiterated the comments he made on-air. A second, longer statement was issued later Friday, in which Smith said that he does 'not believe a woman provokes the horrible domestic abuses that are sadly such a major problem in our society.' He apologized if his comments were taken to convey anything other than his condemnation of violence against women.","ESPN host Stephen A.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police in Singapore destroyed two pieces of evidence tied to the death of Shane Todd, whose body was found in his apartment there in June 2012, according to the American engineer's family. The 31-year-old's parents, Rick and Mary Todd, have for months been demanding the Singapore government return the hand-made noose and towel around their son's neck when his body was discovered by his girlfriend hanging from his bathroom door. The authorities there deemed the incident a suicide yet the towel and the noose - made from a computer bag strap - contained the DNA of two unknown people, according to official reports. Shane Todd, shown here on a kayak in Singapore, was found hanging from a bathroom door in his apartment in the island nation in June 2012. His mother says he told her months earlier that he felt his life was under threat . Rick and Mary Todd, who believe their son was murdered, have been battling to get the noose and towel back from Singaporean authorities for months . No further testing was done to determine whose DNA it was. 'Rick and I wanted the towel and the strap returned to us in order to do what the SPF [Singapore Police Force] should have done in the first place - to test the...DNA (on the items),' Mary Todd told CBS News. 'We have ample evidence that our son was murdered, but the towel and the strap were the only DNA evidence in Shane's case, and now they have been destroyed forever.' She added that the items should be returned because they belong to her son. She and her husband retained a Singapore lawyer to help them get to the bottom of the incident, and the issue of what happened to the noose and towel became the subject of emails, official letters and hearings in recent months. Senior State Counsel Tai Wei Shyong addresses the media after day five of the coroner's inquiry on the death of U.S. engineer Shane Todd at the subordinate courts in Singapore in May 2013 . This is a photo of the Institute of Microelectronics, where Shane Todd worked before he died. He told his parents his life was under threat because Chinese firm Huawei, which was working on a business deal with the institute, wanted him to divulge U.S. secrets . Singapore's attorney general, however, said in a report that it is 'normal protocol' for items used in hanging cases to be 'forfeited to the state for disposal'. The government had asked the family to explain why it wanted the items returned but the lawyer refused the request, CBS News reported. 'In law, there is no reason to explain why you want your property back,' the lawyer wrote to the Todd family. 'It's like justifying to a robber why you want your belongings returned. Sheer chutzpah. It's the family's by right. Mary and Rick Todd, center, in a family photo with their son Shane (back right), his brothers and the wife of one of them . Singapore's state coroner concluded in July of last year that Todd's death was caused by 'asphyxia due to hanging' and ruled out foul play. The Todds, however, insist their son was murdered after he was asked to compromise U.S. security by revealing secrets to a Chinese company, and that the crime scene was staged to make it appear like suicide. The company, Huawei Technologies, which has been declared a threat to U.S. national security by the House Intelligence Committee, was at the time discussing a joint project with Todd's Singapore employer, the Institute of Microelectronics. Both companies deny their business discussions involved any classified military information. The project was abandoned soon after Todd's death.

"By . Sanchez Manning . For the sophisticated palates of the Chipping Norton Set, you might expect that nothing less than Waitrose would do. But now locals including David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks are poised to welcome a surprising addition to their town – Aldi. The budget foodstore has won planning permission to build an outlet on scrubland just 500 metres from the genteel High Street in the Cotswolds town. Aldi is planning to open a new store in the upmarket Chipping Norton, just off the town's High Street (file picture) It’s the latest sign of the middle classes turning in increasing numbers to Aldi and fellow German discount supermarket Lidl for their shopping. And the new store will give the Prime Minister the opportunity to counter accusations of elitism after he revealed himself to prefer Waitrose shopping earlier this year. Addressing John Lewis staff in April, he said: ‘I shop at various different supermarkets. I’m going to be honest with you. ‘When I’m at home in the constituency, I go to Sainsbury’s in Chipping Norton, because there isn’t a Waitrose. The Prime Minister had previously revealed himself to be a Waitrose customer . ‘When I’m having a day in the central town in my constituency, I go to Waitrose in Witney.’ Chipping Norton’s mayor Mike Tysoe said the new budget store has had an almost unanimous welcome from residents. He said: ‘It ticks all the boxes across the board in the community. The area isn’t just a chocolate box picture. There are a great many rural families on very tight budgets. ‘A lot of them go once or twice a month to Aldi in Banbury for a big shop. That’s a 28-mile round trip. They are extremely happy that they’ll no longer have to do that.’ Chipping Norton is not the only middle class bastion Aldi is set to gain a foothold in, with plans for 48 new stores this year – more than any of the other supermarkets. Other wealthy spots earmarked for the no-frills retailer include Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Epsom in Surrey and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Lidl, too, is expanding with plans for 15 more UK shops this year, including in upmarket places like Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.","Budget chain given go-ahead to build a store in exclusive Chipping Norton .

"By . Suzannah Hills . The first ever gold coin to be struck in the U.S. more than 225 years ago is expected to fetch at least $5 million at auction. The gold doubloon was struck in 1787 and was the fledgling country's first ever coin intended for circulation in America's emerging colonies. Prior to its launch, settlers used foreign copper and silver coins they had brought with them or coins they had forged themselves. But only a handful of the gold doubloons were ever made and just seven exist worldwide today.The coin is estimated to sell for at least $5million when it goes under the hammer. Going under the hammer: This gold doubloon struck in 1787 is expected to sell for five million at auction . But experts believe it could fetch far more, beating the $7.6 million dollars paid for a $20 coin from 1933 called a Double Eagle, making it the second most expensive coin in the world. It could potentially even rival the $10 million world record set in January 2013 by the sale of a 1794 one dollar coin. The gold doubloon contains 26.66 grams of gold - slightly less than an ounce - and was worth $16 at the time, around $400 today. It was struck by New York goldsmith Ephraim Brasher, a neighbour to George Washington, and is being auctioned on behalf of coin expert Walter Perschke who bought it in 1979 for $430,000. On one side it features the Great Seal of the United States - an eagle holding an olive branch in its talons - and the motto 'e pluribus unum' meaning 'out of many, one'. On the reverse is a sunrise over a mountain with the words 'Nova Eboraca Columbia excelsior'. Columbia was an early name for the United Sates, Nova Eboraca is Latin for New York and excelsior - 'even higher' - was its motto. Worth more than its weight in gold: The coin contains 26.66 grams of gold which was worth $16 when it was made but is now worth $400 . Mark Borckardt, an expert in currency from Heritage Auctions, said: 'The Brasher Doubloon is a wonderful piece with an incredible history. 'It is one of the most famous coins in existence and among the most valuable too. 'What makes it so special is that it was the first gold coin ever to be struck in the USA. 'At the time the coins used by the fledgling colonies were either foreign ones they had brought with them or copper and silver coins they produced themselves. 'There were no gold coins and that was something Congress wanted to rectify. Top dollar: A Flowing Hair Silver Dollar, believed to have been the first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint, sold for slightly more than $10 million at a New York auction last January . 'Ephraim Brasher, a goldsmith in New York City and a neighbour of George Washington, produced a small number of gold coins called doubloons worth 16 dollars face value. 'Only seven now survive, two of which are in museums, and of the remaining five this one is the finest example - it is like new. 'The seller is a prominent coin dealer who bought the doubloon the last time it came up for sale in 1979 and has treasured it ever since. 'It will be many years before a coin like this comes up for sale again and we expect the auction to be a momentous event.' The auction will take place in Orlando, Florida, tomorrow.","The coin was struck in 1787 by New York goldsmith Ephraim Brasher .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . Nick Clegg has revealed his sympathy for Prince Charles, saying he was living through a 'nightmare' waiting to become king . Nick Clegg has blundered into the debate over whether the Queen should step down in favour of Prince Charles by saying the heir to the Throne was living through a ‘nightmare’. The Deputy Prime Minister sparked a Royal row by revealing his sympathy for Charles, who, he said, had been waiting so long in the ‘ante-room’ before becoming King. In unguarded comments on the highly sensitive subject, Mr Clegg was overheard saying: ‘I’ve always quite liked him [Charles] actually. It must be a nightmare just being in this ante-room for decades.’ The remarks come just a few weeks after the unexpected abdication of Spanish King Juan Carlos in favour of his son, but there have been no signs that the Queen has any intention of following suit. And last night, Tory MPs rounded on Mr Clegg for breaking the taboo that Ministers do not comment on the thorny issue of the succession to the Throne. Stuart Andrew, MP for Pudsey in West Yorkshire, said: ‘Given that next year the Queen will become our longest-serving monarch, Nick Clegg’s remarks are as untimely as they are disrespectful. ‘Prince Charles gives as much dedication to his role as the Queen gives to hers. ‘Surely, the Deputy Prime Minister is not going to suggest next that she should abdicate! That’s not how we do things in this country.’ The Queen, 88, is due to become Britain’s longest- serving Monarch next year when she overtakes Queen Victoria’s reign of 63 years and seven months. In contrast, Prince Charles has been heir to the Throne for all but three of his 65 years. Mr Clegg’s surprise intervention, which came at a reception at Westminster, follows his staunch defence of Charles after the Prince claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin was behaving like Adolf Hitler over the Ukraine. When the Kremlin angrily claimed the comments ‘don’t befit a future British Monarch’, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted Charles was ‘free to express himself’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, shaking hands with Prince Charles, has been rounded on by Tory MPs for breaking the taboo on talking about succession to the Throne . A spokesman for Mr Clegg last night said: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister was asked a question at a reception by somebody writing a book about Prince Charles. ‘He cannot remember the exact way he responded, but all he was saying was expressing that it must be a difficult situation to be in on a personal level.’ There were claims that King Juan Carlos had said he was abdicating because he did not want his son to ‘grow old waiting for the throne like Prince Charles’. According to a report in Spain’s El Mundo newspaper, he had privately told aides: ‘I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.’ Last night, a spokesman for Prince Charles declined to comment on Mr Clegg’s remarks.","Deputy PM said Prince Charles had been waiting so long in the 'ante-room'

David Tredinnick said astrology had a ‘proven track record’ at helping people recover from illness and should be incorporated into standard medical treatments. The MP for Bosworth in Leicestershire also admitted he had prepared astrological charts for fellow MPs – but refused to say who. ‘I am absolutely convinced that those who look at the map of the sky for the day that they were born and receive some professional guidance will find out a lot about themselves and it will make their lives easier,’ he told MPs. Speaking to the BBC this week he added: ‘I think it’s something that people should be aware of as an option they have if they are confused about themselves.’ However, he stopped short of suggesting that the NHS should provide astrological readings. He attempted to pre-empt his critics, describing them as ‘bullies’ and declaring: ‘There is no logic in attacking something that has a proven track record.’ He also revealed that Chris Patten, Britain’s last governor of Hong Kong, had an official astrologer. Mr Tredinnick is a member of two influential Commons committees, the health and science and technology committees.

"By . Neil Sears . and Arthur Martin . On reality show Made in Chelsea, the petty squabbles and vindictive fallouts of London’s ultra-privileged super-rich are played out across the screen. But one of the programme’s regulars could soon be airing her dirty laundry on a different stage, after her ex-boyfriend moved to take their fight over £210,000 worth of jewellery to the High Court. Ian Hudaly, 33, dated 25-year-old Made in Chelsea regular Emma Miller on and off between 2009 and 2013. When the relationship ended for good last September, he asked her to hand back a diamond and sapphire Cartier bracelet and its matching ring. Scroll down for video . Ian Hudaly, 33, dated 25-year-old Made in Chelsea regular Emma Miller (above) on and off between 2009 and 2013. When the relationship ended for good last September, he asked her to hand back a diamond and sapphire Cartier bracelet and its matching ring . Miss Miller – who is said to have dated A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio – refused, prompting Mr Hudaly, the son of a multi-millionaire dentist, to put forward a civil legal claim. The explosive document accuses the model of subjecting him to ‘emotional abuse’ by taunting him over presents she received from ‘a series of gentlemen’ – which he says led him to fear she was ‘acting as an escort’. And it sheds some light on the affluent pair’s remarkable tiffs, claiming she took a £36,000 vase as well as his two passports when he didn’t give her the jewellery she wanted for her birthday. Miss Miller, a regular on the celebrity circuit, has been pictured with American reality queen Kim Kardashian and once boasted on her Twitter account of enjoying breakfast at Harrods with Stella McCartney. The model has featured in L’Oreal and Avon campaigns, and is said to have dated DiCaprio in 2009. Miss Miller – who is said to have dated A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio – refused to return the jewellery, prompting Mr Hudaly (above), the son of a multi-millionaire dentist, to put forward a civil legal claim . Only this week she was spotted in St Tropez where she attended the star’s charity gala. She is also said to have romanced the star of US TV show Desperate Housewives Jesse Metcalfe. Miss Miller is a regular on the E4 reality show Made in Chelsea. She joined in April as the love interest of womaniser Spencer Matthews – whose family own an exclusive Caribbean hotel. But her former flames seem to have landed her in hot water with her ex. His claim refers to her ‘series of gentlemen’ admirers, saying: ‘The claimant avers that the relationship suffered because the defendant subjected him to emotional abuse by taunting him with expensive gifts, travel and accommodation provided by a series of gentlemen, which led him to be concerned she was acting as an escort.’ Mr Hudaly’s claim continues: ‘The claimant is the owner of a Cartier sapphire and diamond bangle and a sapphire and diamond ring. ‘The jewellery’s value is £210,117.75. The claimant demanded the return of the jewellery, but the defendant refuses to return it. Any claim that the jewellery was gifted to her is expressly denied.’ The legal document goes on to detail the row about property developer Mr Hudaly’s ‘Lalique serpent vase’ worth £36,220 and his two passports. It says: ‘The defendant admitted she had taken the vase and the passports without his knowledge. She stated she had taken them because he had not given her a particular bracelet she desired as a birthday present. ‘She subsequently returned the passports because our client was required to travel. She eventually agreed to return the vase to the claimant’s solicitors via her brother.’ Mr Hudaly’s claim concludes by demanding the return of the jewellery or £210,000, plus interest, and suggests damages could also be due. Mr Hudaly works in the investments office of his father, David Hudaly, who made £120million selling the chain of dentists he started in Bolton. His son, who lives in a £1million flat in Belgravia, said last night: ‘I don’t particularly have any ill-will towards Emma – I just want the jewellery back. It was a loan to her. She wants to be famous and I think the whole fame thing has gone to her head.’ But in yet another twist in the sorry tale, Mr Hudaly later claimed that he was considering withdrawing his claim to save his ex any embarrassment. Last night a spokesman for Miss Miller said she was unavailable for comment, but her lawyer stressed that she has denied all the claims. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ian Hudaly, 33, dated Made in Chelsea regular Emma Miller, 25, on and off between 2009 and 2013 .

"By . Abul Taher . It was supposed to be a high-profile, cheerful celebration of Countryfile’s best-known star. But last week’s programme to mark John Craven’s 25 years with the BBC’s rural affairs series has degenerated into a bitter row – after former presenter Miriam O’Reilly accused the Corporation of ‘erasing’ her from the show’s history. Ms O’Reilly co-hosted Countryfile with Mr Craven for eight years from 2001. But the anniversary programme did not include one shot or mention of her, despite showing dozens of clips from Mr Craven’s years on the series. Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly, who says she was deliberately left out of a tribute to fellow presenter John Craven . She believes that a deliberate decision to exclude her was taken because BBC bosses have still not forgiven her for launching a landmark age-discrimination case against the Corporation after she was axed from Countryfile in 2009. Ms O’Reilly, now 57, and three fellow female presenters in their 40s and 50s – Juliet Morris, Charlotte Smith and Michaela Strachan – were dropped ahead of the programme leaving its Sunday morning slot for a prime time evening slot. While the three other presenters went quietly, Ms O’Reilly took the BBC to an employment tribunal and won a case for age discrimination. She is believed to have been awarded between £100,000 and £250,000. ‘I am not angry, as I am past that now. But I am disappointed,’ she said after watching the anniversary Countryfile. ‘I feel I’ve been erased from the show’s history. It was the BBC’s way of wiping out my contribution because I challenged them at this tribunal. ‘I appreciate the show was marking John’s 25th anniversary at Countryfile, and he was editing it, but I presented the show with him for eight years and they’ve left me completely out.’ She also pointed out that she worked for the BBC for 25 years and has won a number of prestigious awards. In last Sunday’s show, the three other female presenters who were axed with Ms O’Reilly also did not get a mention. But the younger presenter hired to replace them in 2009, Julia Bradbury, now 44, was shown twice. Ms O’Reilly said she had not intended to watch the anniversary Countryfile, but fans who follow her on Twitter alerted her to the snub. Countryfile star John Craven, far right, who co-hosted the BBC programme with Ms O'Reilly for eight years from 2001 . One fan, known as ‘Craig O’, tweeted: ‘It’s not right that you seem to have been erased from its history but BBC are good at not mentioning certain things!’ Another wrote: ‘Catching up with John Craven’s 25yr retrospective on #Countryfile. Strangely, no Miriam O’Reilly to be seen... It was appalling.’ Speaking from her home in Aberdovey, Wales, Ms O’Reilly said she had a ‘professional and friendly’ relationship with Mr Craven, 73, and does not believe he was responsible for editing her out of the show. She believes that it was the work of BBC executives who have ‘blacklisted’ her. ‘I feel they just have not accepted the findings of the tribunal, where judges said that I was discriminated against because of my age,’ she said. ‘Publicly they said they accepted its findings, but privately they did not. ‘This is why I have been left out. It’s childish and mean, but that’s how they are.’ After her tribunal victory, Ms O’Reilly was given a three- year contract to work across the BBC. But she terminated her deal two years early after receiving very little work. Last night the BBC denied that Ms O’Reilly was blacklisted. A spokesman said: ‘Sunday’s Countryfile was a celebratory edition for long-standing presenter John Craven and included some of his most memorable moments from his 25 years on the show. ‘The programme was not intended as a look back at the entire history of Countryfile but purely to mark John’s anniversary and his contributions.’ Mr Craven was not available for comment.","Presenter was left out of special programme to honour John Craven .

"By . Adam Lee-potter . To a tea: New research claims the optimum length of time to leave tea to stew is just 25 seconds . It's a debate that’s been brewing almost as long as there’s been tea: just how long should you leave the bag to stew? Now at last one expert has what he says is the definitive answer – and it is a result that goes against everything the manufacturers say. The optimum length of time to leave in the bag, according to professional food and drink taster Martin Isark, is exactly 25 seconds. ‘Any less, and there’s not enough flavour, any longer, and there’s too much tannin, giving your tea a horrible stewed taste,’ said Mr Isark, who tested bags from Tetley, Typhoo, PG Tips, Twinings and Yorkshire – which together account for 81 per cent of the British tea market. Running his trial with strict controls, the 59-year-old tested the bags in the same teacup throughout, using freshly boiled bottled water and stirring each cup just once. His findings contradict the advice on the boxes, which ranges from PG Tips’ suggested 40 seconds to four to five minutes for Yorkshire Tea. Mr Isark drank 400 cups in 48 hours to draw his conclusion and believes the demands of impatient consumers are behind the brewing speed. He said: ‘Cheaper, smaller tea leaf particles are used because they release flavour quickly. 'Bags have to be filled with tiny particles of broken leaves that have lost the wonderful flavour nuances associated with full-leaf Assams, Darjeelings and Oolong teas.’ The connoisseur, who prefers first-flush Darjeeling at £700 for 100g, claims Yorkshire Tea offered the best taste. ‘With Yorkshire Tea, you can get away with a 30-second brew time but no more,’ he said. As to why manufacturers recommend lengthy brewing times, Mr Isark, who runs the website CanIEatIt, said: ‘Perhaps they’re trying to suggest that they sell a better product than they really are. Three to five minutes is only appropriate for the very best teas.’ The results have divided industry opinion. Tea master Edward Eisler, of maker Jing Tea, agreed. He said: ‘Teabags with tiny tea particles will deliver a very quick infusion in around 25 seconds, but the downside is that they compromise on clear regional and varietal flavour.’ But Philip Magor, chairman of UK-based tea farm owner Williamson Tea, which supplies the main five brands except Tetley, dismissed the claims. He said: ‘I’m not convinced by the research – 25 seconds is nowhere near enough time to release those important antioxidants.’ Professional taster Martin Isark drank 400 cups of tea in 48 hours to draw his conclusion (file picture) Tea brewing time has long been a hot topic, and in 2011 a team of academics devised a mathematical formula claiming to prove the perfect cuppa is best drunk exactly six minutes after being made. The optimum brew time, they found, was two minutes. And last week, the Advertising Standards Authority backed claims by PG Tips that their pyramid-shaped bags released more flavour than Tetley’s round bags. A Typhoo spokesman said: ‘We would recommend that the tea is brewed for two to three minutes to get the maximum flavour and depth of colour from the tea.’ A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea said: ‘We recommend brewing for four to five minutes in order to get a proper brew with a rich, full flavour.’ Tetley said customers should brew in whichever way gives them their perfect cup. A spokesman added: ‘We say two to three minutes more as a guideline which will let the flavour of the tea infuse.’ A Twinings spokesman said: ‘We generally suggest a brew time of three-and-a-half minutes.’ And a spokesman for PG Tips added: ‘While we recommend an optimum brewing time (40 seconds), it should always come down to personal preference.’","Professional food and drink taster believes 25 seconds is perfect brew time .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . In a vast warehouse on the banks of the River Clyde, the Commonwealth Games hosted its most high profile event yet — the unveiling of Usain Bolt, the superstar billed as the saviour of the Games amid a slew of high profile drop-outs. The fastest man in the world will not compete until Friday evening and even then, only in the heats of the 4x100 metres relay, but his presence alone is a boost for the Games. In the absence of Mo Farah, who withdrew on Thursday — too late for his face to be removed from the promotional material which adorns Glasgow — Bolt is by far the biggest draw, arguably the only athlete here who  transcends the sport. His opening address at the dimly lit Loch Lomond press conference room was as  enthusiastically attended as some of the  sessions of sport here. Bolt said all the right things, starting with confirmation he would run after weeks of doubt that he would be in shape after suffering a foot injury. Relaxed: Jamaica's Usain Bolt jokes with reporters during his press conference at the Commonwealth Games . Happy to please: Bolt poses with Clyde the mascot and children from Giffnock Athletics Club . Incredulous: Bolt did not like it when a reporter questioned whether he would really run in Glasgow . ‘I have done a lot of training over this past month,’ he said, ‘I have been really pushing myself and I am in pretty good shape, but I am not yet in running shape, hence why I am  running the heats, just to get a few runs in.’ The athletics programme, which gets under way On Sunday, needs the star quality he brings. Bolt made his entrance with Clyde, the Games mascot, and high-fived several  local schoolchildren. Someone tried to present him with a kilt — ‘red is not my colour,’ —  then some haggis and there were several requests for ‘selfies’. And that’s just from reporters. The only occasion Bolt looked troubled in this session was when asked his opinion on the Gaza conflict. He hadn’t had a chance to  ‘follow it up,’ he said, slightly flustered. Bolt, who has eight world titles and six Olympic gold medals, has never competed in a Commonwealth Games and will miss the  individual sprints again. But he denied it had lost its lustre as an event with the absence of Farah, suffering from an unspecified illness, and other big stars. ‘I don’t think anybody pulled out on purpose,’ he said. ‘It’s about injuries. It happens in the Olympics and World Championships, things just go wrong at the last moment. It’s just one of those things. There are lot more athletes here and I am sure it’ll be a good Games. I am looking forward to watching to see what the level is.’ World champ: Bolt celebrates winning the 4x100m relay at the World Championships last year . Smiling Bolt: The Jamaican sprinter looked in high spirits at his press conference on Saturday . Bolt and Farah share a major sponsor with the Glasgow 2014 organisers, and there have been suggestions he was under pressure to compete for commercial reasons. ‘I never try to say it’s pressure,’ he said, ‘I told my coach I wanted to come and he said ""right we will make a decision, it depends on how the season is going"", and I got injured and at the end we said we couldn’t make it for the trials but let’s make it for the 4x100m.’ Bolt moved into the athletes’ village yesterday evening and said he would spend most of his time in his room to avoid requests for photographs and autographs from other  competitors. He will hope to have more  luck with his housemates than Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford, who compared his accommodation to a noisy student flat. ‘It’s like a halls of residence,’ said Rutherford. ‘But when you are in professional sport you hope that people respect the fact that you are not about to go out on the lash all day. ‘I was actually awake when the noisy b******s started this morning but I have heard it is a couple of coaches, my investigations haven’t quite gone as far as getting names but things are going to get sorted out.’ Unhappy: Greg Rutherford is far from happy with his current living conditions at the Commonwealth Games . The first track and field medals will be won on Sunday evening in the men’s and women’s marathon and the men’s 5,000m. England’s Adam Gemili will run in the 100m heats and has set his sights both on winning a medal and posting his first sub-10sec time. ‘I feel I have been fit enough to do it for a while, weather-permitting, and it would be awesome to do it in front of a British crowd,’ said Gemili. ‘That would be unbelievable.’ He wished Bolt and his compatriot Yohan Blake, the second fastest man in the world, were competing in the 100m, even though it gives him more chance of a podium finish. ‘If you want to challenge yourself, why not challenge yourself against the quickest man in the world,’ added Gemili. ‘It is lucky I got to race him in Moscow (at the World Championships) and it is always  a shame when he is not at his full fitness to race here.’","Sprinter gave his first press conference after landing on Saturday .

"By . Lucy Osborne . The Crufts ‘Good Citizen’ award is reserved for the most obedient and well-trained dog – so you would expect only the best of behaviour from the winner. But last year’s victor Eddie – a brown and snow-white Akita – disgraced the title just hours after claiming it. As the award winner was posing with his proud owner for photographs he suddenly lunged at a nearby woman, sinking his teeth into her knee and hand. Attack dog: Eddie the Akita, left, had just passed an award at a Crufts show in Birmingham when he suddenly lunged at Louise Nelson, right, leaving her needing surgery on her knee and with permanent nerve damage . Former accountant Louise Nelson was left needing surgery on her knee and with permanent nerve damage to her hand. A . district judge at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court found Eddie’s owner . Lorain Ronis, 52, guilty of allowing a dog to be dangerously out of . control in a public place. Mrs . Ronis, a dog trainer  and dog walker, claims witnesses exaggerated the . attack because they were fierce rivals on the  dog circuit and wanted . her out  of the way. The . court heard she was posing with her five-year-old dog for a celebratory . picture after he triumphed in the Good Citizen Dog category. But Eddie . took a dislike to a nearby Akita called Banks and sprang forward. Convicted: Lorain Ronis (above), 52, was found guilty of letting Eddie be dangerously out of control in public . After being pulled away by his owner he lunged a second time, clamping Miss Nelson’s kneecap in his jaws. She . told the court she feared her kneecap would be ripped off during the . six-second attack on March 8 last year during the Crufts show at . Birmingham’s National Exhibition Centre. Miss . Nelson, 33, an experienced dog owner who has been attending shows for . 13 years, said: ‘I tried to get out of the way but it grabbed hold of my . knee and was shaking my kneecap.’ As . she attempted to free herself she also received a bite to the hand. Witness June Watson said she saw Mrs Ronis and Eddie standing ‘too . close’ to the other Akita. Lunge: Eddie took a dislike to a nearby Akita called Banks and sprang forward. Above, an Akita like Eddie . She said: ‘There was a little bit of contact . [between the dogs] and then they were separated. ‘The lady on the bench [Miss Nelson] stood up and it [Eddie] went towards her and grabbed her leg.’ Denying . the offence Mrs Ronis, from Luton, said her dog had never been . aggressive and claimed the other Akita had attacked first. She said: ‘Eddie was never dangerous or out of control. She suffered her injury by getting between two dogs.’ Mrs Ronis claims that Miss Nelson had told her at the time ‘dogs will be dogs, don’t worry about it’. ‘If I had known then how this was going to unravel I would have got more witnesses,’ she said. During . the trial it was revealed Miss Nelson, from County Durham, had been . sacked from her accountant’s job after stealing £10,000 from her . employer and had pleaded guilty to 11 counts of fraud by abuse of . position. She was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 12 months. Mrs . Ronis claimed Miss Nelson’s need for money to repay her employer was . behind the allegation. She also claimed  that the other witnesses were . fierce rivals on the dog show  circuit. ‘They are my competitors, they . don’t like me,’ she  told the court. Convicting . Mrs Ronis of the offence, district judge Ian Strongman said he found . Eddie had caused the injuries to Miss Nelson, but made no order to have . the dog destroyed. He said: . ‘I’m satisfied when the dog started misbehaving Mrs Ronis tried her . best to pull it back.’ He adjourned the case for sentence until August . 14.","Five-year-old Eddie had just won award with his owner Lorain Ronis, 52 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A baby elephant, who was found guarding the body of her dying mother, has been rescued and is now rebuilding her life in Kenya’s only elephant orphanage. Zongoloni spent her last moments in the wild with her mother, who lay critically injured from wounds inflicted by poachers hoping to steal her tusks. But two months later, the 'strong-willed' one-year-old calf has overcome her trauma and has found new friends in the keepers and other orphaned elephants at Kenya's Nairobi National Park. One-year-old Zongoloni has found new friends (pictured) in other orphaned elephants and keepers at Kenya's only elephant orphanage and is 'strongly willed' and a little greedy, as her rehabilitation begins . Zongoloni was rescued by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) as she cuddled her mother who lay dying from a gunshot wound to her leg. In September a gang of poachers shot at the animal and while a mobile veterinary unit tried to remove shattered bone and treat her wounds, they could not rule out the possibility of a bullet still being embedded within the bone and were worried about her future. Two weeks after the attack the large elephant collapsed and could not stand, leaving milk-dependent Zongoloni to guard her, even though the calf was scared and confused. Zongoloni spent her last moments with her mother who died from wounds inflicted by the poachers hoping to steal her tusks and was found grieving by a wildlife rescue team . Sadly, the Kenya Wildlife Service had to euthanise the mother who was in crippling pain from her wounds and after spending final moments with her mother, the calf was tranquilised and flown to Kenya’s only elephant orphanage, based in Nairobi National Park to recover with other young victims of the ivory trade. At the orphanage, Zongoloni now spends time with calves and keepers 24 hours a day, travelling with them as a group during the day, and sleeping alongside them within a stable at night. Keepers in Kenya told MailOnline that Zongoloni was initially understandingly very untrusting of them, given her experience with humans so far. Zongoloni was rescued by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) as she cuddled her mother who lay dying from a gunshot wound to her leg . On the right Zongoloni stands guard over her mother as she lies dying from a gunshot wound inflicted by ivory poachers and left, chases away any threats, even though she is only small and just one year old. Sadly her mother had to be euthanised to save her from any further suffering . Experts from the DWST tranquilised Zongoloni so they could fly her to the orphanage in Nairobi . However, she is slowly building bonds with the people who care for her that will last a lifetime. ‘In Zongoloni’s case, since her rescue she has been grieving for her lost family and during the day, chooses to spend some time alone,’ they said. ‘Like humans, elephants grieve for their loved ones just as acutely and so this is completely natural and a process that the orphanage has seen many times over. The daily routine of the orphanage and constant contact with the other orphans, including her friends Oltaiyoni and Lima Lima who she enjoys to walk with, provides respite from the grieving process and keepers hope that in the next few months it will gradually subside. Zongoloni’s keepers said she is a ‘very independent and strong willed little elephant’ Zongoloni's personality is emerging at the orphanage. Her keepers said: 'At the moment, she is very greedy for her milk feeds and dairy cubes from the Keepers and loves her hand-picked greens!' ‘For many orphans, losing their mother can prove too much to bear and many lack the will to survive through this loss, but Zongoloni’s strong spirit shows she has chosen the choice of “life” and she is a survivor - something that will aid her in years to come during the reintegration process,’ they said. ‘At the moment, she is very greedy for her milk feeds and dairy cubes from the Keepers and loves her hand-picked greens.’ While Zongoloni is still grieving her mother, her unique personality is emerging and the keepers said some of the orphans, like Kithaka are incredibly mischievous and ‘enjoy teasing visitors and engaging in lots of pushing bouts’. Zongoloni is one of the quieter elephants in the herd but she still plays in the mud bath and socialises with the other orphans. ‘Each orphan that reintegrates into the wild has their own traumatic story that they have overcome,’ the charity said. At the orphanage, Zongoloni is now spending time with calves and keepers 24 hours a day, travelling with them as a group during the day, and sleeping alongside them within their stable at night . ‘The young calves are hugely vulnerable and because of this it is vital the interaction between elephant and keeper is sustained.’ However, because elephants are so emotionally intelligent, keepers are alternated regularly to avoid an extra level of distress for an orphan if their chosen keeper is away. ‘In the past, we have sadly experienced the death of an orphan due to this separation, as young elephants are known to pass away due to a broken herd,’ the charity said. ‘The care and love provided from each Keeper is paramount to the survival of the orphans and we ensure our locally employed Keepers are with us for around 10 years to avoid added emotional distress for the orphans,’ it added. Bottle feeding is a relaxing time for the orphans and the keepers regularly hang large blankets when the elephants are feeding because it gives them an extra level of comfort as calves rest their trunk on the blanket as they would their wild mothers. Zongoloni is one of the quieter elephants in the herd but she still plays in the mud bath (pictured) and socialises with the other orphans . ‘It is our duty to protect these . vulnerable elephants, I will never stop being a Keeper’ said Goya . Golicha, a keeper at the orphanage. Zongoloni will be released into Tsavo Natural Park when she is ready, which might be when she is between eight and 10 years old. The . charity said it is difficult to predict the future of the orphans due . to the current poaching situation in Africa, but many of the elephants . revist the orphanage with their wild born calves to welcome new arrivals . and often when they have been injured by poachers or hidden illegal . snares. In a few years Zongoloni will join the older orphans at either Voi or Ithumba Reintegration Units to slowly become accustomed to a wild life among Tsavo’s famous herds to start her own family. She is one of 49 infant elephants rescued by the DSWT this year and her story shows the real cost of an ivory poaching crisis that kills a staggering 36,000 elephants across Africa every year. Elephants with calves and entire herds are slaughtered for their ivory, prized in the Far East in countries including China, for ornaments and figurines. Dame Daphne Sheldrick, founder of the DSWT said: ‘Individual personalities and family histories are lost each time an elephant is slaughtered for its ivory, with innocent milk-dependent calves like Zongoloni paying the price for man’s greed for ivory. ‘In these terrible times for Africa’s elephants, our anti-poaching teams and mobile vet units are on the front line against poaching everyday providing immediate aid and protection to wild elephants and rescuing those that are found orphaned.’ The DSWT charity is currently looking for people to 'foster' elephants for £30 a year.","Zongoloni spent her last moments with her mother who died from wounds inflicted by the poachers hoping to steal her tusks .

Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new . book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old . Trafford. He is ‘The Special One’. Jose Mourinho. Winner of seven league titles in four countries. The man who went from being Bobby Robson’s  interpreter at Porto to one of football’s great coaches. But without Louis van Gaal, who knows if an incredible managerial career that contains two Champions League triumphs would have happened. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he is very happy for Louis Van Gaal . Special: Louis van Gaal gave Jose Mourinho his first chance to work on the training pitch at Barcelona . It was the Dutchman whose faith in Mourinho gave him his first chance to work with star players on the training pitch. When Van Gaal arrived at Barcelona in 1997 to take over from Robson, Mourinho expected to lose his role as assistant manager. Van Gaal took all the staff out to introduce himself and during dinner somebody criticised aspects of Robson’s regime. Mourinho, believing he was on his way out anyway, spoke up in passionate defence of his former boss. It proved fateful, as the Dutchman revealed: ‘I liked this man who had the confidence and the loyalty to support the last coach, even if he thought it might cost him his job. ‘I thought that if he could be so loyal to Mr Robson, he would be loyal to me, too, and that we would work well together.’ It was Van Gaal and not Robson who allowed the young coach to take charge of training sessions and at times speak to the media in his place. Together in three years they won two La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey. ‘We lived very close - my home was 15 metres from his - and we worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week,’ said Mourinho. Close: Van Gaal shares a joke with Mourinho during Bayern's Champions League clash with Madrid in 2010 . ‘I used to work like a beast, but I was happy to do so. I learned a lot from him. One of the main things was that if you want to get  anywhere, you have to work very hard. ‘He gave me the confidence to coach the team on the pitch. He was very important in my  development.’ Van Gaal, typically, is fully aware of his own  contribution to Mourinho’s career. ‘I sometimes think I was the only guy at the club who believed in Jose,’ he said. More than 10 years later their paths were to cross again in a Champions League final. Mourinho, as manager of Inter Milan, robbed Bayern Munich boss Van Gaal of another trophy.

"By . Maarten Meijer . Manchester United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits. Here, Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old Trafford. Louis van Gaal's march to the World Cup semi-finals began two years ago in a cosy hotel room with a blazing log fire. That’s where the new Holland manager held a secret meeting with a key group of players and coaching staff to write the blueprint for their World Cup success. VIDEO Scroll down for Playoff for third place: Brazil 0-3 Netherlands . High five! Holland reach the semi-finals of the World Cup under the stewardship of Louis van Gaal . It was a perfect match. The Dutch had . limped away from Euro 2012 after a disastrous campaign in which they had . hopelessly under-achieved. Van Gaal still had the stain on his CV of being in charge of the side that failed even to qualify for the World Cup in 2002. He had been out of work, had five operations to fix a hip but at the age of 61 was determined to make a success of his second chance. Van Gaal had to set the record straight after his ill-fated first tenure as national manager; the team had a score to settle after Euro 2012. He wanted to hear the views of the players and, after his first  training session with the national team, he set up a meeting at the Huis ter Duin hotel in Noordwijk, a regular haunt of Dutch teams, past and present. ‘It was a beautiful room with a wood fire,’ explained Van Gaal. Disappointing: Robin van Persie (left) and Rafael van der Vaart (right) played during Holland's poor Euro 2012 . ‘I had asked that they adjust the . lighting. The chairs of the players were placed in a semi-circle, so . that everybody could face each other.’ There were 13 in the room including Van . Gaal. Trusted assistant Patrick Kluivert was definitely there and key . players such as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben almost certainly were, . too. Van Gaal showed them some video clips, finishing with an interview . with Wesley Sneijder just before Euro 2012. Van Gaal revealed: ‘He said that a Dutch national team with so much quality couldn’t settle for anything less than the championship. On target: Van Persie scores as Holland beat Brazil to claim third place at this summer's tournament . VIDEO Playoff for third place: Brazil 0-3 Netherlands . ‘So then I asked: “So how is it possible that things went so differently?"" ‘That turned into a conversation of two hours but I will not say anything more about it.’ Whatever was said, events in Brazil two years later suggest it worked to a tee.

Van Gaal completed the exercise but slipped on the smooth soles of his . shoes, landed awkwardly and suffered a double break. ‘I was crazy enough to think that I was still 18,’ he said. He had surgery the same day at the Alkmaar medical centre and six pins were inserted to support the broken bones. His leg was put in a cast and for the next few weeks he had to use a wheelchair. After a full anaesthesia patients should stay in hospital for three days, but he left the next day to attend a match. ‘Just to make sure, I swallowed a substantial dose of painkillers on the way to the stadium,’ he admitted. ‘I wanted to be there.

There are some things even Louis van Gaal cannot control. A life that has always had hard work, discipline and order as its core values was sent into a whirlwind when his first wife lost her fight with cancer. He had met Fernanda Obbes when he was only 18 and she was two years younger. Friends said it was love at first sight as they locked eyes at the Catholic youth society near his home. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some fascinating footage of 'The Iron Tulip 'Louis van Gaal . Young love: Louis van Gaal pictured with his first wife Fernanda who sadly passed away in 1994 . They were married when Louis was still . only 21 and blissfully happy until, in 1994 at the height of his success . in his first spell as manager of Ajax, she was taken ill. Doctors diagnosed liver and pancreatic cancer. In his position in charge of Holland’s biggest football club he had access to all the best doctors and surgeons, but nothing could be done. Instead, Van Gaal found himself confronted by challenges beyond his control. While he did his best to tend his wife in  private, in public he had to show iron discipline as Dutch fans mocked their ordeal. In Holland, there are two words for woman. ‘Vrouw’ shows respect for a loving partner. ‘Wijf’ is insulting - translated as something like ‘bitch’. At one Ajax game, rival fans held a banner referring to his wife’s cancer. The placard read: ‘Van Gaal, heeft een kankerwijf’, which would roughly translate as ‘Van Gaal has a cancer bitch’. It must have hurt but he refused to let anybody see his anger. It was only 11 years later, in a rare interview about life outside football, he revealed the devastating effect the episode had on him. Asked to name ‘the last time you cried’, he admitted: ‘When my wife died in 1994.’ Tough to take: Van Gaal was mocked by Ajax's rival fans during his wife's illness but refused to show his anger . There is still a picture of Fernanda - with whom Van Gaal had two daughters - in the house he shares now with his second wife, Truus. They met not long after  Fernanda’s death and were  partners for 14 years before Louis proposed in 2007. He couldn’t go down on one knee - he had a broken leg at the time! They married on his birthday - 08-08-08 - as the invitations pointed out. Van Gaal guards his private life closely but while Truus wanted to secretly tie the knot in Las Vegas, he flew 80 friends to Portugal where they have a holiday home near Albufeira, to join the celebrations. Paradise: Van Gaal gestures whilst snapped on holiday with wife Truus in Aruba back in 2003 . Truus . revealed: ‘The wedding was wonderful. It was important to me, not so . important to him. He always regarded me as his wife but the media kept . referring to me as “Louis’ girlfriend”. I didn’t like that. ‘I . wanted to go to Vegas, just the two of us, but Louis wanted a big . celebration. He said: “If you have something to  celebrate, then . celebrate”. He was right. A secret marriage would have been wrong. His . daughters from his first  marriage belonged there as well.’ The home in Portugal remains their . sanctuary. It was there that Manchester United officials  travelled for . talks within a few days of sacking David Moyes.Truus has looked at . houses in Manchester to follow Van Gaal to his new job, even if she . admits she would love to settle for the good life in the sunshine. She said: ‘Louis can’t help himself. He believes in himself and his methods. I’d thank the Lord if he quit.’ Van Gaal is clearly as much the master of all he surveys at home as he is in his professional life.‘At . home he doesn’t do a thing in the house; he doesn’t even know how to . make coffee,’ says Truus. ‘He likes me to spoil him and I like to do . just that.’ But . he does have a sentimental side. Talking about the picture of Fernanda . in their living room, she says: ‘Why not? She is a grandma, too. I . bought the two grandsons a little AZ jersey (while he was head coach at . Alkmaar). You should have seen Louis’ face. Proud and emotional. Louis . is a warm-blooded human being. It’s sad not a lot of people know this.’ New job: Van Gaal shares a smile with Man United striker Wayne Rooney during the club's tour of America .

According to team-mate Leen Goeij: ‘Louis comes across as arrogant and assertive. He had hardly arrived and he proclaimed that other players were inept.’ At one stage Welshman Barry Hughes was in charge. ‘He gave the impression he personally had invented the game of football,’ says Hughes. ‘On the pitch he performed well but as a person he was a hopeless case.

"By . Ben Brockman . Len discovered that his great-grandfather's son was arrested for attacking his own father and he suffered horrific treatment in prison . What was life like for prisoners when hard labour really was tough? When they didn't have televisions or the chance to sue warders who dare abuse their human rights? Celebrities including Len Goodman and Mariella Frostrup find out as a fascinating new documentary series called Secrets From The Clink reveals how their jailbird ancestors were treated in harsh Victorian prisons. The show features five celebrities with porridge in their blood. Their ancestors' stories are dramatic – from tragic tales of people who couldn't return to the straight and narrow to criminals who managed to turn their lives around. Take Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman, who's initially judgmental when he learns his great-great-grandfather's son Henry was sentenced to five years' hard labour for attacking his own father. 'He was obviously a hooligan with a vicious temper,' says Len, who believes he deserved his punishment. But then he discovers that Henry, who was 22 at the time, was given nine months in solitary confinement at Pentonville, where he wasn't allowed to talk to anyone. Even when prisoners had their daily hour of exercise, those in solitary had to wear a special hat that forced them to look straight ahead. The aim was to break a prisoner's will, or 'grind them good' as the Victorians put it, but many ended up going insane and committing suicide. 'It's horrific,' ponders Len. 'I'm not sure I could have coped with that.' Henry was then sent for proper hard labour. This often involved futile exercises with the sole purpose of making the prisoners sweat; the phrase 'money for old rope' refers to the small benefits men could earn for pulling apart tarred-up rope. Another chore was to crank up a gravel-breaking machine with a handle – the prison officers would often tighten the machine to make it harder to crank, which led to their nickname 'screws'. In 1863 Henry was sent to the island of Portland in the Channel to work in the quarries breaking stone for the Chatham naval yard. It was true hard labour, eight hours a day, six days a week. Life in a Victorian Prison in 1907 . The prisoners were given just enough food to enable them to work; oats and water for breakfast, stale bread and potato for dinner. Len is stunned at just how hard life was. 'When I see what he had to go through I'm starting to think the crime doesn't fit the punishment,' he says. 'I feel so sad for him. What he did was terrible but we all have that trait in us; we can all snap. The conditions in those prisons were atrocious. You can see why anyone would want to avoid being sent to one.' TV presenter Mariella Frostrup, 51, is at first contemptuous of her great-great-grandfather William Martin Ekersley, who was convicted for fraud. 'It's a bit of a tacky crime, isn't it?' is her first response. But then she learns he was a salesman who went bust during a recession. In those days you could not be personally bankrupted, so he enlisted a friend to keep some possessions such as his children's clothes out of the hands of his creditors. For that he got six months in prison. But just before his trial the stress resulted in 30-year-old William becoming paralysed. Eventually he was given early release by the prison authorities, who were unable to look after him. Mariella Frostrup stands in front of HM Prison Lancaster Castle . So he was released, still paralysed and still owing money, with a family to feed. 'It was so misguided, there was no safety net for real poverty,' says an astonished Mariella. Another celebrity whose ancestor had money troubles was soap actress Michelle Collins, 52, whose great-great-great-grandfather was locked up in a debtors' prison for six months in 1848 when his Covent Garden umbrella-making business went bust. Depicted poignantly in the works of Charles Dickens, whose own father was in one of them, these jails were draconian places to send people who owed money. Michelle is in tears when she hears about what it was like being in the debtors' prison. But things did not improve much when he came out. All of his assets, including his tools, were taken but he still needed to keep his family above the breadline. 'It must have been horrific,' she says. 'Even after you've done your time you come out and you have no money. I can't even imagine what it must have been like for him. It's about as bad as it can be.' Actor and comedian Johnny Vegas, who has spoken of his own dependency on alcohol, discovers his great-great-great-great-grandmother on his mother's side was sent to prison more than 100 times for being drunk and disorderly. Ann Haines, who came from a Bristol slum, was described in local newspaper reports as 'a notorious drunkard who has been repeatedly before the bench'. Johnny, 43, is visibly moved as the truth of life as a penniless drunk in Victorian times sinks in. 'She was obviously a damaged individual and I feel like I really get her because of my relationship with alcohol,' says Johnny. 'I don't think anybody ever sat her down and asked her what was wrong.' Contemporary reports show that she'd often be rearrested for sleeping rough as soon as she'd been released. 'She had nothing to lose,' he says, fighting back tears as he learns her problems started when her husband died. 'At least in prison she had shelter and got fed. However hard it was, it was better than living rough.' Former ITV political correspondent Daisy McAndrew has perhaps had the most dramatic story of all in her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Reibey. A domestic servant, she was caught stealing a horse in a bid to escape the house and at first faced the gallows, but ended up being transported to Australia. Her relatives had put together a petition to Queen Victoria begging that she should not be 'doomed to a miserable exile', but Australia ended up being the making of her. After serving her sentence she was given some land in Sydney and married a freeman, junior officer Thomas Reibey. The two set up a wealth of successful businesses as well as having seven children. Mary's picture is now on the Australian $20 dollar note thanks to her charity work. Daisy, 42, is astonished. 'To have that as my family legacy and to have some of her DNA is an incredible honour. It shows there are no boundaries in your life; there is nothing you cannot overcome.'

"By . Richard Spillett . Mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore has been remanded in custody after he was re-arrested over his connections to Italian crime gangs. The 65-year-old appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today, where he was described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' by Adam Harbinson, representing the Italian authorities. Wearing a beige sweater, blue shirt and black trousers, Rancadore was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court for a bail hearing next week. Scroll down for video . Italian mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore, pictured with his wife, Anne, is wanted in Italy over his connections to Sicilian criminal gangs . Domenico Rancadore, pictured (left) outside court and (right) in an archive police photo, avoided extradition after mounting a human rights claim . The court appearance came after the Metropolitan . Police's extradition unit arrested Rancadore at his home in Uxbridge, west . London, yesterday, following a new European Arrest Warrant . request from Italy. Mr Harbinson told the court that the latest arrest warrant is identical to the previous one, save for assurances about the prison conditions he faced with in Italy. It . alleges that Rancadore has an 'outstanding sentence of seven years . imprisonment to serve for participation in Mafia association' between . 1987 and 1995 in Palermo. Rancadore, known as The Professor, was first arrested in August last year under a European Arrest Warrant for the same allegations, police said. He had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years, who accused him of fleeing Italy, where he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections. However, he won a battle against extradition back to his native Italy last month after Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that prison conditions in Rancadore’s home country would breach his human rights. He was later told at another hearing that he would not face an appeal against the judge's ruling. Rancadore and his wife leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court after the extradition hearing last month . The court heard prosecutors had lodged an . appeal against the decision to refuse Rancadore’s extradition, but it . was not served to his lawyers within the seven-day time limit. Granting Rancadore unconditional bail, District Judge Quentin Purdy said: 'You’re free to go as far as this court is concerned.' Mr Purdy said unconditional bail had been granted 'as a matter of caution' until the High Court sanctions the dismissal of the appeal. Mr Riddle reversed his original decision to extradite Rancadore, who has a serious heart condition, following concerns prison conditions would breach his human rights. Rancadore's home in the west London suburb of Uxbridge, where he lived under the name of 'Marc Skinner' Rancadore and his wife moved with their two children to Uxbridge in 1994 and lived under the name of Skinner, the maiden name of Mrs Rancadore’s British mother. Police arrested 'Marc Skinner' under a European arrest warrant on August 7 at the upmarket semi-detached home. At a previous hearing, Mr Rancadore said he came to the UK to give his children 'a good life', and to bring his time in Italy to an end. He said the trial in which he was a defendant in the mid-1980s - involving 460 defendants, one of whom was his father - was a 'terrible experience'. Asked about changing his name to Marc Skinner, he said it was to end ties with Italy, adding: 'This was the only way.' Rancadore said he did not even contact his mother or father back home, saying: 'I wanted to end everything with Sicily.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A father today told how he has travelled 40,000 miles just to hug his severely autistic son, who is cared for at a specialist centre 250 miles from home. When Josh Wills was diagnosed with severe autism, his parent's lives changed forever. Born in October 2000, the now 13-year-old was healthy and appeared to walk, talk and develop as any other toddler. But when he reached two-and-a-half, his parents Sarah Medley and Phill Wills started to notice something wasn't quite right. Josh stopped speaking, he started to show signs of repetitive behaviour, began to bang his head against walls and started screaming. Josh Wills, 13, was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two-and-a-half. For years his parents cared for him at their homes, but when his self-harming became more extreme he was referred to a specialist treatment centre in Birmingham, 250 miles from his Cornwall home . Sarah Medley and Phill Wills have travelled the 500-mile round trip to see their son for the last 20 months, but are now desperate to bring him home . Today the teenager is receiving the specialist care he needs. But it means he is separated from his parents by 250 miles, living at a treatment centre in Birmingham while his family live in Cornwall. The couple, who have separated, told This Morning they take it in turns to make the 500-mile round trip to visit Josh as often as they can. On a good day the journey takes between five and six hours. In the last 20 months his father said he has travelled around 40,000 miles just to hug his son. Mr Wills said:'We haven't tucked him in bed for 19 months now, or kissed him goodnight or read him a story. In a heartbreaking post on the family's petition page to bring him home, he wrote: 'Josh has now spent both his 12th and his 13th birthdays in the unit, 260 miles away from me and the rest of his family in Cornwall.  He has never met his little sister. 'This whole experience is heartbreaking for our family.  Josh continually asks for us and when he can’t see us he becomes anxious and more likely to self injure. '[His] self-harming is so severe that it is life threatening. Last year he bit his tongue so badly that a third of it then had to be removed. 'We visit Josh every weekend. This is exhausting but it still never feels enough.  While the staff caring for Josh do a great job, what we can’t understand is why Josh can’t receive that same level of care, closer to home, so we don’t have to travel for over five hours just to give him a hug.' It was when Ms Medley was at an autism awareness day that a light blub went off in her head, her son was autistic. Shortly after that, Josh was formally diagnosed with severe autism. His condition was a regressive form of the disorder, which comes on as a child grows up. Ms Medley said: 'He developed fine, but he started to decline, his autism is regressive. Josh's parents have pleaded with their local NHS authority in Cornwall to bring their son home after travelling backwards and forwards to Birmingham for nearly two years . 'His speech stopped and we started to see lots of repetitive behaviour, lots of head banging. There was screaming. 'I wasn't overly concerned until I went to an autism awareness day and a light bulb went off in my head, he's got autism. 'He was diagnosed quickly because he showed all the typical traits. It was quite obvious. 'The . quick diagnosis did help me accept it quicker, you don't want to label . your child but because the support and research was there I could do . what I could to help him.' But for Josh's father Phill Wills the diagnosis was harder to come to terms with. He said: 'I was a typical man about it, I put my head in the sand,  I thought "" my boy? What?"". 'But I don't think it took me that long to get my head around it.' NHS Kernow told This Morning: 'We understand how upsetting this is for Josh and his family. 'Josh . is the only child with autism or a learning disability that NHS Kernow . has placed out of the county, one of the lowest rates in the country. 'We . will always try to commission bespoke care, but Josh's complex needs . means he does need specialist care that we are currently unable to . provide in Cornwall. 'We . have appointed a learning disabilities nurse to work with the family . and our plan is to bring Josh back to Cornwall as soon as we can to find . a way to provide him the best possible care closer to home.' The pair said they went through a 'grieving process' for the 'boy they lost'. Ms Medley said: 'Everyone who has a child hopes they will become a footballer, or be good at this or that. 'But those hopes and dreams die a little bit. 'You worry about if they will ever be independent, what if something happens to me? Who will care for them? 'I think that is the biggest worry for a parent, who has a child with a disability, what happens if you go?' Ms Medley added: 'It is something you never expect. But we got through the rough times, there were periods of self-harm that were quite extreme. 'We Helped Josh feel secure and safe and the phase would pass until the next time. 'As he got older it became more apparent it was increasing, his self-harm was getting more extreme and it was becoming harder to keep him safe. 'When you have other children to look after as well it only takes turning away for a second and if he was in a bad place his head would be on the wall. 'The hardest thing was knowing that perhaps there was going to come a point where we could not keep him safe anymore and he needed more than we could give him.' Mr Wills said: 'The specific services that Josh needs were not in place in Cornwall. He was in hospital in Truro for three months then he was transferrred to Birmingham. 'Initially we were told for 12 weeks, then it became six months. 'Now here we are 20 months later. We kept asking for help, kept asking them to look into what's missing in Cornwall, what can be put in place that can bring Josh back to us? To both our families.' Ms Medley added: 'We always assumed he would come back, we didn't really agree with him going away in the first place but we sort of had little choice, no one was coping even the staff working with Josh. The pair, who have separated since their son was diagnosed with severe autism, estimated they have travelled 80,000 miles between them. Mr Wills said for the last 19 months they have not been able to kiss Josh goodnight, adding the 12-year-old has not met his younger sister Marnie . The couple have worked alongside the charity Mencap . and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, to lobby the Government to . ensure people with a learning disability can get the support they need . in their local communities. They launched a petition #bringJoshhome which has more than 175,000 signatures. In a joint statement, Jan Tregelles, chief executive of Mencap, and Vivien Cooper, chief executive of the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, said: 'Josh’s story is devastating, but sadly he is not alone. 'We know that 185 children and young people are also in similar situations, stuck in assessment and treatment units hundreds of miles away from their loved ones. 'We urgently need local care services which are fit for purpose. 'The government has said that children and adults with a learning disability should not be living in units and that local areas must develop the right support and services. But this is not happening. 'This awful situation for Josh cannot be allowed to continue. 'The money spent on sending people like Josh to units can be spent developing local services instead. 'We urge everyone to sign Josh’s petition and make this change happen.” 'But I never dreamed he would still be away now. Sarah sometimes reads him a story over the phone but it is things like that.' Ms Medley added: 'I live in fear every time the phone rings, that something has happened and I can't get there. 'I think he is pretty traumatised, I'm worried he will never get over this emotionally. He won't get over it physically, the damage (from self-harm) is to great to his face and mouth. 'I think he needs the security of his family, he is very frightened and confused.' When he was younger Josh suffered separation anxiety. His parents said the now teenager would purposely hurt himself or vomit at school knowing he would be picked up and taken home. She added: 'He is very complex. We are not saying that because he is away that is the sole reason  he is harming. 'We are very, very happy with the care he is getting, they adore him' Josh's father added: 'It is not easy to leave him behind on a Sunday and come back to Cornwall but when he is snuggled into a specific carer, he has chosen to sit with, I take that image with me when I go home. 'He is happy, they are part of his family, they know him.' NHS Kernow said the plan is to bring Josh closer to home for treatment and said they have employed a specialist nurse to liaise with the family. Mr Wills added: 'It does now seem that it is a case of not if, but when Josh will come home.'","Josh Wills was diagnosed with severe autism when he was two years old .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Medical staff who helped stop a gunman from killing more people at a Pennsylvania hospital on Thursday have been been hailed as heroes. Dr Lee Silverman, who police say may have been the intended target, and caseworker John D'Alonzo, were able to quickly stop Richard Plotts after he shot dead their co-worker. The 49-year-old, who has a history of mental illness, was attempting to reload his gun when Silverman fired several shots, and D'Alonzo wrestled him to the ground. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: Bloody hand prints were left by Plotts as he tried to leave the office. The patient was shot three times by Dr Silverman . Attack: Richard Plotts was shot three times by a doctor after he shot dead his caseworker on Thursday . District attorney Jack Whelan gave new details Friday about the terrifying encounter in an office next to Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby. The attorney told ABC News that Silverman began firing at Plotts, who had just killed his case worker Theresa Hunt. Using a chair to shield himself from attack, Silverman fired at least 10 times at Richard Plotts, using a gun he carried with him for protection. He managed to hit Plotts three times - twice in the chest and once in the arm - despite being injured himself. The doctor was shot in the hand and a bullet grazed his head, but Silverman continued to fire at Plotts until his gun was empty. He then managed to escape the office. Shock: Hospital workers comfort each other on Thursday after a shooting killed caseworker Theresa Hunt . Investigation: An officer walks near the scene of the shooting at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby . A second case worker, John D'Alonzo, also heard the shooting and, finding the office door blocked, climbed through a window to try to stop the gunman. Whelan described D'Alonzo's actions as 'nothing short of heroic' and told ABC News: 'If it wasn’t for [their] heroic actions ... we believe [Plotts] was going to reload that . revolver and continue to fire.' Plotts is currently sedated and under guard. When he is no longer sedated, the patient will face an arraignment on charges of murder and attempted murder. On the day of the shooting, the 49-year-old had arrived early for an appointment, with a concealed weapon. Whelan said a motive was not yet clear, but added: 'He intended to kill Dr Silverman and that's why he brought the gun.' Plotts is also facing weapons charges because he did not have a license for the gun. Police said Plotts has a lengthy history of gun arrests, violence and mental health . problems. They say he had 39 bullets on him after the shooting. 'There were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' Whelan said. His victim, 53-year-old . Theresa Hunt of Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to the psychiatric . crisis center at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Darby, just southwest of . the city, authorities said. Police in Upper Darby . were aware of at least three mental health commitments involving Plotts . — once after he cut his wrists and once when he threatened suicide — . but said such stays can last just one to three days. Lock down: Police arrive at the hospital after reports of a shooting . Evidence: Crime scene workers arrive at the hospital on Thursday afternoon . Plotts had also been barred from at least . one residential shelter because of his violent history, Upper Darby . police Superintendent Michael Chitwood said Friday. 'The . case workers and the doctors and the catchment centers - they know who . violent individuals are, because they're frequent fliers. And the system . is not geared toward keeping these people housed somewhere until they . start to be better. So you put whole communities at risk,' Chitwood . said. Plotts may have been . angry with Silverman over his treatment plan, Whelan said. Colleagues . heard arguing during the appointment and saw Plotts aiming a gun at . Silverman when they peaked inside the door. They quietly backed out and . called 911. The shooting soon began, just before 2:30 p.m. Hospital . policy bars anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from . carrying weapons on campus, a Mercy Health System spokeswoman said. She . otherwise declined to discuss the reports that Silverman was armed at . work. Concern: Hospital workers leave the scene of the shooting on Thursday . 'We remain focused on . working with the Delaware County Police Departments to understand fully . the details of the event,' said the spokeswoman, Bernice Ho. Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.' 'Without . that firearm, this guy [the patient] could have went out in the hallway . and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the . chief said. Both guns were . recovered from the scene. The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third . floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community . teaching hospital. There . are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area . outside, and no metal detectors at the entrance, authorities said. Cathy . Nickel, a neighbor at Plotts' last known address, an apartment complex . in Upper Darby, saw a caseworker move him out of the building about a . year ago. As he was taken away in a van, she said, he yelled, 'You . haven't heard the end of me!' A spokesperson for the hospital released a statement, saying: 'We continue to pray for the victims and their families. 'We are thankful for the responders to this incident, the many law enforcement professionals who are a part of the investigation, and the outpouring of support we have received from our community.'","Richard Plotts, 49, is sedated and under guard after killing Theresa Hunt .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Fifty Shades of Grey producers are set to make two versions of the film so they can please both fans of the explicit book and allow the movie to be shown in mainstream cinemas. 'What we’re kind of hearing from the . fans is they want it dirty... they want it as close as possible [to the . book],' said producer Dana Brunetti, who has been listening to the demands of the book's female followers on Twitter. After a fairly restrained take on the bondage bestseller for mainstream cinema audiences, he reveals filmmakers are planning to release a more explicit version soon afterwards. Fifty Shades producer Dana Brunetti (left) and author EL James (right) The sex scenes featuring bondage, . spanking and sadomasochism were a big part of the appeal of the so-called 'mommy porn' books by . EL James. They tell the story of virginal college student Anastasia Steele, who embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery with her S&M-loving boss, billionaire entrepreneur Christian . Grey . But they have created a minefield for filmmakers of the £25m movie who risk either neglecting the racy book's fans by toning it down too much or getting a rating that deems it off limits for mainstream cinemas. If the first version of the film gets an . R or restricted rating in America it could be seen by anyone aged 17 or . over. A more explicit version may get the much rarer NC-17 certificate, . which is reserved for films depicting rape or drug use. 'I always thought it would be really . cool if we released the R version [18 in Britain] and then we had an NC-17 version that . we released a few weeks later. 'Everybody could go and enjoy the R . version, and then if they really wanted to see it again and get a little . bit more gritty with it then have that NC-17 version out there as . well. That is my idea, but the fans and the studio [Universal . Pictures] will benefit from the double dip... Dakota Johnson plays Anastasia Steele (left) and Belfast-born former model Jamie Dornan plays Grey (right) 'We . do not want this film to be seen as mommy porn - we want to keep it . elevated but also give the fans what they want,' Brunetti told review site collider.com. If the clever marketing strategy was followed in Britain the film could seek an 18 certificate for the more vanilla version and an R18 rating for the explicit cut, meaning it could be shown only in cinemas with a special license cinemas, revealed the Sunday Times. But cinemas could legally change themselves into sex-film venues for 'special events' such as midnight screenings, as long as they get local authority approval, said a former adviser to the British Board of Film Classification. The film's scheduled release was delayed after British actor Charlie Hunnam, 33, pulled out of the lead role. He has been replaced by Belfast-born former model Jamie Dornan, 31, who portrayed a serial killer in the BBC series The Fall. Dakota Johnson, 24, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, plays the role of Anastasia Steele. The . highly-anticipated movie, which starts shooting in Vancouver tomorrow, was scheduled to premiere in August next year. However fans will have to wait a little while longer. The first part of the trilogy is now set to hit the big screen until February 13 2015, suggesting Universal hopes it will be a Valentine's date movie.","Producers hope first version gets R rating in USA, seen by anyone 17+ .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . California police are investigating after multiple families reported porcelain dolls that resemble their little girls were left outside their homes. As many as 11 California families from a gated residential community in San Clemente, Orange County, have come forward to report finding the creepy dolls on their doorsteps. The mysterious person behind the creepy gifts has since been found by police, who say she had never intended to scare anyone. Disturbing: This doll was left outside of a home in California where a little girl lives with her family - 10 others have also been found . Mystery: At least 11 porcelain dolls were left outside homes in this gated California community . The dolls began appearing on doorsteps on July 16. All the girls who received one were aged around 10 years old, and some attend the same elementary school. KTLA reports that the initial number of dolls was four, but the figure has been revised to 11. 'Families in each of the homes where porcelain dolls were left voiced concern that the dolls resembled their daughters,' the Sheriff’s Department stated in a news release. Photographs of two of the dolls provided by police show one curly-headed and dressed in a pink nightie with bunny slippers, and the other in a ruffled blue dress. So far, the distribution of the unwanted gifts is not being considered a crime, but the police department was initially concerned by the events. After finding the person responsible, the police said the dolls had been left outside the homes as a 'gesture of goodwill'. Bizarre: Police don't know if the dolls are meant as gifts or indicate something more concerning . The dolls are currently being stored in the police department's evidence room. Families who received one of the dolls helped solve the mystery, after realizing that many of them attended the same church. Police contacted a woman who was part of their church, and who the families said may have been behind the gesture. According to the OC Register, the woman admitted she had left the dolls outside the houses, and told police she had just been trying to get rid of her collection. She also said she had tried to match up dolls with the girls living at the homes, but had not meant to scare anyone. Investigation: Police were called by concerned families after dolls resembling their children were left outside houses . Orange County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Jeff Hallock said the police became involved because the case appeared to involve children. 'Obviously, there’s an indication by some the parents that the dolls resemble their daughters. We’re talking about children here. Anything that has the potential to involve children causes us some concern,' he told KTLA. The dolls were first reported on Tuesday and have been taken as evidence by police.","Police were called in after 11 dolls were left on doorsteps in San Clemente .

"By . Sofia Zagzoule . For celebrities like Cara Delevingne, Simon Cowell and Rihanna a jet-set lifestyle can make it tough to stay fresh-faced. The latest fashionable answer? IV drips. Cara, Rihanna and Lily Allen have all posted photographs of themselves on IV drips when their non-stop schedules have left them rundown. Cara admitted she sought treatment to help with a cold and Lily conceded that her hectic travel schedule was catching up with her. Reviv IV vitamin drips will be available in the UK from September. Hydration treatments will be priced at £199 and Booster Shots £39 . But such quick fixes haven't been available to the rest of us, at least in the UK, until now. From September these boosts will be available up and down the country with Reviv offering IV Hydration treatments at £199 and Booster Shots for £39. The treatments aim to help you look and feel your best. They deliver vitamins and 'wellness' agents quickly and efficiently– claiming to give you 100% of the benefits compared to 55% you get from tablets. CEO Johnny Parvani says the treatments are filling a huge gap in the . market. ‘A lot of people don’t need to see a doctor but they are also . not feeling 100%. They'd normally go to a doctor or to buy painkillers . and medicines at a pharmacy. These treatments help them get back to . feeling their best again and cut out the middle man.’ Celebrity fans: Lily Allen posted this image of her having an IV drip on her Instagram account in May . Kelly Osbourne joined the celebrity trend in June . Rita Ora posted her IV drip picture just before filming her latest video in March (left) and Rhianna is a veteran to the trend posting her pic way back in June 2012 (right) Sarah Lomas Vice President of Operations at Reviv says getting one of . the shots in America changed her life and motivated her to set up the . business. ‘I just kept thinking, when can I get this again and how? I was travelling all the time and exhausted. My life changed that day.' On the menu for UK customers will be a choice of five IV . Hydration Wellness options and three booster shots. The Hydromax, favoured by athletes, delivers 2 to 4 litres of saline to aid peak hydration; Ultraviv, a recovery infusion to ward of pain and nausea – i.e a hangover or jet lag; Vitaglow an anti-ageing infusion and Royal Flush, a deluxe treatment combining Ultraviv and Megaboost. The shots are B-12, Glutathione and Slimboost, which claims to rev up the metabolism and aid weight loss of up to 4lb in a week . alongside healthy eating and exercise. There's a sense of excitement amongst my fellow guinea pigs (including Towie's Amy Childs) as we prepare for our IVs. We've heard whispers of the wondrous benefits – lose weight, boost immunity, cure a hangover, overcome jet lag. Some claim the drips have banished all illness for more than a year – others say friends got pregnant soon after having one. Writer Sophia Zagzoule tries the celebrity the Reviv IV drip for Femail. The drips work by delivering vitamins and 'wellness' agents quickly and efficiently . So I'm excited. Leading up to this I've worked and partied a little too hard. Unrelated, I've also been diagnosed with Costochondritis, a painful chest condition. London's in the grip of a sweltering, sleep-preventing heatwave. I'm probably even feeling a tiny bit like Rihanna, Miley and Lily do. On the table in front of me lie my potential saviours. A selection consisting of five IV Hydration Wellness options and three booster shots.  I'm advised to go for the Megaboost infusion that contains B vitamins, anti-ageing Glutathione and an energy booster. I'm nervous. I've never been on a drip before. Tellingly, I've told my mother nothing about this as it would only have worried her. But I'm reassured by Reviv's medical approach (they have four physicians on the board). These days in Las Vegas, ‘party buses' offer IVs to revellers in need of a quick fix. Reviv is nothing like this. I have a consultation with CEO Johnny Parvani who takes me through a detailed health check.I still feel slightly nauseous as my skin is pricked and then it's in. It's at this point I learn that I have small veins – so rather than taking 30 minutes for the goodness to filter into my blood stream (the average time), it takes an hour, pretty unusual. It feels cool – as in cold, not because I feel like Rihanna although that probably helps - because the fluid is below body temperature. I'd arrived with a headache, which disappears about half way through. When it ends I'm left feeling very clear-headed, the way you feel when you've put in brand new contact lenses with a new, sharper prescription. I feel, in essence, very alert. Fans at the launch talked about the IV drip's benefits lasting for days – weeks – months even. About it helping them stay healthy and ward off colds and flu. I'm hoping it will see me through another tough week of work, and perhaps I'll learn my lesson about partying too hard. Although miracles were never what Reviv promised. - Sofia Zagzoule .","IV treatments cost up to £199 a time and take 30 minutes .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Michael Feldmen, husband of NBC host Savannah Guthrie and a first-time dad-to-be, has undertaken a 'Daddy Boot Camp' segment on his wife's The Today Show, just two months before the birth of the couple's first child. Mr Feldman, 45, a Washington D.C. communications strategist, took a trip to the Northshore University Hospital in New York, along with friend and Today host Willie Geist, to speak with a labor and delivery nurse. 'They say nothing really prepares you for parenthood, I think that's definitely true,' Mr Geist - himself a father-of-two - remarks. 'But I tried at least to give my buddy Mike a little Cliffs Notes version of early fatherhood before that little delivery arrives in a couple of months.' Taking notes: Michael Feldman (right) is taught how to be a supportive husband ahead of his wife Savannah Guthrie's labor in two months - whose position is improvised here by Today host Willie Giest (bottom left) No weight worries: Ms Guthrie, pictured earlier this month, recently revealed that she has so far gained 30lbs during her pregnancy, which her OB/GYN advised her not to 'worry' about . The first and foremost rule in the delivery room? 'Make her happy, make her comfortable — [that’s the] most important thing to do,' Nurse Ellen Benz, advises, as Mr Feldman nods eagerly. 'The biggest mistake is apologizing when mom is yelling,' Ms Benz continues. 'Just agree with her.' Both Mr Feldman and Mr Geist wear expressions of undeniable trepidation as the lesson continues. Next, Mr Geist enthusiastically assumes the position of a woman in labor, lying back on the bed, his legs akimbo, while a visibly nervous but notably focused Mr Feldman appears busy taking mental notes. Just like this: Mr Geist (left), who is himself a father-of-two, enthusiastically passes on his daddy tips to Mr Feldman (right), including the all-important knack of supporting of the baby's neck . Supportive buddy: Mr Geist outright laughs as Mr Feldman struggles to work out the changing of a diaper (pictured) 'When it's time to push, grab a leg - she'll be screaming at you - just ""Yes"" her to death,' instructs Ms Benz, as Mr Feldman repeats 'Yes! Yes!' emphatically, much to the amusement of Mr Geist, who seems to be rather enjoying his role-play scenario. Once the fictional baby is 'born', it's onto the next set of lessons. Mr Feldman is handed a doll, repeatedly forgetting to 'support its neck', despite several reminders, and struggles comically with attaching a diaper. 'At this point,' says Ms Benz as Mr Feldman scrabbles to 'change' the doll, 'the baby will be peeing on you.' Having a ball: The pair dutifully immerse themselves in the 'Daddy Boot Camp' role play . United: Savannah looked radiant sporting a snug green dress as she clutched the hand of her husband . Presumably much to his relief, the final part of the segment see's Mr Feldman reunited with his wife Savannah, who is positively glowing, dressed in a stretchy lime green dress. The happy couple clutch hands for a quick chat with Terry Crews, an actor and author of Manhood, and Amar'e Stoudemire, a basketball player for the New York Knicks, both of them fathers. Mr Feldman is advised to 'make time' for his child, 'read to him or her before bedtime' and 'Skype with his family' when he's away from home. 'What about back massages for the wife?' Savannah gamely interjects, closing the segment. 'I'm so happy to be able to call him my husband, it's still strange saying ""my husband"", but great' The couple first met in 2008 when Savannah attended Mr Feldman's 40th birthday party with a mutual friend and they began dating a few months later. They got engaged last May during a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and tied the knot in March outside Ms Guthrie's home town of Tucson, Arizona, without publicizing the event to media. During the course of the evening the newlyweds privately announced to family and friends that they were expecting a child. Wedded bliss: Ms Guthrie married her husband Michael Feldman at their 'surprise' wedding in March (pictured) and publicly announced her pregnancy a few days later . Savannah later went public with her 'surprise' wedding and pregnancy news on the Today show. After marrying her husband, Savannah said: 'I'm so happy to be able to call him my husband, it's still strange saying ""my husband"", but great.' The couple have chosen not find out the sex of their baby until it is born in August, and it has not yet been revealed who will fill in for Savannah on the Today show during her maternity leave.","Savannah, 42, will give birth to the couple's first child in August ."

Days . later, the woman's arms were found in separate yards in Hempstead, . about 25 miles west of Bay Shore, and her severed head was discovered at . another home in the village on July 17, the prosecutor said. Prosecutors believe Cuevas had pretended to be the landlord' following the death of the building’s owner last year. She is said to have collected rent from tenants despite the fact the building’s lacked hot water and electricity was scarce. It is believed Browne had become fed up with the and refused to continue paying. Mother: Chinelle LaToya Thompson Browne with her four children and a friend . Cuevas, 42, has not been charged with defrauding tenants. She was held without bail in Suffolk County District Court on Long . Island after pleading not guilty to second-degree murder. A . statement a neighbor in the building gave to police said the two women . had argued loudly the day before over complaints about no electricity, . hot water and unpaid rent. That neighbor said Browne was renting a room . from Cuevas. Mary . Beth Abbate, a court-appointed defense attorney, argued during the . arraignment that Suffolk County was not the proper venue because the . killing allegedly took place in New York City. Assistant District . Attorney Robert Biancavilla said that because the victim's torso was the . first evidence recovered — and that happened in Suffolk County — the . local court was the proper venue. District Court Judge G. Ann Spelman agreed and allowed the arraignment to proceed. An . autopsy determined that Browne died of 'homicidal violence,' including . multiple stabbing and incise wounds, Biancavilla said. He added Browne's . blood was found in Cuevas's apartment and in a hallway. Scene: The Hempstead police said the head was found around 5 pm Thursday on Boylston Street, close to where the two arms were found dumped earlier this month . He . did not say whether a murder weapon was recovered, but police noted in a . press release announcing the arrest that the investigation remained 'active'. Dale . Browne, the victim's husband, said his wife had moved to New York about . a year ago and worked in a Manhattan department store. He planned to . move to New York with their four children after he got his paperwork . completed. He read from a Bible verse outside the courtroom following the arraignment before speaking with reporters. 'I trust God,' he said. 'My wife was a human being, a mother of four, a wife and all . that goes with that connotation. She loved her family; she made a . sacrifice to leave Guyana to come here.' He . added: 'What hurt the most is when the prosecutor described the words . that she screamed out. I can hear those words, you know? Pretty . animalistic. Just a beast that did this.' He declined to comment on whether Browne had spoken of prior disputes with Cuevas. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Leah .

"Arizona Senator John McCain, himself tortured for years while held captive in a Vietnamese prison, says that an execution that took nearly two hours at an Arizona prison was a form of 'torture.' On Wednesday, convicted murderer Joseph Wood - who gunned down his former girlfriend and her father in 1989 - was put to death at the state prison in Florence after losing a last-minute appeal. Witnesses described seeing Wood struggling to breathe and gasping for air almost the entire time. Torture: Senator John McCain says the nearly two hours it took to execute Joseph Wood amounts to 'torture' POW: McCain was held for five years at the 'Hanoi Hilton' prison camp in Vietnam, where he often was tortured . 'I believe in the death penalty for certain crimes. But that is not an acceptable way of carrying it out. And people who were responsible should be held responsible,' McCain told Politico. 'The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That’s torture.' McCain spent five years in the 'Hanoi Hilton' - a nickname for the Vietnamese prison camp where he was held captive - after his plane was shot down. He eventually was released, but was tortured repeatedly while a prison. As Wood gasped for air, his lawyers filed an emergency appeal in federal court demanding that it be stopped. The appeal said Wood was 'gasping and snorting for more than an hour' Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's office says . Wood was pronounced dead at 3.49pm - an hour and 57 minutes after the . execution started. Wood was sentenced to death for . killing Debra Dietz and her father, Eugene Dietz, in 1989 at the . family's automotive shop in Tucson. A relative of Wood's victims said she did not believe the killer had suffered - especially compared to the victims. Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for nearly two hours as he was being executed for murdering two people . 'You don't know what excruciating is,' Jeanne Brown told KTLA after the execution. 'What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn’t really call him a man.' Before the murders, Wood . and Debra Dietz, 29, had a tumultuous relationship in which he periodically . assaulted her. Dietz tried to end their relationship and got an order of . protection against Wood. On . the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for . Dietz's father, who disapproved of his daughter's relationship with . Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father, 55, hung up, Wood pulled out a . revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled. Wood . then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to . telephone for help. Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her . chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood . say, 'I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.' He then . called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest. Relief: Jeanne Brown, whose sister and father were killed by Wood in 1989, is pictured at a news conference after the execution as her husband Richard Brown listens. She said that Wood had deserved to die . Inhumane: Arizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer describes how Wood gasped and breathed heavily before he died. Media witnesses agreed they had never seen an execution like it . On Wednesday, Wood looked around the . death chamber and glanced at the doctors as they made preparations for . his execution, locating the proper veins and inserting two lines into . his arms. Wood then uttered his final words, smiled at the victim's family members and made eye contact with a deacon. Just . after declaring that he was at peace with his death, he smiled at the . deacon, but for a second, a subtle look of panic took over his face. Officials administered the lethal drugs at 1:52 p.m. Wood's eyes closed. About 10 minutes later, the gasping began. Wood's . jaw dropped, his chest expanded, and he let out a gasp. The gasps . repeated every five to 12 seconds. They went on and on, hundreds of . times. An administrator checked on him a half-dozen times. Troy Hayden, who witnessed the execution as he covered it for KSAZ , likened Wood’s breathing to a 'fish gulping for air'. 'It was tough for everybody in that room,' he said. Wood could be heard snoring loudly when an administrator turned on a . microphone to inform the gallery that Wood was still sedated, despite . the audible sounds. As the . episode dragged on, Wood's lawyers frantically drew up an emergency . legal appeal, asking federal and state courts to step in and stop the . execution. 'He has been gasping for more than an hour,' the lawyers pleaded in their filings. 'He is still alive.' Praying: Robert Hungerford, of Phoenix, prays as he and a group of about a dozen death penalty opponents protest the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood at the state prison in Florence, Arizona on Wednesday . The . Arizona Supreme Court convened an impromptu telephone hearing with a . defense lawyer and attorney for the state to decide what to do. Wood . took his last breath at 3:37 p.m. Twelve minutes later, Arizona . Department of Corrections Director Charles L. Ryan declared Wood dead. The state court was informed of the death while its hearing was underway. It . took one hour and 57 minutes for Wood's execution to be completed, and . Wood was gasping for more than an hour and a half of that time. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had told . the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she was . concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the injections. Still, she said, there was nothing unlawful about the death. She . said: 'One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful . manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer. 'This . is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he . inflicted on his two victims — and the lifetime of suffering he has . caused their family.' After the death, a federal judge ordered officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution for an investigation. Desperate: Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last-minute appeal. Wood's death was one of a number of botched executions . The lengthy . execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics . denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave . questions about the two-drug combination Arizona uses for lethal . injections. Wood had . waged an intense, last-minute legal battle that challenged the state . over key information about who supplies the drugs and how they are . administered. The execution came after the U.S. Supreme Court denied several appeals seeking details about the state's execution methods. There have been several controversial . executions recently, including that of an Ohio inmate in January who . snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die. Arizona's . highest court temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate . Wednesday morning so it could consider a last-minute appeal before soon . allowing it to proceed. The . appeal focused on arguments that Wood, 55, received inadequate legal . representation at his sentencing, along with a challenge about the . secrecy of the lethal injection drugs. The execution occurred amid new scrutiny nationwide over lethal injections after several controversial executions. The . U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for Arizona to carry out . its third execution in the last year following a closely watched First . Amendment fight over the secrecy issue. Going forward: A fence surrounds the state prison in Florence, Arizona where the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood was scheduled to take place on Wednesday . Wood's lawyers used a new legal tactic . in which defense attorneys claim their clients' First Amendment rights . are being violated by the government's refusal to reveal details about . lethal injection drugs. Wood's . lawyers were seeking information about the two-drug combination that . finally killed him, including the makers of the drugs. A federal appeals court ruled in Wood's favor before the U.S. Supreme Court put the execution back on track. The . 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision marked the first time an . appeals court has acted to delay an execution based on the issue of drug . secrecy, said Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information . Center in Washington, D.C. The . 9th Circuit gave new hope to death penalty opponents. While many death . row inmates have made the same First Amendment argument as Wood, the . Supreme Court has not been receptive to the tactic. The court has ruled . against them each time the transparency issue has come before the . justices. States have . refused to reveal details such as which pharmacies are supplying lethal . injection drugs and who is administering them because of concerns over . harassment. An Ohio inmate in January snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die. In Oklahoma, an inmate died of a heart attack minutes after prison officials halted the process of his execution because the drugs weren't being administered properly. The fight over the Arizona execution has also attracted attention because of a dissenting judge's comments that made a case for a firing squad as a more humane method of execution. 'The guillotine is probably best but seems inconsistent with our national ethos. And the electric chair, hanging and the gas chamber are each subject to occasional mishaps. The firing squad strikes me as the most promising,' wrote Alex Kozinski, the 9th Circuit's chief judge. 'Using drugs meant for individuals with medical needs to carry out executions is a misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful - like something any one of us might experience in our final moment.'","Double murderer Joseph Rudolph Wood was pronounced dead at 3.49pm, an hour and 57 minutes after his execution began on Wednesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man has been sentenced to life in prison for beating his girlfriend's two-year-old son to death. Ronald Dimambro Jr., from Washington Township, Michigan, was convicted in June of first-degree murder and first-degree child abuse for breaking Damian Sutton's skull in August last year. Before the sentencing on Thursday, Damian's distraught mother, Nicole, called her ex-boyfriend a 'demon' and an 'evil monster' for how he had treated her son, who died six days after he was beaten. 'Damian is getting his justice today,' she said as she held on to her son's blue blanket, the Detroit Free-Press reported. Locked up: Ronald Dimambro, pictured on Thursday, has been sentenced to life in prison for beating 2-year-old Damian Sutton, his then-girlfriend's son, to death last August while he was babysitting him . But 27-year-old Dimambro, who admitted in police interviews to shaking the child, insisted that he had never intended to kill the little boy, saying it was 'simply an accident'. 'This was not intentional,' he said before the sentencing. 'I wish he could come back.' Damian was being looked after by Dimambro when he was attacked on August 21. The boy suffered a blunt force trauma to his head and experts said the injuries were not accidental. He underwent brain surgery as doctors tried to reduce the swelling by removing part of his skull. Loss: Damian Sutton, pictured left and with his mother right, suffered blunt force trauma and was put in a medically-induced coma as doctors tried to stop the swelling on his brain. He died six days later . Devastated: Nicole Sutton called her former boyfriend 'an evil monster' for how he treated her toddler son . But his parents eventually decided to switch off his life support after six days. He died on August 27. When Dimambro had called 911, he initially told dispatchers that the two-year-old was suffering an asthma attack, then later said he fell out of his crib. He eventually admitted shaking the child. Judge Jennifer Faunce told Dimambro that the boy had 'died violently at your hands' and that a life sentence did not seem like enough of a punishment. 'You’ve created a pain that will never go away,' she said. Damian's father also told the court how the youngster, who was born when he was just 22, had turned his life around. The responsibility forced him to pull himself together and get a job, he said. Heartbroken: The boy's father, Tim Sutton, also told the court about how having a child had helped him turn his life around - and his heartbreak that he would never be able to thank his son. Dimambro is seen left . He said he was getting his life back on track just as he received the devastating call that his son was in the hospital. 'I like to believe Damian saved my life,' Tim Sutton told the court. 'I will never be able to thank him.'

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Alastair Cook will remain as England captain with Jos Buttler in line for his Test debut after being picked in a 13-man squad for the third match of the Investec series against India in Southampton. England included wicketkeeper Buttler, in place of the injured Matt Prior, when they named their squad on Tuesday afternoon. The announcement also confirmed England's intention to stick with captain Cook, who has been badly out of form and has led his team to seven defeats in their last nine Tests. Still there: Alastair Cook has retained the England captaincy despite a horrible run of form . Grabbing his chance: Jos Buttler has come into the England squad as a replacement for Matt Prior . VIDEO I will not walk away - Cook . It's in his hands: Buttler is in possession of the gloves for England . Cook's role has been called into question by many observers, who cite not just England's miserable sequence of results - extended when they went 1-0 down to India with a 95-run defeat at Lord's on Monday - but also the captain's loss of all form with the bat at the top of the order. Cook, England's most prolific centurion, has not made a Test hundred in 27 innings and has mustered only 129 runs in nine innings this year. Buttler's promotion, after 69 limited-overs caps, was the obvious response to Prior's decision after the second Test to rule himself out of Test cricket for the remainder of the summer - during which he is likely to have surgery on his Achilles. National selector James Whitaker congratulated 23-year-old Buttler on his inclusion, and called for an improvement from England to battle back in the five-match series at the Ageas Bowl on Sunday. ""The result of the second Investec Test at Lord's was very disappointing,"" he said. ""One or two of our players had encouraging performances. ""However, it is vital the squad learns quickly and arrives in Southampton this week refreshed and ready to perform well in what will no doubt be another tough Test match."" Frontline seamers Stuart Broad and James Anderson both came in for criticism after they were unable to bowl India out cheaply in their first innings, after Cook won the toss on a green pitch. Friendly rivalry: Prior (left) and Buttler before the first Test at Trent Bridge . For the third Test against India at the Ageas Bowl starting on Sunday: .

Whitaker added: 'Congratulations to Jos Buttler, who comes into the squad following some very exciting limited-overs performances for England and a good record with Lancashire this season and fully deserves this opportunity. 'Matt Prior has contributed a huge amount to the England side over the years and should be proud of his record throughout his 79 Tests. 'He has decided to take time out of the game to work on his fitness, and we will continue to follow his progress over the coming months.'

"By . Australian Associated Press . An former NSW cop who lied to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) about a drug-fuelled weekend has cried in court as he described how his career has been destroyed. Former detective inspector Shane Diehm, 49, was hauled before the PIC in October 2011 to answer questions about drug use in the force. During that hearing, Diehm was quizzed about a weekend on Queensland's Gold Coast the year before, in which officers were allegedly secretly recorded consuming illicit drugs and hash cookies. Diehm initially lied to the commission about taking drugs but after a two-hour adjournment at the PIC, went back and admitted he had. Diehm has pleaded guilty to two counts of giving false information in relation to this. Disgraced former detective inspector Shane Diehm cried as he told the court how his drug use had impacted his family and career . Diehm was suspended from duty for testing positive for cocaine after a colleague's retirement party in August 2011 . But he denies he lied to the PIC when he said he 'didn't remember' seeing other former and serving cops use drugs that weekend. He has pleaded not guilty to two counts of providing false information to the PIC in relation to this. Diehm told Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday that he had 'no reason' to protect the other cops. 'I'm not naive enough to believe that I was the only one who (took drugs)...

"By . Andrew Levy . Two teenagers’ bodies were recovered yesterday after they drowned in separate incidents while cooling off in dangerous waters during the heatwave. The tragedies followed another death on Tuesday, when a 13-year-old boy went into a fast-flowing section of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to retrieve a football. A high of 28.6C (83.5F) was recorded in the Solent in Hampshire yesterday, with other parts of the country seeing similar temperatures and occasional heavy showers. [caption . The sweltering heat, which is due to continue today, coincided with the start of the school holidays – prompting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to issue a warning to young people. Leisure safety manager Dave Walker said: ‘Even on a hot day, the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting, and there may be underwater debris that you cannot see.’ Rony John, 15, was found dead at 2am yesterday, ten hours after he got into trouble while swimming in the Great Ouse river near Hartford in Cambridgeshire. Search teams then discovered the body of Conor McColl, 16, from Luton, just after 1pm. Conor also disappeared on Thursday, at around 6pm, after swimming in a disused quarry in Clophill, Bedfordshire. Two other teenagers were rescued from the water. Weak swimmer Rony had jumped into the river with fellow pupils from St Peter’s School, Huntingdon. Rony John, 15, went missing in the River Great Ouse near Church Lane in Hartford, Cambridgeshire . One girl at the scene said: ‘Apparently he couldn’t swim and he went in with a group of boys. ‘They all held on to him so that he wouldn’t go under and then he said that he could swim.’ The two tragedies today come just . days after Arran Cooper, ten and Kyrece Francis, 13, died in separate . tragedies earlier this week. Schoolboy . Arran, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died in hospital in the . early hours of Wednesday after he fell into the River Orchy, in the . Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

Arran Cooper (left), tem, from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, died after he fell into the River Orchy, in the Caledonian forest reserve in Argyll and Bute. Kyrece Francis (right) was remembered by friends as a promising footballer and a 'genuine' and 'great' guy . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution also urged the public to take care in the sea, after a 12-year-old girl and her 21-year-old brother had to be rescued on Wednesday. The pair were nearly swept into the path of a shipping lane by currents in Ramsgate, Kent. Thousands are being tempted to the coast as ocean temperatures have hit a seven-year high in some places. The water has reached 20.4C (68.7F) off Start Bay in Devon – a full degree warmer than Santa Monica in Los Angeles. Elsewhere, a mother who abandoned her baby in a boiling car to go shopping was cautioned by police. Passers-by called the emergency services after noticing the child had been left alone in the Surrey supermarket car park on Tuesday, when temperatures hit 20C (68F) in the shade, The Sun reported. Police gave the mother a caution for ‘wilful abandonment’. The baby did not require medical treatment. Forecasters said the high temperatures would continue today – making Britain hotter than Crete – before falling by up to four degrees on Sunday. Sun-worshippers who end up looking more like a lobster than a bronzed beauty can now get relief – using the first burn lotion containing ibuprofen. The cream, called Soleve, delivers the painkiller directly to burnt skin. In trials it was found to remove the stinging sensation for eight out of ten users. The lotion, which costs £9.95 for 100ml, also contains the emollient isopropyl myristate, which soothes and moisturises the skin and traps in water, helping the body’s healing process. Surveys show three out of five Britons have suffered from sunburn in the past five years, and say it has blighted their holidays. Other after-sun lotions currently available are simply forms of moisturisers and can do nothing to relieve the pain of mild to moderate sunburn. Dr Phil Rosher of Diomed Developments, which created Soleve, said trials showed it helped to relieve pain, swelling, inflammation and tenderness.","Body of Rony John, 15, was found in River Great Ouse, Cambridgeshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Suspected illegal migrants have been caught on camera prying open the door of a lorry in Calais before jumping inside in a desperate attempt to make it into Britain. Courier Ben Irwin, 34, shot the video earlier this month while travelling along the access road to the ferry terminal at Calais, France. Dozens of ferries leave the terminal in Calais to head to Dover every day. Mr Irwin, from Derbyshire, said: 'There were around 300 immigrants crowding around the lorries, trying to get in. I couldn't believe it. It's so dangerous.' Scroll down for video . A British lorry driver has told of how he spotted hundreds of desperate migrants trying to get on to the back of vehicles in Calais . Courier Ben Irwin, 34, shot the video earlier this month while travelling along the access road to the ferry terminal at Calais, France . On the approach to the ferry port, queuing means vehicles can only travel at around five miles per hour. It is believed migrants try to take advantage of the slow speed to pry open the lorry doors and jump inside the vehicles. Mr Irwin said: 'It's terrifying. I drove up to the bumper of the lorry in front to try and stop them from getting in. 'When I refused to back up, they became very aggressive and started battering and pushing my vehicle to try and get in. That's what the thumping noise is towards the end of the video. 'Lorry drivers live in fear of this happening. I've heard of drivers being beaten half to death after trying to stop immigrants from entering their vehicles. 'We just wonder which one of us will be next. It won't be long before someone gets killed.' Mr Irwin, from Derbyshire, said: 'There were around 300 immigrants crowding around the lorries, trying to get in. I couldn't believe it. It's so dangerous' It is believed migrants try to take advantage of the slow speed to pry open the lorry doors and jump inside the vehicles . The number of illegal migrants arrested as they try to get to Britain from Calais has doubled to more than 7,000 in six months, figures revealed last week. Despite tougher security measures introduced by the French, there has been a huge increase in those trying to make their way through the Channel Port to the UK. Figures compiled by the local prefecture show 7,414 were arrested between January and June this year. This compares to 3,129 for the same period in 2013. Last week the mayor of Calais passed an official decree banning the setting up of camps in areas, saying they were a danger to public health. A number of camps have been bulldozed, with the authorities doing everything possible to get the migrants to leave the town. Mr Irwin said: 'It's terrifying.

PC Lee Haworth visited Katrina Ianson-Hughes’s house in Oswaldtwistle for sex while on duty on April 5 last year, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Prosecutors . said the pair met during an investigation into an alleged assault on . Miss Ianson-Hughes and had exchanged texts ‘of a sexual . nature’. PC Lee Haworth (pictured right outside Liverpool Crown Court) visited the house of Katrina Ianson-Hughes (left) in Oswaldtwistle for sex while on duty on April 5 last year, the court heard. He was today cleared of misconduct . It was said they were exchanged over Haworth’s police-issued personal digital . assistant (PDA) device. The father - who was already in a . relationship - first received a ‘grade two’ call during a visit to her home, the court heard. Prosecutors . said the 39-year-old said he would attend an incident in . Clayton-le-Moors and told the call handler to mark it on the . computer system that he was attending. But he did not leave Miss Ianson-Hughes’s . kitchen. Moments after receiving the call, another officer said they would also go to the incident. GPS records for Haworth’s police car showed that the car was parked outside her home for about an hour, prosecutors said. Then there was a call to a ‘grade one’ emergency. Haworth . did not volunteer to help and the call handler had to speak . to a sergeant to rearrange patrols because they were ‘struggling for . back up’, a judge was told. Police officer Lee Haworth, (pictured outside Liverpool Crown Court today) who admitted having sex on the job, has been cleared of misconduct - despite failing to respond to three call-outs . Haworth told the court he thought there was no need for him to volunteer. Finally, . prosecutors alleged he did not respond immediately to a call for . concern about an elderly man in Accrington. Haworth told a judge that regardless of the outcome of his four-day trial, his resignation from Lancashire Police was ‘in hand’. The defendant, described by his colleagues as an ‘exemplary’ officer, had earlier admitted two breaches of the data protection act, for which he received a £700 fine. His barrister told Liverpool Crown Court: 'He embarrassed the force, he let himself down and he let his partner down.' But he claimed the rapid response officer was still within the patch, would have been able to respond to any emergencies he was called to and he did not take any other breaks of any sort resulting in spending the same amount of time on visible patrol. The jury heard evidence from call handlers who said that night was a ‘reasonably quiet’ Friday and that all demands were met by other police officers. Haworth also told the judge that while he was having sex with Miss Ianson-Hughes he kept his radio on and had been listening to it in case he might be needed. Nick Clarke, QC, for the defendant, said: 'He was not on visible patrol, it was said, whilst he was at Katrina’s, but he was still there within the patrol area and he would have been able to respond to any emergency that he was in fact called to. 'He was not asked to go. If he had have been, there would have been no problems. She would have understood. Prosecutors at Liverpool Crown Court said the pair met during an investigation into an alleged assault on Miss Ianson-Hughes and had exchanged 'flirtatious' texts 'of a sexual nature' 'The reality is he was on duty for that shift. He did not take a meal break or break of any sort. 'The total time he was out on visible patrol was the same as anybody else.' Haworth had admitted he was ‘in dereliction of his duty’, but denied it crossed the threshold for the jury to find him guilty of misconduct. Mr Clarke said: 'There is no doubt Lee Haworth admits that he was in dereliction of his duty when he was visiting Katrina Ianson-Hughes whilst he was on duty. 'He behaved that night in a way which was an embarrassment to the police force.' Before the jury retired to consider its verdict, Mr Clarke reminded the seven men and five women that the case was a criminal trial and not a ‘court of morals’. Mr Clarke added: 'It is a shameful incident for him, but he is not to be condemned just for that.' The data protection breaches, include accessing logs for information about a personal matter and sending a copy of a log praising his work to his then partner without blanking out the name and address of a suspect. Sentencing Haworth, Mr Justice Holroyde told him: 'The punishment you have brought upon yourself is a heavy one. 'It is serious to misuse the police computer and any police officer who does so should expect to be punished for it. 'There is an obvious need for the confidentiality of the personal data. 'There is a clear obligation on any police officer to use the computer system for legitimate reasons. 'The serious aspect of these two offences is that it shows a rather cavalier attitude to that important obligation.' Haworth, who refused to comment as he left court, was told he must also pay £500 prosecution costs and a £70 victim surcharge. Mr Clarke told the judge his client had been treated for depression and that after his medication was increased to the maximum level available, matters ‘came to a head’ last week. He said: 'Financially, he will lose his income. He will have frozen that part pension to which otherwise he would have been entitled. 'In the short term, his life is uncertain.' Speaking after the hearing, a Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'We acknowledge the guilty pleas which have been entered for the data protection act offences and we thank the jury for giving all of these matters their due consideration. 'A decision will now be made as to whether any further disciplinary proceedings are appropriate given all the circumstances.'","PC Lee Haworth visited Katrina Ianson-Hughes for sex while on duty .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain's relationship with the EU was 'not acceptable' Britain will vote to leave the European Union if Brussels does not hand back powers to Westminster, Philip Hammond said this morning. The new Foreign Secretary said the current relationship with Brussels was 'not acceptable' and needed to be overhauled before giving the public a say in 2017. But he added: 'If the offer by European partners is nothing, no change, no negotiation, I am pretty clear what the answer of the British people in that referendum is going to be.' Mr Hammond has previously said he would vote to leave the EU under the current circumstances. The Foreign Secretary was asked whether he stood by his earlier position that Britain should vote to leave an unreformed EU. He said: 'The status quo is not in Britain’s interest and we have to negotiate - the way we’re doing this, if we have a Conservative government after the next election, there will be a referendum in 2017 so the British people will decide.' The Foreign Secretary added: 'There has to be substantive renegotiation, substantive change in Europe, that addresses the concerns that Britain has, but also addresses the needs of Europe in a modern world and then we’ll put it to the British people and they’ll make the decision. 'My job now is to pursue that renegotiation… when we get to the end of that process and we can see what is on offer, what is on the table, we will then make our recommendation to the British people. 'I haven’t change my mind. If there is no change at all in the way Europe is governed, no change in the balance of competencies between the nation states and the European Union, no resolution of the challenge of how the Eurozone can succeed and co-exist with the non-Eurozone, that is not a Europe that can work for Britain in the future so there must be change, there must be renegotiation.' The Foreign Secretary insisted Britain was not alone in its fight to reform the EU. He said: 'Increasingly, across the European Union people are realising that Europe needs reform' Mr Hammond also insisted that Britain was not alone in wanting reform in Europe. He said: 'We all believe that the status quo is not an acceptable way to run Europe in the future. And we are not isolated as some people wish to paint us, as little Englanders, alone in believing this. 'Increasingly, across the European Union people are realising that Europe needs reform. 'It needs reform to deal with the globalisation, the world economic situation, it needs reform to deal with the challenge of a Eurozone coexisting with the non-Eurozone countries in the world. And it needs reform to deal with Britain’s specific grievances.'","Tory Cabinet minister says there has to be a 'substantive renegotiation'

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . New taxes will be levied on betting and Premier League football clubs to fund more school and community sport if Labour wins power. Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman will today insist there should be a ‘proper levy’ on top clubs’ revenue from the sale of their television rights to help develop grassroots football. A new tax on all sports betting – similar to that already levied on horseracing – would help pay to reintroduce two hours of sport for every primary school child. Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman, pictured, will today insist there should be a 'proper levy' on top clubs' revenue from the sale of their television rights to help develop grassroots football . Critics warned Labour’s move could mean football clubs clawing back the cost through higher ticket prices, and said the last government had done more than any other to encourage gambling by liberalising the law. But Miss Harman will insist today Labour is prepared to ‘get tough’ with wealthy football clubs and betting firms if it wins the general election in nine months’ time. Currently, there is a levy of ten per cent the gross profits made by betting companies from betting on horseracing, raising £82 million this year. This money is ploughed is issued in grants to improve the sport. The Government has already announced a change law to extend the horserace betting levy to overseas bookmakers, who are currently exempt. But Miss Harman, speaking at an event to sports leaders at the London Aquatics Centre in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will suggest the tax should be extended to all sports betting. She will also propose that a five per cent voluntary levy on TV revenues agreed by the Premier League to support grassroots football in 2001 should be toughened. Labour claims the sums actually going to grassroots clubs and teams has fallen short. ‘People across the country are passionate about sport whether it’s them or their children taking part or watching it at events or on television. It’s also important to public policy because of the many physical and mental health benefits that it provides people of all ages,’ Labour’s deputy leader will say. Labour argues that child participation in sport has slipped back since the eyes of the world were on London's Olympic Park, pictured . ‘We were all proud to host the Olympics and Paralympic Games in London two years ago but instead of seeing increased participation, things have got worse especially amongst young people as a result of the government axing school sports partnerships. ‘Labour wants to help everybody to do more sport and physical activity – from children to the elderly, girls and well as boys and people from all backgrounds and regions. ‘Our consultation looks at a number of ideas which aim to boost investment in community and grassroots sports by getting tough with the Premier League and betting companies, bringing back two hours of sport at schools a week and encouraging more people to take part – girls as well as boys.’ Clive Efford, shadow minister for sport, said: ‘If we are going to get more people active then we have to empower the people who do most of the work in our communities to have more influence over how we plan, organise and deliver sport and physical education at local level.’ Sallie Barker, head of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ‘We would welcome a strong focus on ensuring a quality experience for every child in every school, rather than purely focusing on structural change. Revenue raised from the taxes would be used to help develop grassroots football (file picture) ‘The flexibility of the school sport premium allows schools to pool their money and, where it suits them, to replicate school sport partnerships. 'But in other places, where other arrangements suit pupils better, those too can be funded. The strength of this is that it allows teachers to choose what is best in their area, for their children, rather than superimposing a one-size-fits-all approach.’ A Conservative spokesman said: ‘This is yet another short-term gimmick from Labour. It is a tax on football fans which will mean higher ticket prices for ordinary people wanting to watch our national sport. ‘The evidence is clearer than ever that Ed Miliband is out of touch with hardworking taxpayers and doesn’t have a long-term plan for Britain.’","Plan for taxes on betting and Premier League clubs if Labour wins power .

"By . Harcharan Chandhoke . The relationship between Ishant Sharma and Indian cricket fans has often resembled that of a rather tempestuous couple. It began, as these things usually do, with a teenage infatuation. When the 18-year-old from Delhi burst on the scene with pace, accuracy and menace – and immediately tied even the great Ricky Ponting in all manner of knots - we dared to ask whether India had found its first quick bowler since Kapil Dev to match the country’s long line of spinning greats? VIDEO Scroll down for Dhoni salutes 'memorable' Lord's win . Pumped up: Ishant Sharma (right) celebrates bowling Ian Bell on the fourth evening at Lord's . And that’s not to mention the attraction of the wild hair, jangling necklaces and extreme height (us Indians are quite a short bunch). The only Indian object visible from space: Sharma's hair has been mocked on websites . But in subsequent years he proved to be a huge disappointment. He developed no consistent away swinger to complement his natural inswing towards right-handers, and picked up a serious problem bowling no balls. There was no increase in pace - if anything, he got slower. The relationship soured and even turned abusive, as Ishant became the biggest butt of jokes in India after the nation’s corrupt politicians. Whole websites sprung up devoted to ridiculing everything from his massive mane - ‘the only Indian object visible from space’ - to the awards he should have won for services to Australian sport when his team were whitewashed Down Under. By the time he was selected for this English tour the old love had crossed that fine line into hate, with several observers incredulously questioning how someone with a bowling average over 37 could have somehow won 55 Test caps and still be in line for more. Now, however, the pendulum may be swinging back. There appears to be a reconciliation on the cards. With speed, aggression and a huge amount of heart, Ishant not only blew away the England batting line-up with seven for 74 in the second innings at Lord’s but also won back his place in the affection of Indian folk. Some have even removed the old barbs from their Facebook pages, and quite rightly too. Ishant, who is still only 25, probably played the biggest role of all in what could rank as India’s greatest ever victory away from home soil. Carrying the fight to England: Sharma (left) bowled a sustained spell of short stuff and blew the hosts away . Cheers: Sharma seems to have won over the India public again following his display at Lord's . VIDEO Dhoni salutes 'memorable' Lord's win . They had no right to win the second Test, and take a one-nil lead in the series, after being put in to bat first on a pitch that was as green as the outfield. They won because their bowlers understood better than England how to bowl in these most English of conditions. They bowled full and straight with an upright seam and let the pitch and humidity do the rest. Ishant was at the forefront of implementing this simple discipline – seemingly forgotten by James Anderson, Stuart Broad et al – which helped push India into a winning position on the final day. And then, with England’s last recognised batsmen threatening to tilt the game back in their team’s favour, came the most remarkable act of all in this fascinating Test match. Having been told by his captain to abandon his traditional line and length, Ishant bowled bouncer after bouncer. England accepted the bait and - one after another - hooked and pulled the ball to the hands of gleeful fielders standing in the deep. Steaming in: Ishant ran in hard on the final afternoon and gave England some chin music . Tests: 57 Debut: vs Bangladesh, 2007 . Runs: 515 Highest score: 31* Average: 9.36 Catches: 12 . Wickets: 174 Best bowling (inns): 7/74 Best bowling (match): 10/108 5wkt innings: 6 10wkt match: 1 . It may have been a lemming-like act of collective suicide on England’s part, but huge credit is also due to Ishant. In baking heat on a fifth day pitch and with an 80-over old ball, he banged the ball in short with relentless energy and passion. In his last seven overs he took five wickets for 27 runs and won the match, using tactics very rarely associated with an Indian bowler. He outdid the English at their own game. It turned out that the final match-winning strategy was actually down to the skipper MS Dhoni, who admitted he coaxed a reluctant Ishant into following his wishes by setting a field that gave him no option but to bowl short. Indeed, Dhoni’s innovative thinking throughout the match – can anyone ever remember a wicketkeeper standing several yards back to a spinner? - provided a sharp contrast to the ponderous captaincy of his beleaguered opposite number, Alastair Cook. Given short shrift: Moeen Ali was bounced out just before lunch and England subsequently collapsed . Dhoni and Ishant are the only members of this team who have played Test matches in England, and they are doing an excellent job of guiding their inexperienced team-mates. The innocuous-looking seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, in particular, is the emerging star of this tour. While he may be a humble and unassuming character who will never quite live up to his first name – it literally translates as ‘Lord of the Earth’ – he is certainly exercising a degree of dominion over this series with not only the ball but also the bat. At the top of the batting order the opener Murali Vijay is proving a rock-like presence, and it is encouraging that Ajinkya Rahane is standing out above his more illustrious colleagues in the middle order. Tormentor and tormented: Ishant (centre) and MS Dhoni (left) speak to England captain Alastair Cook . Even Ravindra Jadeja managed to win over a hostile home crowd, who initially booed him at every opportunity over his spat with Jimmy Anderson, with his swashbuckling 68 runs in the second innings that swung a hitherto even game in India’s favour on the fourth day. His exuberant sword-swishing celebration on reaching his half century – a tribute to the traditions of his warrior Rajput caste – showed that, like Ishant, he has plenty of personality. The whole team, in fact, is proving that it has to be taken seriously after a long run of crushing and sometimes embarrassing results away from home. As England are quickly realising, this India side is no joke.

A ban had been imposed Tuesday after a rocket strike landed about a mile from the international airport, prompting fears that passengers' lives could be put in danger. The directive applied only to U.S. operators such as Delta Airlines, US Airways and American Airlines, and had . no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport. Even before the ban, Delta Air Lines turned around one of . its jets mid flight and indefinitely canceled all future flights between the . U.S. and Israel after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the airport . Other U.S. airlines quickly took similar action, and . counterparts in Europe and Canada followed within hours, despite protests from . the Israeli government.

Support: Bloomberg called Israel's main airport the 'best protected airport in the world' Welcome: Billionaire Bloomberg has held meetings with Israeli President Shimon Peres during his visit . After assessing the situation with its U.S. government counterparts, the FAA announced late on Wednesday that flights could resume. The relevant agencies have reviewed new information about rocket strikes and taken into account measures the Israeli government has taken to limit risks to passenger jets. After hearing about the ban Bloomberg had strongly urged the FAA to ‘reverse course’ and permit U.S. airlines to fly to Israel. The billionaire released a statement stating his plans to fly on El Al to Tel Aviv Tuesday night to ‘show solidarity with the Israeli people and to . demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.’ ‘The . U.S. flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved . victory and should be lifted immediately,’ Bloomberg said. Secretary of State John Kerry was also able to work around the FAA . restriction Wednesday when he arrived on an Air Force jet to try to broker a . cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, CBS News reported. Arrivals: Secretary of State John Kerry used an Air Force jet to travel to Israel . Family in mourning: Bloomberg was taken to Jerusalem to visit the family of 24-year-old Sergeant Max Steinberg, a volunteer soldier from Southern California who was killed in the Gaza Strip . Although not covered by the FAA restrictions, other countries have been cautious about flights to Israel. Germany's Lufthansa, Italian airline Alitalia and Air . France all acted before the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory. Scandinavian Airlines canceled two flights from Copenhagen . to Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, and said it will rethink . the situation for two more flights this week. Budget airline Norwegian said it had scrapped a flight from . Stockholm to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and was monitoring the events closely, the . airline's spokeswoman Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson said. Also Wednesday, Royal Jordanian suspended its flights to . Ben Gurion until further notice, according to the airline's spokesman, Basil . al-Kilani. Korean Air Lines Co. said on Friday that it was suspending . its flights between Incheon International Airport near Seoul and Tel Aviv until . at least Thursday, citing tensions between Israel and Palestine. Lufthansa and Air Berlin later extended their cancellations . through Thursday and Air France said it was suspending its flights 'until . further notice.' The European Aviation Safety Agency said it 'strongly . recommends' that airlines refrain from operating flights to and from Tel Aviv. It said it would 'monitor the situation and advise on any . update as the situation develops.' At least 160 flights at Ben Gurion had been canceled before the ban was lifted Wednesday, 80 incoming and 80 departing, Transportation Ministry director-general . Uzi Yitzhaki said. Last year, an average of 1,044 passengers flew each way on . the four daily flights between the U.S. and Israel on American carriers, . according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Change of plans: Delta Flight 468 from New York to Tel Aviv carrying 290 passengers was rerouted to Paris Tuesday . Jack Ram, 50, of Tel Aviv, who was in New York visiting . friends, said threats of violence and disruptions while traveling were nothing . new for Israelis. He prayed Tuesday before entering the departure area at . Newark, New Jersey, for his El Al flight to Israel. ‘We're used to it. That's how we live for the last 3,000 years . actually,’ Ram said.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . and Tamara Cohen . Nicky Morgan, the new Education Secretary, said she would be 'nice' to teachers . The new education secretary Nicky Morgan has vowed to keep the controversial rules which punish parents who take their children out of school during term time. In her first interview since she was asked to replace Michael Gove last week, Mrs Morgan said the zero-tolerance policy on holidays during class time sends ‘a firm signal’. ‘For every day or half-day that a child misses. It does affect their education’, she said. ‘From the prime minister downwards, we have made it clear that being in school during term time is that best place for children to be. I'm really clear that will continue.’ Mrs Morgan has called for an end to the Government war on teachers, just days after taking over from Michael Gove. Nicky Morgan said she wanted to be 'nice' to teachers to get the best out of them. Her remarks are in stark contrast to her predecessor Mr Gove who infuriated teachers and unions by attacking the education establishment as a block on change. Allies of the former Education Secretary claim his demotion in last week's reshuffle signalled that the Government had lost its war against the teaching unions - which they refer to as 'the blob'. But Mrs Morgan - the privately educated mother of one - said working with 'the system' was crucial to get the best results for children. She said: 'I will obviously be nice to teachers, because working with teachers and heads and governors and everyone else in the system is critical in getting the best outcome for our children. Education can be life-transforming.' But she insisted she would not turn her back on the changes championed by Mr Gove, who oversaw the creation of new free schools and academies in an effort to provide greater choice and competition. Mrs Morgan also revealed she would not stand in the way of grammar schools expanding to take in new pupils. She said: 'It is very much about what parents want, whether they want a free school, whether they want to send their children to academies or grammar schools. 'If grammar schools want to expand, we’re not going to stand in their way.' Overall she said: 'There will certainly be no soft-pedalling on reforms. 'I think Michael has been a fantastic education secretary and the reforms he has put in place, particularly freeing schools from Whitehall interference, have been phenomenally successful.' She rejected calls to perform a U-turn on rules to punish parents who take their children out of class during term time, saying the policy 'sends a firm signal'. Mrs Morgan also backed the policy of allowing lessons to be taught by people without formal teaching qualifications: 'If (heads) say that the best person to teach economics is somebody who has worked in a bank in the City of London, then fine.' Michael Gove was hated by many teachers over his radical reforms to school pay, the curriculum and exam standards . The Education Secretary also supported Mr Gove's policy of allowing new free schools to be opened where there is demand, even if there is no shortage of school places in the area. 'If there is parental demand for free schools, that's where they should go,' she said. 'It is very much about what parents want, whether they want a free school, whether they want to send their children to academies or grammar schools.' She said the Department for Education would not stand in the way of grammar schools that want to expand. Mrs Morgan, who went to the private Surbiton High School, has a six-year-old son, Alex, who attends a state school. Asked if he would go to a state secondary school, she said: 'We've got very good state secondary schools, so yes, but he's a long way off secondary school.'","Zero-tolerance policy on holidays during class time sends 'a firm signal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An invasion of Asian super ants is believed to have spread across southern England after a massive nest was found in London. The UK’s first colony of the insects, which are attracted to electricity and munch through cables sparking fires and blackouts, was reported in 2009 at Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire. Experts were called in to get rid of them but it is believed many ants escaped and have since colonised a huge swathe of southern England. Scroll down for video . The Asian ants, similar to those pictured, travel in swarms rather than straight lines, like garden ants . The nests found at a home in Hendon, north London, last week are believed to be the first in the capital, but there are fears the whole of the UK could be swarming with the pests within the next ten years. Asian super ants, which swarm together rather than crawling in lines like garden ants, form large colonies with interconnected nests spreading over many miles. They are dependant on the sugary liquid called honeydew left by aphids, form ‘super colonies’, with many queens and interconnected nests spreading out over many miles. The ants, called Lasius neglectus, were first found 20 years ago in Europe after a colony was found in Budapest, Hungary, and have now colonised areas of Germany, France, Spain and Poland. If the ants from Gloucestershire have made it all the way to London - almost exactly 100 miles from where they were first found in 2009 - it could mean they have marched through Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Bucks before reaching the capital. Bosses at Cleankill Environmental Services say they were called out to home in Hendon last week after the owners noticed that the ants were ‘behaving oddly’ and that there were ‘tens of thousands of them’. Pest control experts uncovered a large nest of the creatures in Hendon, north London last week. File photo . The species are drawn to electricity, a compulsion that is stronger in the ants that the drive to eat or drink, and the can cause blackouts and fires by eating through electrical cables. In the house in Hendon, pest controllers found thousands of the ants inside the couple’s microwave and other electrical equipment as well as in the garden and a bedroom. Chris Davis, one of the managers with Cleankill, said yesterday that the find in London was a ‘wake up call’ that the ants are spreading across the UK. He said: 'Initially our technician thought they were garden ants but then we noticed they were behaving in an unusual way and they weren’t following trails. 'They were being seen absolutely everywhere in the house including the microwave and on a bed. 'We sent a sample of insects to experts who identified them as Asian super ants, and with treatment advice from (fellow pest control experts) at Killgerm Chemicals and Bayer we were able to modify our inspection and treatment procedures accordingly.' A colony of the ants was first reported in Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire in 2009, but are feared to have spread . A spokesman for the firm said the ant infestation in Hendon was ‘serious’ and that it was harder to control and kill the super ants than normal black garden ants. He said': 'Asian super ants form super colonies, sometimes consisting of tens of thousands of ants in interconnected nests. 'New satellite colonies are formed by ‘budding’ - ants leaving the ‘home nest’ and forming new colonies. 'These satellites may be very small, for instance in a potted plant, and it is thought that in this way the super-colonies can gradually develop. 'This budding behaviour means that the ants can be easily transported by commerce and seed a new colony. 'These nests do not compete with each other although they do compete strongly with other ant species in the area. Nests are found in leaf litter, under paving, and other stones, and around the base of trees.'","Asian ants first found in manor in Gloucestershire five years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Warm temperatures and showers have made it a record year for slugs as the weather has provided the perfect breeding conditions . The hot weather isn’t just encouraging gardeners to get stuck into the veg patch. Warm temperatures coupled with regular showers have provided slugs with perfect breeding conditions, meaning record numbers – estimated to be double last year’s count – are descending on our well-tended borders. And the weather has been good for plants too, meaning the pests have rich pickings. As well as the recent humidity, the mild winter further boosted the slug population because there were fewer frosts to destroy their eggs. Allan Cavill of National Allotment Society advised: ‘It is much better to water in the morning.  That allows water to evaporate away before the slugs are active. The worst time to water is at night.’ Another research team, examining new 'monster slugs', claim that an army of outsized gastropods have also hit the country. The pests, which feast on dead matter and dog excrement, are said to be particularly hardy and able to devour up to 20 slug pellets before they even start to show the effects. Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, first encountered the slugs in East Anglia in 2012. He counted 350 of them in just one day and when he saw some eating a dead mouse he decided to send samples for identification. Researchers received a number of sightings of the beasts in April last year, but a sudden cold snap either killed many off or slowed down their breeding. However, it is feared that the current warm period is set to spark a breeding frenzy of the monsters. Dr Bedford said: 'With the mild winter climate and the conditions we have seen in the spring, we are expecting them to make a comeback this year. 'I am starting to find a few dozen in the garden already.' As well as the recent humidity, the mild winter further boosted the slug population because there were fewer frosts to destroy their eggs . The scientist and his team of researchers are seeking to secure funding for urgent research, so as to tackle the monster molluscs before they destroy many crops. These slugs, which are cannibalistic and eat others of their kind, are thought to have first arrived in Britain on imported lettuce and other salad leaves. Experts fear they will breed with native species - which play a vital role in our ecosystem - to create a mutant version that could resist all forms of pest control. Dr Bedford warned: 'The Spanish slug is a voracious predator that can survive eating many of the slug pellets that are supposed to kill them.' The warm, wet, summer has also lead to an increase in other insects, including flying ants. Professor Hart added: 'It seems to have been a very good year for them, we’re doing a study into flying ants and numbers seem to be high. 'It’s not easy to tell half-way through the season, but this seems to be a similar summer to last year and that was a good year for the flying ants, their numbers were up.'","Temperatures have provided slugs with the perfect breeding conditions .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . The biggest scare Mercedes have endured in Budapest this week occurred on push-bikes rather than cars. Sitting around Lewis Hamilton was one of his bosses, Toto Wolff, with a broken wrist and shoulder, another - Paddy Lowe - with cuts and bruises, and senior performance engineer Jock Clear with three cracked ribs - all from a pile-up while riding along the Danube. In a separate incident one fool, whose identity we will protect, could not get his feet out of the toe clips and toppled down the bank and hit a tree. He is sporting a black eye. Stick to cars, chaps. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton taking a virtual spin round Hungaroring . Picture that: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both of Friday's practice sessions ahead of the Hungarian GP . Target: Hamilton has won the Hungarian Grand Prix on four previous occasions - in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013 . Crash: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff fractured his wrist in a bike accident during a team bonding exercise . In the four-wheel world they continue to dominate. Hamilton was quickest in both sessions in Friday's practice sessions for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix on a demanding track where he has won four times; his team-mate Nico Rosberg was second. 'It should be six wins here!' said Hamilton, whose victory here last year was his first for Mercedes. 'The fans in the UK are the greatest and then here is probably second for me, for some reason. 'From the moment I arrived at the airport this morning there were tons of people with flags and  t-shirts they had made. 'I love the track. It's an old classic circuit. They don't make them like this anymore. There's a lot of braking and that's where I gain my time generally. You do have to throw the car around more.' It was the car throwing him around in qualifying for the German Grand Prix, when his brakes failed and he thudded hard into the tyre wall. Acupuncture, as well as physiotherapy, helped get him ready to race, in which he drove impressively from 20th on the grid to third. Heading for the track: Hamilton leaves the Mercedes garage during the second practice session . Driving seat: Nico Rosberg leads the World Championship but he was over two tenths down on Hamilton . It is the Saturdays that have been weak for Hamilton this season, surprisingly given his reputation as a phenomenal one-lap specialist. He made notable mistakes in Canada, Austria and Britain. In his pre-race column, Hamilton admitted these failures were becoming costly, saying: 'I've had a difficult run in qualifying - I've not been on pole for five races, and that has not made things easy for me in the championship. 'I feel like I've had the pace to be on pole at all those grands prix but it just hasn't worked out. Some of that has been down to me, and some of it has not. I've made some mistakes and had some bad luck. 'I have no doubt I have the pace; I've just got to start delivering. I don't really know why it hasn't come together. 'We're now heading into a very important period of the year and that part of my game needs to be back to its best.' The weather in Budapest was scorchingly hot yesterday, and the sun is expected to stay out today. However, rain is forecast for the race - which would be fun if it is anything like the 2006 edition, when Jenson Button broke his long wait for a Formula One victory. If it is a dry race, overtaking will be extremely difficult, putting an even greater premium on qualifying than at most other tracks.

Hamilton, who described his 18 months with Mercedes as the best times of his career, is in talks about a new contract. That, though, is  for his manager Simon Fuller to  negotiate while he focuses on the task of winning the world title. Last night after stepping out of his Mercedes, Hamilton was back to the immediate business, saying: 'We have some work to do overnight to ensure we get the best setup for the weekend as we're not fully  comfortable with the car just yet, but our race pace looked OK. We'll have to look through the data to really know where we stand.' Rosberg, however, was pleased that Red Bull had not caught up the Silver Arrows. 'A really encouraging start to the weekend,' said the German. 'The car feels great and is super quick in the corners, so overall I'm quite happy.' Away from the track, Sportsmail's story that Formula One would be staging a race in Baku, Azerbaijan was confirmed. It will take place in 2016. There is a suggestion it will be called the European Grand Prix, which seems bizarre: Azerbaijan may be in the Eurovision Song  Contest, but it remains on the Asian side of the Caucuses.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Max Chilton has every confidence he will be retained by Marussia for a third consecutive season. Chilton started the campaign relatively strongly, claiming the best results of his Formula One career by finishing 13th in the season-opening race in Australia and again in Bahrain. In Monaco, however, team-mate Jules Bianchi stole Chilton's thunder as the Frenchman scored Marussia's first points from their four and a half years in F1 with ninth place in Monaco. Centre of attention: Max Chilton remains hopeful of being retained by Marussia for the 2015 season . Since then Chilton has struggled for form and results, but the 23-year-old from Reigate in Surrey sees no reason why Marussia would not retain him for 2015. 'I naturally want to stay with the team,' said Chilton. 'Like a lot of these things they filter down from the top, and there are a lot of rumours with regard to the top of the grid, with people moving around and you don't really know where you stand until then. 'I won't focus on that until later on in the year, but I'm confident I'll be here next year. I've had good races this year. 'I started off fairly strong, and okay the last few have not been particularly great, but I feel we've got to the bottom of that. Overall I've been consistent and had good results.' Chilton may yet be thanking Bianchi for that result in Monaco as the young Briton would like to believe it could play a key role in his own future. On track: The British driver joined the team in 2013 and finished every race of his debut season . Those two points mean Marussia lie ninth in the constructors' title race ahead of both Sauber and Caterham. If Marussia can hold on to that position the financial rewards would be considerable, which in turn may mean Chilton not having to find the cash to fund his seat. 'Marussia have a good future, especially if we hold off Sauber for ninth. That would really build up momentum,' added Chilton. 'That would be a big help to the team financially if we could do that as it would help us develop the car for next year. 'If the team gets this ninth then we might not need to worry about that (his financial situation). That's just me really thinking of the bigger picture. 'I've not properly looked into it, but I'd like to think I could continue to help the team develop over the next couple of years.'","Chilton is hopeful of racing at Marussia for a third straight season .

The . remainder of the session was naturally nowhere near as dramatic, but . was nevertheless eventful, particularly when rain began to fall at the . start of the top-10 shoot-out. As . the drivers attempted to get in a flying lap on slick rubber, the . slippery surface proved too difficult to handle, especially for Kevin . Magnussen who slid off into a tyre barrier at turn one. That . brought out the red flags for his car to be recovered and for the . barrier to be repaired, resulting in an eight-minute delay. That . period of time was enough for the rain to pass and the track to start . to dry out, ensuring the remaining nine drivers could again use slick . tyres.

Come the conclusion it came as no surprise when Rosberg clinched pole, his sixth of the year and fifth in the last six races.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton continued his long love affair with the Hungaroring by posting the fastest times in both Friday practice sessions ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton has become a master of the tight, twisty track, the slowest permanent facility on the Formula One calendar, claiming four poles and four victories in seven attempts. Another win on Sunday would make the 29-year-old the most successful driver at the circuit of all time. He is currently tied with Michael Schumacher on four wins apiece. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton taking a virtual spin round Hungaroring . Picture that: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both of Friday's practice sessions ahead of the Hungarian GP . Target: Hamilton has won the Hungarian Grand Prix on four previous occasions - in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013 . Hamilton could not have asked for too much more of a springboard towards a race win after finishing the day ahead of title rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Quickest in FP1 when the medium-compound Pirelli tyre was used throughout, Hamilton posted a time of one minute 25.814 seconds, finishing 0.183secs clear of Rosberg. Come FP2 when the drivers were allowed a run on the soft rubber, the quicker of the two choices this weekend, Hamilton improved to 1:24.482, with Rosberg down by 0.238. The fact they again finished one-two was no surprise as Mercedes have no equal this season, with just two drivers within a second of the pair after the two 90-minute runs. Heading for the track: Hamilton leaves the Mercedes garage during the second practice session . Driving seat: Nico Rosberg leads the World Championship but he was over two tenths down on Hamilton . Both were world champions, with outgoing champion Sebastian Vettel 0.629 off the pace in his Red Bull, followed by double title-holder Fernando Alonso for Ferrari, 0.955 adrift. The second session was not without its difficulties for Mercedes, though, as Hamilton at one stage complained of a loss of braking. That will likely have sounded a few alarm bells on the pit wall in light of Hamilton's accident during qualifying last Saturday for the German Grand Prix when he suffered a 30g impact into a tyre wall after a right-front brake disc failure. As for Rosberg, there were engine concerns just over two-thirds of the way through the session, although neither man seemed overly burdened as long runs were eventually undertaken.

There was one comical radio moment late on when Rosberg said: 'Some advice please.' 'On traffic?' came the reply. 'No, on driving!' said Rosberg. It appeared strange the current leader should ask how to drive his car, but he was told to look at his exit out of turn two in order to gain a better approach into turn three. Behind the leading quartet was McLaren's Kevin Magnussen, followed by the second Ferrari and Red Bull respectively of Kimi Raikkonen and Daniel Ricciardo, the latter 1.5secs down. Despite a run of three successive podiums - the first Williams driver to conjure such a feat for 11 years - Valtteri Bottas was only eighth, albeit on a track not expected to suit his car this weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button, 1.752secs back, and Felipe Massa in his Williams completed the top 10, with Marussia's Max Chilton down in 21st and just over four seconds in arrears.","Hamilton finished ahead of Nico Rosberg in both practice sessions .

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . Luckless Lewis Hamilton's bid for a fifth pole position in Hungary literally went up in flames as his car caught fire early in qualifying. Just minutes into the session at the Hungaroring, Hamilton's Mercedes was ablaze at the rear, and although he attempted to crawl back to the garage, it proved a futile exercise. Hamilton was forced to stop on the pit lane entry road where marshals quickly used extinguishers to douse the fire, started by what Mercedes claimed to be a fuel leak. Now click here to read the report . Host commentator . That's Rosberg's third straight pole, and barring a mechanical problem, he looks set to extend his lead over Hamilton as we head into the summer break. Thank you for your company today, and be sure to join us for tomorrow's Hungarian Grand Prix. Hungarian GP Grid: 1 Rosberg; 2 Vettel; 3 Bottas; 4 Ricciardo; 5 Alonso; 6 Massa; 7 Button; 8 Vergne; 9 Hulkenberg; 10 Magnussen . The German goes faster on his final run and he is almost half-a-second quicker than Sebastian Vettel who will be on the front row for tomorrow's race. Button goes fourth fastest, and he has time to turn in another lap. It's Bottas up next and the Williams man misses out on pole by just over one tenth. He is second. But Rosberg goes fastest with a 1:23.236 and he is almost two tenths quicker than Vettel. Has he done enough to secure pole? Surely, the circuit will be improving but is the rain coming in again? But what a time that is from Vettel who lays down a marker with a time of 1:23.415 and he is the best part of eight tenths faster than Bottas. Bottas is the man of the moment and he sets the fastest time. His first run is two seconds quicker than Rosberg. Does the German have one eye on the championship? Ricciardo is second fastest, three tenths adrift of the Williams with Alonso up next. We're back underway in Hungary and it appears as though the track is at its worst in Turn 1 and Turn 2. The track could get quite a bit quicker in the next few minutes. Rosberg is the first man on track and he is followed by Ricciardo. The session will re-start in two minutes. The brolleys are still up, but it appears as though the rain has eased off. Nico Rosberg locks his brakes at Turn 1 and runs wide, and BANG, Magnussen is in the barriers after locking his brakes, too and he heads straight into the barriers. A heavy shunt for the McLaren man, but he is OK and out of his car. The session is suspended as the marshalls repair the tyre barrier. The drivers are on slick tyres, but they probably know they have one shot at posting their best time with the rain intensifying. It's raining in the paddock ahead of the top-10 shootout. That will add a bit of spice to the remainder of the session. The cars are stacked at the end of the pit lane awaiting the green light. Rosberg laid down the marker with a 123.3 with the two Red Bulls close behind him. It looks as though it is the German's pole to throw away today, mind. 'So, we couldn't even beat Sutil,' is the message from a frustrated Grosjean over the team radio. He will start 15th tomorrow. Kvyat had set two personal bests but lost the rear of his Toro Rosso under braking at Turn 12, and he is out of his car. On track, and with three minutes remaining, Hulkenberg, Perez, Gutierrez, Grosjean and Biacnhi are heading out of qualifying. It's Rosberg, in the troubled-free Mercedes, who tops the timesheets. LEWIS HAMILTON: 'I bailed out of that timed lap and something happened to my brakes so I had to engage some settings to correct it and then the engine just died. I was on the pit lane entry so hoped I could get it back to the pits and they could fix it but I looked in my rear mirrors and it was on fire. 'I hoped to get it to the garage and maybe they could do something but I tried to stop and the brakes weren’t working. It is all pretty bad. I honestly don’t know what I can do tomorrow. I will struggle to get in the top 10 at least the top 5 I will probably leave here more than 20 points behind Nico but here are still races to go. I will try my best.' Niki Lauda: 'It is not back yet so we have to get it back and see what it is. The fuel pressure went down and there was a fire so the logic is the fuel caused the fire. I hope the car isn't too much damaged. It is completely unfair. Two races in a row. Here passing is difficult. He would have been fastest today. He would have won the race no question.' We're green for Q2 - a 15-minute session to reduce the 16 remaining drivers to 10. Will we get any more drama? Meanwhile, Mercedes have confirmed that a fuel leak caused the fire on Hamilton's car. Unbelievable. For the second consecutive race Kimi Raikkonen has been knocked out of qualifying in Q1. The Finn was sitting in Ferrari garage as Jules Bianchi, on the books of the Italian team of course, usurped his time. Madness. Stunning pictures of Hamilton's Mercedes on fire. That will now be six races without pole for the Briton and it's damage limitation once more for the 29-year-old... Back on track, and Hamilton's nemesis Nico Rosberg is top of the timesheets some two tenths ahead of Daniel Ricciardo. Jules Bianchi, Max Chilton, Romain Grosjean and Marcus Ericsson occupy the relegation places with Maldonado and of course Hamilton both out of qualifying. Hamilton can't believe it. He watches the marshals put out the fire and puts his head in his hands. His Mercedes is wrecked with smoke still billowing out of the engine. Unbelievable. Hamilton's Mercedes is up in flames. The Briton is touring round the track, and he makes it back to the pit-lane but he has to jump out of his car. The marshals are quickly on the scene and extinguish the fire, but that means Hamilton will start at the very back for tomorrow's race. You couldn't make it up. What rotten luck for the Briton. Pastor Maldonado pulls off the track in his Lotus with yet another mechanical error for the troubled team. It looked as though the Venezuelan, who has already signed on with Lotus for next season, completely lost drive. How many more mechanical failures can that team have? The light goes green in Hungary and a gaggle of cars head on to the track. The midfield runners head out on the harder tyre. The FIA are now reporting a 30 per cent chance of rain during qualifying. We get underway in a little over five minutes... Christian Horner has been speaking following his blast at the Formula One media in Friday's press conference. 'I stand by everything I said yesterday. We shouldn’t be talking the sport down the whole time. The drivers have got to be the heroes and thereafter the cars should be second to that. We need to give more access to the drivers and the fans have got to be able to engage with the drivers.' Toto Wolff is sporting an arm brace in the paddock this weekend after fracturing his wrist in a cycling crash earlier this week. Wolff was taking part in a team building exercise with his Mercedes colleagues, but it turned in to somewhat of a farce after Wolff’s injuries, Paddy Lowe suffering bruising and race engineer Jock Clear cracking three ribs. Stick to four wheels, chaps. The circuit is currently bathed in summer sunshine, but to the south of the track it certainly looks as though there are some dark clouds gathering. We've got 30 minutes until the start of today's qualifying session... Niki Lauda has apologised in person to all at Ferrari following his derogatory remarks made in the wake of Sunday's German Grand Prix. debut on the 2016 Formula One calendar. A move for Baku, the capital city, to host the race was first revealed by Sportsmail in March. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner launched an astonishing tirade against the Formula One media on Friday. My aim heading to Germany was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over Lewis Hamilton, and then win what is my second home race after Monaco, so it was very special to win for myself and for Mercedes as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team. Lewis Hamilton was quickest in both sessions in Friday's practice sessions for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix on a demanding track where he has won four times; his team-mate Nico Rosberg was second. Lewis Hamilton has endured somewhat of a qualifying nightmare of late. Indeed, it’s been five races since the Briton stuck his Mercedes on pole. But where better to end his current one-lap hoodoo then Hungary? The 29-year-old is a specialist in Hungary, winning in his debut year in 2007, then again in 2009 in a dog of a McLaren, in 2012, and claiming his first victory in a Mercedes last term. Hamilton was fastest once more this morning, meaning he has topped the timesheets in every practice session so far at the Hungaroring ahead of team-mate and his rival for the title Nico Rosberg. Rosberg is 14 points ahead of Hamilton heading into tomorrow’s race after victory at the German Grand Prix last time out. Hamilton will be desperate to close the gap ahead of the four-week summer break.","Hamilton out of qualifying after his Mercedes catches fire .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Castleford ran in three tries in the last 13 minutes to snatch an unlikely 18-18 draw against a rejuvenated Hull in a dramatic First Utility Super League match at the KC Stadium. The home side looked to have secured a first win in six matches to rekindle their outside play-off hopes when they led 18-4 for most of the second half, but Hull-bound stand-off Marc Sneyd sparked a remarkable fightback with one try before right winger James Clare touched down twice in the last seven minutes. Sneyd, who is joining Hull on a three-year deal at the end of the season, could have won it for the Tigers but he missed the target with three of his four conversion attempts on a rare off-night. Power: Daryl Clark of Castleford Tigers battle through the Hull defence . Hull may feel aggrieved after losing both half-backs Jordan Rankin and Jordan Abdull to injury but there was much to encourage coach Lee Radford, who had labelled his side an ""embarrassment"" after their 56-10 hammering by Wigan a week ago. They were lifted by the return of skipper Gareth Ellis and a man-of-the-match display by loose forward Joe Westerman while 18-year-old Abdull capped an accomplished performance with his first try for the club. Radford's men were a rejuvenated side from the kick-off and an early knock-on from Castleford full-back Luke Dorn gave them the opportunity to set up camp in the visitors half. Rankin lost the ball trying to ground it over the line, Ellis was brought down just short and winger Tom Lineham went close to touching down Westerman's kick on a free play as the Airlie Birds enjoyed all the early momentum. The pressure finally told on 14 minutes when hooker Danny Houghton made the running for centre Kirk Yeaman to create an overlap for winger Fetuli Talanoa to score the first try. On one of the few occasions, the Tigers managed to break free of the shackles, Sneyd whetted the appetite of the home fans ahead of his pending move to the KC Stadium with a superb break that set up a 15th try of the season for centre Michael Shenton. The normally reliable Sneyd missed the conversion attempt and Hull increased their lead through the impressive Abdull on 29 minutes. The youngster had earlier made a clean break which came to nothing, but he produced a clinical finish to register his first try for the club, jinking past two flat-footed defenders, and Rankin's second goal made it 12-4. Hull were forced to scramble after a wonderful flowing move featuring ball-handling forwards Grant Millington and Weller Hauraki almost fashioned a try for hooker Daryl Clark but Castleford were relieved to find themselves trailing by only eight points at the break. Their task began to look impossible when Castleford winger Kirk Dixon lost the ball just outside his own 20-metre area within two minutes of the re-start and Hull immediately took advantage of the perfect attacking position, with Abdull getting Yeaman crashing over for their third try. Well done: James Clare (right) celebrates after scoring the fourth try for Castleford Tigers . Rankin kicked a third goal but hobbled off six minutes into the second half and Hull lost some of their momentum in the resulting re-shuffle. As Castleford rallied, forward Oliver Holmes got to the line after a determined run only to lose his grip on the ball as he attempted to touch down, but the visitors gave themselves hope with two tries in seven minutes. Shenton carved out a score for Sneyd with a trademark slicing run on 67 minutes and his goal cut the gap back to eight points. There were only four points in it on 73 minutes when Hull failed to clear the danger caused by Sneyd's grubber kick and Clare picked up the loose ball to sprint 30 metres for his first try. As the Tigers pressed for the winning try, Abdull was carried off on a stretcher with a head injury following a collision with Hauraki, who was put on report by referee James Child. Hull fans bayed for a penalty but Castleford took advantage of excellent field position as Clare collected Sneyd's clever kick to the corner for his second try.","Castleford score three tries in 13 minutes to salvage a draw .

"By . David Kent . Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke was sacked last night after he was hit with a two-year ban for doping. Tiernan-Locke is the first Sky rider to be charged with doping in the team’s five-year existence and Sir Dave Brailsford, the team principal, said the 29-year-old was axed as soon as UK Anti-Doping’s verdict was confirmed. ‘We respected the process and now it’s been concluded we terminated his contract with immediate effect,’ said Brailsford at the finish of stage 12 of the Tour de France here. ‘We know his violation was from before he joined Team Sky,’ continued Brailsford. ‘We set out to win the Tour with a clean British rider.

"By . Derek Hunter . Veteran shooter Michael Gault says he can now ‘chillax’ after matching the record number of medals won at a Commonwealth Games with bronze for England in the 10-metre air pistol. The 60-year-old grandfather from Norfolk, competing in his sixth Games, secured an 18th podium place after coming out of retirement in a bid to break the record held by another shooter, Phillip Adams. He has now moved level with the Australian, who has long since retired, and could move out on his own as the most decorated Commonwealth athlete in history with a 19th medal in the 50m event tomorrow.

He said: ‘It didn’t matter what colour . it was, I’ve got the 18 medals now. That’s exactly what the aim was so . it’s job done now.

"By . Damian Spellman . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is refusing to give up on summer targets Fabio Borini and Marcos Alonso despite a frustrating wait to secure them. The Black Cats appeared to receive a double set-back in their pursuit of the pair earlier this week when Borini's agent Marco de Marchi indicated that the player's preference was to fight for his place at Liverpool, while a report from Italy suggested Fiorentina full-back Alonso was no longer for sale. However, Poyet remains optimistic that deals can still be struck for the two men who provided sterling service during loan spells at the Stadium of Light last season. Determined: Gus Poyet says he won't give up on trying to bring Fabio Borini and Marcos Alonso to Sunderland . Staying put: Borini (left) would prefer to stay at Liverpool and fight for his first-team place . Asked about 23-year-old Borini, the Uruguayan told the Sunderland Echo: 'It is not for me to explain but it is not just a question of Fabio wanting to come or not. There are many, many things to look at and unfortunately, I cannot comment on those. 'We are involved in negotiations and you never know how long that can take. There's nothing new to report as things stand, but we are still hoping to close the deal completely. 'It's up to Fabio. We have been clear, everything is fine, there's no doubt about his connection with our club, and me and him get along fine, so there is no reason for it not to happen. 'I would love to know how long it will take to sort out, but all I can tell you is that things are changing every day. 'We have targets that we are looking for, we have other options, but we have an agreement with Liverpool and we will do everything possible to get Fabio to the club first. 'If Fabio does not come, it does not set us back, we would move on - we are not a one-player team.' The capture of 23-year-old Alonso too is a priority, and one which Poyet is confident can be achieved. He said: 'It's close, but not close enough. Everything is on track. 'We're trying hard. It's been a bit more difficult than I expected, but we're not going to stop.' Lasting impression: Alonso (left) enjoyed an impressive season on loan at Sunderland in the last campaign .","Gus Poyet says he is refusing to give up on trying to bring Fabio Borini and Marcos Alonso back to Sunderland .

"By . Guy Aspin, Press Association . Welsh Athletics has vowed to carry out an internal review after a second drugs scandal hit its team at the Commonwealth Games. European 400 metres hurdles champion Rhys Williams, the co-captain of Wales' athletics squad in Glasgow, has been provisionally suspended and will miss the event after failing a drugs test. The 30-year-old son of rugby union great JJ Williams becomes the second Welsh athlete to be forced out of the Games over an alleged doping offence, after 800m runner Gareth Warburton was withdrawn nine days ago. He said he was 'utterly devastated' by the news of his failed test and insisted, like Warburton, that he had never knowingly doped. Ban: Rhys Williams has been provisionally suspended after being charged with an anti-doping violation . Blow: Williams said he was 'devastated' and in 'shock' at the results . However, Welsh Athletics admitted it . was ""concerned"" to see a second member of its team charged with . committing an anti-doping rule violation.

"By . Garry Doolan . The transfer of Luis Suarez to Barcelona may have given Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers the hard cash to make it a record-breaking summer of transfers at Anfield. But the signing of France forward Loic Remy has been in the pipeline long before the arrival of Rodgers at the club. The versatility of a player often likened to former Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was what made ex-Reds boss Kenny Dalglish enquire about Remy’s availability way back in 2011. VIDEO Scroll down for Liverpool eye Remy . Almost there: Remy is on the brink of joining Liverpool after last season's loan spell at Newcastle . Gone: Luis Suarez left Anfield to join Barcelona for £75m after yet more controversy this summer . VIDEO Borini off to Sunderland as Liverpool eye Remy . And the 27-year-old’s stock has only risen in the years since, scoring the goals for QPR and Newcastle United which have proven he can hack it in the Premier League. He smashed six in 13 starts for a struggling QPR side eventually relegated from the top flight and bagged 14 in 24 starts for Newcastle last season. Rodgers himself went after the Frenchman in January this year and again in March - long before Suarez departed for La Liga. The forward’s goal return is clearly a draw as Rodgers seeks to fill the 31-goal gap left by the Uruguayan. Crucially, though, Remy will also provide the pace, ability and willingness to play in any position forward of deep midfield, which appeals to the Ulsterman’s desire for his players to be interchangeable in a fluid, rotating system. In and out: Remy will not be able to fill Suarez's shoes but he will offer Liverpool a different type of option . Versatile: The French striker's pace and ability to play across the front line is a key factor in his signing . It was this ability to take up any role asked of him - coupled with blistering pace - which made Remy a much better bet that Wilfried Bony. Although primarily a striker, he can operate anywhere across the front line. Remy featured in five different positions for Newcastle last season and that is a clear sign he will fit into a Liverpool attacking system that is likely to have Daniel Sturridge as its beating heart but with a mix-and-match group of players as its lifeblood. Raheem Sterling assumed a key role during Liverpool’s title challenge last season after learning to be more flexible, while Philippe Coutinho earned rave reviews in the latter half of the season after showing a similar willingness to adapt. Key role: Coutinho is one of the Liverpool players who functioned so well behind the strikers last year . Key pair: Suarez and Sturridge formed an excellent partnership last season, something Remy wants to emulate . Rarely did they get in each others’ way as Liverpool smashed goals with abandon at the height of their resurgence; Remy will be equally expected to work out his place in this grand scheme. There will be inevitable moments of confusion when Sturridge and Remy both pull wide and deep, or chase the same balls into the box. But Rodgers will trust them to come good, in time. The Liverpool manager would not have spent the £8.5m on Remy if he were not confident there will be no long-term clash of styles, no fighting for the same positions. It was a similar train of thought with the purchase of Rickie Lambert from Southampton last month. Rodgers has always been happy to compliment how well his front line complement. Remy’s arrival will not change that. Searing: Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge used their pace to rip teams apart last season . Irreplaceable: No one player was ever going to be signed to make up for the Uruguayan leaving . With Remy now signing on the dotted line for Liverpool, the work of his agent, Frederic Guerra, would appear done. Guerra has previously wasted no opportunity suggesting his player would be he perfect match for Liverpool, but his sales-pitch from 2011 would appear to be perfectly aimed at Rodgers now. 'This boy is pure gold,' he said. 'And I am not just saying that because I am his agent. 'He has great pace and that is something Liverpool need in attack. He has his heart set on playing for Liverpool.' If Guerra’s high-praise should come with the obvious health-warning of somebody pedalling self-interest, the words of former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson perhaps carry more credibility. Back in May this year, the Match of the Day pundit was proclaiming Remy as an ideal signing for the Reds. Rebuilding: Rodgers has already brought in several stars to fill the whole left by Suarez . 'Personally, I would take him all day long,' he was reported as saying. 'He would provide a perfect option as he is such a good player.' Lawrenson was commenting in the knowledge that Liverpool will be tested by a challenge for honours on four fronts next season following their return to the Champions League. Prior to joining QPR in January 2013, Remy was a regular for Marseille in the Champions League, scoring four goals in 16 appearances in the competition. He also played for the French club in the Europa League. In buying Remy, nobody, especially, Rodgers will believe he has signed a direct replacement for Suarez. But the Northern Irishman perhaps knows now more than ever, following the disappointment from by the antics of its greatest individual performer last season, that Liverpool’s strength next term will come from the sum of its parts.","Remy set to join Liverpool of £8.5million .

"By . David Clough, Press Association . James Anderson faces the possibility of being banned from his home Test at Old Trafford after a date of August 1 was set for his ICC disciplinary hearing. The England fast bowler ill be quizzed via Skype by ICC judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis the day after the third Test at the Ageas Bowl finishes after being charged with a Level 3 offence for allegedly 'abusing and pushing' India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja during the first Investec Test at Trent Bridge. An initial hearing on Tuesday morning, also via teleconference and involving Anderson's legal representatives and others from the ECB and BCCI, 'addressed preliminary issues' and set the date for the next stage of the disciplinary process.

'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'. Level 3 penalty . All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player. The date chosen for the full hearing is the day after the conclusion of the third Test against India at the Ageas Bowl, in a series England trail 1-0 following their 95-run defeat at Lord's. It was also decided on Tuesday that following England's Level 2 counter-allegation against Jadeja over a reported spat between the two players in the Trent Bridge pavilion stairwell on day two of the match, the tourist's case will be heard by the ICC's match referee David Boon. The punishments set out at Level 2, under the ICC's code of conduct, are less stringent and mean Jadeja is highly likely to escape a ban even if found guilty. Anderson will discover his fate within 48 hours of the hearing at 9am on August 1 - the time frame in which the judicial commissioner is required to announce his decisions. The fourth Test of five, at Old Trafford, is scheduled to start on August 7. Lancastrian Anderson, even if found not guilty at Level 3, could - at Lewis' discretion - be penalised at a lower grade, such as the one Jadeja faces.

Steve McClaren and his players will try to emulate Leicester City and Reading by responding to play-off heartbreak with automatic promotion next season. Nigel Pearson’s side won the Championship title this year, 12 months after losing dramatically to Watford in the semi-finals. Brian McDermott got Reading promoted as champions in 2012 having lost the 2011 play-off final to Swansea. McClaren (below) admitted there was ‘anger, sadness and remorse’ at the manner of their 1-0 defeat by Queens Park Rangers having dominated the match, but insisted Derby would not change their style of play.

He is keen to secure George Thorne, 21, the West Bromwich Albion midfielder who shone at Wembley, on another loan deal or permanent basis. He would also look to bring back Andre Wisdom and Patrick Bamford, who were on loan from Liverpool and Chelsea respectively. ‘We’ll get the players together and reflect on what we have achieved this season,’ said McClaren. ‘When we came in we never dreamed we’d be third with 85 points and top scorers. ‘The key thing is the style. It takes courage because you have to take risks and sometimes we’ve lost because of that but most of the times we’ve won. We didn’t win at Wembley but we have to keep that style because I enjoy watching it and the players enjoy playing it.

You can’t change what happened. We have to get back in July and have a right go.

"By . Ruth Styles . Women aged between 25 and 34 are more stressed than anyone else in Britain, a new study has found. At that age, women are typically climbing the career ladder at work, caring for demanding young children at home and paying a mortgage. All these pressures mount up as they struggle to overcome the strains of busy work, family and social lives, experts say. Anguish: Women between the ages of 25 and 34 are the most stressed people in Britain . Nationally, two in three of us, 67 per cent, suffer from stress every week, the study by herbal stress remedy brand Kalms found. And over a year the average Brit gets stressed 208 times. Managing bills and finances in tough economic times, and struggling to fit everything into a day are the biggest causes. Women typically suffer more bouts of anxiety than men - feeling anxious more than five times each week - and also find it harder to cope with. Men feel the strain four times each week, with the pressure passing more swiftly than women. But women - who often shoulder the greater burden of raising children - feel anxious five times a week. Tough: Actresses Miley Cyrus (left) and Christina Ricci (right) have both admitted to suffering from stress . A quarter of women say they are over-burdened eight or more times each week - meaning they struggle to cope every single day. The causes of stress are often similar for both sexes, the study of 2,000 adults found. Four in ten Brits (39 per cent) worry they will not be able to pay their bills and 30 per cent worry about squeezing all their chores into a busy schedule. One in five (22 per cent) are anxious about maintaining a healthy work/life balance, and 12 per cent making key decisions about their kids' future. But notably, women are much more likely to stress about household chores and relationships. Men fret more about working long hours, getting stuck in traffic, and being a passenger in a car while their partner is driving. During times of intense stress, 43 per cent of women lose sleep, a needy 41 per cent 'comfort eat' and 21 per cent drink more alcohol. Stress leaves many women feeling 'irritable', 'tense' and 'tired', the study found. Others report suffering from headaches or increased heartrate. Loss of sleep . Indulgence in comfort food and treats . Arguments with loved ones . Over-eating . Taking up smoking or smoking to excess . Get a good night's sleep . Eat healthy foods . Read some escapist fiction . Go shopping . Chat to a friend . Men who are feeling the strain are more likely than women to start smoking or to smoke more. And a quarter, 25 per cent, turn to their favourite tipple to help get them through times of trouble. Others argue with loved ones, forget to eat or take time off work to help them recover. Personal assistant Jane Hughes, 32, said the pressures of modern life leave her feeling stressed every single day. The mum of two, from Birmingham, said: 'Balancing the demands of my work and family lives is really tough and there's little room for a social life. 'I have to sacrifice sleep in order to get everything done, which leaves me feeling incredibly irritable each morning. 'A day does not pass without me feeling stressed. Unfortunately I do comfort eat to try to make me feel better but I then get more stressed about putting on weight.' Neil Shah, Director of the Stress Management Society, said: 'Women between the ages of 25 and 34 appear to be the most stressed. 'At this age they are struggling to keep up with an 'ideal lifestyle' and struggling to fit more and more into their lives. Solution: Spending time with friends can help to alleviate stress . 'Juggling a career, personal finances, relationships, family and home life not only contributes to stress but can make it difficult to find time to deal with the causes.' He added: 'Men and women stress about different things. Women worry more about bills and finances, and juggling their time, but men are more concerned about working long hours and debt. 'It is also important to bear in mind men and women have very different strategies to cope with stress. 'The fact they are worrying about different things could become a source of tension within relationships. 'People should find ways to relax and regain control. Exercise and a healthy diet can help to manage these periods of elevated stress and anxiety. You should try to avoid stimulants such as technology or alcohol, particularly close to bedtime. A good night's sleep can really help reduce symptoms of stress, so ensure you have a good wind down routine in the evenings.'","Pressure of young families and climbing the career ladder to blame .

Kate McCann felt ‘worthless’ and ‘mentally raped’ after her diary of the days after her daughter vanished was published in the News of the World. The mother of missing Madeleine told the Leveson Inquiry into press standards yesterday that she wanted to ‘climb into a hole and not come out’. Mrs McCann and her husband Gerry, both 43, said they felt some of the coverage of Madeleine’s disappearance was ‘nothing short of disgusting’ and that they had faced a virtual trial by media. Ordeal: Kate and Gerry McCann described the media storm after their daughter Madeleine vanished from a Portuguese holiday apartment in May 2007 . Trauma: The McCanns yesterday said their experience at the hands of the media had been 'disgusting' The couple from Rothley, . Leicestershire, revealed they had been called  by the editor of the . now-defunct News of the World, Colin Myler, days before the anniversary . of Madeleine going missing from their rented Portuguese holiday . apartment. Mrs McCann said he made her ‘almost feel guilty’ about giving . an interview to Hello! magazine, talking about their campaign for a . Europe-wide alert system for missing children. Witnesses: Gerry and Kate McCann arrived at the Leveson Inquiry at London's High Court holding hands this morning . Her husband added: ‘It’s fair to say . Mr Myler was irate when he learned of the publication and was berating . us for not doing an interview with the News of the World. ‘It was a time of stress for us on . the first anniversary … he basically beat us into submission, verbally, . and we agreed to do an interview the day after.’ Four months later, in September 2008, . a friend told Mrs McCann that her private diary – probably leaked by . Portuguese police – had been printed in the same newspaper. The mother of three said: ‘I  felt . violated. I’d written these words at the most desperate time of my life, . and it was  my only way of communicating with Madeleine. ‘I recently read through my diary . entries at that point in that week and I talk about climbing into a hole . and not coming out because I just felt so worthless that we’d been . treated like that.’ Mr McCann said he had never read his . wife’s diary because  it was private, and was shocked by its . publication. He told  the inquiry: ‘Kate was distraught and in her words . felt “mentally raped”.’ The couple said they initially . received support from the media after Madeleine’s disappearance but the . tone changed after ‘leaks’ from inside the Portuguese police . investigation falsely suggested the  couple were involved in Madeleine’s . disappearance. The couple were unable to refute the . allegations as they had been threatened with a two-year jail sentence if . they broke Portugal’s laws of judicial secrecy which surround any . police investigation.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Simon Crutchley, 51, from Tewkesbury, swindled more than £40,000 from his 90-year-old mother so he could pay back his spiralling debts . A son stole £40,000 from his 'extremely vulnerable' elderly mother so he could pay back his spiralling debts - just months after the pair were reconciled for the first time in twelve years. Simon Crutchley, 51, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, swindled the money from 90-year-old Joan - who is almost completely deaf - by pretending he was looking after her finances. His mother, who had been estranged from Crutchley since 1998, had contacted her son in 2010 because she was ill. But months after being reconciled, Crutchley took control over his mother’s finances - so he could steal £42,700 from her life savings. The self-employed salesman - who had racked up a £90,000 credit card bill and a £40,000 loan - withdrew the money four times over a 15-month period. He ripped up his mother's bank statements and ordered her carers not to touch her post so he could cover his tracks. Crutchley was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to four counts of theft during a hearing at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Judge Martin Walsh said: 'She was extremely vulnerable. These offences are so serious they cross the custody threshold. 'These offences took place over a period of 15 months and you stole more than £42,700 from your aged mother.' The court heard that Crutchley stole the money four times from his mother's HSBC account and cash ISAs between 2011 and 2013. He stole the money in instalments of £19,000, £15,717, £6,497 and £1,538. Crutchley pleaded guilty to four counts of theft during a hearing at . Wolverhampton Crown Court, pictured. He was jailed for 16 weeks . As well as a credit card debt and a loan, Crutchley also had a £390,000 mortgage which he struggled to pay off after losing his job. Prosecutor Trevor Meegan told the court: 'This money was essentially Mrs Crutchley’s life savings which she was using to pay for her car and she wanted to stay in her own home. 'When interviewed, Crutchley originally said after he had lost his job his mother had told him to take what money he needed and there had never been any discussion of paying it back.' The court heard that despite the theft, Mrs Crutchley still had enough money to be able to live in her own home. Blondelle Thompson, defending, said: 'He lost his job and his outgoings exceeded his income. 'He took advantage of her and is ashamed of the way he behaved.'","Simon Crutchley, 51, reconciled with his mother in 2010 after 12 years .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . In Monday’s Sportsmail, Ed Hawkins revealed two approaches made by a former Test star to Brendon McCullum in 2008 to fix matches – one before the inaugural IPL, and one during New Zealand’s tour of England. McCullum turned them down, and later provided testimony to the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit – testimony which Hawkins got hold of. The immediate reaction of New Zealand Cricket was to point out that McCullum was not being investigated (Hawkins never said he was) and to express ‘dismay’ that his testimony had been leaked. Pointing out an approach: Brendon McCullum gave a testimony to the ICC after being asked to fix matches . In a perfect world, NZC would have a . point. It’s a world in which every player who has been asked to do . something illegal reports the approach to the authorities, immediately. It’s a world in which those authorities can be trusted to bring the . guilty to account. And it’s a world in which no-one within cricket’s . internecine corridors of power has an axe to grind. It’s also a world that doesn’t exist. And it’s why some journalists will continue to treat these stories like forbidden fruit. Leaks happen for a reason. Those who run the game should spend less time outraging about the morality of leakage, and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place. The story of cricket’s so-called fight against corruption has been an underwhelming one, in which the main blows have been struck by the Indian police or the media. The ACSU have precious little to shout about: Kenya’s Maurice Odumbe, Marlon Samuels of West Indies, and – thanks to the work of its English branch – Mervyn Westfield and Danish Kaneria of Essex. Yet to judge not only by vast swathes of anecdotal evidence over the years, but also by the recent revelations about the number of people being monitored by the ACSU, you wonder what else we don’t know about. It’s true that the ACSU’s legal powers are limited. But it’s equally true that they are yet to convince the cricket community that they have the manpower, the expertise or even the will to deal with the problem. The game’s attempts to handle corruption took a bizarre twist recently when it was claimed that the ACSU would be reformed, reporting no longer to the ICC’s chief executive Dave Richardson, but to the ICC’s new chairman. As things stand, this chairman will be N Srinivasan, who has been temporarily incapacitated as president of the BCCI by India’s Supreme Court because of an investigation into – that’s right – corruption at the Indian Premier League. This, then, is the man who may soon be heading up cricket’s battle against corruption. So you’ll forgive the media – and the public – if their faith in cricket’s capacity to police itself is on the shaky side of sceptical. It’s in these circumstances that leaks occur. And, in the long run, these leaks will help paint a clearer picture, which is the least the public deserve. Throwing matches: Lou Vincent has admitted being involved in plans to fix games . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . But the public deserve more than that. They deserve to know that the game they’re paying to watch contains players who actually care about its legitimacy. I’m not talking here about the match-fixers themselves; they’re beyond the point of caring. No, it’s a question of persuading those who have been approached by the Lou Vincents of the game that they owe cricket a duty of care by exposing them straightaway. For that reason, we can’t heap all the blame on the administrators, who are hamstrung by a variety of factors ranging from legal impotence to downright incompetence. It is the players who must take ownership. Last week I met Mal Loye, who spoke at length about Vincent’s attempts to corrupt him before a Twenty20 game for Lancashire in 2008. Loye is one of cricket’s good guys, who found himself suddenly thrown in at the deep end and gasping for breath. One of the ggod guys: Mal Loye was appraoached by Vincent when they were team-mates at Lancashire . Six years ago, it had not been drummed into players that non-disclosure of an illegal approach was in itself an offence. Loye regrets keeping the approach to himself, and hopes others won’t make the mistake he made. Neither would they have any excuse for doing so: where the ACSU can claim some credit is in educating players about the modus operandi of the bookies. In 2014, everyone knows the score. In the meantime, the administrators might be advised to focus on ridding the game of corruption, not bemoaning the work of journalists who have lost faith in their capacity to do so. It’s fashionable right now to bash everything the ECB do, and in some instances they deserve it. But it was interesting to note the selection of Michael Carberry in England’s one-day squad for the five-match series starting on Thursday against Sri Lanka. Carberry was dropped from the 50-over side after averaging 21, with a strike-rate of 62, during five ODIs last September. In March, he told the Guardian that ‘I seem to have been left out for some unknown reason. I don’t think it’s a cricket reason because my one-day stats speak for themselves over the last few seasons’. Asked whether he had heard from the selectors since returning from the Ashes in Australia, he replied: ‘No. Nothing – which is disappointing. But it’s the way they tend to do things.’ Now he’s been picked again. Maybe he feels he owes England a better return than he managed first time round. Stats life: Michael Carberry is back in the England 50-over team despite an average recent return . The ability of teams in the IPL to chase down almost any total has done little to quell the fears of those who believe boundaries have been brought too far in-field. To quote one concerned party: ‘As we looked down on the ground for the press box, the playing area seemed very small. It would be interesting to know when this habit of making off much of the ground with a circle first was accepted […] It seems wrong to me…’ Those words were written by Jack Fingleton, in his 1949 book Brightly Fades the Don. He was talking about the Lord’s Ashes Test of the previous summer. We like to imagine that cricketing gripes are new – and all the more outrageous for being so. In fact, the same grumbles have been around for years. It’s just that no one ever does anything about them. Mushtaq Ahmed, until recently the ECB’s spin-bowling coach, has taken up a similar role with the Pakistan team, and immediately told www.PakPassion.net that his aim was to ‘find and develop mystery spinners’. We wish him luck – and wonder why English cricket didn’t seem such fertile ground for him to do the same thing during his five-and-a-bit years in this country. With Matt Prior fighting off an achilles injury and the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord’s fast approaching, the gloves are off for the fight to, er, put the gloves back on. The field is wide open, and Steve Davies looked in good nick while helping to shepherd Surrey to their first Championship win of the season against Gloucestershire at The Oval last week. So it’s a shame that Davies has asked to be relieved of his wicket-keeping duties while he rediscovers his form with the bat. There may never be a better chance to grab those Test gloves. The (keeping) gloves are off: Steven Davies (left) has given up stumping to rediscover his form with the bat .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Hundreds of surfers paddled out on boards to remember a Southern California lifeguard who drowned a week ago while saving a swimmer caught in treacherous surf. The Orange County Register reports that more than 2,000 people joined the paddle-out tribute Sunday in Newport Beach in memory of 32-year-old lifeguard Ben Carlson. Thousands more watched from the pier and beach. Carlson died a week ago during a rescue after disappearing under 10- to 12-foot waves. He was the first lifeguard to die in the Orange County city known for sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide. A Coast Guard helicopter hovers over people gathered for a memorial for Newport Beach lifeguard, Ben Carlson off the Newport Pier Sunday, July 13, 2014 in Newport Beach, California .

People gather for a memorial for Newport Beach lifeguard, Ben Carlson off the Newport Pier Sunday, July 13, 2014 in Newport Beach . Surfer Bobby Zahabizadeh says he's grateful for the lifeguards. He was just a few towers away when Carlson died. Lifeguards along more than six miles of pristine sand in this Southern California beach city had rescued more than 200 people by the time the call came to help a distressed swimmer east of one of the main piers. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat  and jumped into the water. The 32-year-old, a passionate surfer and one of the fastest swimmers on the 200-strong mostly seasonal lifeguard staff, was pronounced dead late on Sunday after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves . Ben Carlson was described as a 'swimming monster' who knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing . He was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide. ‘He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,’ said his father, Chris Carlson. ‘He was a water monster - that was one of the things that was so unbelievable to us; a lowly 10-foot wave would take him out because he was so experienced.’ He said his son knew how to handle himself in 30- and 40-foot waves while surfing. Newport Beach lifeguard boats converge at the end of the pier after the three hour search for a missing lifeguard Ben Carlson ended . 'He just loved being out on the water, he loved the opportunity to help people,' said his father, Chris Carlson . ‘It's one of those professions that people think you're getting in the way of fun, or it's kind of a cakewalk job, and something like this happens, and people realize how truly dangerous it can be,’ Carlson said. The swimmer, who has not been identified by authorities, was brought to shore and survived. Conditions on Sunday were especially treacherous, with swells of 12 feet or more crashing in without warning and a strong current that took swimmers by surprise. Around 100,000 people packed the beach with about 80 lifeguards on duty, said Rob Williams, the city's chief lifeguard. ‘It's not typical that we always have 10- to 12-foot surf, but it does happen once or twice a year, and it happened to be a Sunday with fantastic weather on a holiday weekend,’ said Williams, whose guards made more than 200 rescues and issued 3,000 warnings to beachgoers that day. Carlson was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide . Newport Beach lifeguards rescued hundreds of swimmers over the weekend due to dangerous rip currents . The city gets 10 million beach visitors annually. The National Weather Service had warned Sunday of dangerous rip currents and high surf along Southern California beaches due to a swell originating in the Southern Hemisphere. Beachgoers said on Monday that a particularly huge swell surged ashore in the late afternoon, drenching blankets and upsetting picnics. Shortly after, rescue boats buzzed between the waves and helicopters began flying low over the water up and down the beach. ‘The waves were huge. I saw it and I thought a tsunami was coming,’ said Shirley Reinker, 72, who has lived along the beach for 40 years. The fallen lifeguard was raised in the inland suburbs of Southern California but always loved the ocean. As soon as Ben Carlson was old enough to get a driver's license, he tried to get a lifeguard job about an hour's drive away in Newport Beach, his father said. Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach . He traveled to surf big waves and played water polo at the University of California, Irvine. And while worked as beverages director for the Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant chain, he would lifeguard whenever he could, the elder Carlson said. He was one of the fastest swimmers on staff, Williams said. All lifeguards must be able to swim 0.6 miles in under 20 minutes and re-qualify annually, but Carlson had additional training to work on a boat as a rescue swimmer and drive patrol vehicles, Williams said. As a seasonal guard, Carlson made about $22 an hour. Friends hung his red lifeguard jacket over the bar at a local Irish pub blocks from the beach, a lifeguard hangout. A sign outside read: ‘Ben would go. We love you. You will be missed.’ An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday. For his part, the elder Carlson takes some solace in that his son died doing what he loved most, and that he was a man of faith. ‘He's in paradise today - swimming with dolphins,’ he said.","Ben Carlson was pronounced dead July 6 after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours .

Police have charged 14 people with participating in a fraternity hazing incident that ended with a 19-year-old southwest Ohio college student having a . testicle surgically removed. Tyler Lawrence underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a knotted towel, severely damaging one testicle . Police made the arrests Thursday after an investigation into the Halloween incident at Wilmington College's Gamma Phi Gamma house. Court records said a fraternity pledge was injured when he was struck with a towel 'fashioned as a weapon.' Tyler Lawrence . underwent emergency surgery after students hit him in the groin with a . knotted towel on October 30, severely damaging one testicle. Jim Reynolds, president of the Quaker college of about 1,000 students southeast of Dayton, says the conduct is unacceptable. The fraternity has been kicked off campus until at least 2019 . The fraternity, which claims to have existed since 1907, appealed the ruling but the punishment was upheld. The Smoking Gun reported Lawrence was pledging to the Greek organization along with two other young men inside the Gamma Phi Gamma house, dubbed 'Gobbler House,' located off the Wilmington College campus, when he was injured. The trouble began when the students were . blindfolded and led down into the basement of 'Gobbler House,' which had . been filled with about three inches of water. They were then ordered to lie on the wet floor and pretend they were swimming. Afterwards, the men were instructed to remove all of their clothes except for the blindfold. As part of the initiation, the pledges had Limburger cheese stuffed into their mouths and were ordered to simulate a sexual act with a 'ball of stuffing' As . the students stood naked in the basement, one of the fraternity members . allegedly rubbed a substance similar to the muscle balm Icy Hot on . their nipples, backs, buttocks and scrotums.

"By . James  Nye . and Daily Mail Reporters . Pictures which V. Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City have been released on the same day a 40-year-old man was charged with attacking the 31-year-old who caused the downfall of LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Provided exclusively to MailOnline by her attorney Mac Nehoray, the images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face. In one photograph, taken after Sunday's alleged assault outside the Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin. In the other, which was presumably taken the day after, Stiviano's face seems to be painfully swollen, especially around her cheek. Shocking: These two images - taken on Sunday night and the next day - reveal what appears to be serious bruising and swelling suffered by V.Stiviano in the alleged racially motivated assault she suffered over the weekend in Manhattan . Dominick Diorio, 40, of Old Bethpage, New York, was originally charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, assault, harassment and aggravated harassment . The 40-year-old was arrested in connection with the incident involving V. Stiviano outside the Gansevoort Hotel, New York police said . Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible. Nehoray said Stiviano had been examined by a doctor after the incident, but found to be 'banged up but OK.' These . images were released on the same day that Dominick Diorio, 40, was . arrested at his home in Old Bethpage, New York, and charged with assault . as a hate crime, aggravated harassment and harassment for punching . Stiviano in the face outside the Gansevoort Hotel on Sunday. He . and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse during the attack, including the N-word, at . Stiviano after she left a restaurant with friends at around 6.40pm. The . second man has not been arrested. They apparently recognized Stiviano from her role in the recent NBA race scandal, which caused Sterling to sell the Clippers after she recorded him making bigoted comments about black people. New York Police Department Detective Brian Sessa told reporters that the investigation is still ongoing. Lifting the veil: Stiviano without a visor covering up her face after she showed the world what she said were photos taken after her assault in New York City . Healed? Here, Stiviano walks down the street while out shopping at Bloomingdale's in New York City. No remaining trace of the brutal attack appears to remain on her face . Complaint: Wearing a visor to cover her face, V. Stiviano arrives to a police station in downtown Manhattan to file a . police report for alleged assault by two men in New York City on Sunday . Diorio, who was in the city with his friend to celebrate his 40th birthday, allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort. According to Stiviano's legal team, she was struck by the two men while they screamed racist abuse as they left. 'Ms. V. Stiviano was attacked outside of Gansevoort Hotel by two white males,' a statement released by the law firm said. 'As Ms. Stiviano was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a f**** n**** b****. Donald Sterling pictured out shopping yesterday at the Grove in Hollywood, California . Shelly Sterling, wife to former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, stepped out for dinner at celebrity hotspot Craig's in west Hollywood last night . 'Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling 'I am going to slaughter you'. 'As the assault on Ms. Stiviano continued, some by-standers attacked the assailant. 'Ms. Stiviano was rushed away from the scene and was seen by a private physician upon her return to the hotel. 'She is badly bruised and swollen on the right side of her face and has some difficulty with her speech.' Reported: Stiviano spoke to detectives on Monday and told them the assault happened outside the Gansevoort Hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District on Sunday night . 'Punched': Stiviano, who recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball, was allegedly attacked . Diorio was reportedly injured by the passersby who jumped to Stiviano's aid and according to The New York Post was found by police sprawled on the floor, bleeding from a wound. They took him to hospital to treat his injuries on Sunday night, unaware at the time he was the man who allegedly struck Stiviano. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had said yesterday his officers had not received any reports of an alleged attack against Stiviano. Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report, officers had not been investigating the fight. But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police. He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday. Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock. 'Wow, I'am not going to tell my wife about this. That'll just upset her. I don't know what to do.' Stiviano's attorneys Alaleh Kamran and Mac Nehoray expressed their gratitude to the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force on Tuesday evening and said that their client met with the Assistant District Attorney and answered additional questions. Hurt: Stiviano (pictured at LAX on Saturday) claimed she was . in New York to appear on Anderson Cooper's CNN show on Monday night . when she was allegedly targeted in a racist attack - she did not appear on CNN on Monday night . Recorded: Donald Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers . Earlier her attorneys said they are examining surveillance video of the alleged attack. 'We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,' her lawyer's office said in a statement. 'In addition, several witnesses have come forward with relevant and critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and the identity of the assailants.' Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball. He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month. However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it. Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.","Photographs reveal what appears to be significant bruising around the right side of V. Stiviano's face .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Michael Sam has revealed that his hugely publicized coming out in February wasn't really the way he wanted things to go down. The NFL's first openly gay player tells People that he actually wanted to wait until he was drafted and in the pros to make the historic announcement. 'When I came out in February, it actually wasn't the time I wanted to come out. I was going to come out to my team – whoever drafted me,' said the newly-minted St. Louis Ram. Planned to wait for the pros: The NFL's first openly gay player Michael Sam revealed to People magazine that he never planned to come out in February, but tipped off reporters eager to break the news eventually helped coax him to do so . Waited to experiment: Sam, seen here Tuesday at his first press event after being drafted, has now also revealed that though he's had feelings toward males since 7th grade, he didn't act on them until college . The 24-year-old defensive end made headlines then and has again returned to the media center stage after being drafted May 10 into the big leagues. The Rams, of course, knew he was gay and it's all because of the media. But not in the why one might think. 'I did it because when I participated in the Senior Bowl, I was surprised how many people in the media knew,' he told People. 'Everyone who did an interview with me said, ""Okay, we know you're gay, can we break the story?"" So I said okay, and I called my agent. Sam chalks the rest up to history, but it could have all gone down much differently, and less controlled, had it not been for his University of Missouri teammates. 'They knew they could tell whoever they wanted to, but they didn't,' said Sam, who came out to his fellow Tigers last fall. 'They kept it secret. They didn't have to. I was out. I did my own thing. I had my boyfriend.' Sam revealed to People that he's known he was attracted to men his whole adult life, but didn't act on those feelings until more recently. 'I always knew I was different. I knew I had a male attraction probably in 7th grade,' he said. 'But I didn't act upon it. I didn't act upon it in high school. But college was different. College is all about experimenting. I did, and then I was like, ""This is who I am.""' Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano famously shared a kiss--and a messy piece of cake--on national television Saturday in a photo that will no doubt go down in NFL history. The draft turned Sam into an instant celebrity across the U.S. and especially within the LGBT community. At his first Rams press conference on Tuesday, Sam reacted to hearing a story about a son who was able to finally come out to his father after being inspired by the football player's story. The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news and would soon share a kiss that made pro sports history . Celebration: Michael Sam and boyfriend Vito Cammisano kiss after Sam smashed cake into his face . 'I'm honored that I helped someone be comfortable with who they are, gave him a little courage to deal with his father. I'm honored to have that happen to his son,' Sam said. 'But right now I'm just looking forward to continuing on my dream. If it inspires other people, hey, I'm with you. Anyone that's not OK with that, if someone disowns you, be a part of my family. I welcome you. Ram up!' Sam graduated of the University of Missouri and was selected in the seventh round of the draft. A father posted the heartwarming tale of his son's coming out on the university's Facebook page after. The man says he was watching the draft with his son and other family members, who are mostly military veterans. 'When Michael Sam was finally drafted my . 15 year old son started crying and told me he was gay. He said he didn't . want to hide anymore or be embarrassed about who he was. Thank you . Mizzou for embracing Mr. Sam and recruiting a young man of his caliber . so that kids like my son have more positive role models to look to...' Thanked his teammates: Sam told People he's thankful for his teammates' respectfulness after they kept quiet after he came out to them last fall . In demand: A Michael Sam jersey became available just hours after the 24-year-old became the first openly gay player in the NFL and has since become the second best selling jersey of the NFL draft picks after Manziel . At the press conference on Tuesday, Sam said he was thankful to have been drafted, especially just to a team located just two hours from his alma mater. 'St Louis feels just like home,' he said. 'I still [don't] really feel like I’m part of the NFL right now. I'm blessed.' When asked what it felt like to be the first gay man hired in the NFL, Sam said: 'I guess it's great.' He apperaed with five other late-round draft picks for the press conference on Tuesday. After about 20 minutes, the other players left and Sam answered questions solo. He says he hopes his landmark drafting will let other people know 'It's OK to be who you are.' 'Whether you're gay, straight, black or white. It's OK to be comfortable in your own skin,' he said.","The NFL's first openly gay player was helped out of the closet by reporters who knew about his orientation and begged to break the story .
Last fall Sam told his Missouri teammates who, he told People, 'could tell whoever they wanted to, but they didn't'
The 24-year-old revealed he knew he was attracted to men for years, but in college he experimented and discovered 'this is who I am'
At his first press event Monday, Sam said it's 'great' to be the first openly-gay man drafted but is now turning his attention to training ."
"By . Leon Watson . Smiling happily on her wedding day, Nicole Reyes went from the picture of happiness to a gaunt prisoner on the day she was released from a Dominican Republic jail. Today the British mother's family, from Cardiff, south Wales, told of their tearful reunion after they scraped the cash together to allow her to jump bail back to the UK. The 38-year-old was given a 12-year sentence in February for killing her husband Jorge, 37, who died in July 2012. Her family managed to raise the £62,000 needed to pay her bail and four weeks ago the authorities on the Caribbean island freed her without confiscating her passport. Nicole Reyes on her wedding day with Jorge in the Dominican Republic in 2007 (left) and on the day she was released from prison (right) Mrs Reyes was kept safely in a house by a Dominican family while it was arranged for her to fly home. A photo of Mrs Reyes taken on the day she was released from prison shows how the ordeal has taken its toll on the former travel rep, who has suffered serious health problems during her time in jail. Her family have campaigned tirelessly for her release and yesterday was the day they had been waiting for as she arrived back on British soil. Mrs Reyes's parents Jeannette and Mike Clements flew out to accompany her home, where her children Leah, 18, and Luke, 17, were waiting when she arrived in the early hours of yesterday. Mrs Reyes remains on bail, but after arriving home she and her family believe her ordeal is over. Mrs Clements, 62, said: 'We scraped the bail money together from wherever we could. Nothing mattered as much as getting Nicole home. When we had the £62,000 we sent it over to our lawyer. Mrs Reyes' family in Britain raised the £62,000 needed for her to be released on bail . 'We waited for news and then finally heard that Nicole was free. She was taken to a house in the Dominican Republic while we organised her a flight out of there. She just had to give an address.' Mrs Clements said: 'We got her through the door after midnight on Sunday and drank champagne together and cried tears of relief. I could hardly take it in, I still can't get my head around it.' She said they didn't tell anyone the news until they stepped off the plane. Mrs Clements said: 'When we stepped out of Heathrow that was when I had the sigh of relief. 'I think when we got there and my friend picked us up and I thought 'wow, we're on the way back to the house'. 'I didn't let anybody know until we got off the plane. It still didn't hit home. I'm still expecting the phone call from her at the prison at 4pm or 8pm, as she did every day.' Nicole Reyes and Jorge Quintanilla, 37, were driving home from a meal separately when she hit his motorbike with her 4x4 last July . Nicole's mother Jeannette Clements said her daughter and Jorge Reyes were very much in love . The family spent the day together yesterday at their home in Rumney, where Mrs Reyes was able to meet her 10-month-old grandson Antonio for the first time. Mrs Clements said: 'Every time we pass each other in the house we hug each other or kiss each other. She's had quite a few tears, her emotions are all over the place. I really think she's going to need counselling.' She added: 'All I was concerned about was her health, because she was very poorly even when we were travelling. She said to me 'Mum I thought I was going to die.' 'Nicole is trying to feel like she's back home but I am very concerned about her health and we're going to get her to the doctors.' She said their focus now is getting Nicole well again. Her mother said: 'Two weeks ago she was curled up in a ball, crying to me that she thought she was going to die. 'Now she is home we can get her the medical attention she has been so desperate for. I can't tell you what it means to me that she is back where she belongs. 'We are all walking around dazed, it feels like a miracle after the journey we've had.' Sadly, Mrs Reyes' grandmother Audrey was not around to see the moment. Her dying wish was to see Mrs Reyes at her bedside, but she died in December while her granddaughter was still in prison. The mother-of-two was being held at this prison in the Dominican Republic, where she spent two years before being released . Mrs Reyes mother Jeannette Clements, right, has campaigned to bring her daughter home. She is pictured with and Leah Jackson, Mrs Reyes' and her young son Antonio . Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job. She lived in this house with her husband Jorge . Mrs Clements said: 'I would have loved my mum to be here. My mum lived for this day.' Mrs Reyes first went to the Dominican Republic on holiday and later took a holiday rep job with Thomas Cook, where she met Jorge. The couple married in 2007 and Mrs Clements said they were very much in love. But in July 2012, Mrs Reyes was accused of deliberately running over her husband in her SUV as he rode beside her on a motorbike. Police arrived on the scene and told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital, but they took her to a prison where she stayed for nearly two years. Since then, she and her family have endured the wait of several adjourned court hearings. Her parents claimed they also received death threats. Mrs Reyes, who has always maintained that her husband's death was a tragic accident, was initially warned she could face up to 30 years in jail. She appeared in court for a two-and-a-half hour trial in February where the charge was reduced to voluntary manslaughter and she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Cardiff South and Penarth MP Steven Doughty raised concerns at the time of the length of the trial and Mrs Clements yesterday thanked him and his office for their help. Mr Doughty said: 'My main concern at all stages has been the fairness and conduct of the judicial process in the Dominican Republic, Nicole's health, and her treatment in prison. 'I have had serious concerns at all stages about the conduct of the judicial process in the Dominican Republic and whether Nicole would receive a fair trial.' He said: 'In the end the family have been able to pay bail and remove Nicole from the Dominican Republic without restriction and it is now for them to assess her legal situation with their lawyers. 'Most importantly, though, Nicole is now out of prison, able to access the health care she clearly needs and which has not been provided at many stages in prison in the Dominican Republic.' A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that a British National has been released from prison in the Dominican Republic pending a further appeal. We continue to provide consular assistance.'","Nicole Reyes was pictured on the day she was released from prison .

The 28-year-old Twilight star, singer and all-round funny-girl, says the last time she recalls being hit on was around the time she played her Oscar-nominated role opposite George Clooney in Up in the Air, when she was 23. A modest Miss Kendrick, who covers ELLE's July issue, also downplays her natural good looks, telling the magazine: 'I’m lucky that I’ve never had a crisis about whether the only reason I’m successful is because I’m crazy hot.'

Miss Kendrick ended her four-year relationship with director and producer Edgar Wright last year, and hasn't publicly dated anyone since. The star also opens up about emerging as a woman late in her teens. 'When I was a teenager, I was an ultra-late bloomer, and my mom would say it was a blessing, because it means you never have to wonder if guys are only interested in you because you’ve got boobs,' she tells the publication.

'I hate when people think you're broken because your parents are divorced,' she remarks. 'And I really reject the idea of staying together for the kids.

Breck's mother Lorin LaFave revealed . last night that she complained to Surrey Police in December that a man . was trying to 'control' her son online. Miss LaFave said: 'The problem was the predator who was trying to . control his ideology about religion, government, family, education. Schoolboy: Breck Bednar who died after allegedly going to meet someone he had got talking to online . 'Breck . looked up to him because of his interesting manner and computer skills. Breck couldn't see the bad and when I pointed out his obvious lies, . they were overlooked by Breck and his friends.' Surrey Police said the case has been . referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because of . 'recent contact' with the family. In a statement the force said: . 'Surrey Police is working with Essex Police following the tragic death . of a 14-year-old boy from Caterham in Grays, Essex on Monday. 'Due to recent contact Surrey Police had with the victim's . family the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints . Commission (IPCC). 'The previous contact relates to a report by a . relative in December 2013 regarding online activity.' Vicar Jerry Garton said at a service at St John the Evangelist church in Caterham that the community is in 'complete shock'. After the service Rev Garton added: 'It has been a very difficult time for the family. I have been with them for the past week offering everything we can. 'The family are obviously distraught and trying to come to terms with what has happened. They are all regulars at the church, and the congregation are in shock. 'The community has been really shaken up by what has happened. With regard to the rest of the investigation, we don't know exactly what happened.' Lewis Daynes, an 18-year-old computer engineer, appeared in court yesterday charged with murder, and was remanded in custody. He is due to appear before Chelmsford Crown Court today. Breck’s . cousin Tanner Barth said he was ‘addicted’ to video games and had . stopped going to church and turned against his parents after meeting a . man on the internet. He said that Breck was an ‘incredibly smart, funny, and cute 14-year-old boy’, before adding: ‘Despite this it was very difficult for him to make friends and he would often avoid social interaction. ‘So, like myself and many others he turned to his computer and the internet for entertainment. ‘He loved to play video games and may have even been a bit addicted to them. He ended up meeting someone who he thought wanted to be his friend. ‘Soon a man began telling him that his parents hated him, and that God isn’t real, and that he shouldn’t go to church. Friends of 14-year-old schoolboy Breck Bednar told yesterday how he would spend hours speaking to online ‘friends’ – often late at night – who he had never met in real life. As they played videogames on the internet, they would use a computer program called Teamspeak 3 to chat to each other. The software allows computer users to make free calls over the internet in a similar way to a conference call. Users often wear a headset with an integrated microphone so they can talk as they play online with several other gamers. Private chat channels can also be set up by groups which are accessed by invitation only. Teamspeak is free to use but there is a fee if someone wants to block other users from joining in. Breck is thought to have been a keen player of violent videogame Battlefield 4, which thousands of teenagers play online. Last night Hannah Broadbent, of online protection charity Childnet, said: ‘Young people should bear in mind that it’s not always easy to spot a groomer. 'Often they might be chatting about things you are interested in and you might not realise. You can never be completely sure that a person is who they say they are on the internet. ‘The most important thing is that young people can tell someone if someone makes them feel uncomfortable online. ‘And never meet up in person or share any personal information. If they are contacted by someone who makes them feel uncomfortable it’s important to report it. ‘It’s really important that we educate young people so they know how to navigate the risks.’ Probe: A forensics officer can be seen entering the flats in Grays, Essex, yesterday where the 14-year-old schoolboy was found seriously injured on Monday. He later died . Probe: A forensics officer is seen in Grays, Essex, yesterday as police carry out a murder investigation . ‘Breck became distant, stopped going to church and quit his extracurricular [activities] altogether. ‘They tried talking to him and helping him to no avail. ‘Two nights ago, Breck told his father that he was going to his friend’s house for a sleepover a couple of blocks away. ‘He ended up taking a train down to Essex, about two hours away to meet a man he had been talking to over the internet. ‘Early the next morning, the police found his body.’ Breck’s aunt Lisa Barth described the boy as ‘absolutely wonderful’ and said his death was a ‘senseless, disgusting tragedy’. And Christopher Curtis, headmaster of St Bede’s School, a Christian comprehensive in Redhill, Surrey, where Breck went to school, said: ‘Breck was a bright and hard-working student who was a real pleasure to teach. ‘His tutor describes him as a model student. A conscientious young man with a great deal  of potential.’ 'Murder': Breck Bednar is thought to have travelled from his home in Caterham, Surrey, to Grays, Essex . It is understood the schoolboy was part of a gaming group run by Daynes called FEP squad, which had around eight members, all thought to be around age 14, and some of whom had never met  in person. Eventually almost all the members left and joined a different group, but Breck stayed. Yesterday neighbours described how an ashen-faced teenage boy was led away from the Essex flat where Breck was found after arriving on Sunday night in a taxi. They described Daynes as an ‘extremely quiet’ loner who moved into the property 18 months ago with the help of his grandparents, who paid for his rent and bills. Chris Curtis, headteacher of St Bede's . School where Breck was a pupil, said they had been devastated by the 'awful news' of the . Year 10 pupil's death. He added: 'Breck was a bright and hard working student who teachers describe as a real pleasure to teach.

"By . Wendy Leigh . Wendy Leigh (pictured) has struggled with the lack of affection shown to her by her father . Perched on the edge of my father’s deathbed during the last moments of his life, I hoped I could finally find some peace. After a lifetime where I’d felt anything but cherished by him, I thought this might be his moment to make amends for all those years of emotional neglect. ‘Is there anything you would like to say to me?’ I asked, pressing a notebook and pen into his hand as throat cancer had robbed him of his ability to speak. My 75-year-old father, Paul, started scrawling onto the lined paper and I held my breath. Perhaps, after years of longing, this would be the moment when he would tell me how proud he was of me and how much he loved me. Instead, when I read his final words, my heart sank. It wasn’t a message for me,  his 41-year-old daughter, but for his 27-year-old girlfriend of two years who lived  in Thailand. He wanted me to tell her that he loved her and would watch over her for ever. I don’t know why I had expected anything different. Hurt as I was, I went downstairs to the telephone box, called my father’s girlfriend and relayed his last loving words to her. Words which I had for my entire life longed for him to say to me. Even at the end, my father refused to dole out any love or praise to me. His third cousin, the late artist Lucian Freud, once described himself as: ‘A selfish man who only does  what pleases me.’ My father was exactly the same. It’s little wonder that Emma Thompson’s recent confession that her mother didn’t applaud her for her brilliant acting career, and only praised her once, really resonated with me. Only in my case, it was my father, not my mother, who consistently refused to acknowledge any of  my virtues. Like so many men born in the early 20th century, his inability to praise or encourage could have been a symptom of the post-war era in which tough love reigned supreme. But I’m not about to defend  him. Growing up without a single word of praise from your father  is tough. Until the age of six, I had been daddy’s girl, my father had doted on me, photographed me constantly, and, in his Viennese accent, dubbed me his ‘Pitzly’, German for ‘little thing’. But then I developed buck teeth and became fat and ungainly and, quite simply, my father lost interest in me. Cold: Wendy with her father Paul . Around the same time that Wendy's father (pictured) lost interest in her, he began having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to Wendy's mother, Marion . It was around this time that he went off on his own adventures, having extra-marital affairs with an assortment of women and making a mockery of his marriage to my mother, Marion. The import and export business he and my mother owned was doing well, so there was enough money to send me to drama school when I was nine years old. When I bounced home every night, reciting reams of A Midsummer Night’s Dream by heart, my mother applauded enthusiastically while my father couldn’t have cared less. He watched, wordless, his face impassive. Throughout my entire schooling, he never once came to speech day or my end-of-term play.When I started to blossom into womanhood, my mother was quick with the compliments. She told me what good skin I had, how pretty my eyes were, how glossy my hair was. By now, after a 16-year marriage, my parents had divorced. My mother, though still in love with my father, could no longer grapple with the pain of his infidelity. An inability to show love can be a symptom of narcissistic personality disorder . And while I still longed for his approval, I knew that the chances of getting it were remote and so I avoided him as much as possible, rarely spending time with him and his new wife, a blonde actress who was 25 to his 40. On one of those rare occasions, out of the blue, he said: ‘Your stepmother has a better figure than you.’ Then, for good measure: ‘And your mother is prettier too.’ Why he would want to compare me to my mother or his second wife was utterly incomprehensible, but it cut through me like a knife. He never recognised my professional successes, either. When, at 20, my first article was published, I proudly showed it to him, only for him to cast it aside with the words, ‘It’s good, but I could do better’.His comment stung then, and still resonates to this day. Despite having had 14 books published since, never hearing  my father say ‘well done’ or ‘I’m proud of you’ still leaves me with a gaping hole in my heart. It was no coincidence that, aged 16, I fixed on a man of 38 as my first great love. But while he gave me my first kiss, he ultimately rejected me, and I was bereft. Consequently I didn’t look to men for reinforcement, kindness or praise, or live my life waiting for Prince Charming to save me. Wendy's parents: Divorced after 16 years of marriage, Marion, Wendy's mother, still struggled with her now ex-husband's infidelity. Pictured: Wendy's parents . Instead, I carved out my own existence and lived my life as my own woman, strong and independent, determined to follow my own destiny rather than merely be the frame to some man’s picture. My father was not  so cruel to my six  sisters, five of whom  he had with two different women and who were a good deal younger than me. I think he had grown up by the time  they arrived and was  more warm and loving  with them. Yet he still seemed to encourage us to compete with one another for his affections. In fact, it was only after his death that I grew close to my three eldest  half-sisters, Nancy, Bridie  and Sadie. Today I like, love and respect all three of them, and cherish our times together, but I am still bitter that by trying to pit us against one another, my father deprived me of the happiness of growing up with my sisters, and having them in my life through the years. Until the age of six, Wendy was a real daddy's girl. Pictured: Wendy as a child with her father . When Wendy developed buck teeth and became fat and ungainly, her father lost interest in her. Pictured: Wendy as a child with her parents . On his deathbed in London’s St Thomas’s hospital in 1997, with all of us gathered around him,  he pointed to each of us in turn, explaining what he thought of us, saying one was pretty, another clever, a third funny. And me? ‘She’s nothing,’ he said. Even at the end, he reserved the cruellest blow for me, his eldest daughter. I never did understand what prompted such deep disdain. When I asked my mother, quick as a flash she said: ‘Deep down, he was still a child, and was jealous and competitive and wanted all the praise for himself.’ The end result was that he just couldn’t bring himself to give me the praise and love for which I longed. By withholding it, he remained in control and that, above all, mattered to him. The very last time I saw him in hospital, too weak to reach into his bedside drawer, he asked me to get something for him. As I did, I saw a copy of the magazine in which I had published an article. It was dog-eared and well thumbed. Just as I lifted it out, my father’s nurse appeared. ‘Oh, you’re the writer,’ she said. ‘Your father is always talking about you. He’s so proud of you.’As my eyes filled with tears, I turned to my father, but he looked away and said nothing.","Wendy had a good relationship with her father until she was six .

A 68-year old resident of a Sumpter County, Florida 55-and-over retirement community was arrested along with her much younger toyboy, 49, for allegedly having drunken sex in the the community's town square. Residents of Lake Sumter Landing, one of the squares in the retirement community, called police and reported seeing Margaret Ann Klemm, 68, and David Bobilya, 49, engaging in sexual intercourse at 10:30 PM on June 2. The Smoking Gun reports that when investigators arrived at the scene, Klemm had her shirt pulled down and wasn't wearing any pants.

David Bobilya, 49, was arrested along with Klemm for allegedly having sex in public . Bobilya's pants and underwear were pulled down all the way to his ankles. Police say that Klemm and Bobilya both seemed to be intoxicated but that they followed police officers' orders and put their clothing back on. Both face charges for public intoxication and indecent exposure. Klemm and Bobilya both were booked and jail on misdemeanor counts but were released on $1500 bail. Just four days before the alleged public sex romp, Klemm finished settling a prior criminal case. Back in April Klemm pleaded guilty to a DUI charge after she was caught drunk driving in a golf cart. The Smoking Gun reports that The Villages retirement community calls itself 'Florida's Friendliest Retirement Hometown.' Residents are not permitted to engage in 'friendly' naked behavior in public, however.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . An architect's plan to shoot-up the upscale New York design firm where he worked 'because he was getting fired' was halted by a fellow employee who says she saw him make a map of potential victims and heard him make threats. Kon Jang, 35, was arrested on May 29 after he allegedly schemed to shoot employees at the CentraRuddy design firm in Soho after they planned to fire him for his mercurial temperament and 'erratic' behavior. Jang, described as a 'loner', failed to keep his plan secret to a female employee deemed 'his only friend' at the firm. Kon Jang, 35, allegedly planned to shoot his coworkers at the upscale New York design firm that was going to fire him for his 'erratic' behavior . He allegedly told her that he had a gun and that he planned to execute a mass shooting at the office. He showed her a map that had red 'Xs' where his co-workers sat. On her desk and his he apparently put a circle. The Post reports that Jang also told coworkers, 'I’m going to come back here and you are going to get it.' He allegedly told his one female confidant that he 'wanted to be on the news' and that he was planning a 'tragedy.' He also allegedly told the woman that he was going to warn her not to come to work the day of the shooting. The woman says he probed her for information about when the next meeting would be 'where everyone would be together.' The design firm CentraRuddy is located on Broadway in the upscale neighborhood of Soho in Manhattan . He reportedly said he'd 'stay quiet until then.' When police went to Jang's home in Wood-Ridge, NJ on May 29 they arrested him on harassment charges and say that they found 'what appears to be an assault rifle and rounds of fake ammunition.' It's unclear as to whether or not he knew his ammunition was fake. Jang is being held on $10,000 bail. He surrendered his passport on May 30 and his next court apperance is on June 16. 'He was very quiet. I never saw anything, I never would have guessed,' said a woman who works at CetraRuddy to the post. Jang is 'no longer with the firm,' said another employee. According to his LinkedIn profile, Jang had been employed by CentraRuddy since February of last year. He studied at prestigious universities like University of The Arts London, Pratt, and The Rhode Island School of Design. His design website Konidesign.com shows projects he worked on in New York, Boston, Portland, and Providence.","Kon Jang, 35, was arrested on May 29 after he allegedly planned to shoot employees at the CentraRuddy design firm in Soho .

"By . Simon Murphy . The Taxpayers' Alliance said taxes were for essential services, not 'so civil servants can hum along to Miley Cyrus' Taxpayers are footing a bill of nearly £1 million so that civil servants can listen to the radio at work. Government departments and quangos have been using public money to pay music royalties to allow staff to listen to music in the office. Some have paid royalties for the banal music played when callers ring switchboards and are put on hold – even though royalty-free music is available. Since 2009, £848,904 has been spent, according to figures uncovered by The Mail on Sunday using Freedom of Information laws. For any workplace where music is played, a licence must be obtained from both the PRS, which collects royalties on behalf of songwriters, and the PPL, which covers both artists and record labels. Last night, John O’Connell, director of Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People will be furious that their cash is being wasted on listening to the radio and hold music. Taxes are for essential services, not so civil servants can hum along to Miley Cyrus. Hold music drives people up the wall – if they knew they were paying for it they’d be even angrier.’ The highest spender is the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The agency has paid out an £552,012 in royalties since 2009 so the radio can be played in its 299 driving test centres, 87 testing stations and one enforcement office. Another big spender is Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, which has paid out £141,632.81 since 2009 for hold music, but says it will cut the bill. Media watchdog Ofcom, which has paid £38,655.57 over the same period, switched to royalty-free music last year, reducing its spend to £681. Since 2009, the Ministry of Defence has paid £73,852.44 in royalties, the Home Office has spent £22,153.26 since 2010, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has paid £9,076.34 since 2009, and Ofgem has splashed £8,410.36 since 2009. A DVSA spokesman said: ‘Listening to the radio helps to keep our examiners up to date with local news, traffic and weather conditions, which can all affect the delivery of our services. It also gives driving test candidates a more relaxing environment in which to wait.’","Taxpayers footing bill of nearly £1 million for civil servants' radio royalties .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Michael Sam just got into the NFL, and now he's landed his own TV deal. The first-openly gay football player to be selected in the draft will be the focus of a new multi-part documentary series to air on Oprah's OWN network, produced by the same crew that filmed Lindsay Lohan's reality show. 'We are honored that Michael is trusting us with his private journey in this moment that has not only made history but will shape it forever,' Oprah Winfrey said in a statement. Scroll down for video . From the football field to Hollywood: Michael Sam, the first openly-gay man to be drafted into the NFL, will be the star of his own reality TV show, Oprah Winfrey announced Wednesday . Cameras are rolling: The show has reportedly already started filming and crews were in the room when Sam got the call that he had been drafted and kissed his boyfriend in celebration . From the people that brought you 'Lindsay': The documentary series is being filmed by the same crew that followed Lindsay Lohan for her OWN reality show . 'I am proud of the focus on authentic storytelling in our new documentary series format. The next real-life story we follow in ‘The Untitled Michael Sam Project’ promises to spark valuable, important discussion on life in America today. Acceptance and illumination start here,' Winfrey added. The announcement was somewhat surprising since Sam said at a press conference yesterday that he just wants to focus on training. When asked what it felt like to the the first openly-gay draftee, Sam said simple: 'I guess it's great.' 'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added. Shooting has already begun on the as-yet untitled project, but it's uncertain how much access the NFL and Rams will grant them now that Sam is in training. The series will follow Sam as he trains to make the St Louis Rams 53-man roster for next season - which will not be without challenge. Spotlight: Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano celebrated his drafting in Las Vegas this weekend. He has since flown to St Louis to begin training. It's unclear how much access the crews will be granted by the NFL or Rams . Sam was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year during his time at the University of Missouri, but is considered too small to be a defensive end in the league at six-foot-two and 261 pounds. Most likely, he'll have to focus on learning a new position if he wants to make the team for the season. But in a Tuesday press conference, Sam said the attention he's received will only help his training. 'Thank God for you guys making this all a big deal, because it’s just going to make me a better player than I am now,' Sam said.

"By . Simon Murphy . MPs were facing a new backlash over expenses last night after it emerged they have been making claims for designer spectacles worth hundreds of pounds. Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, along with Government and Shadow Ministers, are among those who have made claims for glasses at the taxpayers’ expense. One MP even submitted a receipt for a pair worth £354. More than two dozen MPs have made claims for spectacles over the past four years, totalling more than £5,400. Expensive: Communities and Local Government Minister Stephen Williams, who sits on the expenses committee, £319.50 for an employee's specs . The politicians made the claims on behalf of their staff, in line with Revenue & Customs guidance, which states that employers should make a contribution towards the cost of spectacles where their employees use computer screens. But one Tory MP, Glyn Davies, submitted receipts for his own glasses. The Welsh MP made five claims, totalling £370. Last night he said: ‘Two are mine and the other three are for staff. I think it’s fair.’ The claims, logged with the Independent Parliament Standards Authority (IPSA), show MPs are regularly reimbursed for staff spectacles worth more than £100. Specsavers’ cheapest pair, including frames and lenses, cost just £25. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that politicians were claiming for cycling mileage. Last night, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, Jonathan Isaby, said: ‘It’s totally unacceptable that anyone is demanding the unwitting taxpayer pay for designer frames.’ Taxpayers' money: Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley is one of more than two dozen MPs who have claimed $5,400 for spectacles in the past four years . Mr Lansley, who was sacked as Health Secretary in 2012 and is now Leader of the House of Commons, claimed £229 for ‘prescription glasses and eye test costs’ for an employee last year. Communities and Local Government Minister Stephen Williams, who sits on the expenses committee, claimed £319.50 and Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed made one claim worth £165. Conservative MP Fiona Bruce claimed the most, submitting receipts for £629. She said: ‘My overall expense claims are very  low, but I take staff welfare issues very seriously.’ But Tory MP James Duddridge, who claimed £354, said: ‘This isn’t an employee buying an expensive frame, it’s a complex prescription which costs a lot of money.’ Labour MP Alan Whitehead, who made claims of £224 and £207,  said: ‘There is nothing wrong whatsoever with those claims. ‘I personally take my staff’s welfare reasonably seriously.’ Tory MP Nick de Bois, who made claims for £200 and £119, said: ‘Two of my staff suffered eye problems as a result of jobs which involve a lot of computer use. I didn’t think it fair to make them pay for the right lenses and frames for this. I won’t ever cut corners with the wellbeing of my employees.’ When asked if staff should have chosen cheaper models, Labour MP Roger Godsiff, who claimed £138.70 and £129, said: ‘IPSA run a very tight regime and they lay down the guidelines. ‘I suppose you could still go and get an original pair of NHS spectacles with the wire issued in 1948.  I suppose that’s possible.’","A number of MPs have used taxpayers money to pay for glasses .

"By . Simon Murphy . and Glen Owen . Vince Cable held a secret ‘ski summit’ in the French Alps with a long-term ally who has called for Nick Clegg to be replaced as the Liberal Democrat leader. Mr Cable was spotted at the exclusive resort of Courchevel enjoying a £3,000 break with Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, who is widely regarded in Westminster as the unofficial ‘campaign chief’ for the 70-year-old Cabinet Minister. The Alpine get-together is bound to reignite speculation about the Business Secretary’s undimmed ambition to succeed Mr Clegg as leader if the party performs poorly in next year’s Election. Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) held a secret 'ski summit' in the French Alps with his long-term ally, Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott (right) who has called for Nick Clegg to be replaced as leader of the party . Mr Cable, who was accompanied by his wife, Rachel, spent the week in a £410-a-night suite at Les Ducs De Savoie Hotel, which boasts a swimming pool, jacuzzi and a gym as well as direct access to the slopes. Former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott was seen there huddled in conversation with Mr and Mrs Cable. The Cabinet Minister was forced to distance himself from Lord Oakeshott last September after he said Mr Clegg’s ratings were ‘very poor and have been for a long time’ – the latest in a long line of his anti-Clegg interventions. He added: ‘We need to face facts, there’s quite a lot of complacency going on and self-delusion going on. We are likely to lose seats.’ Lord Oakeshott then compared the Deputy Prime Minister to Michael Foot – the former Labour leader who led his party to a crushing General Election defeat in 1983. The Alpine get-together in the French resort of Courcheval is likely to reignite speculation about the Business Secretary's undimmed ambition to succeed Mr Clegg as leader if the party performs poorly at next year's election . During the interview, he also indicated that Mr Cable would be the best candidate to take over as leader. Mr Cable claimed at the time that he found the remarks ‘seriously unhelpful’, while Mr Clegg said the peer appeared ‘like clockwork’ every year to make similar criticisms. He added: ‘When it’s conference and the weather turns bad, up pops Matthew Oakeshott with some disobliging remarks about me.’ Lord Oakeshott compared Mr Clegg to Michael Foot - the former Labour leader who led his party to a crushing General Election defeat in 1983 . Courchevel is part of the Three Valleys, which is the  largest ski complex in the world. It is a hotspot for celebrities and Royals, including Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, who holidayed there in 2010. The resort, which is popular with wealthy Russians, is full of Michelin-star restaurants and designer shops. Chancellor George Osborne found himself facing criticism three years ago when he took his family on an £11,000 ski trip to Switzerland after telling the public that ‘we’re all in this together’. But Mr Cable took time out of his own skiing break to urge the Chancellor to introduce a VAT cut for homeowners trying to repair flood damage. The move, which could cost the Treasury £150 million, was viewed as another attempt by the Lib Dems to distance themselves from their Coalition partners as next year’s Election draws closer. Last night Mr Cable went out of his way to stress that Lord Oakeshott was with him on the skiing trip as an old friend – not as his political spokesman. Mr Cable said: ‘There’s a lot of difference between expressing distinct political views and personal friendships which go back for many years.’ He added that as well as Lord Oakeshott and his wife, the skiing party also included Lib Dem peer Lord Strasburger and ‘other people’. Later, aides for Mr Cable insisted that ‘Matthew does not speak for Vince’ and said Mr Cable had met the costs of his holiday out of his own pocket.","Vince Cable met with Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott in Courcheval, France .

"By . Simon Murphy . Watches by Baume et Mercier (example pictured) and Givenchy, which can be worth as much as £3,000, are among items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office . Luxury watches and jewellery given as gifts to ambassadors and their staff are being auctioned off for a fraction of their original value. Watches by Baume et Mercier and Givenchy, which can be worth as much as £3,000, are among items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office. The Mail on Sunday has obtained a list of auctioned gifts, which includes bracelets, a gold coin, Mont Blanc pens, prayer beads, cufflinks, candle sticks, a blanket, a tie, earrings and even a 3G mobile device. In two years the Government has taken . in £10,401.66 at Birmingham auction house Fellows. The buyers are not . aware they are bidding on diplomatic gifts and any inscriptions are . removed. Watches sold by the FCO fetched anywhere between £800 and just £18. A watch and bracelet set sold for just £20. Geoff . Whitefield, of Fellows, said: ‘A watch that might be worth £2,000 or . £3,000 could sell for less than a third of that at open market. ‘It’s a bit like buying a brand new car – the minute you drive it off the forecourt you’re taking first hit depreciation.’ Though . the FCO refused to say which countries’ presents it had sold, a Freedom . of Information request revealed it has received tens of thousands of . pounds’ worth of gifts from regimes such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and . Burma in the past three years. The FCO said the watches were worn for a short time to avoid causing offence and then sent back to the UK. If staff want to keep gifts worth more than £140 they must pay the difference themselves. Last night, Labour MP Andy Slaughter said: ‘This seems terribly two-faced that they’re prepared to accept lavish gifts from disreputable regimes but then flog them off quietly.’ Mont Blanc pens were included in the list of items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office . The list also includes cufflinks, candle sticks, a blanket, a tie, earrings and even a 3G mobile device .","Watches by Baume et Mercier and Givenchy, which can be worth £3,000, are among the items accepted by diplomats abroad and then sold .

"By . Simon Murphy . Figures reveal the corporation spent almost £2.5million on all-access tours but only made £1.2million back . The BBC is losing £600,000 of licence-fee payers’ cash every year running ‘vanity tours’ of its studios. The tours are held at several BBC sites across the UK and cost between £9 and £13.50. They offer visitors ‘behind-the-scenes’ access to programmes including Dragons’ Den and Match Of The Day. But in just two years the BBC has lost £1.2 million running the tours, according to details obtained under Freedom of Information laws. The broadcaster has earned £1,231,912 income from the tours but has forked out almost £2.5 million on running costs. The popularity of tours differs vastly between different BBC buildings. Only 18 people attended a tour of the BBC’s Cardiff studios in 2011/12. Last night, Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tickets to tour the broadcaster shouldn’t be subsidised by the licence fee. 'Reducing the cost of taking visitors around the Beeb would mean more of the licence fee available for a better deal for all involved.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We know from feedback that visitors to the BBC enjoy our tours immensely. 'As the tours develop, and ticket income increases, we’ll ensure they provide the best value for money.’ The figures come just weeks after a report revealed BBC bosses lost £100million on a failed IT project. The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was called off in May after the BBC admitted that to continue would be ‘throwing good money after bad’. The number of visitors going behind the scenes of shows like Dragon's Den has been lower than expected . A review carried out by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed eight separate management boards were in charge of the project but none realised it was failing until it was too late. Launched in 2008, the DMI was intended to digitise the BBC’s archive, enabling staff to share and download material remotely instead of having to transport tapes. But it quickly ran into costly delays and became a joke among insiders, who referred to the project as ‘Don’t Mention It’. When it was scrapped this year, bosses were forced to admit they had spent a total of £98.4million trying to make it work.","Corporation spent £2.5m on running costs but only took £1.2m .

"By . Simon Murphy . MPs were at the centre of a new expenses row last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered they are claiming money for riding their bicycles. Britain’s Cycling Minister, a millionaire backbench Labour MP and the shadow Transport Minister are among those who have claimed the 20p per mile allowance for pedalling to and from official engagements. The cycling allowance has been used hundreds of times by eight MPs over the past four years. One of the politicians admitted he stopped claiming the allowance because it did not cost him anything to ride his bicycle – but others defended their claims, insisting they were justified. MPs were at the centre of a new expenses row after it emerged they are claiming 20p a mile on expenses for riding their bikes. Hugh Bayley (pictured) made 166 claims worth £205. He was the highest claimant of expenses for cycling  and said he used the money to maintain his two bikes . The expense claims, which have been logged with the Independent Parliament Standards Authority (IPSA), follow HMRC guidance. It states that the ‘approved mileage rate’ for individuals cycling for business journeys – not commuting travel – is 20p per mile. Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh has made six cycling claims, totalling £11.60. One of her expenses, for which she claimed £1.60, was incurred when she ‘cycled from Westminster to Peckham for BBC filming and back’. The Labour MP, who describes herself as a ‘cyclist’ on her Twitter profile, also claimed £2.40 for a cycle ride from her London home to ‘United Biscuits Factory for a visit’. Last night she declined to comment. Tory MP Robert Goodwill, who was appointed the Cycling Minister last year, has made three claims, totalling £7.20. One, for a four-mile journey in his constituency in Sacroborough on April 20, 2012 was worth just 80p. Last night he said: ‘I just put in a few . claims to demonstrate that I use my bicycle for work. I actually made . ten journeys last Thursday for votes between the Department for . Transport offices and Parliament and I didn’t claim for those.’ Mary Creagh (left) made six claims totalling £11.60. The shadow Transport Secretary claimed £1.60 for a jaunt to Peckham for 'BBC filming' Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said he stopped claiming the allowance after making six claims, worth a total of £12.50. He explained: ‘I concluded, I’ve got a bike, it’s not costing me anything so I just don’t claim any more. ‘I certainly think we should be encouraging MPs to use the cheapest mode of transport but I have myself chosen to do it without claiming now.’ Fiona MacTaggart, thought to be the second-wealthiest Labour MP, has made 34 claims totalling £46.10. Last night she did not respond to calls for comment. In total the cycling mileage claims have cost the taxpayer £417.48. The highest claimant is Labour MP Hugh Bayley, who has made 166 claims, costing the taxpayer £205.40. Asked what he used the money for, he said: ‘I use it to maintain my bicycles and I’ve spent a lot more than £200. ‘I have two bicycles, one in my constituency and the other in London. It costs about £60 a year to put each through an annual maintenance check.’ And Norman Lamb (centre and front) made six claims totalling £12.50. The Lib Dem has stopped claiming, because cycling 'costs nothing' Labour MP Andrew Smith has made 59 claims, totalling £105.40. When asked what he used the money for, he said: ‘Well, running a bike you maintain it. IPSA sets the amount, so you need to ask them the basis on which it’s set but I think it’s pretty much in line with costs you incur.’ The other two MPs to have claimed expenses for cycling are Lib Dem Tom Brake, the Deputy Leader of the House  of Commons, and Tory MP Adam Holloway. Last night, Founder of FairFuel UK Campaign Howard Cox said: ‘That’s astonishing that MPs are claiming mileage for cycling. That is profiteering. This is absolutely scandalous.’ Since the MPs’ expenses scandal broke in 2009, the amount claimed by politicians has gone down. The expenses watchdog, IPSA, claims to have to have saved the taxpayer £35 million since it was set up in 2010. MP Dan Poulter said he would investigate a claim his office lodged for a 204-mile bike trip from his Suffolk constituency to London, after saying he doesn't cycle . He's renowned as one of Parliament’s fittest MPs, but a 204-mile cycling round trip in the middle of summer is surely beyond him. Records from IPSA state that Health Minister Daniel Poulter put in the cycling mileage claim, worth £40.80, for the trip from Easton, in his Suffolk constituency, to London last August. The journey is more than 50 miles further than the longest stage in this year’s Tour de France. The claim was among nine the Minister made for cycling mileage, totalling £148.40, which include two other 102-mile journeys between his constituency and London. But last night the 35-year-old MP, a keen rugby player, cricketer and golfer, said:  ‘I don’t own or ride a bike, so this may be a coding error by IPSA – or perhaps more likely an error by my office team inadvertently selecting cycle miles rather than car miles on the IPSA travel expenses menu. I shall investigate further next week.’ Other MPs also said their cycling mileage claims were a mistake. Desmond Swayne, Lord Commissioner  of the Treasury, who made one claim for £1.20, said: ‘I’m certain that I have never knowingly claimed a cycling allowance, but it might be a mistaken computer entry.’ Tory MP Jack Lopresti, made one claim, totalling £23.40 for a 117-mile journey from his constituency home near Bristol to Westminster. A spokesman for the MP said that the  claim was a mistake and the journey was in fact taken by car. An IPSA source said: ‘If MPs have claimed for cycling mileage, they’ve claimed for cycling mileage. We don’t go in and change it from a car  or train journey.’","The cycling allowance has been used hundreds of times by eight MPs over the last four years .

"By . Simon Murphy . Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly have been offered the chance of freedom by Christmas – if they help bring down the drugs gang behind the £1.5 million cocaine haul they were caught trying to smuggle out of Peru. And last night, faced with the alternative of 15 years behind bars, they were considering what to do. In an emotional phone call to her mother Debra, Melissa said: ‘I’m very confused.’ Scroll down for video . Offer: Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly have been offered the chance of freedom by Christmas - if they help bring down the drugs gang behind the £1.5million cocaine haul they were caught trying to smuggle out of Peru . Choice: Faced with the alternative of 15 years behind bars, the pair are considering what to do. Above, Reid, left, and McCollum Connelly, right, are escorted from . a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison ahead of their court . appearance on Wednesday . Melissa called her mother during a fundraising event in her name on Friday night. Bursting in to tears, Debra told people at Kirkintilloch Miners Club in Glasgow: ‘Thank you so much. Your support keeps us strong.’ But the girls have been warned that a citation document, seen exclusively by The Mail on Sunday, contains a raft of damning texts, calls, money transfers and photos that do nothing to support the claim they were coerced into smuggling by armed Colombian mafia who kidnapped them in Ibiza. During a fundraising event in Glasgow on Friday night, Reid's mother Debra (pictured) told people: 'Thank you so much. Your support keeps us strong' They have now been told that if they admit they fabricated the story and agree to stop shielding the criminals and collaborate in bringing them down, they could be out of prison in two months. ‘They hold their whole future in their hands,’ said Dr Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the state attorney’s anti-drugs unit ahead of a hearing on Tuesday. ‘This is going to be their last chance to get an early termination on their sentence and by-pass a trial. 'They have the option of collaborating with the state prosecution or saying nothing and going to jail for a very long time. 'There is a possibility these two women can be out of prison in around two months but they simply can’t plead guilty and say they were forced. ‘They need to go into detail about who these other men involved are –  what they look like  and where  we can find them. The evidence that we have is overwhelming and they don’t have anything to suggest they were forced.’ Melissa, from Lenzie near Edinburgh, and Michaella, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, both 20, confessed last week to drug smuggling. But they still insisted they were coerced and their defence strategy failed when prosecutors got the sentencing hearing cancelled. Media frenzy: An enormous group of cameras and reporters were there to meet the pair as they arrived for their first court appearance earlier this summer . Melissa’s parents, energy company manager Billy, 54, and National Grid administrator Debra, 53, have encouraged their daughter to plead guilty, but say they believe she was forced to carry drugs through Lima’s Jorge Chavez airport. A source close to the case said: ‘If Melissa and Michaella do know more than they are letting on, then they face an agonising decision. 'Snitching on an international drugs gang obviously carries its risks, but spending some of the most important years of your life in a hellhole jail thousands of miles from  home can’t be very pleasant either.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly have been offered the chance of freedom by Christmas .

"By . Simon Murphy . and Matthew Kalman . A Nazi memorabilia dealer who tried to sell a concentration camp victim’s clothes on eBay for more than £11,000 has apologised – and pledged to return the garment to the man’s family. Dealer Viktor Kempf, 62, claimed the striped uniform belonged to Wolf-Gierszon Grundmann, who died in Auschwitz in 1941. Last night Kempf said: ‘I am ready to present the uniform to the family as a donation. And I would like to apologise to them for awaking sad feelings and bad memories.’ The complete Auschwitz prisoner uniform, including cap, shirt, trousers and shoes, which seller Viktor Kempf claimed belonged to Wolf-Gierszon Grundmann. But Mr Grundmann's outraged family claim it is a fake . Several Star of David armbands, used to identify and demean Jews, were on eBay for up to £165 . However, experts and Mr Grundmann’s relatives believe the  uniform is counterfeit and have asked police to investigate. How the Mail on Sunday broke the story last week . Last week an investigation by this newspaper revealed how online auction site eBay was profiting from the sickening trade in Holocaust relics. It caused global outrage and led to an apology from eBay, which removed 30 items from sale – including the uniform – and pledged to make a £25,000 donation to charity. Mr Grundmann’s disgusted relatives  accused Kempf, who lives in Vancouver, Canada, of ‘trying to make money out of a personal tragedy’. Mr Grundmann’s daughter’s half-sister, Fani Simon, 66, said she would be asking Canadian police to  investigate Kempf. Ms Simon, who lives in Tel Aviv, Israel, said: ‘This is terrible and upsetting. I feel very angry. ‘We are absolutely sure this uniform is a fake, which means someone stole his identity.’ Another of the uniforms since removed by eBay, with close-ups of the buttons and material for buyers . Vancouver Police last night confirmed that they are ready to open a fraud investigation. Kempf told The Mail on Sunday he bought the uniform from a collector in Holland, who had obtained it from an American dealer.  Kempf added: ‘I never thought that I would cause any harm. It is not illegal to buy and sell these items.’ Dr Shimon Samuels, of the  Simon Wiesenthal centre for Holocaust studies in Paris, said genuine clothing from Nazi concentration camps was rare: ‘When the camps were liberated there was a fear of typhus and everything was burnt as a precaution. So it is very unlikely that anything beyond a few rags would have remained.’ Detailed records of victims, including serial numbers, are kept by Holocaust museums and are easily accessible online – making identity fraud simple. Mr Grundmann, of Proszowice, Poland, arrived at Auschwitz on January 16, 1941. A few months later his family received a letter saying he had died. Toothbrushes apparently used by Auschwitz victims were on sale at £145 . A battered case inscribed with the name Samuel and a Star of David, listed at £492 . Rabbi Abraham Cooper, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles, said: ‘It is flat out disgusting for eBay, to profit from the prison garbs of Holocaust victims. They are on the same page as advertisements for major companies like Kia and McDonald’s. This is taking the sale of Nazi death camp memorabilia to the mainstream. It is deplorable. ‘These precious items only belong in museums because they are witnesses to history. This trade is demeaning to everyone who died in the Holocaust.’ eBay has broken no UK laws by selling . materials from the Holocaust. But the same trade is banned in Germany, . Austria and France. In 2000 Yahoo was sued in France for allowing an . auction of Nazi memorabilia. Mrs . Clarke, whose father was shot just a week before Auschwitz was . liberated by Russian soldiers in 1945, said: ‘Many survivors of . Auschwitz burnt their uniforms. But I do know of some who kept theirs, . and other mementoes. ‘HOLOCAUST’ SALES: WHY CAN’T EBAY  STOP THEM?The . company said it uses a filter system which is supposed to pick up . restricted items uploaded by sellers, but admitted that goods can slip . through the net. eBay said that in light of The Mail on Sunday’s . findings, it would be redoubling its efforts to remove items of concern. HOW MUCH DOES EBAY MAKE FROM THEM?The . site makes ten per cent from the final sale price of items and receives . a listing fee ranging from free to a few pounds depending on type of . sale and country which it is being sold from. In the case of the . concentration camp uniform priced at $18,000, the company would receive a . listing fee of 50 cents (31p) and royalties of $1,800 (£1,125) should . the item sell for its full price. WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?The . authenticity or origin of Holocaust items cannot be immediately . verified, but the sellers claim the memorabilia is genuine and in some . cases have stated that it was originally sourced from the victims’ families. IS IT ILLEGAL? The sale of Holocaust memorabilia is legal in the UK but outlawed in Germany, France and Austria. Profiting from pain: Woman's curlers from the Warsaw Ghetto were listed at £17 . Wooden clogs were up for sale as part of a female concentration camp victim's uniform . The striped pyjama-style concentration camp uniform was worn by death camp inmates .","Viktor Kempf, 62: 'I would like to apologise for awaking bad memories'

AlphaMetrix denies the allegations. Mr Blair’s office did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesman for Mr Brown would not comment, although he has said he does not personally benefit from the profits which go to charity and help to run his office.","Mr Brown's speech earned over £60,000, including accommodation and flights .

The 25-year-old wrote 'me and mum' alongside the image in a tragic final post just a day before she was found dead. Her sudden death has heartbreaking similarities to the untimely passing of her mother in 2000 at her London home, leaving behind her young children to be raised by Bob Geldof. Scroll down for video .

Couple: Miss Yates, who was 41 when she died of a heroin overdose, met Peaches' father Bob when he was the frontman of Boomtown Rats . Bob Geldof walks through Heathrow Airport in 1989 with Paul Yates and their daughters Trixibelle and Peaches . Miss Yates, a TV presenter who had three children with Bob Geldof, died of a heroin overdose at her home in Notting Hill. Peaches was just 11-years-old at the time and vividly remembers the day her mother passed away. She said: 'I remember the day my mother died, and it’s still hard to talk about it. I just blocked it out. I went to school the next day because my father’s mentality was ""keep calm and carry on"". 'So we all went to school and tried to act as if nothing had happened. But it had happened. I didn’t grieve. I didn’t cry at her funeral. I couldn’t express anything because I was just numb to it all. I didn’t start grieving for my mother properly until I was maybe 16.' Peaches . went through a period of heavy drinking and taking drugs as a teenager, . but said the memory of her own mother's overdose stopped her from . spiralling out of control. IIn the days leading up to her death, Peaches posted images of her two sons Astala, 20 months, and Phaedra, 10 months, at home on the picture-sharing site. Three weeks ago she also uploaded an image of a book she was called Magick: In Theory and Practice by Aleister Crowley. He was an early 20th century writer and magician, who wrote about mysticism and paranormal beliefs. She also told her followers she was reading William Todd Schultz's Torment Saint: The Life of Elliot Smith. The book is based on the musician, who died in 2003 from stab wounds following a battle with drug addiction. Following his death a coroner could not say conclusively whether the wounds were self-inflicted and his fans have contested the circumstances ever since. The last adult to see Miss Yates alive was a former heroin addict she had met during her time in rehab. But her four-year-old daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger . Lily, whose father Michael Hutchence died just three years before, was alone . with her when she passed away. It . seemed she had never recovered from the death of the INXS frontman in 1997. Bob Geldof, the father of Yates's first then took the orphaned child into his home, so she could be brought up with her two half-sisters. Yates, who was 41 when she died, married Bob Geldof in 1986, after ten years together. Family: Paula Yates (right), Fifi Trixiebelle (left) and Bob Geldof gather round new-born Peaches in 1989 .

"By . Tara Brady . Peaches Geldof spoke in her last interview of how she owed her life to her children and said: ‘I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything.’ She said that becoming a mother had healed a ‘rudderless and troubled’ childhood, and that she wanted everyone to know parenthood was ‘the best thing you’ve ever done’. The interview, less than a month before her death on Monday, with Mother & Baby magazine was centred on ‘attachment parenting’ –  sleeping in the same room, preferably the same bed as the baby, as well as long-term breastfeeding. Scroll down for video . Family: Peaches, pictured with her sons Astala and Phaedra at Christmas last year, said her sons grounded her . Peaches, 25, said she had cried with exhaustion and said that becoming a mother had ‘broken’ her. The . mother of Astala, 24 months and Phaedra, nearly one, told how her own . experience of attachment parenting from her nanny before the divorce of . her mother Paula and father Bob ‘saved me from losing it’. She . described ‘attachment parenting’ as responding to a baby's needs and . building bonds through closeness and trust. And she said she received a . great deal of help from Sue Cohen, mother of her husband, Tom. ‘Becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally,’ she said. ‘After . years of struggling to know myself, feeling lost at sea, rudderless and . troubled, having babies through which to correct the multiple mistakes . of my own traumatic childhood was beyond healing. A lovign mother: Peaches with her son Astala in April 2013, who said last month that she owed her life to her children . ‘I . felt finally anchored in place, with lives that literally depend on me, . and I am not about to let them down, not for anyone or anything.’ Peaches was supposed to start a regular column offering advice, based on her own experience, of bringing up her children. The . magazine said: ‘M&B’s new columnist… Peaches Geldof! The It Girl . turned Earth Mother will be sharing her mummy moments and views on . bringing up babies, from attachment parenting to juggling work and . family.’ She defined . attachment parenting as building trust and love with her children, by . abandoning what she called ‘arms-length’ advice on parenting. ‘Becoming a mother has really broken me, but in the best possible way!’ she said.

Tight knit: Peaches and her husband Thomas Cohen enjoy a day out at the park with their two sons Astala and Phaedra in September 2013 . She called looking at her sons’ faces the proof that they were miracles, and the best thing any human being could do. It was her own difficult childhood which proved to her that so-called ‘attachment parenting’ was the way to bring up children. She . said that her nanny, Nina, had practised close contact parenting, which . made up for the difficulties of her parents’ divorce. Peaches called the aftermath of the divorce, in 1996, when she was seven, as ‘really unstable’. Besotted: Peaches and husband Thomas enjoying an afternoon at the park with their two sons Astala and Phaedra in July 2013 . The . difficulties were compounded when she was told, aged 13, that she . suffered from polycystic ovaries and was unlikely to have children. The feeling, she said, was like being ‘robbed’ of part of her ‘womanhood’. Later, . she said, she would have conversations with boyfriends about what their . future children would look like, but had to bite her tongue from . telling them she did not think there would be any. However . she later suffered an ectopic pregnancy. She did not address who the . father was in the interview but it happened in 2010, before she was . married to Cohen. ‘I knew the baby could never be, but I cried for days on end,’ she said.

Peaches said her 'two fat little cherubs under two' became 'my whole existence' and made her life 'bliss' She was living in California at the time but returned to Britain and fell in love with Cohen, who was an old friend. When . she experienced the symptoms of pregnancy, including nausea and . cravings, she dismissed them and it was five months before she went to a . doctor and was given a pregnancy test. The interview appeared less than a month after she died in Mother & Baby magazine . ‘After six tests, I began to dare to hope there could be a life inside me,’ she said. ‘But . it was only when I saw Astala's perfectly formed, serious little face . that I released an out breath of sheer relief and pure joy that I felt I . had been holding my whole life until that one perfect moment.’ Her husband, she said, was in tears and her love for her son was instant and intense. ‘I knew then I'd been destined to be a mother, it's just my baby was waiting for the right time, the time I was ready, too.’ Peaches . said that her next pregnancy was accidental – she had not realised it . was possible to conceive while breastfeeding – but no less welcome. A . result of the age difference of just a year between her sons, and her . desire for ‘attachment parenting’ – which has also been advocated by . Gwyneth Paltrow – was exhaustion. She . described crying with tiredness and having no time for herself, but . said she had no doubt what she had done was the best thing possible to . do. And she also said that . she did not live off her father, having always been told by him to earn . her own money, while when her husband's band SCUM split, it was . difficult for her marriage, as she had to become the main breadwinner. She . praised her husband as having ‘the patience of a saint’ and said simply . of her children: ‘I love loving them and being there for them through . everything.’ Devoted: Peaches Geldof's nanny Anita Debney, who became a surrogate mother to her after Paula Yates (right) died of an accidental overdose, today paid tribute to the 25-year-old who passed away suddenly on Monday . Another image Peaches published on Instagram was this photograph of Paula Yates and her nanny Nina . Peaches Geldof was a staunch advocate of attachment parenting, a child-rearing philosophy based on the idea that an infant can benefit from a strong emotional bond with their primary caregiver. The phrase was initially coined by U.S. paediatrician William Sears in 2001, and recommends practices such as co-sleeping, carrying a baby close in a sling and breastfeeding into toddlerhood, or until the child weans naturally. The concept has since been embraced by a number of celebrity mothers including Alanis Morisette and The Big Bang Theory’s Mayim Bialik. Peaches famously defended the practice late last year on This Morning in a debate with former Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins. Peaches and Katie Hopkins went head to head in a debate about attachment parenting on This Morning . She said: ‘All it is is a return to instinctive parenting. I follow the 7 Bs of attachment parenting - birth bonding, breastfeeding, babywearing, bedding close to baby, belief in the language value of your baby’s cry, beware of baby trainers and balance.’ She explained that the principles can be as strict or relaxed as one likes, and her routine with Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 10 months, include ‘a loose feeding schedule’ but ‘really strict bedtime’. When questioned about how the co-sleeping arrangement affects her sex life, Peaches responded: 'I have two babies under two so obviously I am doing something in the bedroom. 'Just because I sleep in bed with my babies doesn't mean I'm in bed with them 24/7. 'They go to bed at 7, but I don't go to bed at 7. We go to another bedroom in the house and watch television or do other things couples do. 'I'm 24 and my husband is 23, we obviously like being intimate with each other!'","Socialite feared she would never have children because of fertility problems .

"By . Simon Murphy . Melissa Reid’s father last night told The Mail on Sunday that he’s not totally convinced by their version of events – and he wants his daughter to come clean and plead guilty. William Reid thinks Melissa should change her plea in order to reduce her sentence. Up until now Melissa and Michaella McCollum Connolly have insisted they are innocent and were forced to unknowingly carry drugs. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to 15 years in prison. Melissa Reid's father, William Reid told The Mail on Sunday that he's not totally convinced by the Peru Two's version of events and he wants his daughter to come clean and plead guilty . Mr Reid was reunited with his daughter Melissa at Dirandro police station in Lima last week . However, if they plead guilty, they may get off with only six years and eight months. On Thursday the girls were moved to the Virgen de Fatima jail, which is surrounded by shanty towns just south of Lima. The only Western inmates, they will endure a military-style regime alongside 1,000 other female prisoners, including murderers and terrorists. Last night, in an exclusive interview Mr Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, who visited the girls in prison on Friday, told The Mail on Sunday he’s ‘still not 100 per cent about their story’. When Melissa saw him she broke down in tears and told him: ‘Dad, I love you,  I missed you.’ Mr Reid, 53, said: ‘You continually think you’ll wake up and this nightmare will end. They should plead guilty. They should work with the authorities, tell them everything  they know. Accused: Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly are suspected of smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru . ‘We would then be working towards an end game. At the moment it’s left open-ended. ‘God forbid, if it goes to trial, you have the prospect of receiving that 15-year sentence. ‘It’s indefensible to say that they didn’t have drugs or know they had drugs. They did carry the drugs. 'They were found to have drugs on them. They collected packages which transpired to be drugs. They are going to be guilty of that. ‘If that’s the Peruvian law, regardless of the mitigating circumstances, then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you’re trying to appeal and reduce. ‘These girls are young. They may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they’re going to go free. If you’re adamant that you’re innocent, you don’t believe that you’re even going to be given a sentence.’ Mr Reid, who works for the National Grid, was able to take the girls an extra mattress, a blanket and a KFC meal, which they were ‘delighted’ about. Concerned: Miss McCollum Connolly, left, and Miss Reid, right, are pictured after  being detained on their way to Madrid, Spain . ‘They seemed anxious and full of nervous tension. Melissa is clearly starting to think and understand that pleading guilty may well be the best option,’ he said. ‘They’re still young girls, far away from home. ‘The most poignant moment, for me, was when I explained to her that it will be the trial before I see her again. 'That was the biggest reality check that I’ve seen from her. She cried. I told her that the cost involved was significant and she understood. It will be hard.’ Fighting back tears, Mr Reid added: ‘As I sit here tonight, I’m still not 100 per cent about their story. 'But two girls, who prior to Ibiza did not know each other, are telling a very similar story. They have been pretty consistent all along. Only those two girls know the truth.’ The girls may have to wait up to three years for a trial if they maintain their not guilty plea. Mr Reid said he did not want Melissa to miss ‘the best times of her life’. He added: ‘It’s worse than a death .  .  . we could have dealt with a death because we could grieve. This is enduring.’","William Reid thinks Melissa should change her plea to reduce her sentence .

"By . Simon Murphy . Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford’s wife has filed for divorce, it has emerged just days after he was jailed for a campaign of sexual abuse against teenage girls, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Clifford, 71, is the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree and was sentenced to eight years after a judge ruled he had groomed and degraded his victims. Now it has emerged that his 51-year-old wife Jo – who was conspicuous by her absence during the trial and was not called as a character witness – has started divorce proceedings against her millionaire husband. Scroll down for videos . Max Clifford, pictured left was the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree. Now his wife, Jo, right, has started divorce proceedings against her millionaire husband . Mrs Clifford, who was his PA before the pair married in April, 2010, has instructed celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth, who is thought to charge £450 an hour and is known as ‘Jaws’ because of his formidable reputation. Mr Tooth, who is renowned for negotiating multi-million pound  settlements, has a long list of famous clients including Irina Abramovich, former wife of billionaire Chelsea Football Club chairman Roman, actor Jude Law’s former wife Sadie Frost and rock star Eric Clapton’s ex, Pattie Boyd. Last night the lawyer, whose motto is ‘Don’t get even – get Tooth’, confirmed the split. He said: ‘They are divorcing. There are no disputed matters. Everything has been sorted out amicably so it’s all done.’ Mrs Clifford married the publicist seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz. A source close to the family said: ‘The divorce was nothing to do with the court case. The fault lines were there long before and the separation has been amicable.’ Mrs Clifford has previously refused to comment on the divorce, and on the day her husband received his guilty verdicts she was spotted without her wedding ring strolling in the Cotswolds village where she has a £600,000 three-bedroom cottage. Disgraced PR consultant Max Clifford leaving Westminster Magistrates Court with his wife Jo. The pair married seven years ago . It is understood that the divorce  is in its very early stages, with  the decree nisi – which confirms the petitioner is entitled to a divorce  – yet to be formally granted by  a judge. But a source said: ‘It’s just a matter of time before the judge does grant it and then it will be a few weeks before the decree absolute is issued and the divorce is official.’ Clifford was jailed at Southwark Crown Court on May 2 after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against four girls between 1977 and 1985. Judge Anthony Leonard said that some of the offences would have  led to charges of rape if they had happened today. Last week, one of Clifford’s  victims, Sharon Elliott, 48, waived her right to anonymity to exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday that she felt vindicated after hearing the judge’s verdict. Ms Elliott, who was indecently assaulted in a nightclub toilet by Clifford when she was an 18-year-old dancer, said: ‘The eight year sentence is a positive result for us women and when I heard the judge condemn Clifford for what he said to me, I felt I’d got justice.’ Clifford had sneered at Sharon after the assault, telling her: ‘Don’t bother telling anyone – they won’t believe you.’","Celebrity Publicist Max Clifford has been jailed for eight years for sex offences .

"By . Stephen Adams . Campaigners have described as ‘disgraceful’ a decision by Ministers to slash the level  of fines for hospitals hit by potentially fatal superbugs. The Government claims to have a zero-tolerance approach to the issue. But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Health Ministers have agreed to: . Health officials claim the cuts have been made because to allow the hospitals to cope with the superbug . One of the most vocal campaigners is Bucks Fizz star Cheryl Baker, 60, whose mother-in-law died of Clostridium difficile in 2006. She said: ‘This is outrageous. It’s disgraceful. My mother-in-law had no dignity at her death. ‘She had no control over her bowels. The C. diff ate through her bowels and poisoned her blood. She died of septicaemia.’ Health officials claim the unpublicised changes have been made because many hospitals are doing all they can to beat the bugs. Details were published in an NHS England document outlining C. diff ‘objectives’ for 2014/15. It says some infections are a consequence of ‘factors outside the control of the NHS’. Many hospitals have been hit with fines for having more than 4,477 cases of the superbug . Targets have been relaxed at 89 of 160 English hospital trusts. Last year (2013/14), they were collectively allowed 4,477 cases before fines were imposed. Many missed their targets and about 5,500 cases were recorded in all. This year the hospitals will be allowed to record 4,976 cases, a rise of 499 or more than ten per cent. At some hospital trusts, the threshold has been almost doubled. The number of allowable cases at the Royal Bolton Hospital, Lancashire, has been increased from 28 to 48, a change local GP Dr Stephen Liversedge said was ‘ridiculous’. Ms Baker said: ‘They are acting as if they have solved the problem. But we can’t take a step backwards – it’s morally wrong.’","U.K health officials have made changes to the fines imposed on hospitals .

"By . Stephen Adams . A new investigation has been launched  into child deaths following heart operations in Bristol, almost 20 years after concerns were first raised there. Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired the public inquiry into baby deaths at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, will initially look at nine recent cases. But a well-placed source said Sir Ian could  end up investigating many more as other families came forward. A new investigation has been launched into child deaths following heart operations. It will focus on whether Bristol Children's Hospital had enough skilled nurses to care for very ill children . The QC has been asked to head the independent review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, who agreed to the investigation after meeting bereaved families on Friday. When Sir Ian published his public inquiry report in 2001 he found that a ‘club culture’ among surgeons had prevented young  doctors from raising concerns about high death rates on the operating table. The competence of Bristol’s cardiac surgeons is unlikely to be called into question, however. Instead the new investigation will focus on whether Bristol Children’s Hospital, sited next to the Infirmary, had enough skilled nurses to care for very ill children. Families claim they had to clean up  vomit and even give medicines themselves because of a lack of nursing staff. Several said their children were taken out of intensive care too soon. In a disturbing echo of the original scandal, parents also claim their concerns have been ignored. Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired the public inquiry into baby deaths at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1990s, will initially look at nine recent cases . Prof Keogh said he agreed to the review after listening to the ‘dignified and powerful’ arguments of bereaved families. ‘It was clear .  .  . such a review would need to be independent of the NHS. It must be led by the families. It must be their review,’ he added. Among the deaths Sir Ian will investigate are those of Sean Turner and Luke Jenkins. Sean, four, died in March 2012 on Ward 32 after corrective heart surgery, while Luke, seven, died in April that year, days after being moved from intensive care. It is their parents who pushed to . meet Prof Keogh. It is thought he agreed after hearing the parents of . seven other children were also taking legal action against University . Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. Sean’s . mother, Yolanda, 47, from Warminster, Wiltshire, said: ‘We are . concerned that not only did our children die due to bad care, but the . details surrounding their care have not been properly investigated.’ A . hospital spokesman said: ‘The Trust remains troubled that families . whose children we have cared for continue to have concerns about the . care provided despite our attempts to respond to these issues.'","Sir Ian Kennedy, who chaired the public inquiry into baby deaths at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 90s, will initially look at nine recent cases .

"By . Stephen Adams . As many as 12,000 people may have died needlessly of heart attacks and strokes because of the Government’s ‘disastrous’ policy on salt, a leading doctor has claimed. Meddling by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley meant vital salt reduction targets – which should have been introduced four years ago – have only just been agreed, said Professor Graham MacGregor of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine. People should eat no more than 6g of salt a day, according to the World Health Organisation. Higher intake can lead to heart attacks and strokes. As many as 12,000 people may have died needlessly of heart attacks and strokes because of the Government's 'disastrous' policy on salt, a leading doctor has claimed . The average Briton currently consumes about 8g. Prof MacGregor claimed that, had targets been set four years ago, consumption would now be 0.5g per day lower. He said: ‘We estimate we would have saved approximately 3,000 people a year if the targets had been set by the Food Standards Agency in 2010.’ Professor Graham MacGregor said meddling by ex-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley (pictured) meant vital salt reduction targets - which should have been introduced four years ago - have only just been agreed . Mr Lansley took responsibility for public nutrition away from the FSA in 2010 and gave it to the Department of Health. Prof MacGregor claimed this ‘basically caused chaos’. He said that Mr Lansley also ‘adamantly refused’ to set a rolling target for reduction in the 2010-2014 period – leading to ‘a loss of momentum’. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Far from lacking momentum, the World Health Organisation has said our salt reduction work is world leading.’","Prof Graham MacGregor said meddling by ex-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley meant vital salt reduction targets have only just been agreed .

"By . Stephen Adams . A couple have been left heartbroken after a leading IVF clinic destroyed their frozen embryos by mistake – and with it their hopes of giving their son a brother or sister. Zeb and Nadia Urfan had planned  to have the embryos implanted to expand their family and give their five-year-old son a sibling. But in a terrible administrative blunder, the embryos were removed from the deep-freeze at Jessop Fertility in Sheffield. A couple have been left heartbroken after a leading IVF clinic destroyed their frozen embryos by mistake - and with it their hopes of giving their son a brother or sister (file photo) Staff at the NHS clinic, which is part of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, took them out because they had not received a consent form from the couple which they needed by law to keep the embryos in storage. Originally they told the Urfans the form had not arrived at the hospital, but it has now emerged that the document, which the couple sent recorded delivery, did arrive – but may have been sent to the wrong department. Last night the Jessop admitted there had been a mistake and offered its ‘heartfelt apologies’ to the couple. But Mr Urfan, 39, a property landlord, said: ‘This should not have happened. We have been punished because of someone’s negligence. Our world has been turned upside down. They have taken away our dreams. ‘Our son is an adorable boy and I feel that we owe him a sibling, but now we cannot give him that.’ The couple, from Leicester, said they had decided to bring the matter to the public’s attention to make sure that it ‘never happens again’. Staff at the NHS clinic, which is part of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, took them out because they had not received a consent form from the couple which they needed by law to keep the embryos in storage (file photo) Mrs Urfan, 35, originally underwent IVF with donor eggs to conceive their son, who is now almost six. She had the treatment after being told her chances of conceiving naturally were virtually zero. The IVF cycle, which used Mr Urfan’s sperm and the same donor’s eggs, resulted in two spare viable embryos that were subsequently put in storage. But last week they discovered that both the embryos had been destroyed. Dotty Watkins, head of midwifery  at the Jessop, said the consent form may have been signed for in a different hospital department – meaning staff at the Jessop never got it. She added: ‘We are carrying out a full review into what has happened and I would like to offer our heartfelt apologies to the couple concerned.  We can only imagine how distressed they must be.’ She insisted that the unit had stored embryos for ‘hundreds of couples over the past 13 years and this has never happened before’. And she explained that it was routine practice to send out consent forms when the initial five-year storage period was up, adding: ‘Regrettably the Assisted Conception Unit did not receive the recorded delivery letter which was sent back by the couple stating that they wanted to extend the storage period. As a consequence of this the embryos were then thawed. ‘We have contacted the couple to apologise formally and we will be providing them with a full response in writing once the review is complete to explain fully what happened. ‘We will also be looking at any additional changes that need to be put  in place to limit the chances of this happening again. We are so very sorry this has happened.’","Zeb and Nadia Urfan wanted to give their five-year-old son a sibling .

"By . Stephen Adams . Cosmetic surgery cowboys will have ‘nowhere to hide’ when new rules to protect patients come into force, a Health Minister promised last night. In a victory for The Mail on Sunday, Dan Poulter said ‘robust action’ would be taken against rogue operators to safeguard those who go under the knife or opt for other treatments such as Botox. Nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted, with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently (pictured) Plans to make the £3 billion-a-year industry safer will be put before Parliament in January. They include: . Cosmetic surgeons who have long pushed for tighter controls welcomed the proposals, but cautioned: ‘The devil is in the detail.’ The plans are the Government’s official response to a Health Department review of the industry, which was led by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. The review was triggered by the PIP scandal, in which up to 47,000 women in Britain were fitted with the French implants made from industrial-grade silicone. The exact number is unclear because of chaotic record-keeping. It was years before anyone spotted that the implants ruptured far more frequently than other brands. In part, the delay in identifying the link was because there was no central register. Most women affected then found they could not sue as firms that carried out operations either folded or called in administrators. Dr Poulter said: ‘For too long, the cosmetics industry has been completely unregulated and there are too many tales of women being exploited and of lives ruined by rogue cosmetic firms. 'This has to change, so we are taking robust action to clamp down on cosmetic cowboys to protect the public.’ He added: ‘There will be nowhere to hide.’ Sir Bruce put forward 40 recommendations to clean up the industry and Dr Poulter said the Government aims to put every one into action. The Mail on Sunday has campaigned for improvements in five key areas, including minimum standards for cosmetic surgeons,  an end to ‘hard sell’, and full training and regulation of those administering Botox and dermal fillers. Congratulating The Mail on Sunday for its ‘vigorous’ campaign, Dr Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the Government appeared to be acting on the first three areas, while it had not yet committed to the last two. But he warned: ‘The devil is in the detail and we wait to see the full response.’ Concerns remain about key details, such as whether the breast implant register will be compulsory. Others remain worried Ministers will bow to industry pressure and stop short of meeting our fifth demand by ensuring all those administering Botox, fillers and laser therapy are properly trained and registered. Many beauty therapists carry out such work and some ‘practitioners’ inject clients in their own homes. In his review, Sir Bruce described fillers as ‘a crisis waiting to happen’. Sources . insisted the Government’s plans mean everyone providing such treatments . will be regulated, but it may only be a voluntary scheme. They also claimed several cosmetic . firms, including Harley Medical Group, which fitted 13,900 women with . PIP implants, had dragged their heels on changing their ways. In . September 2012, directors at Harley Medical Group called in . administrators to put the company into liquidation. All legal claims . against the firm died with it, meaning it could not be sued by 1,700 . women who had filed a class action. The review of rules was triggered after French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was found to be using industrial grade silicone in its implants . Directors then set up a new holding company operating from the same premises. Lawyer Mark Harvey, who is fighting for compensation, said other firms acted in a similar way. Jan Spivey, who runs the PIP Action Campaign, said: ‘Everyone seems very keen to swiftly move on. Not enough is being done for women who still have PIP implants.’ Government policy in England remains that women who had implants privately can have them taken out on the NHS only if they have ruptured, she said. The NHS will not pay for replacements. The Harley Medical Group said it had been the victim of a fraud by the PIP makers. A spokesman said it could not have survived if it had not ‘restructured’ to avoid the resultant liabilities. Winding up the original company had therefore been in the best interest of patients, he said. Sharon Little had PIP implants to boost her breasts – and self-esteem – after the birth of her children. The surgery was carried out in 2008 by Harley Medical Group. But an MRI scan in August 2012 revealed that one implant had ruptured while the other had developed a  ‘gel bleed’. Silicone had spread to her lymph nodes. Although she qualifies for their removal on the NHS, she is not entitled to free replacement and cannot afford the £3,500 operation. She is living in pain rather than face the disfigurement of not having new implants. Miss Little, 31, of Cuckfield in West Sussex, said a breast implant register was urgently needed, adding: ‘These changes won’t help me or others.’","New rules for plastic surgeons to be put forward in January .

"By . Stephen Adams . Advertising guru Maurice Saatchi, whose wife died of ovarian cancer, has won Government backing for his private member’s Bill calling for more innovation in treatment of the disease. When novelist Josephine Hart died two years ago, the Tory peer described her treatment  as ‘medieval’. Lord Saatchi has since fought to enable doctors to use procedures other than surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Lord Maurice Saatchi is backing a bill in the upper house to free doctors from the threat of litigation if they deviate from standard cancer treatments. His wife Josephine Hart (right) died of ovarian cancer two years ago . He argued they are too often hamstrung by legal rules which mean they can be sued if they ‘deviate’ from standard treatments, even if they know it will do little good. The peer, founder of advertising giants Saatchi  & Saatchi, sponsored the Medical Innovations Bill to reduce the threat of litigation and ‘encourage responsible innovation’. And on Friday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the Bill, saying it ‘could lead to major breakthroughs, such as a cure for cancer’. The Bill has won the backing of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who said it had the power to 'lead to major breakthroughs, such as a cure for cancer' Mr Hunt announced a ‘full and open consultation’ in the New Year to understand ‘the problems [doctors] face in innovating’ and strike ‘the right balance between innovation and safeguards’. Last night, Lord Saatchi said: ‘I think the  Prime Minister and the Secretary of State want Britain to regain its place as the world leader  in medical innovation.’ He stressed patient safety was at the heart of his proposals. ‘We do not want reckless experimentation that puts patients at risk, and we don’t want patients to be treated like mice,’ he said. Obtaining informed consent to take part in experimental treatments would remain essential, the peer stressed,  and doctors would retain full legal responsibility for  their decisions.","Tory peer Maurice Saatchi is sponsoring a Bill through the Lords .

"By . Stephen Adams . and Eve Mcgowan . Lungs from heavy smokers should be more widely used in transplants to boost the number of life-saving operations taking place, says a leading charity. Despite the increased risks of getting cancer, doctors argue more patients with terminal illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis, should be given the choice of having ‘reconditioned’ lungs from a smoker or older person, which can give them years of extra life. Dozens of patients in Britain die every year while waiting for ‘perfect’ lungs, they say, when their lives would be prolonged if surgeons were able to use more ‘sub-optimal’ organs. Some people often have to wait many years for an organ transplant, and some say relaxing the rules regarding lungs of smokers may help those on the donor waiting list . The proposals have been drawn up by transplant surgeons and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, who are writing to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to try to persuade him to relax guidelines that control the quality of donor lungs. Smokers’ lungs are already used in four in ten transplant operations  in Britain. But researchers say this could be increased to more than half if doctors were less selective. Andrew Fisher, professor of respiratory transplant medicine at Newcastle University, said lungs from the heaviest smokers could be used more  frequently. He added: ‘Common sense suggests accepting lungs from a donor who smokes can’t be healthy. ‘But what is more risky? To wait for a “perfect lung” that may never arrive, or take one that may not be ideal?’ He said evidence showed patients who received a smoker’s lungs were 20 per cent less likely to die within three years than those who stayed on the waiting list. Prof Fisher said technological advances meant poorer-quality lungs could be reconditioned using a machine he has helped create. Bronchial tree of lungs. These can become severely damaged through heavy smoking . He said: ‘The ex-vivo lung perfusion machine improves condition of the organ by exposing them to a nutrient solution and oxygen.’ But the appeal comes just 18 months after cystic fibrosis sufferer Jennifer Wederell, 27, died of lung cancer following a double transplant. She was told the lungs came from a heavy smoker only after the cancer was spotted. Last night her widower David Wederell, 29, said: ‘We should not prevent someone from becoming a donor, smokers included. But we must ensure the transplant process is totally transparent.’ He said they were told Jennifer had the killer disease months after the transplant they thought would save her. ‘We were incredulous this hadn’t been mentioned before her transplant. Jennifer spent seven months enduring gruelling cancer treatment and died a painful, tortuous death.’ The charity also wants lungs from elderly donors to be used more.","Leading charity says people should be more open to different lungs .

"By . Sophie Goodchild . and Stephen Adams . All women over the age of 20 should take a daily dose of  Vitamin D to reduce their chances of developing breast cancer, an  expert claims. Professor Kefah Mokbel is writing to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to argue that making the ‘sunshine vitamin’ free on the NHS would save 1,000 lives a year. He has already started handing out the pills to female patients at his private clinic. But he believes all women should get them – even those who have not been diagnosed with the disease. Professor Kefah Mokbel is recommending that all women aged 20 or over be given Vitamin D supplements whether they have signs of breast cancer or not . Prof Mokbel said the measure would cost the NHS just 12p per woman per day – and claims it would spare thousands the agony of developing the condition. ‘I am calling for all women from the age of 20 to be given free Vitamin D supplements on the NHS because it is effective in protecting against breast cancer,’ he said. ‘It is established science that women who have higher Vitamin D levels have a better chance of beating the disease. ‘Studies also show that women with higher Vitamin D levels are significantly less likely to develop breast cancer in the first place.’ Every year 50,000 women in Britain are diagnosed with breast cancer, and the disease claims almost 12,000 lives annually. Prof Mokbel, a surgeon at the private London Breast Institute, said: ‘My estimate is that at least 1,000 lives could be saved by supplementation a year.’ Vitamin D is best known for its role in helping build and maintain healthy bones. But scientists have discovered it is also essential for the immune system and regulating how cells divide. Both are key to fighting cancer. According to the Harvard School of Public Health in the United States, ‘being “D-ficient’’ may increase the risk of a host of chronic diseases – including osteoporosis, heart disease, some cancers and multiple sclerosis – and infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and even seasonal flu’. Prof Mokbel said his tests showed that half his private patients were Vitamin D deficient, and a third were severely deficient. Prof Mokbel says that 1,000 women could be saved every year if the 12p a day vitamin was provided on the NHS . ‘I give Vitamin D to all my women patients at the clinic because the higher the levels, then the greater the protection from breast cancer,’ he added. ‘Vitamin D works by encouraging cancer cells to change to normal cells, and it also enhances the immune system. Another benefit is that it promotes the death of breast-cancer cells.’ Evidence that Vitamin D supplements may combat breast cancer has been building. In 2008, a Canadian study showed breast cancer patients with good Vitamin D levels were about half as likely to die from the disease as those with a serious deficiency. Norwegian and German studies have reached similar conclusions. However, Jessica Kirby, of  Cancer Research UK, disagrees with Prof Mokbel’s analysis. She said: ‘There have been a large number of studies about Vitamin D and breast cancer and it looks as if people’s Vitamin D levels don’t affect breast cancer risk. Trials in which people took Vitamin D supplements have shown no effect.’ Prof Mokbel, who is also an honorary consultant surgeon at  St George’s Hospital in South London, compared the situation  to the evidence on smoking and claimed action was needed now. He said: ‘This is a low-cost, cheap intervention and there’s  no toxicity from taking it.’ However, NHS chiefs remain worried about the cost. NHS spending on Vitamin D supplements now tops £100 million a year, up from £28 million in 2004. The Health Department and Public Health England were asked to comment but failed to respond. Vitamin D may be known for protecting the elderly against osteoporosis – but it is also putting a spring in the step of some of the country’s fittest dancers. Scientists have discovered that ballet stars can jump more than an inch – 3cm – higher after a few months of taking the pills daily. Supplements also increase leg strength by a fifth and cut the chance of injury, according to a study of members of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Birmingham Royal Ballet (pictured) took part in a study which showed that dancers could jump 3cm higher and had increased leg strength after taking the supplements for a few months . Rheumatologist Dr Roger Wolman, from the city’s Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, said: ‘We suspected muscle strength would improve but the results were impressive.’ The dancers took a pill containing 2,000 International Units of Vitamin D every day for four months last winter. Every year 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 12,000 people die from it . The dosage is ten times the European recommended daily amount, but in Dr Wolman’s opinion it is still ‘quite a low level of supplementation’. He and his colleagues measured how high the dancers could jump at the start and the end of the trial – and how hard they could push with their legs. They also recorded how many injuries they had which forced them to stop training for at least a day. Dancers given the pills went from jumping 17in (43cm) off the floor to 18in (46cm), while their leg strength increased by 19 per cent. The leg strength of those  not given the pills remained the same, according to results published in The Journal  Of Science And Medicine In Sport. And their jump height decreased slightly. Those not given the pills also had a higher chance of being injured – 50 per cent compared with less than 30 per cent for those on Vitamin D. Sports nutritionist Dr Graeme Close said footballers, rugby players, jockeys and golfers were also using Vitamin D to boost performance. ‘If you think how hectic the winter period can be in a lot of sports, it’s really important,’ he added. Vitamin D is produced by the skin when exposed to strong sunlight. Everyone needs  15 minutes’ daily exposure to maintain healthy levels. Oily fish and eggs are also good sources, especially in winter when the body’s levels are low.","Professor Kefah Mokbel thinks 1,000 lives a year could be saved .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . The disclosure over the Living Wage is a 'fresh embarrassment for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, pictured . The Church of England, is paying more than 70 of its own workers less than the living wage - despite lecturing employers about their duty to pay higher salaries. The care and cleaning staff, employed running sheltered housing schemes for retired clergy, earn less than the ‘living wage’ which the Church urges all companies to pay. The living wage is supposed to ensure that families can afford food, clothes and rent. The disclosure is a fresh embarrassment for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, following the scandal over the Church’s investment in the controversial payday lender Wonga. Archbishop Welby is a strong backer of the Church’s campaign to encourage employers to pay the living wage, which was calculated with the help of its own poverty campaigners, under the supervision of the Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. The living wage is currently set at £8.55 an hour in London and £7.45 in the rest of the country. The Church has declared that families cannot afford food, clothing or housing if their income is lower, and that it is ‘morally unacceptable that people should have to do multiple jobs and work long hours and yet still live in poverty’. Archbishop Welby said in November 2012, just before he took over at Lambeth Palace, that championing the living wage was something ‘we should be shouting about.’ However the Church’s parliament, the General Synod, has now been told that one of the CofE’s own institutions has failed to listen to the message. Moreover, it will not begin to improve the low pay of its care workers until next spring. Dr Philip Giddings of the CofE’s cabinet, the Archbishops’ Council, told the Synod: ‘In its supported housing scheme the Pensions Board employs 72 staff who are currently below the living wage. ‘The Board will implement the living wage in stages, starting April 2015.’ Dr Giddings added ‘most staff’ working for contractors used by the Church are paid the living wage, and ‘where they are not, agreement has been reached to phase in the appropriate uplift or, in one case, offer additional funds to an existing contractor to make the necessary uplift.’ The former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Williams, who retired at the end of 2012, has made plain his strong support for the living wage for care workers. In an interview earlier this year he said it was wrong that care workers are often paid only the minimum wage of £6.31 an hour. Paying the living wage was a ‘no brainer’, Lord Williams said, adding: ‘On that sort of salary you have to have three jobs to make ends meet, and rushing from the one to the other is disastrous.’ The Church’s most outspoken campaigner for the living wage has been the Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Dr Sentamu said last year that ‘the holes in millions of pay cheques are being plugged by in-work support to the tune of £4 billion a year. But why aren’t those who are profiting from their workers paying up? Why is the Government having to subsidise businesses which don’t pay their employees enough to live on? Church investment chiefs finally withdrew their £75,000 stake in Wonga earlier this month, almost a year after Archbishop Welby first complained of his embarrassment at the Church’s involvement. He added: ‘In the rush for profit, and for high pay at the top, too many companies have forgotten the basic moral imperative that employees be paid enough to live on.’ The CofE’s highest paid staff member is General Synod Secretary-General William Fittall, who is on over £150,000 a year, more than the Prime Minister. Since the Church is a charity, this salary puts Mr Fittall among the very best rewarded charity executives. The 72 Pensions Board workers on less than the living wage are employed in eight supported housing schemes for elderly and vulnerable clergy, their spouses, and other CofE retired staff, which are established around the country. Each couple accommodated pays around £2,000 a month for places in communities where low-paid staff provide meals, cleaning and personal care. Church investment chiefs finally withdrew their £75,000 stake in Wonga earlier this month, almost a year after Archbishop Welby first complained of his embarrassment at the Church’s involvement. The CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, pulled out of the payday lender only under pressure from the Archbishop, who wants to see high interest short term loan firms replaced by Church-backed low interest credit unions. The Commissioners had said they intended to maintain the Wonga investment, part of a stake in a venture capital company, because it would cost between £3 million and £9 million to get rid of it. The Commissioners also said that Church investment would improve the behaviour of questionable companies, adding that ‘it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick.’ Their discovery that the money could after all be pulled from Wonga without large financial losses came less that two weeks after the Daily Mail revealed their intention to continue with the investment.","Church of England paying more than 70 workers less than living wage .

"By . James  Nye . Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev boasted to his friend, Azamat Tayazhakov, that he could make a bomb from gunpowder just one month before the terror attacks on the city's marathon, federal prosecutors said on Monday. Assistant US Attorney Stephanie Siegmann also said that Tsarnaev, then aged 19, told Tayazhakov and another friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, that it would be good to die as a martyr and 'go straight to heaven'. These damning claims were made on the first day of the trial of three University of Massachusetts students who are accused of interfering with the investigation into the bombing for one reason — to help Tsarnaev. First day: In this courtroom sketch, defendant Azamat Tazhayakov, left, a college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is depicted listening to testimony by FBI Special Agent Phil Christiana, right, during the first day of his federal obstruction of justice trial Monday, July 7, 2014 in Boston . Azamat Tazhayakov is accused, along with his roommate, of removing a backpack, fireworks that had been emptied of their black powder and a laptop computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth several days after the bombing. Siegmann also said that Tazhayakov got a text from Tsarnaev one and a half hours after the bombing which killed three and injured almost 300 that said, 'Don't go thinking it's me.' Going on, the prosecutor said that they will reveal other text messages between Tayazhakov and Dias Kadyrbayev that show the two knew it was Dzhokhar and his 25-year-old brother Tamerlan who had committed the bombings four hours before the FBI revealed their names publicly. Friends: Azamat Tazhayakov and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pictured here in a photo prior to April 2013 . Indeed, the alleged crimes that the two men committed date from three days after the attack on the marathon, on the evening of Thursday, April 18, 2013. Only hours before the FBI had released pictures of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan and had asked for the public's help in identifying the two men. Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev, both 20 and from Kazakhstan, are accused of rushing to Dzhokhar Tamerlan's dormitory room and removing his backpack which contained fireworks emptied of gunpowder and his laptop. They allegedly threw the bag behind a dumpster in a New Bedford apartment that they shared according to The Boston Globe. The two men were brought into custody by the FBI and during questioning admitted were the backpack was. The two men face obstruction of justice charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Also accused: Tazhayakov has pleaded not guilty to obstruction of justice and conspiracy charges. He and his roommate, Dias Kadyrbayev, (pictured) went to Tsarnaev's University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room several days after the bombing and removed a backpack, fireworks that had been emptied of their black powder and a laptop computer, prosecutors say . The lawyer for a man charged with obstructing the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombing denied on Monday that his client removed a laptop and backpack containing fireworks from the bombing suspect's dorm room three days after the deadly attack. Defense attorney Nicholas Wooldridge said in his opening statement that Azamat Tazhayakov took nothing except a pair of headphones that were his property when he went to the room of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of helping his brother in the April 15, 2013, blasts. Tazhayakov is the first of three of Tsarnaev's friends to face trial for hampering the investigation of the bombing and Wooldridge said it was his friend and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev who took the laptop from the room and dropped it in a dumpster. Kadyrbayev is awaiting trial later this year on similar charges. Prosecutors contend that Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev removed items from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth at his request after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, as suspects in the bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. 'Dias is the one that took that bag back to the apartment, not Azamat,' Wooldridge said. 'Azamat never touched that bag.' Neither man is charged with a role in the bombing. But prosecutors contended Tazhayakov believed Tsarnaev was the bomber when he went to his dorm room on the night of April 18, 2013. Deadly: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race in this photo taken as the second of two devices detonated on April 15, 2013 . 'When they removed all these things, the defendant thought that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Siegmann said in an opening statement. 'The defendant and his roommate took all these steps, removing evidence, hiding evidence ... for one reason, one reason: to protect their close friend, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.' Tazhayakov, 20, could face 25 years in prison if convicted of charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty. Tazhayakov was dressed in a black suit and tie and did not speak at the start of his trial in U.S. District Court in Boston. Authorities said his actions delayed the arrest of Tsarnaev, who is also charged with killing a police officer at about the time the three friends were in his room. Tsarnaev is accused of working with his now-dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injured more than 260. His trial is scheduled for November . Prosecutors said Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev and a third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, recognized Tsarnaev as one of the suspects in photos the FBI released after the blasts, which were the largest mass casualty attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001. They contacted Tsarnaev, who asked them to go to his dorm room and take anything they wanted. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, tried to leave Boston that night, with Tamerlan dying after a gun battle with police. Tsarnaev, 20, is awaiting trial on charges that carry the death penalty if he is convicted. Phillipos faces the lesser charge of lying to investigators. Wooldridge urged the jury to remember that Tazhayakov is charged only with obstruction and conspiracy and not focus on emotional reactions to the attack. 'What is this case about? Well I’ll tell you what it’s not about: The bombing,' Wooldridge said. 'Don’t get shocked and awed. Stay clear and stay focused.'","Federal prosecutors began their opening statements to jurors on Monday as Azamat Tazhayakov, 20, went on trial .

Van drivers were 47 per cent more likely to be involved in a crash when they were following other drivers too closely, the survey by Axa Business Insurance found. The survey also found van drivers were much more likely than other drivers to crash while reversing, doing a U-turn and changing lanes, while they were more liable than other road users to get tired or distracted. Van drivers were found to be safer than the average driver in most UK regions, but much more likely than others to be involved in accidents in London and the northeast (File photo) But the survey also showed that van drivers were less likely to cause crashes at roundabouts, in towns and cities and while overtaking. They were also seen to be more confident drivers who were less likely to drink-drive and speed than other road users. While van drivers were found to be safer than the average driver in most UK regions, the study of more than 1.3 million police crash reports from 2008 to 2012 showed they were much more likely than others to be involved in accidents in London and in the north east of England.

"By . James  Nye . Two very different photographs have emerged of the Cleveland Browns quarterback from his Independence Day weekend away in Las Vegas that appear to show the former Heisman Trophy winner in compromising situations. One picture shows everyone's favorite NFL bad boy in an amorous clinch with Playboy model Dallas Nicole while the other shows the Browns draft pick rolling a $20 bill in the bathroom, leaving many wondering just what for? Scroll down for video . What is going on here? Johnny Manziel is pictured in a Las Vegas club bathroom rolling a $20 note . Indeed, having embarked on what seems like a non-stop party since Cleveland picked him up in May's draft, the 21-year-old has been living it up like a rock star. Like a man on a mission, Manziel has spent the past two months seemingly never far from a pool and never far from a pretty girl and this weekend was no different when he was photographed with Playboy model Dallas Nicole. Just like the picture of Manziel in the bathroom with the rolled bank note leaked to Busted Coverage, the pictures of Manziel and Dallas have set tongues wagging, wondering if Manziel has worked more of his NFL magic as he tears through post-season. Party time: Johnny Manziel enjoyed his July 4 weekend with Playboy model Dallas Nicole . Indeed, whether it is at Justin Bieber's Los Angeles party or playing a simple bartender in Austin, Manziel seems to mix up his partying. However, the rookie has publicly said he is tiring of all the attention of how he spends his free time and has declared that he will not change his lifestyle for anyone. This has led some to wonder whether Manziel is trolling all of his hawk-eyed critics with the suggestive money rolling picture, because surely he would not dare be caught out and jeopardise his $8.25 million four-year contract? The player himself has said how aware he is of being followed round clubs by eager members of the public trying to record him engaging in unruly behavior. Texan girl: Dallas Nicole was pictured getting close to Johnny Manziel this Independence Day weekend in Las Vegas . Reading material: Dallas Nicole reads Playboy magazine for whom she works as a model . Day job: Cleveland Browns' Johnny Manziel throws a pass during an NFL football Play 60 youth event at the Cleveland Browns practice facility Friday, June 27, 2014, in Berea, Ohio . 'Now more than ever I've seen that it's an every-weekend thing wherever I'm at — whether it's in Cleveland on a weekend, or in Dallas or anywhere on a weekend, people want to record what I'm doing because they think it's a story.' The Cleveland Browns who recently asked Manziel to cool his wild partying have decline to comment on the picture which after all only shows a man rolling a note with no illegal activities pictured or drugs seen. Regardless, Manziel and Dallas were both pictured cozying up together - the two Texans looking very close as they enjoyed their July 4. Describing herself in her Facebook bio as a Playboy Model and bikini competitor, Dallas will surely set the internet on fire in the same way as it did when Manziel was spotted at a Rangers game with aspiring Maxim model Kyndal Kyaire in April.","Cleveland Browns draft pick photographed in two apparently compromising situations over Independence Day weekend .

"By . Paul Donnelley . If they are given a second thought at all, it is not for their architecture or beauty but usually how quickly can we get out of them. Enig Hui, a petroleum engineer from Miri, Malaysia, takes a different view. For the last six years he has photographed stations all around the world from Euston to Hotel De Ville station in Paris and Kintetsu Nara Station in Japan. Viennese fancy: Praterstern station, Vienna is used by 35,000 people daily. The first station on the site opened on January 6, 1838. It was damaged by bombs in the Second World War and was demolished in 1965. The new building was opened on June 1, 1959 . Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000 . Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River . Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978 . ‘I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,’ he says. ‘Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses. ‘A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.’ You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks. Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Police searching for the body of murdered Suzanne Pilley have identified a key new search area. The 38-year-old bookkeeper who disappeared in May 2010 on her way to work in her Edinburgh office was killed by her ex-lover David Gilroy who is serving a life sentence for her murder. He has always refused to say what he did with Miss Pilley’s body but after an emotional appeal on BBC's Crimewatch by her heartbroken family fresh information means her remains may finally be found. Missing: Suzanne Pilley, a 38-year-old bookkeeper, was murdered by her former lover David Gilroy who is serving a life sentence for her killing . A remote spot near Minard near Argyll, Scotland, is subject to a fresh, intensive police search in connection with Miss Pilley after a new witness came forward. Police have moved into the area following claims from a witness who saw Gilroy's silver car on the main road between Lochgilphead and Inverary the day after she vanished. The same witness also claims to have spotted Gilroy's Vauxhall Vectra at a quiet spot off the main A83 arterial route that runs through the area. Suzanne Pilley's parents, Rob and Sylvia made an appeal for information on Crimewatch earlier this month . Last night, Police Scotland confirmed that they were looking at the site in Minard. DCI Stuart Houston said: ‘The area of Minard, along with a number of areas in Argyll, did feature in the investigation. ‘Following the recent appeal on BBC's Crimewatch, officers have followed up on information that has been passed to police, which is subject to further investigation.’ Detectives believe Gilroy killed Suzanne Pilley in the basement of the Edinburgh building in which they worked but her body has never been found . Suzanne Pilley, 38, disappeared on her way to her bookkeeper's job in Edinburgh. She was murdered by her ex-boyfriend . Earlier this month, Miss Pilley’s heartbroken parents appealed on Crimewatch for Gilroy, 50, to reveal their daughter's final resting place. Grief stricken Sylvia Pilley sobbed as she said: ‘Justice had been done, but we felt so sad after it because we weren't going to get her back. She's lying somewhere and nobody knows, as if nobody loved her.’ Gilroy was found guilty by majority verdict on 15 March 2012 of the murder of Suzanne Pilley and of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He was jailed for life, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years. The Crimewatch reconstruction led to a witness who saw Gilroy's silver car on the main road between Lochgilphead and Inverary the day after Suzanne Pilley vanished . The case made legal history when Gilroy became the first convicted killer to have his sentencing filmed for British TV. During the investigation into her disappearance more than 200 searchers scoured 100,000 acres of land. Their earlier hunt focused on the Argyll Forest, targeting Glen Croe, and an area known as Hell's Glen.Gilroy's trial heard that the day after Suzanne disappeared, he drove his Vectra to Lochgilphead, some 13 miles from Minard. He was then spotted near Lochgilphead High School buying black bin bags .","Suzanne Pilley, 38, vanished on her way to work as a bookkeeper in Edinburgh .

"By . Stephen Adams . More than 3,500 people died unnecessarily in NHS hospitals last year because of mistakes and blunders, shocking new figures reveal. The number of ‘avoidable’ deaths admitted by NHS trusts in England rose by 25 per cent in a year, while experts warned ‘toxic overcrowding’ could contribute to even more fatalities in overstretched hospitals this winter. The figures include cases where patients have died after being given the wrong medicines, have suffered fatal surgical mistakes or simply died because staff failed to spot they were deteriorating fast. Hundreds more vulnerable patients under mental health care have taken their own lives. The new figures, from the National Reporting and Learning System, show the number of patients who died due to safety incidents rose from 2,864 in 2011/12 to 3,588 in 2012/13. Thousands more were reported as suffering harm while in hospital. With the NHS braced for what many believe will be its toughest winter ever, medical experts fear there will be even more serious ‘patient safety incidents’ in the coming year. Leading A&E doctor Clifford Mann said official figures showed emergency departments were ten per cent busier than last year, presenting a risk of ‘toxic overcrowding’. ‘If it’s overcrowded, the quality of care suffers. Worse than that, mortality rates rise,’ said Dr Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine. ‘If a doctor is dealing with six patients when they might normally deal with four, they will not be able to review their patients as regularly.’ Paramedics have warned that closing A&E departments is costing lives because it forces them to resuscitate patients in ambulances . Overcrowding could also lead to patients being discharged because there were no beds available, Dr Mann added, resulting in them dying due to a lack of medical attention. Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said ‘obvious’ blunders like medicine errors and surgical mistakes claimed lives but less obvious faults could also be fatal. ‘It could be something as simple as letting a bedsore develop, which becomes infected,’ he said. Sometimes staff are so busy, they failed to realise a patient is going downhill until too late, he added. Howard Catton, of the Royal College of Nursing added that there was now ‘a solid evidence base’ that not having enough nurses on wards ‘increases the risk of things like medical errors, pressure sores and patients having trips and falls’. Dr Alistair Douglas, president of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ‘Hospitals are already very close to being full to bursting. Every day doctors are hoping more patients will leave than need to come in – but that doesn’t always happen.’ Errors in acute hospital trusts account for almost half reported deaths, with 1,463 dying due to safety incidents, up 10 per cent. At Croydon Health Services NHS Trust in South London, 66 died. Second was Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, with 44 deaths. Yet neither was included in last summer’s review of hospital trusts with high death rates, led by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. Paramedic Alan Bush quit his job five months after Newark A&E in Nottinghamshire closed . In fact, none of the 10 hospital trusts where the most patients died last year due to blunders were part of the Keogh Review, raising the possibility watchdogs are missing problem hospitals. However, the Care Quality Commission did recently give both Croydon and Nottingham ‘high risk’ ratings, and results of intensive new inspections will be published soon. Deaths due to mistakes at mental health trusts showed the biggest annual rise, from 1,285 to 1,909. However, that was largely due to new reporting rules stating all suicides of patients should be classed as safety incidents. Commenting on the figures, Dr Mike Williams, a former hospital chief executive who lectures at Exeter University, said: ‘I think it’s just the tip of the iceberg.’ Hospital managers are now legally obliged to report all incidents leading to severe harm or death. But Dr Williams said in many places a culture of not owning up remains. ‘What is recorded is just a small amount of what happens,’ he said. Dr Frances Healey, associate director of patient safety at NHS England, argued the increasing number of fatal safety incidents was the result of better reporting. She added it was impossible to compare trusts because they still reported the figures in different ways. The Croydon trust said its figures on fatal patient safety incidents were ‘inaccurate and inconsistent with the true picture of care’. Paramedics have warned that closing A&E departments is costing lives because it forces them to resuscitate patients in ambulances. They said they struggle to perform life-saving CPR as they are flung around inside speeding ambulances diverted to other hospitals. Alan Bush, 60, who was a paramedic for 30 years, quit five months after Newark A&E in Nottinghamshire closed. NHS bosses had ordered Mr Bush to drive heart attack and stroke victims to hospitals such as King’s Mill near Mansfield, 23 miles away. He said: ‘It was one reason why I quit. The closure put patients at risk.’ Stressing the difficulties of performing CPR inside ambulances, he added: ‘Sometimes, I’ve fallen on the floor and injured myself. It’s always better to do CPR on a hospital flat bed than in an ambulance.’NHS figures, from a Freedom of Information request, show that in 2008 the number of patients from Newark who died on their way to King’s Mill was seven. In 2011, when Newark A&E closed down, the so-called dead-on-arrival figures increased to 11. By 2012 the number had jumped to 12. Dr Clive Peedell, of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘If you close down A&E wards, more people will die on their way to hospital.’ A spokesman for Newark and Sherwood Clinical Commissioning Group said: ‘If patients are gravely ill they are taken to the hospital with the facilities that best serves their needs.’","Surgical errors of busy staff causes 25 percent fatality hike .

"By . Darren Boyle . This is the heart-stopping moment two British sailors are washed off the side of a yacht as it is capsizes while being buffeted by 115mph winds. Sarah Usher and Liz Richards are seen desperately trying to grab hold of the 70ft boat as they are swept overboard when the freak weather conditions hit. Their 70ft yacht was blown onto one side as the wind built then smashed almost 180 degrees onto the other as the tornado struck. Scroll down for video . The 70ft racing yacht is sailing in the Pacific Ocean north of Papua New Guinea in January when it capsizes . In seconds, the boat is thrown sideways by the 115mph winds, washing two of the crew overboard . The vessel remains on its side for more than 60 seconds as the tornado passes over the yacht . Winds of more than 115mph pinned the capsized yacht down for around 60 seconds. Dramatic footage of the ordeal shows the boat’s crew dragging the pair out of the water and back on board the boat as the winds ease. The tornado can then be seen disappearing into the distance as the boat returns to upright. Ms Usher, 34, from Hull, East Yorkshire, and Ms Richards, 65, from Dartmouth, Devon, were both wearing life jackets at the time and were shaken but uninjured in the ordeal. They were part of an 18-strong crew on the Great Britain yacht competing in the Clipper Round the World Race, a 40,000-mile yacht race for amateur sailors. The footage, filmed from a camera fixed to the yacht’s mast, was taken in the Pacific Ocean just north of Papua New Guinea in January as the fleet raced from Brisbane to Singapore. It was released by race organisers as the fleet of 12 boats begins the final leg of the race from Den Helder in the Netherlands to the finish in London today. It comes just months after London sailor Andrew Taylor, 46, was swept overboard a rival yacht in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Andrew was rescued after spending 90 minutes in the water. Sarah Usher, left, and Liz Richards, right were both washed overboard after the 70ft yacht they were aboard was hit by a tornado just north of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean in January . Like many of the competitors, Ms Usher, who manages sports events, had never sailed before signing up to to the race. She joined the crew for the legs from Sydney to Hobart in Australia then from Brisbane to Singapore. She said: 'We had been through a lot of squalls in the race and so we had a routine and we knew what we were doing. 'We could see another squall was coming and so another team mate and I went up to the mast to help reduce our sails. 'I couldn’t reach the mast from where I was so unclipped my safety line to clip it onto the mast and in that split second the waterspout hit. 'I remember being hit by a rush of water. I lost my balance and the force of the water just took me over the side. As the winds begin to subside, the boat rights itself allowing the crew to safely rescue the two women . She said: 'I was shouting at my crew ‘I’m not clipped on, I’m not clipped on!’ My heart was in my mouth - it was pretty frightening. 'As the waterspout passed the boat started to right itself and I scrabbled around trying to grab hold of anything I could. 'Liz was also in the water next to me. Our team mates were able to grab us and pull us back onboard. 'It all happened so quickly and yet it felt like it was going on forever. 'The tornado passed and we were told to go down into the cabin. I was shaken but the support of the crew was amazing. 'After a while I was able to rejoin my watch on deck and I slowly got back into doing my jobs around the boat. 'It hasn’t put me off sailing but it has given me a new respect for the sea.' Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, founder and chairman of the race, praised the crew of the yacht for their response to the drama. He said: 'What this video shows is how well trained the crews are. 'They’re racing along on a 70ft boat and the next thing they know they are hit by a tornado and the boat is knocked onto its side. 'The forces inside these funnels wind are huge but no-one was hurt, everyone knew exactly what to do. 'The boat rights itself as soon as the tornado passes and the crew deal with the situation very quickly and professionally. 'It is incredibly rare to be hit by a tornado but our crews spend months being trained for every possibility.' The Clipper Round the World Race teams are expected to arrive at Tower Bridge on Saturday. More than 670 amateur sailors from all over the world have taken part in this year’s race, the ninth edition of the event, which started in Tower Bridge in September last year. The youngest sailor was 18 and the oldest was 74.","The 70ft yacht capsized after being struck by 115 mph tornado-force winds .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Ex-Emmerdale star Cy Chadwick at Leeds Crown Court where he is facing charges of indecent assault . A former star of the soap Emmerdale star has gone on trial accused of forcing a young boy who looked up to him ‘like a big brother’ to perform a sex act on him. Cy Chadwick, 45, who played Nick Bates for ten years in the programme, is alleged to have indecently assaulted a boy between September 1985 and September 1987, when the schoolboy was eight or nine-years-old. The complainant was sleeping on a camp bed when the alleged abuse took place, a court heard. Now in his 30s, the complainant only reported it to police in May last year, telling police in a video interview that he came forward ‘because it’s always in the news - it’s constantly on my mind’. ‘How did I know he’s not done it to anybody else at the time. I thought he was going to get to be an old man and do it to someone else,’ he said during the interview played to Leeds Crown Court. ‘Something’s got to be done.’ Addressing the jury before the opening of Chadwick’s trial today, Judge Neil Clark told them: ‘The defendant played a part in the soap Emmerdale. It’s important when you hear the evidence, please remember you’re trying the defendant Cy Chadwick – not a character in the show and not the character he played in the show. Ex-Emmerdale star Cy Chadwick leaves Leeds Crown Court earlier today where he is accused of assaulting a small boy . ‘You try the case on what you hear in this room, about this man and not the character he played. You should try him in the same way as anyone else who appears before this court.’ Prosecuting, Geraldine Kelly told the court that Chadwick used to take the schoolboy out on day trips in his car, and giving him gifts, including a record player and records. The complainant, talking in a police interview video which was shown to the court, told: ‘We were friendly. ‘I looked up to him as a big brother to be honest.’ The Fox And Grapes pub in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, was owned by the mother and stepfather of Cy Chadwick and where the abuse is alleged to have happened . Asked what they would usually do together, the complainant said: ‘Just messing around with stuff. Board games, normal stuff. He used to take me out.‘I liked him. I did. ‘He bought me a record player, records, little trinkets which obviously I thought was brilliant. ‘He had the fanciest equipment anyone could buy because he had loads of money, obviously. He had every electrical gadget you could buy. ‘He had records, turntables, computers, fancy TVs.’ The complainant told how on the night in question he had been lying on the camp bed while Chadwick was lying on his bed, when Chadwick pulled back the covers. It is alleged that Chadwick said to the schoolboy: ‘Put it in your mouth, this is what grown-ups do when they’re friends’. The boy allegedly obeyed after which he described feeling ‘sick’ and ‘peculiar’. Afterwards, Chadwick told the boy ‘not to say anything’, and left the room, sleeping elsewhere, the court heard. The complainant said he had not seen Chadwick since. Chadwick, who now works in TV production and lives in Pudsey, West Yorks., watched the evidence silently from the dock. He denies one charge of indecent assault between September 17, 1985 and September 17, 1987. The trial continues.

Host nation Brazil narrowly scraped through to the Quarter-Finals of the World Cup in a nail-biting finish to this Group of 16 tie against Chile.

The Chileans had a different view and took the game to the hosts who are bidding to be world champions for the sixth time.

So amidst the celebrations, the performance could be forgotten. Timid and lacking in fluency, Brazil limped over the line. Perhaps . they will grow into a champion mentality with each hurdle they clear. Yesterday they created more chances than Chile but for long periods were . out-thought tactically by a delightfully composed Chilean side, . directed by Jorge Sampaoli. In . fact, they were lucky even to get to penalties. In the last minute of . extra time, Maurico Pinilla exchanged passes with Alexis Sanchez and . fairly thumped the ball of the cross bar, as Brazilians looked on aghast . and bewildered. That overpowering sense of expectation for a sixth world title mixed with a fevered outbreak of nationalism created an extraordinary entrance for the Brazil team with the stadium fairly shook as the din engulfed it throughout the spectacle. The National Anthem increased the volume still further: even the mascots had their arms around each other and were bellowing it out. On this occasion the players managed to repress their tears that have characterised previous games and led to fears that the occasion was overwhelming them. On a darker note, parts of the Chilean national anthem were obscured by a din of whistles: it’s not all Carnival and sunshine in Brazil.

Referee: Howard Webb (England) Before the match, the most-heated . discussions had surrounded the anticipated performance of Howard Webb, . the Chileans fearing that referees here are under pressure to favour . Brazil. The Brazilians in turn countered that the Chileans were . themselves putting Webb under pressure not to award them tight . decisions. And the . Yorkshireman was soon put to the test, with Neymar playing in Hulk on 13 . minutes. The Brazilian forward, in the penalty area, raced towards goal . but Mauricio Isla nicked the ball from between his legs. Down went Hulk . and the Mineirao Satdium roared in anctipation but Webb, correctly, . waved away the appeals to howls of anguish. They . need not have protested quite so fervently. Within five minutes they . were ahead from a bog-standard set piece. Neymar drilled in a corner, . Thiago Silva angled the flick on to the far post and though David Luiz . was there to direct it home, it was actually the out-stretched leg of . Eugenio Jara who diverted it into the net. Luiz wasn’t waiting for a . dubious goals’ panel to deliberate, racing away accepting the adoration . of the crowd and team-mates. At that stage, it looked to be a long . afternoon for the Chileans. Talking point: Brazil had a goal disallowed by referee Howard Webb for Hulk's (left) handball . Fuming: Chile players protested against Hulk's goal to Webb (top right) who disallowed the strike .

Fantastic three: Brazil fans soak up the atmosphere by dressing up as fictional characters Spiderman and Hulk . Yet . Brazil have been a strange mixture at this World Cup; at times they . play with real verve and incision; but they can also look an anxious . group of young men, unsure whether they can bear the weight of . expectation. Equally, Chile have been one the joys of the tournament, . playing some of the best football. And . with Brazil reverting to their tentative demeanour and Chile refusing . to be cowed, a small earthquake occurred in Belo Horizonte: Chile . scored. The manner of the goal amply demonstrated Brazil’s nerves. A . Marcelo throw-in was sloppily touched back to him by Hulk; Eduardo . Vargas nipped in and played it first time to Alexis Sanchez. The . Liverpool target simply took one touch to control and a second to score . with a fine finish from inside the box. In small pockets of the stadium, . small red corners erupted and embraced each other. Yet everywhere else . there was a stunned sense of disbelief. Brazil . would respond. Fred should have done better from close range when Isla . did enough to encourage him to blaze a shot over rather than direct it . goal-wards from close range; Dani Alves had an excellent strike well . saved by Claudio Bravo; and Neymar clearly had the measure of Francisco . Silva and Gary Medel, frequently out-running them. But Chile also threatened with Sanchez playing in Charles Aranguiz on half time, forcing . Julio Cesar to make a smart save. All smiles: Barcelona team-mates Neymar, Sanchez and Dani Alves (left-right) joke before the game . Beautiful scenes: Chile and Brazil fans illuminated the Estadio Minearao with their vibrant team colours . Strapped up: Gary Medel receives treatment for a muscle injury during half-time of extra-time on Saturday . Brazil . attempted to regroup. Fernandinho, staring is first match at the . tournament and replacing Tottenham’s Paulinho, sized up a shot on 48 . minutes. It flew just wide and the Manchester City midfield winced, yet . it steadied the crowd somewhat. Brazil, it seemed, would surely put this . right. Still greater . excitement ensued on 51 minutes, when Hulk raced on to a long ball, took . it down and touched it past Bravo. Belo Horizonte rejoiced but they had . reckoned without the prying eyes of assistant ref Michael Mullarkey, . who judged that Hulk had controlled the ball with both his shoulder and . arm. Heart-stopping moment: Brazil's poster boy Neymar (centre) receives treatment as he struggles with fatigue . It was a tight decision, probably correct but predictably it had . Luiz Felipe Scolari up off the bench and in a rage for much of the next . five minutes. The arrival of . Jo brought an expression of fresh hope from the crowd that would . bewilder Premier League audiences. And Chile it was who came closest to . scoring on 65 minutes. Mauricio Isla played a great one-two with Arturo . Vidal and then pulled the ball back for Aranguiz. He struck with power . from close range and if a nation could collectively gasp in premature . horror, this was that moment. Only a superb reflex save from Julio Cesar . prevented the national calamity. Yet . Chile were undeterred. Marcelo Diaz and Vidal in midfield were . establishing a grip on the game and Sanchez was a lurking threat. The . Brazilians continued to chant and to sing but it was the football . equivalent of whistling in the dark, for their team lacked the authority . you might have expected. As much was confirmed when Hulk delivered a . perfect cross into the path of Jo, who, three yards out from goal and . with just Bravo to beat, failed to make any contact with the ball.","Brazil beat Chile 3-2 to reach the World Cup quarter-finals .

Henty told the Sunday Telegraph from his £500,000 home where he also paints: 'Sometimes I have a power. I get relaxed and all of a sudden there is a Lowry. He has come down, inhabited my body and there is a picture. You do feel like that. I was the only one doing Lowrys at first and now everybody is doing them badly. This is what kills me. 'The one I did the other day [The Postbox] was a lovely Lowry. They are not knocked up in two hours.' He added: “I also do Monets. I love Monet. The Impressionists are quite easy to do. I am self taught. I have stacks of art books I read through. I can just do the signatures. You do get an affinity for the artist. You see things through their eyes. When I was in Spain I did loads of van Goghs.' LS Lowry is one of Britain's most influential artists of the 20th century whose work reflected industrial scenes in areas surrounding Salford . Lowry, who was born in Stretford, Lancashire painted his native north with his very distinctive characters often described as 'matchstick men' A eBay spokesperson said: 'Counterfeits are illegal and are not welcome on eBay. We take action against those who attempt to list counterfeit items and we are investigating the way we handled previous complaints against these sellers. 'We spend millions of pounds each year maintaining a safe site and have advanced detection measures and tools but we are sorry that in this instance we did not live up to our usual high standards in identifying and eliminating counterfeits. 'We have reviewed these accounts and recognise that some complaints have previously been received regarding counterfeits. In light of this, all these accounts and any others used by the sellers have now been suspended, and these individuals will not be permitted to sell on eBay again.'","David Henty produced the fake Lowrys in his £500,000 Brighton home .

"By . Darren Boyle . The number of manhole covers exploding has dramatically increased according to new figures released by the Health and Safety Executive.

Experts believe that water may have seeped into the high-voltage electric cable causing the explosion . Experts believe that the cables may have been damaged by contractors digging in the road or repairing other services. This allowed water to seep through the protective insulation layer causing the violent explosions. On Wednesday, a manhole cover blew up in Piccadilly destroying a van parked on the side of the street as theatre goers were heading home. One eyewitness Jon Hornbuckle Tweeted to say there had been numerous explosions and thick black smoke. 'That was scary, I was ten steps away and then BANG,' he wrote.

John Steed, the HSE's principal . specialist inspector told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Last year when we . recorded the increase, UK Power Networks sent off failed link boxes for . examination and it was concluded moisture was the predominant cause. 'We . called directors in, and we had a couple of meetings with them, and we . made it very clear to them that we are expecting them to manage their . assets a lot better, to carry out more inspections.' A spokesman for UK Power Networks said: 'We believe more faults are being reported and recorded, but this does not necessarily mean there has been an increase. 'Last year was one of the wettest years on record, which may also be a factor, because occasionally water can seep into cables which have been damaged by third parties.' UK Power Networks supplies electricity to eight million customers in London, the South East and East of England. Colin Wingate was severely injured when a manhole cover exploded in Harrow, north-west London in August 2011. He was confined to a wheelchair for three months following the blast.
