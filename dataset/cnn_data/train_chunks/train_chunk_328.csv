"(CNN) -- Sit! Shake! Quit barking! Get off the couch! Go find your toy! Ever wonder what your dog is thinking as it gazes at you while you are barking commands? Duke University's Canine Cognition Center in Durham, North Carolina, is one of the few labs in the country focused on how dogs think. ""We're excited about describing the psychology of our dogs,"" says professor Brian Hare, the lab's director. ""Different dogs solve different problems differently. And what we want to understand is: What is it that either makes dogs remarkable as a species or what is it that constrains the ability of dogs to solve problems?"" To test the dogs' ability, Hare and a team of graduate students put dogs through a variety of games similar to those you might play with young children. ""We don't want to look at cute pet tricks. What we want to know is, what does the dog understand about its world?"" Hare said. Hare has been analyzing our four-legged friends for about 15 years. He says dogs have figured out how to read human behavior and human gestures better than any other species has, even chimpanzees. ""The way they think about their world is that people are superimportant and they can solve almost any problem if they rely on people,"" says Hare. Children start relying on adults' gestures when they're about a year old. That's about the same age that dogs start to recognize and rely on humans, too, Hare says. When both I and Hare tried to direct Hare's dog Tazzie to a cup that had a treat in it, Tazzie took his master's cue and went toward the cup. I was a stranger to Tazzie, so the dog didn't rely on my information. ""He's grown up with me,"" says Hare. ""We do lots of stuff together. He's never met you before, so he's saying, look, if they're both telling me where to go, I'm going to trust the guy who I'm with all the time."" According to Hare, this proves dogs are complex social animals who understand they have different relationships with different people. ""They really narrow in and pay attention to you and they want to know what it is about the world that you can help them with,"" he says. Researchers at Duke are studying dogs to better understand their limitations. If they can identify why dogs make mistakes, they believe they can help them improve. That could mean making dogs better at working with people with disabilities or better at working with the military. ""They are a very different species and they think about the world differently than we do. And we need to figure out what are the constraints on how they solve problems, how is it that they think differently from us. And I think that we're going to be able to have a much, even richer relationship with dogs than we already do if we figure all that out,"" says Hare. The professor says even though domestication has made dogs smarter, they are not perfect. Still, they're so smart, he says, that they can understand the principle of connectivity. ""They know they're connected on a leash and [dogs reason] 'Well, now I have to listen, because if I don't do what you say you can stop me. Where if I'm ... not on a leash, well, yeah, I know the command but I don't have to listen to you now,'"" explains Hare. And just like children, dogs also understand that if you turn your back, they can misbehave, especially after their owners have told them not to do something. ""Your dog takes the food you just told it not to take, and you're really upset because your dog disobeyed you, and you think that your dog is not obedient. Well, no, no, no, your dog was obedient but it realized that it could get away with it,"" says Hare. At the end of the day, dogs may rely on humans, but they also use their skills to manipulate their owners and the world they live in. And even though dog owners like to think they're in command, the professor says it may actually be Fido who is really in charge. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- On Thursday in Tampa, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel presided over a change of command ceremony during which Adm. William ""Bill"" McRaven handed over the reins of Special Operations Command to his successor, Gen. Joseph Votel. As McRaven stepped down he observed, ""We are in perilous times."" He pointed out that U.S. Special Operations Forces are helping to fight the fast-growing Islamic State in Iraq; the al Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines; the militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria, and al Qaeda and the Taliban in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. McRaven also said, ""We are in the golden age of Special Operations"" in which elements of the 67,000 men and women under his command have deployed to 92 countries. Now, after more than 3Â½ decades working in the world of special operations, Bill McRaven, 58, is retiring. In his next incarnation he will become chancellor of the University of Texas. As Hagel pointed out in his speech on Thursday that celebrated McRaven's storied career, no one has written McRaven's full history, but if it ever was to be written it ""would need to be heavily redacted"" because so much of it took place in the ""black"" (secret) arena. ""Revered"" is the word you often hear about McRaven in the special operations community. That's in part because even as a three-star admiral, about once a month in Afghanistan, McRaven went out with his teams on risky snatch-and-grab missions. (His predecessor as the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, also went out regularly on such missions and is similarly held in the highest regard.) The book . Hagel pointed out in his Thursday speech that McRaven also has ""literally written the book on Special Operations."" Indeed, McRraven's 1995 book, ""Spec Ops,"" is the standard text on the subject. It features lucid dissections of eight decisive special operations actions, ranging from the British forces who used midget submarines to badly damage the Tirpitz, a key Nazi battleship, in 1943; to the Nazi rescue the same year of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from his anti-Fascist captors; to the raid at Entebbe in 1976 that freed Israeli hostages held in Uganda by Palestinian terrorists. For his book, McRaven interviewed many of the key participants in the raids that he examined, and he traveled to the sites of the operations. After a careful investigation of each raid, he identified six common principles that had made these operations a success: repetition, surprise, security, speed, simplicity and purpose. -- Repetition meant frequent and realistic rehearsals so that the ""friction"" of actual battle was reduced. -- Surprise meant catching the enemy entirely off guard; for example, the Nazi rescuers of Mussolini crash-landed gliders on a mountain near the hotel where the Fascist leader was being held and rescued him without a shot being fired. -- Security meant confining the knowledge of the operation to a small circle. -- Speed meant that ""relative superiority"" over the enemy needed to be achieved in the first few minutes of the attack, and that the entire mission should be completed in no more than a half-hour. -- Simplicity ensured that the goal of the operation was well understood by each of the soldiers involved -- ""release the hostages"" at Entebbe. -- Purpose meant that the soldiers were completely committed to the mission. But McRaven's influence on ""spec ops"" goes far beyond just the book he wrote. McRaven helped establish a curriculum at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. And after taking up a job in the White House just weeks after 9/11, he became one of the principal authors of the Bush administration's counterterrorism strategy. During the Iraq War, McRaven led the shadowy Task Force 121, which tracked down Saddam Hussein in December 2003. Much of the public credit for Saddam's capture went to conventional army units, but it was, in fact, the Special Operations forces under McRaven's command who did much of the work to find the Iraqi dictator. Rescue of Capt. Phillips . From the beginning of the Obama presidency, McRaven has been the key to some of the most sensitive U.S. military operations. On the sweltering evening of April 13, 2009, several hundred miles off the coast of Somalia, as dusk deepened over the Indian Ocean, three shots rang out. All the bullets found their targets: three Somali pirates in a small, enclosed lifeboat bobbing on the darkening sea. For the previous five days the pirates had held hostage Richard Phillips, the American captain of the Maersk Alabama container ship. President Barack Obama had authorized the use of deadly force if Phillips' life was in danger. Unbeknownst to the pirates, the USS Bainbridge warship was shadowing them, and days earlier a contingent of SEALs had parachuted at night into the ocean near the Bainbridge. The SEALs had taken up positions on the fantail of the Bainbridge and were carefully monitoring Phillips and his captors. One of the pirates had just pointed his AK-47 at the American captain as if he were going to shoot him. That's when the SEAL team commander on the Bainbridge ordered his men to take out the pirates. Three U.S Navy SEAL sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall, killing them all. Obama called McRaven, then the leader of Joint Special Operations Command, to tell him, ""Great job."" The flawless rescue of Capt. Philips was the first time that Obama -- only three months into his new job -- had been personally exposed to the capabilities of America's secretive Special Operations counterterrorism units, whose skills Obama would come to rely upon increasingly with each year of his presidency. How bin Laden was found . It is, of course, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, that has ensured McRaven's place in the history books as the architect of the operation. During the spring of 2011 McRaven formulated the plan for the assault on the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where bin Laden was believed to be hiding. The planning for the raid was deeply informed by the key principles he had laid out in ""Spec Ops."" McRaven explained, ""It was a simple plan, carefully concealed, repeatedly rehearsed, and exercised with surprise, speed, and purpose."" Following extensive realistic rehearsals of the raid in both North Carolina and Nevada that included a full-scale model of the compound bin Laden was believed to be hiding in, McRaven went to the White House to give Obama his assessment of the plausibility of the mission. When he was outlining to the President and his war cabinet the planned Abbottabad helicopter raid, McRaven said, ""In terms of difficulty, compared to what we're doing on a nightly basis in Afghanistan, what we're doing in Iraq, this is not among the most difficult missions technically. The difficult part is the sovereignty issue with Pakistan and flying for a long stretch of time over Pakistani airspace."" Obama knew that the intelligence regarding bin Laden's presence at the compound was always circumstantial, but the president had confidence that McRaven and his men would be able to execute the mission successfully, whether the al Qaeda leader was in fact at the Abbottabad compound, or not. The night of the raid, when one of the stealth helicopters carrying a SEAL team crashed inside bin Laden's compound, McRaven -- who was narrating the progress of the operation from his command post in Afghanistan to the White House -- didn't skip a beat, saying without altering his tone: ""We will now be amending the mission."" Around 15 minutes after the helicopter had crashed, on his audio feed, McRaven heard a SEAL team member give the code word ""Geronimo."" Each step of the operation had been labeled with a letter of the alphabet, and G meant that bin Laden was ""secured."" McRaven relayed the ""Geronimo"" to the White House. He assumed that meant bin Laden was now dead, but suddenly thought, ""What if we captured him?"" So McRaven asked the SEAL ground force commander, ""Is he EKIA [enemy killed in action]?"" A few seconds later, the answer came back: ""Roger, Geronimo EKIA."" Then McRaven announced to the White House, ""Geronimo EKIA."" There were gasps in the situation room, but no whoops or high fives. The President quietly said, ""We got him, we got him."" What's next for special operations . On Thursday, McRaven gave his final speech as the leader of American Special Operations. In his dress whites, the famously unflappable four-star admiral concluded, his voice quavering with emotion, ""It has been the greatest honor of my life to lead the men and women of Special Operations Command."" The United States owes a real debt to McRaven and to his wife, Georgeann, who, like many other military spouses, has also served her country stoically as her husband deployed repeatedly to war zones after 9/11. McRaven's successor General Votel, previously led the military's elite and secretive Joint Special Operations Command, which comprises units such as SEAL Team 6 and the Army's Delta Force. As a colonel, Votel led the unit that five weeks after the 9/11 attacks established the first U.S. military base in Afghanistan and is widely viewed as the right officer to succeed McRaven. As the United States and its allies pivot away from the post-9/11 conventional wars but still face threats from jihadist militants in countries in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa, Special Operations Forces working ""by, with and through"" local militaries will be a key part of future U.S. military operations. Among his other legacies, McRaven has put in place a Global Special Operations Forces network, which in practice mean a small presence of U.S. Special Operations and Special Forces personnel in dozens of countries around the world. The goal of that network is twofold: To be better positioned to respond to an immediate crisis, such as the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi in 2012, and also to build up the capacity of local militaries so they can keep the peace themselves.","Peter Bergen: Adm.

"(CNN) -- Arizona Cardinals backup running back Jonathan Dwyer has been released on bond after his arrest in connection with domestic abuse allegations, authorities said Thursday. The Cardinals deactivated Dwyer after news of the arrest, according to a news release from the team. CNN's calls to the office of Dwyer's agent, Adisa Bakari, weren't immediately returned. An announcement from the Phoenix Police Department said two incidents allegedly occurred on consecutive days in late July. They were reported last week. Detectives interviewed Dwyer, and he ""admitted to the incidents, however, denied any physical assaults,"" the police statement said. According to a court document, the incident began the morning of July 21, when after a verbal argument with his wife at their Phoenix apartment, Dwyer allegedly tried to kiss his wife and remove her clothing. She told him to stop several times, and ""when he continued, she bit the defendant's lip. He head-butted her in the face, which she later learned had caused a nasal bone fracture."" A neighbor called police because of ""the loud arguing,"" and when they arrived, Dwyer's wife told them that only she and her son were in the house, the document says. Dwyer acknowledged Wednesday that he was hiding in a bathroom at the time, according to police. Dwyer's wife said that the running back texted a photo of a knife, saying he didn't want to live, and threatened to kill himself in front of her and her son if she told police about the assault, the document says. On July 22, there was another argument, and Dwyer allegedly punched his wife on the left side of her face, according to the court document. ""He also began punching the walls, causing visible damage. The defendant then picked up a shoe and threw it, striking their 17-month-old son in the stomach,"" it says. The child was not injured. When his wife threatened to call police, Dwyer allegedly took her phone and threw it from their second-story residence, the document says. As his wife fled, witnesses heard her yell, ""He f---ing hit me; I'm calling the police."" Witnesses also reported seeing ""swelling and discoloration"" on the left side of her face, according to police. Police said he was booked on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault. The two victims were a 27-year-old woman and an 17-month-old child, police said. Dwyer posted bond and was released from the Maricopa County Jail on Thursday, according to a tweet from the county Sheriff's Office. The state had requested a $60,000 bond Wednesday, but the judge set a $25,000 ""cash-only"" bond and required Dwyer to wear an electronic monitoring device and abide by a curfew. He also can't have contact with the victims, leave the state of Arizona, possess weapons or drink alcohol. The Cardinals said they became aware of the allegations when contacted by police. Dwyer, 25, is the fourth NFL player to be in the headlines this week. Two other players, Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings and Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers, took paid leave from their teams to focus on their legal cases. Peterson has been charged in Texas with child abuse. Hardy has been convicted of misdemeanor assault charges in North Carolina and has been granted the opportunity to have a new trial, this time in front of a jury. And running back Ray Rice has an appeal with the NFL in connection with his indefinite suspension after a domestic violence incident. Dwyer is listed as the No. 2 running back for the Cardinals behind Andre Ellington. He is in his fifth NFL season and first with the Cardinals, and he has 51 yards on 16 carries in two games this year. NFL players out amid claims of violence .

"London (CNN) -- Coca-Cola -- the world's ubiquitous brown fizzy drink -- is staying afloat as the soda market shrinks, and many point to a marketing strategy around the so-called ""secret recipe"" as key to its resilience in a struggling industry. The Coca-Cola Company, which published its full year result Tuesday, recorded a 5% drop in net income to $8.6 billion last year, down from $9 billion in 2012, as it faced ""ongoing global macroeconomic challenges,"" according to its chief executive Muhtar Kent. Volume grew 2% for the year, which it said was ""below our expectations and long-term growth target,"" with sparkling beverages recording a slight increase of 1% -- led by Coca-Cola. Globally, soda drink sales have been shrinking as consumers turn to water, fruit drinks and healthier alternatives. The trend has hit Coke and other market players such as PepsiCo and Dr. Pepper. And while its primary competitor, PepsiCo, depends on its snack business to buoy the declining soda sales, Coke announced further investment into its marketing. In a tough market, one strategy that brand experts credit Coke's relative strength with is the mystery around the much-hyped ""secret recipe."" ""The very idea of mystery attracts attention, and is often seen as an element of quality,"" says social psychologist and marketing expert Ben Voyer, lecturer at London School of Economics and ESCP Europe Business School. ""A typical consumer would think that it must be a valuable product if they are doing all these things to protect the recipe."" Coca-Cola's ""secret recipe"" story -- on which it has centered advertising campaigns and built into its corporate museum --- reaches back nearly a century. According to the multi-national's website, the original recipe was only written down in 1919, more than half a century after a reported morphine addict and pharmacist John Pemberton invented the drink in 1886. Until then, it was passed down by word of mouth. The formula was finally committed to paper when a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff took out a loan to purchase the company in 1919. ""As collateral, he provided a written record of the Coca Cola secret formula,"" Coke said in a statement on its site. Since the 1920s, the document sat locked in a bank in Atlanta, until Coca-Cola decided to emphasize the secret in its marketing strategy. 86 years later, Coca-Cola moved the recipe into a purpose-built vault within the World of Coca-Cola, the company's museum in Atlanta. The ambiance is made complete by red lighting and fake smoke. Coca-Cola has always claimed only two senior executives know the formula at any given time, although they have never revealed names or positions. But according to an advertising campaign based around the recipe, they can't travel on the same plane. The vault, like one straight from a film, has a palm scanner, a numerical code pad and massive steel door. Inside its walls, there's another safe box with more security features. And inside that, a metal case containing what its owners call ""the most guarded trade secret in the world."" A piece of paper with, according to Coca-Cola, a recipe inside. But Mark Pendergrast, author of ""For God, Country & Coca-Cola,"" is skeptical. ""John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886, at the height of the patent medicine era, and one of the ironies of that name is that no one actually patented such creations,"" he says. ""They kept the formulas secret, partly in order to increase sales with a sense of special mystery and to prevent competition, but also to keep people from knowing how cheap the ingredients were and how large the profits,"" he says. The company has never patented the formula, saying to do so would require its disclosure. And once the patent expired, anyone would be able to use that recipe to produce a generic version of the world famous drink. ""[The secrecy] creates a natural curiosity about the product itself. Consumers are more likely to try to find out the recipe,"" Voyer says, adding it creates a legend around Coca Cola's flagship drink. Scores of recipes have emerged through the decades. Their authors usually claim to have cracked the original recipe by getting hold of antique documents. So far, Coke has rejected all of them as fantasy, saying there is only one ""'real thing'."" Mark Pendergrast's book includes two versions of the original formula. ""One is a facsimile in the handwriting of Frank Robinson, the 'unsung hero' of Coca-Cola who named the drink, wrote the famous script logo, manufactured the drink in its early days, and advertised it,"" he says. Does he think the recipe is genuine? ""Yes. I think that both of the Coca-Cola formulas in my book are the 'real thing,' versions of the original formula for Coca-Cola,"" he says. ""In the end, the exact formula isn't really the issue,"" he says. Pendergrast reiterates a tale told in his book, in which he speaks to a Coca-Cola spokesperson who points out that even if its competitors got hold of the formula, they wouldn't be able to compete. ""Why would anyone go out of their way to buy Yum-Yum, which is really just like Coca-Cola but costs more, when they can buy the Real Thing anywhere in the world?,"" he was told.

"(CNN) -- Social-networking giant Facebook has entered the check-in world. Facebook executives on Wednesday announced the launch of Facebook Places, which -- similar to services such as Foursquare and Gowalla -- will allow people to use the GPS on their mobile phones to let friends know exactly where they are. Facebook Places is available immediately in the United States through the latest version of Facebook's iPhone app and, for other advanced mobile phones, through the company's site for advanced mobile devices, executives announced at Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Users who wish to announce their location to their friends on Facebook would tap a ""check in"" button to see a list of places nearby, and then choose the place that matches where they are. ""After checking in, your check-in will create a story in your friends' News Feeds [on Facebook] and show up in the Recent Activity section on the page for that place,"" Places product manager Michael Sharon wrote on Facebook's blog. What do you think of the new feature? Facebook staff also said the feature will be useful not only to let friends know where they are, but also to learn if their friends are nearby at the same time, and to write down what they are doing at the location and what they think about it -- creating a trail allowing friends to see what the writer did there days or even years ago. When users check into a place, they also can ""tag"" any Facebook friends who are with them, essentially letting other friends know that the person is there, too. To cut down on the potential for users to falsely tag friends to a place, people can tag friends only if the taggers themselves check in to the location, too. Sharon, speaking during Wednesday's announcement, said Places has other safeguards to address potential privacy concerns. First, check-ins will appear only to users' Facebook friends as a default, and users can further trim the recipients list to specific friends. Users also can remove check-ins by phone or web at any time, Sharon said. Facebook said it would make Places available in other countries and on more mobile platforms soon. Facebook staff said the company planned to let Foursquare, Gowalla and other services enhance their current integration with Facebook. Executives with Foursquare and Gowalla were at Wednesday's announcement in Palo Alto, previewing plans to ramp up how their users will announce their locations on the social-networking site. The past year has seen big growth in the relatively new mobile check-in space. Foursquare, which essentially made its debut in 2009 at the South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas, was one of the combatants in a so-called ""Location War"" at this year's festival, going heads-up with Austin-based rival Gowalla. Since then, Foursquare has become the clear favorite of the two -- and a darling of tech media, even as it looks for ways to turn a profit. Boasting a half-million users at the start of SXSW, Foursquare doubled that in about a month then needed only another three months to hit 2 million last month. On mobile apps like Foursquare, users ""check in"" at restaurants, bars, movie theaters or just about anywhere else they visit. The idea is twofold -- to let friends know what you're up to, while racking up points and earning virtual badges in the application's gaming element. The New York-based Foursquare has begun forging some corporate partnerships and some businesses have started offering discounts and other deals for users who check in frequently. Facebook, with its half-billion users, represents a massive potential user base for Places. CNN's Doug Gross and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Facebook makes announcement at its headquarters on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A tap water ban affecting hundreds of thousands of people in Ohio was lifted Monday after tests in affected neighborhoods returned ""nondetectable"" levels of a algae-related toxin, Toledo Mayor D. Michael Collins said. ""Our water is safe,"" Collins said. ""The families can return to normal life."" Residents and businesses that did not use their water at all -- not even for showering or washing hands, both of which were allowed under the ban -- will need to run their water first to help flush their systems, Collins said, but ""if you've been using water all along, just go on with life."" Collins said the city would provide details later Monday about flushing systems. Residents of Ohio's fourth-largest city were told to avoid using their tap water all weekend after the state and federal Environmental Protection Agency showed high toxin levels in the East Toledo and Point Place neighborhoods, Collins said earlier Monday. Instead of isolating the two neighborhoods, Collins kept the ban on drinking or using tap water in the entire city until additional retests were completed. He declined to provide specifics on the names of neighborhoods in question and how high the toxin levels were. As many as 400,000 people were told not to consume, cook with or boil the tap water after a toxin called microcystin was found Friday in the water supply. Toledo's drinking water comes from Lake Erie, where a harmful algae bloom that causes microcystin has been growing. The city set up distribution centers for potable water, where members of the Ohio National Guard, fire officials and other first responders were giving out safe water. About 350 Ohio National Guardsmen were activated by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, according to a U.S. Defense Department official, adding that they set up three reverse osmosis water purification unit sites at two high schools and a police facility. The guardsmen also delivered ready-to-eat meals, the official said. Lining up for water . About two-thirds of the Toledo area was affected by the water warning. Kasich issued a state of emergency for Fulton, Lucas and Wood counties. The potential contamination also affected four municipalities in Michigan, CNN affiliate WXYZ-TV in Detroit reported. There were no reports of anyone getting sick from the water, officials said. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, algae can reproduce rapidly, forming a dense population known as a ""bloom,"" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Testing was crucial because NOAA says it can't determine just from images whether blooms are toxic. Ingestion of the toxin can affect the liver and cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and acute liver failure, according to NOAA. But the Ohio Emergency Management Agency said it was safe for adults to shower and for everyone to wash their hands. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, David Shortell, Ryan Sloane, Barbara Starr, Marisa Marcellino, Donovan Long and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The families can return to normal life,"" Toledo mayor says of water ban .

"Washington (CNN) -- Christopher Browne gets ready for snow long before any falls in Washington, which hasn't seen a stormy winter for a few years now. It's a crucial part of his job as manager of Dulles International Airport, one of the busiest jumping off points for international flights and a hub for those traveling to and from the nation's capital for official business. Delays, especially those due to turbulent weather, cost airlines money and passengers lost time and productivity. That puts pressure on airport personnel and heightens the need to plan far ahead for turbulent weather. ""If you were here earlier in the fall, you would see equipment running around and operating and acting as if there was 12 inches of snow on the runway,"" Browne said. ""It's better to set the expectation early, make the call and then with high assurance know that when you get back to an operation status that you will be able to meet all the demands,"" he said. Snows delay flights . His crews jumped into action for a surprise early March storm that moved from the Midwest into parts of Northern Virginia and Maryland. As heavy snow blanketed parts of the area, the Dulles plows moved swiftly up and down the long runways that handle jumbo jets and other big planes that need a lot of real estate to take off and land. Airports like Dulles keep more than 50 pieces of snow equipment handy for extreme winter weather. Their small army of plows are constantly in motion during a storm, sweeping away snow and keeping accumulation at a manageable level. Runways and other busy parts of the tarmac get priority. Gate areas themselves are generally the responsibility of the airlines. Dana Pitts, the Dulles operations manager, said certain areas sometimes can go without constant plowing. ""We can have two or three inches of snow buildup here and still have safe taxiway. As long as we don't have any physical obstructions, like a hill of snow for them to taxi through, this can sort of be left until a convenient time."" Pitts said. On either side of the Washington storm, airport operations in Denver, Chicago and Boston took care of business as snowy weather blasted those cities. Typically, airports remain open in snowstorms. It's up to airlines to decide the status of flights. Carriers lose millions of dollars every year to winter storms that affect their operations. Recent federal regulations penalizing them for long ground delays and stricter attention to costs of managing their fleets now prompt carriers to cancel flights ahead of big storms. ""Seventy-two hours out we start really closely watching storms and how they will impact us,"" said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United Airlines. ""We really do everything we can to cancel everything we have to cancel 24 hours out, giving people a chance to make a decision about their travel plans before they get to the airport,"" she said. For instance, United canceled more than 250 flights ahead of a storm that was expected to hit Denver on Saturday. Southwest Airlines pulled back another 125. McCarthy says that in the event of a snowstorm like the one that gave Browne's plows a workout, United will try to move as many planes as possible out of the area ahead of time so they are not sitting in the snow. This puts a premium on clearing runways efficiently. The faster that work is completed, the faster airlines can get back to flying once the skies clear.","Plows jumped into action at Washington's Dulles airport for surprise March storm .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for slavery and the era of Jim Crow. The House on Tuesday evening passed a resolution apologizing for slavery and Jim Crow laws. The nonbinding resolution, which passed on a voice vote, was introduced by Rep. Steve Cohen, a white lawmaker who represents a majority black district in Memphis, Tennessee. While many states have apologized for slavery, it is the first time a branch of the federal government has done so, an aide to Cohen said. In passing the resolution, the House also acknowledged the ""injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow."" ""Jim Crow,"" or Jim Crow laws, were state and local laws enacted mostly in the Southern and border states of the United States between the 1870s and 1965, when African-Americans were denied the right to vote and other civil liberties and were legally segregated from whites. The name ""Jim Crow"" came from a character played by T.D. ""Daddy"" Rice who portrayed a slave while in blackface during the mid-1800s. The resolution states that ""the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day."" ""African-Americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and Jim Crow -- long after both systems were formally abolished -- through enormous damage and loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of human dignity and liberty, the frustration of careers and professional lives, and the long-term loss of income and opportunity,"" the resolution states. The House also committed itself to stopping ""the occurrence of human rights violations in the future."" The resolution does not address the controversial issue of reparations. Some members of the African-American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendents of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery. It is not the first time lawmakers have apologized to an ethnic group for injustices. In April, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, that apologized to Native Americans for ""the many instances of violence, maltreatment and neglect."" In 1993 the Senate also passed a resolution apologizing for the ""illegal overthrow"" of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. In 1988, Congress passed and President Reagan signed an act apologizing to the 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were held in detention camps during World War II. The 60,000 detainees who were alive at the time each received $20,000 from the government.

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman whose nonstop hiccups vaulted her into the public spotlight, only to be ensnared later in a man's death, was found guilty Friday of first-degree murder. Jennifer Mee, 22, wept after the verdict was read in a Florida court, sometimes holding her head in her hands. She sobbed some more as she was led out of the room for a jail cell. Pinellas County Judge Nancy Moate Ley sentenced her to life in prison without parole and informed her she had 30 days to appeal. Mee was 19 when she was arrested in October 2010. Police said she met Shannon Griffin on a social networking site, then lured him to a vacant home days later. Authorities do not believe Mee or Griffin, a Wal-Mart employee who recently moved to Florida, knew each other prior to their online encounter. Mee led Griffin around to the back, where two men -- Laron Raiford and Lamont Newton -- were armed and waiting, authorities said. Griffin died after being shot multiple times with a .38-caliber revolver. All three suspects were arrested hours after Griffin's body was found. And all three were charged with first-degree murder, even Mee, although police indicated she didn't pull the trigger. Mee, Raiford and Newton had all been living together, according to police. According to CNN affiliate Bay News 9, Raiford was sentenced to life in prison last month and Newton has yet to stand trial. The spotlight on Mee after the arrest, and during her trial, stood in contrast to the attention she got in 2007. That's when she earned the nickname ""Hiccup Girl"" for having hiccups lasting more than a month, even appearing multiple times on NBC's ""Today"" show. Her desperate search for a hiccup cure included trying ""sugar, peanut butter, breathing in a bag, having people scare me,"" she said in a photo slideshow posted on the St. Petersburg Times' website in February 2007. But after her hiccups faded, Mee continued to draw attention. In June 2007, local media reported she ran away from home. In January 2010, St. Petersburg police again issued a missing person report for Mee. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Jennifer Mee, 22, is found guilty of first-degree murder in a man's slaying .

"(CNN) -- Laura Kassem had tripped before. But this time, she fell hard. She couldn't seem to control her body as she went down, even to protect her face from hitting the concrete sidewalk. It happened again the next day as she stepped off an escalator. Then again in the parking garage on Monday when she went to work. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" the 33-year-old remembers. ""I had no idea why I would just drop all of a sudden."" The third time, she went to the emergency room, where a neurologist ordered an MRI and a cardiologist performed a tilt test -- normally done on patients who faint because of a sudden drop in blood pressure. The tests revealed nothing. Doctors sent Kassem home with instructions to drink more water. Kassem continued to trip over nothing. So she went to the Cleveland Clinic, where she says her symptoms ""baffled"" doctors in the rheumatology, cardiology and neurology departments. Back home in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, Kassem made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to address the extreme pain in her hips and lower back. He sent her to a neurosurgeon, who in turn sent her to see a neurologist who specialized in neuromuscular disorders. Meanwhile, Kassem tried to avoid open spaces. She hugged walls so that if her body froze up, she wouldn't fall flat on her face. She already had a few loose teeth, and her nose was a mix of blue and purple. One night, Kassem and her sister were watching ""20/20"" when the woman being interviewed began describing Kassem's symptoms. The woman had been diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome, or SPS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by painful muscle spasms and progressive stiffness in the lower back and limbs. Could that be it? the Kassems asked themselves. They had never heard of SPS. But Kassem's latest neurologist thought they could be right. While waiting for the test results, he put Kassem on benzodiazepine, a medication that is known to lessen the symptoms of SPS. It worked. For the first time in nearly a year, Kassem was able to walk without assistance. Read more of Laura's story on iReport . The exact prevalence of Stiff Person Syndrome is unknown, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, but one estimate places it at one in every 1 million people. That means about 316 people in the United States have it. The exact cause of SPS is also unknown. Doctors believe it has something to do with a deficiency of glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD. GAD is involved in the body's production of gamma-aminobutyric acid, which helps control muscle movement. In patients with SPS, antibodies mistakenly attack certain neurons that produce GAD, leaving the body without the protein it needs. The symptoms of SPS generally start to appear in patients after age 30. People with SPS initially experience muscle stiffness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, muscle spasms and rigidity become more pronounced. These muscle spasms can last anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, and are triggered by unexpected noises, physical contact, stress and/or emotional anxiety. ""I've fallen on the streets and prayed to God that someone wouldn't run over me,"" says Ingrid Steppan, who was diagnosed with SPS five years ago. ""My husband can't touch my arm. My kids can't give me hugs."" Steppan compares the muscle spasms to childbirth. Imagine contractions felt in the uterus happening from your neck down to your toes, she says. The whole body goes stiff -- hence the syndrome's name. When she first began experiencing symptoms, Steppan couldn't dress herself. Her 9-year-old son had to help her put on her underwear, because his older siblings had all moved out and her husband went to work early. ""It was embarrassing for him and it was embarrassing for me,"" she remembers. ""We both cried."" Treatment has helped. While there is no cure yet for SPS, patients are often put on benzodiazepines to treat muscle stiffness and calm the spasms. Anti-seizure medications and painkillers are sometimes prescribed as well to lessen symptoms. Yet after years of freezing and falling unexpectedly because of stress or sudden sounds, many patients with SPS develop agoraphobia, an irrational fear of certain places and/or situations. They become housebound, unable to venture outside their comfort zone. ""My mind knows I'm OK, but my body won't cooperate,"" Steppan says. ""If I try to go outside, my body completely stiffens up, and I will fall over flat. You can put a sticker on my head and put me up for sale. I'm a statue for your lawn."" A few years ago, Steppan underwent intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIg, a common treatment for patients with SPS. With IVIg, a concentrated solution of sterilized antibodies is given to the patient through one of their veins. IVIg is most commonly used to help people with autoimmune disorders. Although SPS is a neurological disorder, it has ""features"" of an autoimmune disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. Those features could eventually lead scientists to a cure. Dr. Harry Atkins, medical director of regenerative medicine at Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Ontario, Canada, has been studying the effects of stem cell transplantation on autoimmune diseases for close to a decade. Five years ago, a patient with SPS approached him with her medical history. She had done her research, Atkins says, and told him that a stem cell transplant could restore her immune system -- ridding it of the antibodies fighting against GAD production. ""She made a very compelling case that this was worth trying,"" Atkins remembers. ""That's how I learned about Stiff Person Syndrome."" During a stem cell transplant, doctors use strong doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the patient's immune system. They then return purified bone marrow stem cells to the body. ""It appears that as the immune system regrows, it's like a baby's immune system,"" Atkins says. ""It recognizes what's part of the body, and is able to fight against germs and pathogens."" It's a dangerous procedure. When their immune system is wiped out, patients are prone to infection and organ damage. As such, it is reserved for those with only the most severe autoimmune diseases. Atkins decided SPS fit that bill and performed the stem cell transplant. His first SPS patient is now symptom-free, he says, and off all medications typically used for treating the rare disorder. He performed another transplant on a second SPS patient two years ago. That patient is symptom-free as well, he says, though she still relies on a few medications. ""I didn't believe the procedure would work so well,"" Atkins says. ""It's like a miracle to see what she was like before, and to see her now -- it's quite dramatic."" Steppan will be Atkins' third SPS patient. Last week, doctors harvested her stem cells for sterilization. She hopes to receive her last dose of chemotherapy soon, so they can then start rebuilding her immune system. Atkins is cautious about saying stem cell transplantation is the definitive treatment for Stiff Person Syndrome. The results have been encouraging, but the procedure has only been done in two patients. The rarity of the disease makes it difficult to find research funding -- not to mention participants. All three procedures were performed in Canada under the country's universal health care system. Doctors at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle have an open clinical trial protocol for doing stem cell transplants on patients with Stiff Person Syndrome, says Dr. George Georges. Unfortunately, most insurance carriers in the United States will not cover the cost of the transplant. Kassem is trying to raise $400,000 as a deposit. The Ohio resident has been bedridden since October. She has spasms that cause her whole body to stretch out and shake. Her brother is the only one strong enough to bend her legs when they go stiff. She lives with her parents, and someone has to be home 24/7. Kassem has made many new friends through rare disease support groups online. They're so few and far between it's often the only way patients with SPS can find each other. She and Steppan have communicated through Facebook. ""It's a very lonely life,"" Steppan says. ""I talk to them every day and they talk to me. ... These people need to believe that there's hope.""

"(CNN) -- A generation once labeled ""slackers,"" detached and melancholic has grown up to find out that reality doesn't bite as much it seemed when they were younger. To the contrary, most of the 84 million Americans ages 30 to 50 are ""active, balanced and happy,"" according to the authors of ""The Generation X Report,"" a research report from the University of Michigan's Longitudinal Study of American Youth. The release is the first in a series of quarterly reports based on questionnaires, interviews and tests from 4,000 Gen X respondents who have participated in the study since 1987. The study defines Gen X as those born between 1961 and 1981, though others sources tag Gen X as those born starting in 1964. ""We hope that this series of reports will serve to correct some of the misunderstandings and misstatements about Generation X that have appeared in the media,"" The Longitudinal Study of American Youth says on its website. ""Some commentators have characterized Generation X as being less successful than their parents and perhaps less ambitious than their parent's generation."" The study marks the latest focus on Gen X as the cultural spotlight gradually shifts away from retiring Baby Boomers. The analysis bolsters findings in a recent marketing study, ""Gen X: Flirting With 40,"" which stated that Gen X has matured into a group of ""technologically savvy, adventurous pragmatists."" Recent media coverage of rants and reflections from Gen Xers in Gizmodo and The Atlantic has also generated intense discussion, fueling debate over whether a passing of the torch from Boomers is under way. The stated mission of the study, which is funded by the National Science Foundation, is to write the history and monitor the future of Generation X. Here's some data from the report that may surprise you: . Myth #1: Gen Xers are slackers. Reality: Generation X devotes more hours to work than average and pursues continuing education. -- Compared to a national sample of all U.S. adults, Gen Xers are more likely to be employed and are working significantly more hours above average, according to the study. In Generation X, 86% is employed and 70% devote 40 or more hours to work each week. For those holding a doctorate or professional degree, that number shoots up to 50 or more hours. Also, 79% Gen X women work. -- Kids from ""The Breakfast Club"" era weren't so strung out on emotional issues that they passed up learning: Half of Gen Xers have completed a post-secondary degree and 9% are enrolled in continuing education. Myth #2: Generation X is hopelessly single and pessimistic about marriage. Reality: A higher percentage of Gen Xers stay married than Boomers, and most want to be married. -- Having spent their formative years in the era of growing divorce rates (divorce peaked in 1980) might lead to speculation that Gen X would run away from marriage en masse. In reality, two-thirds of Generation X is married and 71% report having children in the home. Additionally, divorce has been declining since 1996, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. -- 83% of Gen Xers said finding the right person to marry and having a happy family life is very important. Myth #3: Generation Xers are disengaged, existential isolationists. Reality: Gen X is social. --There's a reason Gen X is called the ""Friends"" generation. The report states that Gen X has extensive social, occupational and community networks outside of the immediate family. Two-thirds of respondents entertain friends for dinner or participate in group cooking at least once a month. -- One in 3 Gen Xers is an active member of a church or religious organization, and 29% volunteer in their community. -- 95% of Gen Xers report talking with friends or family on the telephone at least once a week, and 29% say they do so at least once a day. Myth #4:  As former latch-key kids, Gen Xers are wimpy, neglectful parents. Reality: About 84% of Gen X parents expect their children to earn at least a baccalaureate, and 39% expect their child to earn a graduate or professional degree. -- 72% of parents of preschool children read to them three or more hours a week, and 83% of parents of secondary school students help with homework. Myth #5: Generation X is depressed. Reality: Generation X is actually pretty happy. -Two-thirds of Generation X are satisfied with their job; 24% of these workers rated their job at 9 or 10 on the satisfaction scale. - On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 meaning very happy, the median happiness score was 8, with 29% of Gen Xers saying they were very happy scoring a 9 or 10. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","Generation X is outgrowing bad press as slackers and pessimists, study finds .

"(CNN) -- If a full-fledged war erupts, Ukraine's military would be dwarfed by its neighbor to the north. As of last month, Russian armed forces numbered 774,500 versus 139,000 for Ukraine, according to Jane's Information Group. And Russia's defense budget -- $78 billion in 2012 -- dwarfs that of Ukraine -- $1.6 billion in 2012, according to Jane's Defence Weekly. An article published in June 2011 cited a military expert's prediction that Ukraine would find itself in a ""defensive vacuum"" for a decade if investment were to remain unchanged. Valentin Badrak, director of the Ukrainian Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, was quoted in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper -- cited by Jane's -- as saying that programs for developing the Ukrainian Armed Forces were ""at a zero level."" The government, pointing to a 2010 study, said there was no need for a big army because Ukraine's primary threats came not from the outside but from internal political destabilization. According to the CIA World Factbook, Ukraine has 15.7 million males and females ages 16-49 fit for military service. Compare that with 45.6 million Russians of similar age who are fit for military service. Those figures may have been on the mind of Ukraine's acting defense minister, Ihor Tenyuh, on Sunday. He told a closed session of parliament then that Ukraine does not have the military force to resist Russia, according to two parliamentary members present at the meeting. He called for diplomacy to resolve the crisis with Russia, they said. Journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev, Ukraine, contributed to this report.","Russia's armed forces number 774,500; Ukraine has just 139,000, a report says .

"(CNN) -- After 22 years with Bud Selig in charge, Major League Baseball didn't look far for his replacement -- tapping Selig's right-hand man and longtime league executive Rob Manfred as its next commissioner. Owners of the 30 Major League teams elected Manfred during their quarterly meetings Thursday in Baltimore, the league announced on Twitter. While Selig noted afterward there had been ""a significant number of votes,"" he said Manfred ultimately was elected unanimously -- surpassing the 23 votes that he needed to get the job -- as MLB's 10th ever commissioner. ""It's been a great day for baseball, and I'm very pleased tonight and proud that we did it,"" Selig said. Manfred spent 15 years as MLB's executive vice president of labor relations, during which time he represented the league in reaching collective bargaining agreements with players in 2002, 2006 and 2011 -- without any work stoppages, as happened several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In September 2013, the lawyer by training became the league's chief operating officer, overseeing ""all of the traditional functions of the commissioner's office, including labor relations, baseball operations, finance, administration and club governance,"" according to his official bio. Manfred reported directly to the man he is now succeeding, Allan ""Bud"" Selig. A former car salesman and owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig ascended to the commissioner's job in 1992 following the resignation of Fay Vincent and remained there through his official election to the post six years later. Selig, 80, announced last fall that he'd retire as commissioner, effective this coming January. Manfred referenced his soon-to-be predecessor in remarks to reporters, saying that he has ""very big shoes to fill.""

"London (CNN) -- A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is now law, though the unions aren't expected to take place until 2014. Queen Elizabeth II has given her assent to the landmark bill, which the British House of Commons passed Tuesday, the house's speaker, John Bercow, said Wednesday. The first same-sex wedding could be held as early as next summer. The law does not come into force immediately because government departments need time to make changes. New processes must be drawn up for registrars, and new forms will also have to be drawn up. The government expects to announce a more formal timetable for the implementation of the law in the fall. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill cleared the House of Lords and the House of Commons this week, just before the summer recess. The monarch's assent -- a formality in the United Kingdom -- makes the measure official. What you need to know about same-sex marriages in the U.S. and worldwide . The bill had the backing of British Prime Minister David Cameron, but his commitment to it put him at odds with many in his Conservative Party and its grass-roots supporters. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The bill was also opposed by religious groups, including the Church of England. The Catholic Church in England and Wales said that the law's passage ""marks a watershed in English law and heralds a profound social change,"" and that it regretted that the bill had been ""rushed though"" Parliament. ""With this new legislation, marriage has now become an institution in which openness to children, and with it the responsibility on fathers and mothers to remain together to care for children born into their family unit, are no longer central. That is why we were opposed to this legislation on principle,"" a statement said. 'Go forth and propose' The debate over the legislation became heated at times in the House of Commons, where the issue exposed divisions within Cameron's party. Conservative MP Gerald Howarth angered many when he referred to ""the aggressive homosexual community"" that would ""see this is as but a stepping stone to something even further."" Responding to the news that the law had passed, Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant tweeted: ""The Queen has given Royal Assent to Same Sex Marriage. Aggressive homosexuals, please note. Go forth and propose."" The new law will allow same-sex couples to marry in civil or religious ceremonies. However, religious organizations must explicitly ""opt in"" if they want to perform such ceremonies, and the religious minister conducting the ceremony must also agree. The law also protects religious organizations and their representatives who don't wish to conduct marriages of same-sex couples from being challenged in the courts. It will allow couples in civil partnerships to convert to marriage if they wish. The new law also allows married men or women who wish to change their gender to do so without ending their marriage. A law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004. The issue of same-sex marriage has also divided other nations. A law that allows same-sex couples to marry and adopt was passed by France this year, despite large street protests and vocal opposition from religious groups. The move made it the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. In the United States, two landmark rulings by the Supreme Court last month gave the gay and lesbian rights movement huge political and legal momentum. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . The justices said legally married same-sex couples will now enjoy the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples, striking down a key provision in the Defense of Marriage Act. And although not granting a sweeping right of gays and lesbians to marry nationwide, a separate high court ruling effectively allows same-sex marriage to resume in California, the nation's most populous state. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","The new law allows same-sex couples to marry in civil or religious ceremonies .

"(CNN) -- Last June, Glen Campbell stunned fans when he revealed in a press release that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It was not an easy decision to go public with his private struggle, but his family felt it was a decision that needed to be made. ""The main thing we were concerned about was during shows he would forget a line or get a little confused,"" says Campbell's daughter, Ashley. ""People would think, 'Is he drunk?' Is he doing drugs again?' So we didn't want people to get the wrong impression."" But an interesting thing happened after the Alzheimer's announcement. Instead of fading off into the sunset like a forgotten icon, the 75-year-old entertainer has been catapulted back into the spotlight -- and the music industry can't seem to shower him with enough accolades. In November, he was the subject of a star-studded tribute at the CMA Awards show, and on Sunday night, he'll pick up a Lifetime Achievement trophy at the 54th annual Grammy Awards. Behind the scenes, it's been somewhat of a standoff between the CMAs and the Grammys, with each telecast vying for bragging rights to have Campbell perform. But there's nothing like the pull of the Grammys -- especially when you're a five-time Grammy winner. At the CMAs, Campbell beamed from the audience while Keith Urban, Brad Paisley and Vince Gill serenaded him with his biggest hits, but the Grammys will be a different story. Campbell himself will take center stage for ""Rhinestone Cowboy,"" flanked by Blake Shelton, The Band Perry and his own band -- which features three of his grown children. It'll be his first live television performance since the Alzheimer's diagnosis, and thus, it will also be a bit of a cliffhanger. Last fall, Campbell released his final album, ""Ghost on the Canvas,"" then hit the road on what he's calling his farewell tour. Most of the time, he sails through his set like the charismatic veteran he is. Three teleprompters at the foot of the stage enable him to read his lyrics, and when he flubs a line here or there, he usually laughs it off. But there are rare moments when he'll become a little disoriented, and that's when it helps that he's surrounded by family on stage. Son Cal keeps things steady on drums, while his brother, Shannon, plays guitar nearby. Their younger sister, Ashley, stands protectively to Campbell's left, on keyboards, banjo and violin. ""He looks at me sometimes if he is confused, and I just smile at him. I just try to make him feel like he is surrounded by people that love him on stage,"" says Ashley. While most people with Alzheimer's drift in and out of lucidity without fanfare, you know exactly when Campbell has hit a rough patch. He'll be playing a song on guitar that he's played a gazillion times, like ""Wichita Lineman,"" then all of a sudden hit a bad chord or forget the lyrics. It's like a light switch. In concert, fans are happy to fill in the gaps when he has a senior moment, singing his lyrics back at him until he finds his way again. Campbell's wife, Kim, watches serenely from the soundboard, knowing full-well that these incidents will occur from time to time. But the whole family has made peace with it, including Campbell. He tells CNN, ""I am content with it. Don't cry over spilt milk. Get up and be a man and do what you have got to do."" CNN recently sat down with Glen and Kim at their home in Malibu, in a room overlooking the California coast. Several guitars were on display within arm's reach. Others laid in cases in the entryway, ready to head out on the road. In another room, platinum and gold records lined the walls, documenting the success of ""Wichita Lineman,"" ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" and ""Rhinestone Cowboy."" Clearly, music has been good to Glen Campbell, and Glen Campbell has been good for music. Now, music is helping him cope with life. CNN: How does it feel to be receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys? Glen Campbell: I am flattered. I really am. All I wanted to do every since I could remember was play my guitar and sing. CNN: You came out to Los Angeles in 1958 to be a guitarist. Did you ever see yourself becoming a big star? Campbell: I never really thought of it! I'm a musician first. So when I got the job playing guitar with the session players, I said, ""Yay, I can play."" I was a little scared. I was a little nervous, but when I got in with The Wrecking Crew, I realized that I could cut it out here, and could do it. I played with the Beach Boys, Frank Sinatra, Elvis, the Righteous Brothers, the Monkees. CNN: You're known as a great guitar player, but did you ever take a formal lesson? Campbell: No. I can read a chord chart, but I couldn't read a note chart. CNN: Are you nervous about taking the stage these days? Campbell: I realize you are going to make mistakes through life. Just don't make any bad ones, you know. Like all of my records are perfect records, but I did make mistakes on them. I would rather do live than any kind of lip-synching or something like that. I don't like to lip-synch. CNN: What has been the reaction from fans? Kim Campbell: Boy, were we pleasantly surprised. They have been more than understanding. They have really just been rooting him on. It is really encouraging. Glen: I don't see myself any different, though. I'm forgetful. Kim: I actually think he is better than he was a year ago. I think that being out and performing all the time has something to do with it. Music seems to be really good therapy for him. I don't know if it is the vibrations. Maybe they stimulate the brain. Of course he is on some medications today that I think have been helping, too. So we are blessed to be living in a time when there are some treatments. There is no cure, but there are things that can help, and they are helping. Glen: What did they diagnose me as? Kim: Alzheimer's. Glen: Alzheimer's. What is Alzheimer's? Kim: You start losing your memory and your ability to reason. Glen: I just take it as it comes, you know. I know that I have a problem with that, but it doesn't bother me. If you're going to have it handed to you, you have got to take it, anyway. So that is the way I look at it. CNN: You went down to Nashville for the CMA Awards in November. Seemed like you knew a lot of people there. Glen: What is his name -- the one who married that long-legged girl? Kim: Keith Urban. Glen: Yeah, Keith Urban. He is probably the best guitar player in Nashville. Kim: And Brad Paisley. They are two of his favorites. Glen: Just incredible players. CNN: The two of you have been married nearly 30 years. Did you really meet on a blind date? Kim: I was dancing with the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. Glen: They had a bunch lined up and I thought, ""I'll take that one there."" No, I'm kidding. CNN: Was it love at first sight? Kim, at that time, he was kind of a hell-raiser. Kim: I really didn't know anything about that, because I was a dancer, and I just had my head into Broadway and I didn't read the tabloids. But I knew he was a singer. And then I went to one of his concerts -- ""Oh my goodness, I remember that song. I remember that song."" He had a lot of hits. So then I got a little more intimidated, but I really just didn't know much about him. CNN: Glen, did Kim change your life? Glen: Yes, she did change my life in many ways. Before I met her, I didn't know where I was at, or where I was going. And after I met her, I knew where I was going, and I knew where to wanted to go.

"(CNN) -- Things that are about 18 feet long (sure it's random, just go with it). There's the Ford F-150 pickup truck. There's the 18-foot skiff, a kind of zippy racing boat. Then there's the disturbing, frightening, shudder-inducing Burmese python that a Florida water-quality maintenance crew ran across this week. Yes, an 18-foot snake. Well, 17.82 feet to be exact. And 150 pounds. Workers with the South Florida Water Management District often run across the invasive snakes as part of their daily routine inspecting and maintaining canals, pump stations and the like, said agency spokesman Randy Smith. But this one was something even for the grizzled crew of snake runner-acrossers. ""Needless to say, when you get one this big, it raises eyebrows,"" Smith said. ""It's just such a large animal. They have no predators. They'll eat anything, even alligators. They are ferocious creatures."" Python kills security guard . The work crew came across the snake Tuesday in wooded uplands near wetlands a few miles north of Everglades National Park, Smith said. They called in the agency's python coordinator, who killed the snake with a shot to the head, Smith said. Despite the snake's size, it's not the biggest recorded in Florida. That distinction goes to an 18-foot, 8-inch specimen killed by a Florida man who spotted it sticking out of bush in Miami-Dade County in May 2013, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Before that, the largest python captured in Florida measured 17 feet, 7 inches. 40 pythons seized from Ontario motel room . Pythons aren't poisonous -- they squeeze their prey and humans aren't a frequent target. But they are killing rabbits, raccoons, opossums, bobcats and other native species and wreaking havoc with the south Florida ecosystems where they've taken hold, according to research published in 2012. Pythons are such a problem that the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission held a contest last year to see who could capture and kill as many as possible. Hunters turned in 68 of the snakes, the longest measuring more than 14 feet long. Willing to capture a crocodile in Florida? Apply now .","Florida work crew finds 18-foot Burmese python .

"(CNN) -- He was born into poverty, became wealthy via the stock exchange, suffered the suicides of both his parents, and would ultimately end his own life on the golf course that bears his legacy. The life of Clifford Roberts was remarkable tale, a man who -- in a rags-to-riches ode to the American Dream -- rose from farm boy to the position of advisor for the American president via his role as creator of one of the most iconic golf courses in the world. As chairman of The Masters, Roberts would become legend, but the story of his life was one filled with twists and turns and which, ultimately, ended in tragedy on the banks of Augusta National's par-three course in September 1977. A triumph over adversity . ""Cliff managed to rise above the tragedy of his parents. He was a land man and he traveled across the country, approaching farmers and buying their land for drilling rights,"" said Curt Sampson, author of ""The Masters: Golf, Money and Power."" ""He made a real success and moved to New York, where he got into stock brokerage and proved himself highly skilled in the art of ingratiating himself to people with money. He was as skilled with stocks and he was with 'the schmooze'."" It was in New York that Roberts befriended legendary amateur golfer Bobby Jones, who in 1930 completed the unique feat of a calendar Grand Slam, by winning the U.S. Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur and British Amateur. Jones had retired from golf aged just 28, with his celebrity at an all-time high. He sought money and sanctuary, and together with Roberts conceived the idea of building an ultra-exclusive club in the more temperate south where monied New Yorkers could head for retreat and rounds of golf in the sun. Building a national treasure . Augusta, Georgia, was familiar to both men. Roberts had completed his First World War training at the town's Camp Hancock facility, while Jones had a house nearby. Roberts raised $70,000 to buy a pre-Civil War, 365-acre Indigo plantation, and the pair invited British designer Dr. Alister Mackenzie to set out a golf course . ""They built it for a dime, and got all their labor and materials for practically nothing,"" said Sampson. ""When they finished they declared bankruptcy, reorganized and gave themselves a new name."" The big sell . Augusta was ready in just 124 days, but it took a lot longer to sell the prospect to an America in the grips of recession. ""Thanks to the Depression, the duo (Roberts and Jones) failed to attract many early takers, and the club teetered on the brink of bankruptcy for years,"" wrote Cameron Morfit, in Golf Magazine. In 1933, Roberts invited a group of wealthy business types to travel down from New York by train. He paid for everything, and the carts were stocked generously with prohibition-flaunting whisky. But his greatest trick was launching the event that would put Augusta on the map. A new kind of tournament . It started life as the Augusta National Invitational in 1934, before Roberts finally convinced Jones on a name befitting of the tournament's elitist home -- The Masters. Jones came out of retirement to play, and Roberts was made chairman. He immediately set about putting his stamp on the event. ""He changed the locations of perimeter mounds to improve gallery viewing. He was the first to use a series of leader boards placed throughout the course. He also devised a system for showing the cumulative score of each player,"" the history of the Masters on the official web site reads. Friends in high places . The Masters gave Roberts new influence. In 1948 he invited a five-star general named Dwight Eisenhower to visit Augusta. Roberts would ultimately serve as Eisenhower's political and financial advisor, and -- according to Sampson's research -- help illegally distribute funds to the Republican party en route to his election as president in 1953. ""Their relationship is told through Eisenhower's oral history. Roberts is open about being a bag man, and carrying satchels of cash around to avoid paperwork and detection,"" Sampson said. Iron fist in a velvet glove . The Jones-Roberts relationship was widely seen as ""good cop, bad cop"" partnership. Sampson called Roberts an ""iron fist in a velvet glove"", and the many stories of Roberts ruthless pursuit of perfection at the course attests to this. ""He (Roberts) hated to see a dead tree limb or anything out of place,"" said Carl Jackson, who'll caddy in his 50th Masters at the 2011 edition, in an interview with Golf.com. ""Almost every time I would see him he would wave for me. He would say, 'You go and you tell that goddamn greens superintendent that I'm out here on number 14 and to come out here this very minute.'"" There was the incident in 1948 that Roberts ejected Frank Stranahan from The Masters for hitting additional balls in a practice round. Stranahan claimed a conspiracy against him. And the fierce control he kept over television broadcasters, from the moment The Masters went went live for the first time in 1956 with CBS persists in ethos to this day. Barriers to entry . But the controversy that defined Roberts' reign at Augusta, was unquestionably the club's apparent reticence to embrace black players -- and black members. The PGA of America dropped their Caucasian-only clause in 1961, but it was 14 years before Lee Elder became the first African American to compete at The Masters. In the intervening years Charlie Sifford won twice on the PGA Tour, and applied time and again to be part of The Masters field. But to no avail. Product of the different era . Augusta National under Roberts occasionally was frequently compared to the Plantation it was built on. The workers were black, the caddies were black, and they politely served the white folk who played and relaxed there. But was it really any more than a reflection of the society at the time? ""I don't think Cliff was motivated by racial issues at all,"" Sampson said. He was simply a product of the time and his environment."" The legacy of Jones and Roberts . When Jones succumbed to a debilitating illness in 1971, Roberts assumed total control of Augusta, and of The Masters. His would preside over their legacy for another five years, before terminal illness led him to end his life on the golf course that defined it. Typical of his ordered world, he had his haircut and attached the doctor's note to a letter for his wife before shooting himself. A plaque was erected at the entrance to Augusta, and his legacy continues to be fiercely protected at every turn by the club that made him chairman in memoriam. ""Although he was a tough man, he was a person who was truly dedicated to golf and the quality and standards of the game,"" Arnold Palmer reflected. ""All of us in golf appreciate what he has done for the game,"" said Jack Nicklaus. ""From the time I met Clifford Roberts until his death, I never knew him to do anything that was not in the best interest of Augusta National. As a youngster [he] would ask me what I thought of something, and I would try to give him an answer. He would then research it, come back to me and say, 'Jack, we agree and we are going to fix that on the golf course.' Or, he would tell me why they didn't agree with me. ""He was just a fun-loving guy; a good guy. I love the story about the spoof he put on at one of the jamborees. They always said he could walk on water, and he rigged it so he could walk across the water at No. 16.. There was an age difference but we were good friends,"" Nicklaus told Golf.com .","Clifford Roberts was born in Morning Sun, Iowa, and suffered the suicides of both his parents .

"(CNN) -- Reports of yet another outbreak on a cruise ship this week have some imminent cruisers asking the unpleasant question: What are the chances of spending my vacation in the bathroom? ""My mother, who is a first-time cruiser, is seriously reconsidering our choice for our family vacation,"" wrote CNN reader Monica Mancera in an e-mail. The University of Texas at Austin student is booked on a Carnival cruise with her family in March. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating two recent norovirus outbreaks  at sea. One outbreak hit Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, infecting more 600 passengers and crew. The other struck a Princess Cruises ship, which cut short its seven-day Caribbean itinerary after more than 180 passengers and crew members fell ill. The cause has not yet been determined. Not exactly tropical drinks by the cruise ship's pool, lovely walks by the moonlight and port visits to exotic climes. And just the thought of wasting precious vacation time has worker-bee bystanders riled up: So glad it's not me! Poor suckers! And cruise skeptics who have never been on cruises have another opportunity to ask: What were they thinking? ""I think they are floating germ kingdoms. Disgusting,"" wrote Matt Dryden of Newport, North Carolina, via e-mail. ""Never been on a cruise because of that exact reason."" Cruising represents one of travel's deeper divides. Love it or hate it, most of the keenest objections are only half true -- or false, depending on how you look at it. Floating petri dishes? Cruise ships are ripe for spreading illness. Outbreaks of norovirus, the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States, occur most frequently in close quarters, according to the CDC. Nursing homes, dormitories and cruise ships are common transmission grounds. In 2013, the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program logged nine gastroenteritis outbreaks aboard ships, seven of which had a confirmed cause of norovirus. About 1,200 cruise passengers were affected by those norovirus cases. To put those figures in perspective, the industry's Cruise Lines International Association says more than 10 million passengers embarked on CLIA-member cruise ships from a U.S. port in 2012. Meanwhile, nationwide, norovirus sickens an estimated 21 million people in the United States every year, according to the CDC. Bottom line: More people are getting sick on land. (Granted, that's little comfort if you're vomiting violently at sea). More outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been reported aboard cruise ships since 2001, according to CDC statistics. The government agency says the spike is tied to an increase in both passengers and ships sailing the seas as well as an overall increase in norovirus outbreaks. ""There are attempts to control these types of outbreaks, but it's hard to guarantee that it's not going to happen for any particular cruise,"" said Dr. Lin Chen, director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So yes, the threat of illness is real. Yet the number of reported outbreaks among thousands of annual sailings has ranged in recent years from less than a dozen affected sailings to about three dozen. Who's responsible for the outbreak? ""Though the cruise lines may get the bad rap for an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness, cruise lines typically do a masterful job of cleaning and disinfecting the ships before, during, and after passengers set sail,"" said Robert Kwortnik, marketing professor at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration. That's because the stakes are so high. ""It's more likely that the cause of these outbreaks is us -- or what technology professionals refer to as ""'user error,'"" he said. ""We might not be feeling tip-top when we board the ship and instead bring illness on-board with us rather than saying, 'Maybe I should do this another time.' No one wants to cancel a vacation, especially if it's nonrefundable."" Kwortnik's solution: Buy travel insurance, which is intended for just this kind of problem, and stay home if you're sick. The recent outbreaks aren't scaring away some travelers. ""I feel for the people who are suffering through it, but for the number of cruises per year and the sheer number of people on them, outbreaks like this are just too small for me to worry about,"" wrote Christina M. Stetler of Manchester, Pennsylvania, via e-mail, who took a cruise in September. Are ships or passengers unsanitary? Norovirus, the most common cruise ship outbreak offender, spreads quickly from person to person but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces. The CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program conducts regular unannounced inspections of cruise ships. Explorer of the Seas, the Royal Caribbean ship currently experiencing an outbreak, scored a 98 out of 100 on its last inspection in July 2013. ""Something like this is not representative of an unclean ship,"" said Colleen McDaniel, managing editor of CruiseCritic.com. ""It doesn't mean this particular vessel was unclean. It just means there was an outbreak on board. They're ending the cruise two days early and doing a really deep cleaning of the ship. It's not likely to happen on the same ship again."" Unlikely, but not unheard of: Princess Cruises' Crown Princess had norovirus outbreaks on two consecutive sailings in 2012. In 2010, the CDC issued a four-day no-sail recommendation for a Celebrity Cruises ship after three consecutive outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness. The deep cleaning upon Explorer of the Seas' return to port ""will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue,"" Royal Caribbean said. Wash your hands! Cruise lines activate CDC-monitored response plans when outbreaks are detected. Measures include increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfection, isolating ill people, distributing information about proper hand-washing and hygiene as well as illness updates and regular reporting to CDC Vessel Sanitation Program officials. Hygiene is extremely important when outbreaks occur. Proper hand washing, avoiding contact with ill passengers and direct contact with public surfaces such as restroom door handles can help stem the spread of highly contagious illness. The CDC offers health tips for cruisers on its website. Avid cruiser Marcy Webster and her husband won't be changing their plans for an upcoming sailing on Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas. Norovirus: The most common stomach bug . ""It is not the cruise line's fault. It is a passenger who came onboard sick and spread the virus everywhere. On every cruise I have been on, the crew is diligent in keeping things clean and making passengers use hand sanitizer,"" Webster, of Keller, Texas, wrote in an e-mail. ""Bad things happen. If you stop your life for fear of what could be, you never experience anything."" That's not good enough for Cheryl King, who decided not to take a cruise with her family after learning about the outbreak on the Royal Caribbean ship. ""We were in the process of looking for a cruise when this story came on,"" King wrote CNN ,via e-mail. ""We have decided our money will serve us much better by keeping both feet on terra firma, where we can walk away if something goes sideways. ""We will not be going on any cruises. Ever.""","Some travelers hesitant to cruise due to gastrointestinal outbreaks aboard cruise ships .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez is ""now a Barcelona player in all respects,"" according to the Spanish club. Liverpool and the Spanish side announced last week they had agreed terms for the sale of the Uruguay international, with a transfer fee reported to be in the region of £75 million ($128.5 million.) Suarez, who was due to sign a five-year contract with the Catalan giants, traveled to Barcelona Tuesday to complete the transfer. Although no official announcement has been made, Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta revealed in a news conference Wednesday that a deal has now been finalized. Following the four-month ban from football-related activity imposed by FIFA on Suarez for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, Zubizarreta conceded he had to be careful what he said about the striker. When the transfer has been officially announced, Barcelona will be unable to unveil Suarez due to his ban. The Spanish club have presented previous big-money signings, such as Cesc Fabregas and Neymar, to their supporters at the Camp Nou stadium. Despite appealing, Suarez saw FIFA uphold his suspension last week, and he will now take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland in hope that the sanction will be overturned. Suarez joined Liverpool in January 2011 from Dutch club Ajax for £22.8 million ($39 million), scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances. He played a pivotal role in the Reds' title challenge last year, netting 31 times in 37 appearances. Liverpool came up just short in the race for the English Premier League title, finishing second to Manchester City, but ensured Champions League football for the first time in four seasons. Costa signs . One long-standing transfer that has definitely been concluded is that of Diego Costa's move to Chelsea. Costa has long been linked with a move from Atletico Madrid, and the London side announced Tuesday that a deal has been completed. It is reported that Chelsea met the striker's buy-out clause, believed to be worth £32 million ($54.8 million). The 25-year-old, who helped Atletico to the Spanish La Liga title and the European Champions League final last season, has signed a five-year contract. Costa, who was born in Brazil but was part of Spain's squad at the 2014 World Cup, expressed his delight at joining Chelsea, while he revealed he is looking forward to working under manager Jose Mourinho. ""I am very happy to sign for Chelsea. Everybody knows it is a big club in a very competitive league, and I am very excited to get started in England with a fantastic coach and teammates,"" he told Chelsea's official website. ""Having played against Chelsea last season [in the European Champions League] I know the high quality of the squad I am joining. ""I would like to thank everybody at Atletico who made me into the player I am, it was an incredible time for me, but now I am starting a new adventure and I hope to win many trophies with Chelsea."" Costa will be joined at his new club by a familiar face in former Atletico teammate Filipe Luis. Chelsea confirmed Wednesday that an agreement has been reached to sign the left-back, who also played a key part in securing Atletico's first Spanish championship in 18 years. Luis is reported to be joining for a fee of £20 million ($34.25 million), with the move subject to the 28-year-old agreeing personal terms with the English side. Elsewhere, Liverpool confirmed the signing of Lazar Markovic from Benfica Tuesday. The 20-year-old winger is the English club's fourth signing of the summer -- after Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can -- and he cannot wait to get started. ""I am very happy that I have joined such a great club,"" he told Liverpool's official website. ""I hope that I will fulfill the expectations of the supporters, coaches, players and all connected to the club. ""I have seen what the players are like, I have seen what the supporters are like, and I cannot wait to start playing here.""","Luis Suarez has completed his move to Barcelona, according to the Spanish club .

"(CNN) -- Most of us have become so used to suppressing noise that we don't think much about what we're hearing, or about how we listen. Yet our well-being is now being seriously damaged by modern sound. Here are 10 things about sound and health that you may not know: . 1.) You are a chord. This is obvious from physics, though it's admittedly somewhat metaphorical to call the combined rhythms and vibrations within a human being a chord, which we usually understand to be an aesthetically pleasant audible collection of tones. But ""the fundamental characteristic of nature is periodic functioning in frequency, or musical pitch,"" according to C.T. Eagle. Matter is vibrating energy; therefore, we are a collection of vibrations of many kinds, which can be considered a chord. 2.) One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. The World Health Organization defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"" which opens at least three dimensions to the concept. On a philosophical level, Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras and Confucius all wrote at length about the relationship between harmony, music and health (both social and physical). Here's Socrates: ""Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful."" Watch an interview with Julian Treasure . 3.) We see one octave; we hear ten. An octave is a doubling in frequency. The visual spectrum in frequency terms is 400-790 THz, so it's just under one octave. Humans with great hearing can hear from 20 Hz to 20 KHz, which is ten octaves. 4.) We adopt listening positions. Listening positions are a useful set of perspectives that can help people to be more conscious and effective in communication -- because expert listening can be just as powerful as speaking. For example, men typically adopt a reductive listening position, listening for something, often a point or solution. Women, by contrast, typically adopt an expansive listening position, enjoying the journey, going with the flow. When unconscious, this mismatch causes a lot of arguments. Other listening positions include judgmental (or critical), active (or reflective), passive (or meditative) and so on. Some are well known and widely used; for example, active listening is trained into many therapists, counselors and educators. 5.) Noise harms and even kills. There is now wealth of evidence about the harmful effect of noise, and yet most people still consider noise a local matter, not the major global issue it has become. According to a 1999 U.S. Census report, Americans named noise as the number one problem in neighborhoods. Of the households surveyed, 11.3 percent stated that street or traffic noise was bothersome, and 4.4 percent said it was so bad that they wanted to move. More Americans are bothered by noise than by crime, odors and other problems listed under ""other bothersome conditions."" TED.com: Music is medicine, music is sanity . The European Union says: ""Around 20% of the Union's population or close on 80 million people suffer from noise levels that scientists and health experts consider to be unacceptable, where most people become annoyed, where sleep is disturbed and where adverse health effects are to be feared. An additional 170 million citizens are living in so-called 'grey areas' where the noise levels are such to cause serious annoyance during the daytime."" The World Health Organization says: ""Traffic noise alone is harming the health of almost every third person in the WHO European Region. One in five Europeans is regularly exposed to sound levels at night that could significantly damage health."" The WHO is also the source for the startling statistic about noise killing 200,000 people a year. Its findings (LARES report) estimate that 3 percent of deaths from ischemic heart disease result from long-term exposure to noise. With 7 million deaths a year globally, that means 210,000 people are dying of noise every year. TED.com: Jose Abreu on kids transformed by music . The cost of noise to society is astronomical. The EU again: ""Present economic estimates of the annual damage in the EU due to environmental noise range from EUR 13 billion to 38 billion. Elements that contribute are a reduction of housing prices, medical costs, reduced possibilities of land use and cost of lost labour days."" (Future Noise Policy European Commission Green Paper 1996). Then there is the effect of noise on social behavior. The U.S. report ""Noise and its effects"" (Administrative Conference of the United States, Alice Suter, 1991) says: ""Even moderate noise levels can increase anxiety, decrease the incidence of helping behavior, and increase the risk of hostile behavior in experimental subjects. These effects may, to some extent, help explain the ""dehumanization"" of today's urban environment."" Perhaps Confucius and Socrates have a point. 6.) Schizophonia is unhealthy. ""Schizophonia"" describes a state where what you hear and what you see are unrelated. The word was coined by the great Canadian audiologist Murray Schafer and was intended to communicate unhealthiness. Schafer explains: ""I coined the term schizophonia intending it to be a nervous word. Related to schizophrenia, I wanted it to convey the same sense of aberration and drama."" My assertion that continual schizophonia is unhealthy is a hypothesis that science could and should test, both at personal and also a social level. You have only to consider the bizarre jollity of train carriages now -- full of lively conversation but none of it with anyone else in the carriage -- to entertain the possibility that this is somehow unnatural. Old-style silence at least had the virtue of being an honest lack of connection with those around us. Now we ignore our neighbors, merrily discussing intimate details of our lives as if the people around us simply don't exist. Surely this is not a positive social phenomenon. 7. Compressed music makes you tired. However clever the technology and the psychoacoustic algorithms applied, there are many issues with data compression of music, as discussed in this excellent article by Robert Harley back in 1991. My assertion that listening to highly compressed music makes people tired and irritable is based on personal and anecdotal experience - again it's one that I hope will be tested by researchers. 8. Headphone abuse is creating deaf kids. Over 19 percent of American 12 to 19 years old exhibited some hearing loss in 2005-2006, an increase of almost 5 percent since 1988-94 (according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Josef Shargorodsky et al, reported with comments from the researchers here). One university study found that 61 percent of freshmen showed hearing loss (Leeds 2001). Many audiologists use the rule of thumb that your headphones are too loud if you can't hear someone talking loudly to you. For example, Robert Fifer, an associate professor of audiology and speech pathology at the University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, says: ""If you can still hear what people are saying around you, you are at a safe level. If the volume is turned so loudly that you can no longer hear conversation around you, or if someone has to shout at you at a distance of about 2 or 3 feet to get your attention, then you are up in the hazardous noise range."" TED.com: Evelyn Glennie shows how to listen . 9. Natural sound and silence are good for you. These assertions seem to be uncontroversial. Perhaps they resonate with everyone's experience or instinct. 10. Sound can heal. Both music therapy and sound therapy can be categorized as ""sound healing."" Music therapy (the use of music to improve health) is a well-established form of treatment in the context of mainstream medicine for many conditions, including dementia and autism. Less mainstream, though intellectually no more difficult to accept, is sound therapy: the use of tones or sounds to improve health through entrainment (affecting one oscillator with a stronger one). This is long-established: shamanic and community chant and the use of various resonators like bells and gongs, date back thousands of years and are still in use in many cultures around the world. Just because something is pre-Enlightenment and not done in hospitals doesn't mean that it's new-age BS. Doubtless there are charlatans offering snake oil (as in many fields), but I suspect there is also much to learn, and just as herbal medicine gave rise to many of the drugs we use today, I suspect there are rich resources and fascinating insights to be gleaned when science starts to unpack the traditions of sound healing. I hope these thoughts make a contribution to raising awareness of sound and its effects on health. I welcome your reaction, and I will check this forum and respond. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Treasure.","Julian Treasure: Sounds we hear have an important effect on our lives and health .

"(CNN) -- On November 2 you can help raise millions of dollars for sick children by sitting on the sofa and playing video games. Just like the weekend athletes who collect donations from family and friends for every mile they race in a charity run, thousands of gamers will be enlisting their networks to support them in a marathon of a completely different sort. This novel fund raising idea is sponsored by Extra Life, which is now a part of the nonprofit Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Players can sign up to play for this charity at any time throughout the year. But November 2 is Extra Life's annual game day. And because this year the day ends with clocks falling back an hour, they have upped the challenge from a 24- to a 25-hour marathon of gaming. Would anyone really support gamers spending an entire day just playing? And would gamers sign up for such a thing? Even Extra Life founder Jeromy Adams was unsure. Back in 2007, he reached out to a gaming community called Sarcastic Gamer to see whether they would donate a few games to Tori Enmon, a young girl who was going through cancer treatment in his local hospital. He received such an overwhelming response from gamers all over the world that he and Tori had to spend the next few months trying to find enough hospitalized kids to take all the games. Adams says he realized that gamers were the ideal audience for a good cause. Here, he thought, is a group that loves trying to save the day and be the hero. ""Gamers are not the stereotype of the angry pale kid in mom and dad's basement,"" he said. ""They are more likely to be the mom and the dad. ""We are some of the most connected people on the planet. We communicate more efficiently, and we want to make a difference. Despite these expert qualifications, nobody really asks us for our help."" Tori succumbed to her cancer in 2008, and Adams started Extra Life that year in her honor. Since then, his faith in gamers has been more than proven. Every year thousands of new players sign up, and to date they have raised more than $4 million. Are gamers really the giving type? The argument could be made that some gamers might be signing up so they finally have an excuse to spend a whole day playing without the guilt that they're wasting time. But other charities have started to tap into this audience, and they have also found a giving community. The charity Child's Play is celebrating its 10th anniversary of gamers giving back, and in 2012 it received more than $5 million in contributions. And then there is the philanthropy, Humble Bundle. Humble Bundle is a unique online store that sells a rotating collection of games at a price determined by the purchaser. The buyer also gets to select what percentage of that price will go to the game's developer, the Humble Bundle team, and how much goes to a selected charity. Humble Bundle's Will Turnbull and his team were nervous when they offered their first bundle in 2010. What would gamers do? If they were just trying to get the lowest price possible for these games, the model would never work. The team hoped to raise $200,000 with that first offering. Instead, they brought in more than $1.2 million, with about $350,000 of that going to charity. ""We were totally floored to see that people were willing to give more than the minimum,"" Turnbull said. ""It changes the message that this is just a discount ... We really trust the consumer to do the right thing, and they have proven that trust, and the charity part is incredibly integral to that."" On Humble Bundle purchases, the default portion that goes to charity is 20%. In most cases, Turnbull said, buyers slide that percentage up to give more to charities like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity:water and the American Red Cross. To date, Humble Bundles has raised more than $25 million for charities. Adams keeps a picture of Tori Enmon at his desk at work as he prepares for their big marathon. This year he is looking to expand his gaming audience. Extra Life is inviting everyone who plays any type of game, whether it is sports, board games, even live-action role-playing. He says he believes the generous spirit he found in video gamers is a universal trait that just needs an opportunity, and perhaps the incentive to have some fun. That, he says, is what Tori showed him, from a hospital bed full of games and a determination to find a child for each one.","Gamers can raise money by playing for more than 24 hours on November 2 .

"(CNN) -- Ivorian-born businessman Tidjane Thiam is all too familiar with the daily challenges of setting the strategy and overseeing the operations of a global company. Over the last three years, the London-based executive, who served as a government minister in Ivory Coast in the 1990s, has been at the helm of Prudential, a life insurance giant and financial services group with a 160-year history and more than 26 million customers in Asia, the U.S. and the UK. But for Thiam, the first black CEO of a FTSE 100 company, being a cabinet minister in Ivory Coast was much tougher than heading a global company. ""The difficulty you have when you work in an emerging market is you never have enough,"" he says. ""It's very tough because it's like being asked to choose between cutting your right arm or your left arm. So every decision is very painful, engages lives, has a huge impact on how people live, whether they live or not, and if you take that responsibility seriously it can be quite heavy."" Related: Ivory Coast seeks chocolate fairness for farmers . Born in 1962, Thiam spent his childhood in Ivory Coast and Morocco before relocating to France for studies. He made his first professional steps in Paris and New York and in 1994 he returned to Africa to be in charge of Ivory Coast's infrastructure projects. But in 1999, while Thiam was abroad, a military coup overthrew Ivory Coast's government. Thiam returned to the country and was initially put under house arrest. He was then asked to work for the new regime but Thiam refused the offer and returned to Europe to work in the private sector. Thiam spoke to CNN's Robyn Curnow about Prudential, Ivory Coast and what it takes to be a good leader. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Being the first African to run a big FTSE 100 company, that kind of discussion that comes back at you a lot, doesn't it? Tidjane Thiam: It does -- I try to stay away from it and to move away from it, but fundamentally it's not a real issue. Fundamentally I think you just have to be yourself, that's the only thing you can do anyway and that's the only way to live your life. CNN: Prudential is very much a multicultural organization. What are the tricks to running a global business in today's environment? TT: The the only thing you can do is to be authentic. People have their own filters to look at you and to decode what you are saying or what you are doing according to their own cultural references, but I think one thing people can read across cultures is whether you're being genuine or not. Read related: Oil vs. cocoa: Why Ivory Coast isn't like Libya . CNN: You've told me before it's harder being an African minister in a government, than a CEO of a large company. TT: It's very different. The difficulty you have when you work in an emerging market or emerging economy is you never have enough. For instance, often I had to get involved in the public investment process and frankly if I added all the requests we had when we did the budget every year, it was between 50 and a 100 times the resources we had. In the West, when you budget you're going to get 20, 30% more than what you have, not 50 times or a 100 times, and frankly I think each and every one of those requests were legitimate. So if you have to go from 50 to one, it's very tough because it's like being asked to choose between cutting your right arm or your left arm, so every decision is very painful, engages lives, has a huge impact on how people live, whether they live or not, and if you take that responsibility seriously it can be quite heavy. The consequences of the decisions you make are of a completely different magnitude on a human level. CNN: You very much charted a new road in terms of privatizations, that was in a way revolutionary in West Africa. TT: It's not complicated, we had no money, as the President put it. The first challenge he gave me was. ""look ... we have a drought, the dams are empty, we need a power plant but we have no money so I need you to build a power plant."" That was my first job, so yes, I think if you don't have money, you have to be creative. So it was actually very exciting. We had to go out and innovate, frankly it's as much out of necessity that we went and raised private capital. Watch: Rebuilding Ivory Coast's cocoa trade . CNN: You rejected the military regime's offer. I've read that you've said that the period after the coup was a very lonely time. TT: I have to say the coup was popular, people did not understand my position, my position was a position of principle ... A lot of so-called democrats were applauding the coup and I'm saying this is really short-term thinking and it's very poor thinking -- because it is bad for democracy that in one of the few countries in Africa where there had never been a coup and I was absolutely convinced that it was all going to go wrong and there was no stopping it. Watch: How a coup made a CEO . Because in countries with weak institutions once you've allowed someone to take a minister or cabinet member and make him crawl with his AK-47, that's it -- it's going to happen over and over and over again. It's always wrong to build your power on military might...because someone will always have a bigger gun than you. There's always someone who's got a bigger muscle than you or a bigger stick than you, a bigger baseball bat and he can always break your skull, that's why we have a rule of law, that's why we have civilization. CNN: You get angry, don't you? TT: Yes, it's just unnecessary. We are the poorest, we are the weakest, we are divided -- if on top people are going to fight each other, what chances do we have? I go to Asia, you get to Bangkok, Hanoi, Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, I challenge you to see a difference between Sunday and Monday -- there are seven days in a week and they use those seven days to work and to produce. So if we spend our time fighting each other while others are working together toward a goal, we shouldn't be surprised if we fall behind.","Ivorian-born Tidjane Thiam is the chief executive of Prudential .

"(CNN) -- Wildfires raging in Northern California briefly halted the search for extraterrestrial life on Tuesday. The Eiler Fire, burning some 200 miles north of Sacramento, forced employees at the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet and power. ""We can't listen when all that is down,"" said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer and director of SETI Research. At SETI -- which stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- scientists search the heavens for signs of extraterrestrial life by ""listening"" with an array of small satellite dishes. The blaze came within a mile of the facility, located near Hat Creek, California, on both the east and west, according to Shostak. ""The fire on the west had jumped the road, burnt down our favorite lunch place, got within a mile of the telescopes,"" he said. As the flames got closer, the staff fled to safer ground and shut down the satellites. ""We just lost some search hours,"" he said. ""To expect that E.T. will somehow reach out at this moment, that would be very bizarre."" The Eiler Fire may not have cost the researchers their chance to find aliens, but it's already burned more than 31,000 acres and threatened over 700 homes. However, fire offficials say the fire is 35% contained and is expected to be fully contained by August 20th. The search for life can continue at SETI's telescope array.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean marines detained an American man on the bank of a river bordering North Korea late Tuesday, according to a South Korean Defense Ministry official and a senior U.S. State Department official. The marines were on a regular patrol mission west of Seoul when they caught the man by the Han River in an area where it divides North and South Korea. The U.S. citizen was being interrogated Wednesday, the defense ministry official said, adding that it was not immediately known whether the American was trying to cross into North Korea. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul said it was ""aware of the reports that a U.S. citizen has been detained attempting to swim from South Korea to North Korea."" The Embassy said it had been in contact with South Korean authorities but didn't have any additional information to share. Americans are allowed to travel to North Korea, usually arriving by plane from Beijing. But it's forbidden to cross from South Korea into North Korea. The U.S. State Department warns citizens against all travel to the authoritarian state led by Kim Jong Un. Three U.S. citizens are currently in detention in North Korea: Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Fowle. A North Korean court on Sunday sentenced Miller to six years hard labor for committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea, although the circumstances surrounding his alleged crime remain murky. Bae, a Korean-American missionary, is serving a 15-year sentence for allegedly trying to bring down the North Korean government.

"(CNN) -- Contrasting Barack Obama's upcoming visit to Africa with Chinese president Xi Jinping's recent tour indicates seismic shifts not only within Africa but also in terms of global power. On this visit, only Obama's second to Africa since he became president (Xi visited Africa during his first foreign tour as head of state, in March this year), he will be visiting a continent which feels increasingly less beholden to American dictates. China's growing economic influence in Africa, which generated more than $160 billion in bilateral trade in 2011 (when U.S. merchandise trade with Africa was worth just $95 billion), plays an important role in this shifting sentiment. Read this: Obama's goal in Africa: Counter China . An interesting characteristic of the recent Chinese visit to Africa was the virtual lack of any protest -- and this has also been the case for previous visits by Chinese heads of state. In South Africa, where Obama will be visiting, the politically powerful umbrella group for the country's unions, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), will be throwing its weight behind the ""NObama"" campaign, which seeks to call on ""millions"" on the African continent ""outraged at the horrifying record of U.S. foreign policy."" While China seems an easy target in terms of its own unflattering human rights record and lack of democracy -- particularly for many African post-colonial states that have waged wars against the tyranny of imperialism -- reaction is surprisingly mute. One of the reasons for this is that Chinese oppression is viewed as largely reserved to its domestic sphere. America, particularly in the wake of its ""War on Terror"" and its various military interventions, has made much of the developing world, Africa included, suspicious of its freedom-promoting agenda. The often patronizing, strings-attached variety of aid given by the U.S. smacks to many African leaders of neo-colonial paternalism. China, by comparison, is loath to interfere in African internal affairs, doling out aid to democrats, autocrats and kleptocrats alike. China's ""non-interference"" policy is warmly welcomed by many African states, although to what degree China can maintain such a stance as its presence grows, remains to be seen. Read this: Economist Dambisa Moyo, 'China can transform Africa' Certainly, it has deployed peacekeepers to troubled regions such as Liberia and the DR Congo and has offered assistance in combating Islamic militancy and piracy in Mali and Somalia respectively, but only hesitantly. In Sudan, where it had a virtual monopoly on brokering peace between the north and the south, it engaged from a distance. In official discourse, China frequently insists that it has no intentions to build military or naval bases in Africa. This can be contrasted with the United States camp Lemmonier on the coast of Djibouti and the setting up of the United States African Command (AFRICOM), responsible for military operations in 53 African countries. The United States has let it be known that it is not impressed with certain aspects of the warming relations between China and Africa. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on her 2012 trip to Africa asserted that the U.S. would continue to stand up on human rights issues, ""even when it might be easier or more profitable to look the other way, to keep the resources flowing"" -- a comment widely believed to be aimed at China. This statement goes to the heart of a much broader issue regarding China's presence in Africa and how it differs from Western engagement. China has a fundamentally different conception of human rights. In China's view, developing impoverished regions is the most fundamental step in addressing human misery. As the Chinese proverb goes: ""To get rich, build roads first!"" It is for this reason that China sees its vast infrastructure and aid projects in Africa as a far more sincere gift to the African people than that of democracy. Additionally, China is itself a highly autocratic state which has deployed a rapid and often coercive development model to bring its own people out of poverty (some 350 million and counting). This is the only political and economic recipe it knows. While many African states welcome a vast trading partner like China no longer holding them hostage to the fluctuations of Western markets, there is equally a danger of over-enthrallment. Research findings on African people's feelings towards China (as opposed to their leaders) are mixed, with sporadic cases of anti-Chinese sentiment in countries such as Zambia and Ghana offset by a cautiously optimistic attitude toward the economic development and aid that they bring. Such ambivalence is warranted. China's investment on the continent is inextricably bound to securing access to African markets and resources -- a reciprocity which is referred in Chinese parlance as ""win-win."" And yet, when analysing overall trade patterns, the vast majority of African exports are raw materials while imports consist mainly of manufactured goods. This resembles a non-value-added economic pattern which harks back to the days of European colonialism. The official Chinese line is that, with increasing Chinese FDI, the setting up of Special Economic Zones and a growing African manufacturing base, this unhealthy pattern will change. A cynical retort to this is that China is primarily concerned with winning the scramble for global resources (for which the U.S. is its major competitor) and African welfare comes far second. While issues of humanitarianism and combatting terrorism will be high on Obama's agenda, the administration has woken up to the fact that investment is also a priority. Africans have China to thank for that. The fact that Obama's upcoming visit is readily cast in the shadow of China also suggests that Africa is increasingly becoming a site of struggle for broader geostrategic influence between the two powers. Its significant mineral reserves, strategic position and growing economy make it an important pivot. This puts African leaders in a somewhat enviable position and if they play their cards right, they stand to benefit from both the East and the West. The opinions expressed in htis commentary are solely those of Ross Anthony.","President Obama visiting an Africa 'increasingly less beholden to American dictates'

"(CNN) -- More than 6 million Americans signed up for Obamacare before the March 31 deadline to get private health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. This is great news for the Obama administration. But there are millions more reasons to celebrate Obamacare. Actually, at the writing of this essay, there are more than 317 million reasons — because that's the population of the United States of America and every single one of us can benefit from health care reform. How? Here's a rundown by the numbers: . 3.1 million . That's how many young adults can get coverage because of the provision in Obamacare that allows them to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26. 105 million . That's how many Americans no longer have lifetime expense caps, whether it's because they have chronic illnesses or because their insurance company set restrictive policies. 6.1 million . That's how many Americans with Medicare Part D no longer have to go through the ""doughnut hole"" coverage gap. This means seniors can save more than $5.7 billion on prescription drugs. 3.2 million . That's the number of small businesses estimated to be eligible for tax credits for providing health insurance to their 19.3 million employees nationwide, credits worth $15.4 billion in 2011 alone. 4.4 million . That's how many low-income adults will now have access to health insurance thanks to states implementing the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare; an additional 5.8 million poor adults would be included in this count if 25 mostly Republican-led states weren't refusing Medicaid expansion. 50 to 129 million . That's how many people will benefit from the Obamacare provision that eliminates all bars for coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Studies say that anywhere from 19% to 50% of non-elderly Americans have health conditions that could qualify as pre-existing conditions. 49.4 million . That's how many current Medicare enrollees can feel secure knowing that, under Obamacare, existing Medicare benefits can neither be reduced nor taken away. 317 million . -- That's how many Americans — i.e., all of us — potentially benefit from the requirement that insurance companies provide flu shots, HIV screenings, prostate exams, mammograms and FDA-approved contraception for free, without a co-pay. -- Plus, we all benefit from new requirements that insurance companies must spend at least 80% of our premium dollars on our health care as opposed to marketing or administration. -- We all benefit from the new requirement that insurance companies publicly justify their actions if they want to raise premiums by 10% or more. -- We all benefit from knowing that our insurance can now never be capped or canceled at the whim of insurance companies. As high quality care is maintained while costs may go down because of improved coverage and access, we all benefit from a more affordable and effective health care system. What about, you ask, the estimated 4.7 million Americans who lost their current insurance plans during the rollout of Obamacare? Well, according to a congressional report, 2.35 million or so can take advantage of the Obama administration's decision to grandfather those plans through 2014. Another 1.4 million qualify for Medicaid expansion or subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges. On top of that, the Obama administration has agreed that a ""hardship exemption"" built into health care reform for any American facing major challenges in complying with the law would be interpreted to include those whose policies had been canceled. In other words, they won't be penalized. When Republicans rolled out stories of alleged Obamacare victims, the details were usually debunked in some way. The truth is that many of the canceled plans were no longer legal under Obamacare because they neither covered the basic things insurance should cover or, worse, were dangerously designed to explode the minute the insured got sick: what Consumer Reports has called ""junk insurance."" Arguing that people should be able to keep these plans is like arguing that people should still be allowed to drive defective Chevy Cobalts or cars without seat belts. Like it or not, the government's job is to help keep us safe and insurance companies that were peddling shoddy products were doing the opposite. Polls show most Americans want to keep Obamacare and work to fix it rather than replace or get rid of health care reform altogether. And there's much to suggest support for Obamacare would be even higher were it not for constant Republican attacks and misinformation about the law. After all, when Americans find out what specific provisions are included in Obamacare, they overwhelmingly support them.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn released news of their relationship to limit paparazzi intrusion on their romance, the world's No. 2 golfer said Wednesday. The 14-time major champion is preparing for the Arnold Palmer Invitational tournament in Florida, where a win would see him reclaim the number one ranking for the first time in over two years. Woods and Vonn -- a four time Alpine World Cup skiing champion -- released statements and a series of pictures confirming their relationship on Monday. And the 37-year-old told a press conference at the Bay Hill course they had put out the snaps to prevent any invasion into their lives from photographers that he referred to as the ""stalkerazzi."" Perfect match: When athletes date . ""It's very simple, we're very happy where we are at but also we wanted to limit the stalkerazzi and all those sleazy websites out there following us,"" he told reporters. ""I've had situations where it's been very dangerous for my kids, the extent that they'll go to. We basically devalued the first photos. ""Unfortunately that's just the way it is in our society right now and we felt it was the best thing to do and we're very happy about it."" The pair's relationship has been big news since Monday's confirmation but Woods is now focused on trying to wrest golf's world No. 1 crown back from friend, rival and Nike stablemate Rory McIlroy. It would mark a significant transformation for Woods, whose stuttering form in recent years saw his ranking slump past the 50 mark at one point. But after victory at the Cadillac Championship in Doral last week -- his 17th World Golf Championship title -- Woods can now reach golf's pinnacle if he can secure his 77th PGA Tour triumph. ""I feel like I'm headed in the right direction,"" he said. ""I'm very pleased where I've come from. Like I said, 50‑plus to where I'm at is no small task. ""I'd like to get to 19-plus (majors) myself. Getting back to number one and all that it entails, it's not easy to get there in the first place. I don't think people realize how hard it is to get to number one in the world. ""It's been a long process. I was hurt for a long time, I had to make swing changes that were drastically different than what I was doing before. It's taken some time."" Woods is defending champion at Bay Hill, beating 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme Dowell by five shots last year to secure his first tournament win since 2009. He has won four more times in the last 12 months and he puts a large slice of his resurgence down to the fact that he has remained injury free during that period. ""I just needed to get healthy,"" he added. ""Once I got healthy and I was able to practice properly, I felt like then I could implement the swing changes that (coach) Sean (Foley) wanted me to put in there. ""But I needed to get healthy enough where I could practice. It happened to be a perfect storm where I was making a swing change, and I was hurt, and I couldn't devote any time to it. ""To gradually work my way back, that's something I'm proud of."" Woods' game attracted praise from Palmer himself, who won seven major titles during a glittering career that has seen him regarded as one of the finest to play the game. ""I think right now looking at him and watching him play, he looks probably as strong and as good from a golf perspective as I've ever seen him,"" the 83-year-old told reporters. ""I think his swing and his posture and his attitude is far better than it's been in some time, and it takes me back to when I first played with him at Augusta when he was a rookie. ""I give him a chance. I suppose that every year it's a little more fleeting, however, and he'll have to really work hard to keep himself up and keep his mental attitude if he's going to do it.""","Tiger Woods says he revealed romance with Lindsey Vonn to limit paparazzi focus .

"(CNN) -- Giant killer hornets have killed at least 42 people in China since July and left more than 1,600 injured and dozens more suffering from multiple organ failure and severe allergic reactions. But the Asian giant hornets aren't just a problem in China -- they're also found in other countries, including nearby South Korea and Japan. Travelers would do well to know how to behave if they're faced with these deadly creatures (tip: walk away, don't run). While it's easy to assume that the relevant vaccinations -- and maybe an anti-malarial medication or anti-histamine -- would keep us safe on our overseas travels, such an assumption can be dangerous. There are plenty of unexpected threats out there that could turn your vacation into a nightmare --- and possibly kill you. Here are 10 of the more treacherous creepy-crawlies out there. 10. Loa loa . This disease is spread by the bite of the innocuous mango fly, but can leave victims with worms crawling out of their eyeballs. (Google ""Loa loa"" at risk, the images are graphic.) It's only number 10 on this list because it won't kill, and may not even blind, but it's still pretty freaky. For travelers to sub-Saharan Africa the best protection method is to cover up with long sleeved clothing and consider using insect repellent. 9. Assassin Bug . The Assassin Bug first finds its sleeping victim using its natural thermal-imaging camera, then a chemo-sensor that can detect carbon dioxide. Once it lands on the face the bug feeds on blood from the lips or eyelids -- without its victim even knowing it's there. As the insect feeds it also defecates, and that's how a tiny single-celled parasite can leave the assassin bug and enter your bloodstream, leading to Chagas Disease. Over the years Chagas Disease can lead to the stopping the muscular contractions of the guts, leading to the body filling up with its own waste products, or it may simply cause heart failure. The bite of an infected Assassin Bug supposedly killed Charles Darwin, after decades of suffering. Although present in the United States, this bug, and the disease it carries, is normally only a problem in Central and South America. Sleep in a romantic thatched beach hut at one's peril, because assassin bugs love making their homes in such places. 8. Botflies . If you knew that there was a large, slow-moving fly at large in South America, and that if it landed on you it was likely to lay eggs onto your skin that would hatch immediately and release larvae that would burrow into your flesh and eat you alive, then you'd probably squash it. But the botfly has evolved to avoid this response by ""kidnapping"" other innocuous flies or mosquitoes and laying eggs on them instead of its intended host. When the ""kidnapped"" fly lands on the skin, the eggs drop off, larvae burrow into the skin and make it their living dinner -- without the parent fly ever being at risk. A botfly infestation might not kill, but is messy, and it hurts. Doctors will usually cut out the larvae pustule and prescribe antibiotics to clear it out of the system. Again, the best protection is to cover up. More: Surviving the world with Bear Grylls . 7. Intestinal worms, roundworms, hookworms and tapeworms . These creatures rarely kill, but they will cause discomfort and embarrassment. In more severe cases, they can grow in the brain, causing fits and seizures. Tapeworms are usually contracted when eating under-cooked meat, whereas the larvae of hookworms and roundworms don't even need to be eaten. They can access a body by burrowing through skin, without the victim noticing. Once in your body, roundworms share their victims' ingested food (although they can also block the intestines). The hookworm, however, feasts on the blood. Don't eat under-cooked meat and never walk barefoot in developing or tropical countries because the roundworm ascaris lumbricoides is said to infect 75% of the world's population. 6. Irukandji . The Irukandji jellyfish, considered by researchers to be one of the world's most poisonous creatures, is only the size of a thimble. A tiny jellyfish that is almost invisible, the Irukandji has a painless sting, but can cause massive pain and suffering afterward. The threat is not just for swimmers. It's been reported that a 45-year-old Filipino was stung by an Irukandji while fishing from a bulk carrier. The man, who was airlifted to hospital, was 25 meters above sea level when stung. It's thought that the creature was blown up with sea spray. Jellyfish nets aren't effective either because this tiny animal can slip through. Wearing a ""stinger suit"" is advised when swimming in Queensland or the surrounding region during Irukandji season, and never swim on beaches without lifeguards with reliable local knowledge. This little beast is most problematic around the east coast of Australia. More: A traveler's guide to eating insects . 5. Wandering spiders . One of the most venomous and dangerous spiders in the world is the Brazilian ""wandering spider,"" or ""banana spider,"" although its bites are also famous for another nasty side effect. The venom can cause involuntary and long-lasting priapism for men. Chances are the victim won't be able to put it to good use before he dies from the other components of this potent toxin. 4. Bloodworms . The very name ""bloodworm"" sounds macabre. But the damage they can do to the human body, and the sheer scale of the problems caused by these tiny parasites, is far scarier. The larvae (cercaria) of these little animals live in freshwater snails, usually in relatively clear water. But when they sense a warm-blooded host, such as a human being swimming past, they swim towards it, penetrate the skin, move around the body, and finally make their home in the intestines, or the bladder, where they can live and reproduce for up to 12 years gradually destroying the organ that they made their home. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi film, but it is definitely not rare. Up to 200 million people suffer from schistosomiasis (bilharzia) worldwide and a large proportion of these will die prematurely from the illness. The solution -- don't swim in slow moving fresh water anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa or South America. In other places check first. People have even contracted the disease in un-chlorinated swimming pools in Rio de Janeiro. 3. Sand flies . In South America a sand fly bite can lead to the eyes or nose being eaten away by bacteria, and in the Indian sub-continent the disease that they carry can (and often does) kill. The tiny flies don't make a buzzing noise and can sneak through mosquito nets, making any form of defense difficult. Insect repellent, long-sleeved clothing and avoiding sand fly habitats are the best tactics. 2. Day-biting mosquitoes . Researchers are working on a dengue fever vaccine. For now, the only protective measure is to cover up and wear repellent. Most of us know that we should avoid going out at night without some form of protection against evening-biting mosquitoes, whether that is in the shape of long-sleeved clothes, insect repellent or simply staying inside. However, day biting mosquitoes can spread a disease called dengue fever, otherwise known as ""break-bone fever."" The first time the victim contracts it, he or she will probably survive. The second time it's possible to develop dengue hemorrhagic fever, in which case one's organs can turn to mush and bleeding proceeds from every orifice -- and there's a good chance of death. Dengue is widespread across most of the tropics, with cases often occurring among backpackers on idyllic Southeast Asian islands, but if that's not bad enough daytime biting mosquitoes can also spread tiny worms that cause lymphatic filariasis. Also known as ""elephantiasis,"" the worms block the lymph nodes of the body's drainage system"" causing testicles to swell to the size of beach balls and legs to resemble tree trunks. In areas of India up to one third of the population may be infected, and the disease is essentially incurable. So, cover up in the day time as well as the evening, unless you know that it's safe to bare your flesh. 1. Candiru fish . Candiru fish attacks are not a regular occurrence, but the consequences are so dire that it definitely merits its place as the No. 1 craziest threat when traveling. The way to avoid this blood-sucking fish's unwanted attentions -- don't pee in the Amazon. Though there's much debate about this fish and alleged tales of its attraction to urine, no man wants one stuck in their urethra, as happened to at least one poor chap in recent years. Once inside, it will feed on flesh before surgery is required to get it out.

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber isn't the only famous face being copied via plastic surgery. Claire Leeson recently appeared on the United Kingdom's ITV program ""This Morning"" to discuss how she has spent almost $30,000 to look like Kim Kardashian. Us Weekly reports that Leeson became obsessed with looking like the reality star after watching E!'s ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" in 2009. ""When I get my Kimmy on I feel like I'm unstoppable,"" the Essex, England, resident reportedly said. Leeson said she had been bullied in the past and called the 'ugliest thing alive.' "" ""When I left school, friends would tell me that I had a resemblance to Kim,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- As the final days of 2012 trickle away, an uncommon emotional intensity hangs in the air in America. Something is happening here. The country stands on the cusp of major change. Gun control is just one of the formerly taboo subjects that has come out of the political closet. Today, a majority of Americans support stricter gun laws, a majority support a more progressive tax system and most favor same-sex marriage. A majority of voters even support the idea of legalizing marijuana. The laws have not caught up with this dramatic change in attitudes, and entrenched interests will fight what amounts to a quiet but pivotal social revolution. The coming year will see continuing battles in the courts, in the media and in legislatures, as the forces of change -- now representing the majority -- seek to upset the status quo. No topic has stirred more passion in recent days than the clash between two competing rights: the right to own guns and the right not to get shot. Americans feel the lingering sadness, confusion and anger surrounding a recent massacre of schoolchildren, stirred more by the outrageous, dumbfounding, Christmas Eve murder of firefighters responding to a call for help in New York. Then there's that strange, unbecoming political show, the one with the ticking clock, known as the fiscal cliff. The contest over the budget sounds arcane, but it deals with a fundamental social value, the role of government in society, and the way the burden of financing ought to be shared. Those are just the most immediate of the ongoing dramas adding stress to holiday dinners, energy to television shows and liveliness to coffee house debates. The United States is reassessing matters that many thought had been settled. It wasn't very long ago that the views from the most conservative elements of the political establishment dominated the social agenda. Since the turn of the century we had seen a steady turn toward lower taxes, a ban on even discussing gun control, a rising wave of anti-gay legislation and all manner of conservative legislation. America seemed left behind, ossified, as other parts of the Western world, which generally share America's culture and values, revised their views and rules on social issues. In July, after the movie theater massacre in Colorado, President Obama unhelpfully, unnervingly, mused that ""if there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's the reminder that life is very fragile."" This time, in the wake of the Newtown massacre, he found a more practical takeaway, launching a push to stop gun violence. Most importantly, the tragedy energized the growing majority of Americans who support stepped-up gun control. It also prompted the powerful NRA to push back, and we can expect an all-out campaign whose outcome is far from certain. But the battle has been joined -- and not just in Washington. It took far too many killings, but the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary finally pushed the matter of gun rights one awful step too far, and the conversation changed. Jeffrey Toobin: 2013, a year for big issues in the courts . People who have spent decades working tirelessly for change will no doubt want to correct the impression that all this change has come suddenly. Surely, gay rights activists, gun control organizations have toiled with only minimal victories as reward. In recent months, however, we have reached a tipping point. It may have something to do with the media -- social media, television, the Internet -- providing a boost to the message, a message of human dignity and common sense. It certainly has much to do with demographics. Young people, growing up with new ideas, are picking up the torch of social change. Today, a majority of Americans -- 57% -- favor stricter gun control, jumping sharply from 39% just a few months ago. That's bad news for the most conservative elements in society, who think the government should stand back from almost every aspect of our lives. But the truly radical transformation has come in the area of gay rights. For the first time, Gallup Polls show a majority of Americans support full marriage equality for gay couples. That's an astonishing change. But it's not as astonishing as the wholesale acceptance of gay people that has suffused American society in the last few years. Perhaps it was ""Will and Grace"" or ""Glee"" or President Obama's long-delayed approval of same-sex marriage. Probably all of the above and much more, but a switch has been flipped. The cause has gained an unstoppable momentum, so unstoppable that even if full equality is denied by the conservative-tilted Supreme Court, scheduled to rule on the issue by this summer, it will only amount to a delay of the inevitable. Once again, the people are leading their leaders. Public views, especially among the young, hold that discrimination is not only wrong, it's silly. Attitudes are changing in other ways that seemed unthinkable not long ago. Who would have thought Americans would favor legalizing drugs? Two-thirds of voters under age 30 support legalizing pot, bringing the overall total to 51%, and giving a boost to referendum campaigns on the issue. The wisdom of lowering taxes also dominated for many years, but no more. Three-quarters of Americans agree it makes sense to make the tax system more progressive, raising the burden on the wealthy. What exactly ""wealthy"" means is still unclear. And, as in all the other areas of change, the battle to transform those majority views into law will be hard-fought. With just a few days before the start of 2013, the issues facing America are serious, the disagreements are intense, and the range of views is wide. And yet, the country is facing its choices with nervous anticipation. Something is happening in America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: After years in which conservative views predominated, U.S. is changing .
Ghitis: 2013 should see impact of support for progressive tax rates, same-sex marriage .
Gun control is now considered an urgent issue once again, she says .

"Cambridge, MA (CNN) -- As Daniel Nocera gazed down on one of his experiments in what has come to be known as the ""holy grail"" of energy research, his response was to shrug: . ""Oh, that can't be right."" It was a glass of tap water with a thumb-sized strip of silicon floating in it. When he held the glass up to the light, the strip began to gently bubble. It seemed to be splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. But this would mean you could take any tub of water and -- with no more than a few cheap materials and a little light from the sun -- produce two incredibly powerful fuels. It couldn't be right. Professor Nocera went back and, for 8 months, tried to prove himself wrong. The artificial leaf: better than nature . Scientists had split water before. By 1870, electrolysis using platinum electrodes and vast electrical currents could achieve the feat. In the 20th century, too, simpler methods had been developed which used sunlight to power the reaction -- but these, too, relied on prohibitively costly metals. Nocera's ""artificial leaf"" is different. On either side, the silicone strip is coated with inexpensive metallic compounds -- a cobalt phosphate catalyst that spurs the creation of oxygen gas, and a nickel-zinc alloy that does the same for hydrogen. The process only uses as much energy as it can pick up from sunlight: in the lab, Nocera flicks off the light, and the bubbles disappear. The reaction was inefficient when first demonstrated in 2008 -- with little of the sunlight being locked up in the fuels -- but today it beats nature at its own game. In natural photosynthesis, the process by which all plants take in energy -- and which ultimately provides the fuel for all life on earth -- only very small amounts of solar energy are converted to fuel. ""The best stuff that grows in the field, a plant, it only fixes 1% of the light,"" explains Nocera. ""We're already on 7%."" Freedom from the grid . ""My vision of the world is: if you see some sun, you will be in control of your own energy supply,"" says Nocera, now professor of energy at Harvard University. First, he's looking to the developing world where, he says, two drinking bottles of water could provide a household with a steady 100 watt power supply . The water wouldn't even need to be clean: . ""You find some water on the ground, you put it in, the water circulates over this thing that's collecting the light just like a solar panel and then it's splitting into hydrogen and oxygen."" Anyone could have an artificial leaf device -- which he predicts ""will look like dishwashers"" -- and produce enough bottled hydrogen and oxygen to power the house through the day and night. In the developed world, colossal investment in power stations, pylons and other infrastructure over the last century has guaranteed inexpensive electrical supply for all from the grid -- and he says there's therefore currently little demand for this kind of personal power station. But in the developing world, where many are without connection to such infrastructure, there is a real desire -- if it can be made cheap. That's why Nocera sees his mission -- now focused on driving down costs -- as more than just an act charity: . ""You can say I'm trying to help the poor -- I always say: 'No, the poor are helping me,' because they can be much more nimble."" ""They can be the early adopters and teach the world what the future energy system will look like."" Why it won't happen soon . Today, Nocara knows he's not wrong about what he saw in the glass. He's sure he has found the key to turning water and sunlight into high-power fuels, without high costs. ""I've found the solution, there's no question. You can take sunlight and water, drop this thing in, and simply split hydrogen and oxygen. You can't get simpler."" So when will we see his remarkable creation on the ground? ""Not very quickly,"" says Nocera. ""I tell you what I don't like about my invention? I make hydrogen."" ""Hydrogen is the most powerful fuel, but it's a gas. If I gave you hydrogen right now you wouldn't know what to do with it."" For now, he says, he'll have to work on convincing people to find ways to make hydrogen ""fuel cell"" technology easy-to-use. That, or combine hydrogen with CO2 to produce the type of liquid fuels we're more familiar with -- gasoline or diesel -- a process which has seen big advances in recent years. Still he refuses to get disheartened, and believes it will happen one day: . ""When you are trying to make a new energy infrastructure -- you better understand that this isn't going to happen overnight. ""There's nothing any scientist is going to invent in a lab that will displace hundreds of trillions of dollars' worth of investment in an energy infrastructure."" ""It's got to be a mind-set -- everyone's got to want it."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . Wireless electricity? It's here . Forget wearable tech, embeddable implants are already here .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has named a new target as global sparring over Ukraine grows: food. In a decree signed Wednesday, Putin banned food and agricultural imports from countries that have imposed sanctions against his country. The retaliatory move comes more than a week after the United States and European Union increased economic sanctions on Moscow for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia. A list of specific products and food bans is still being worked out by the Russian government, according to the decree, which describes the order as a special economic measure ""aimed at ensuring the security of the Russian Federation."" Russia is Europe's largest importer in value of animals, meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, according to the European Union. And goods from the EU represent 16% of all Russian imports, EU numbers show. Search for MH17 victims halted for now . Putin said measures would be taken to prevent a jump in food prices in Russia. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN a ban in imports will only deepen Russia's international isolation and work against the country's own economic interest. ""Russia's Central Bank yesterday pointed out that bans on imported food will push up Russia's already high inflation rate, eroding the purchasing power of Russian citizens,"" the official said. The United States insists that sanctions against Russian businesses and individuals are having and effect and already weakened Russia's economy. ""Sanctions are working as intended in putting enormous pressure and strain on the Russian economy. ... The economy has ground to halt,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters on Wednesday. If Putin doesn't push to resolve problems in eastern Ukraine through diplomacy and peaceful means, Obama said, ""he's going to be hurting his economy and his own people over the long term."" But so far, Obama said, violence in Ukraine hasn't stopped even as sanctions against Russia have increased. ""The issue is not resolved yet,"" he said. 'You still have fighting in eastern Ukraine. Civilians are dying."" Russia has denied allegations that it's supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. Several countries imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia annexed Crimea in March, which escalated the Ukraine conflict following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych a month earlier. Since then, tensions have simmered and flared in Ukraine, with frequent battles between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russia separatists in the eastern part of the country. A new buildup of Russian troops along the Ukraine border raised concerns Tuesday that Moscow might be contemplating another intervention like the annexation of Crimea. According to a NATO official, Russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed ""in an area along the entire border with eastern Ukraine."" The buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the last week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there, the official said. In addition, Russia's Defense Ministry is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces. The exercises are taking place in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, roughly 500 miles from the border with Ukraine. Similar military exercises in the region preceded the annexation of Crimea.

"(CNN) -- Jon Meis' reported habit of carrying pepper spray may have saved students' lives after a man opened fire at a Seattle college. The shooter had just wounded three people Thursday, one of whom died. He was reloading his shotgun when Meis, a volunteer security guard, saw an opening. He doused the gunman with the spray and tackled him to the ground. Other students at Seattle Pacific University piled on and took the weapon away from suspected shooter Aaron Ybarra, 26, police said. Officers are convinced the bloodshed at the Christian school would have been worse had Meis and the others not intervened. A man who said he was close friends with Meis' older brother and sister-and-law described him as ""amazingly resourceful."" ""I wasn't surprised to see he was the hero -- his resourcefulness, love for others and knowledge of the greater good are what defines him, in my mind,"" Andrew Van Ness told CNN in an e-mail. Van Ness said Meis enjoyed playing a campus ""humans versus zombies"" game organized by the school's Student Union Board, finishing in the top 10 both times the game was held. On Thursday, Meis appeared shaken, at moments on the verge of tears, when ambulances arrived to tend to the wounded. Medics put him on a stretcher and took him to a hospital to check him over. Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg didn't identify Meis by name but said a man believed to be the student hero was thoroughly evaluated and released. He had no injuries, she said. Police would not give out his name, but one of his friends was quick to point him out to CNN affiliate KOMO and pour out his gratitude. ""I could have been one of these people that was injured or in critical condition,"" said Meis' friend Patrick Maguire. ""A lot of (students) were in that building, and he stopped him in the lobby. He didn't get any farther than that. I'm grateful for him, yeah."" Meis, an engineering student, has a reputation for keeping a low profile, not seeking attention, The Seattle Times reported. He is known as a devout Christian and an excellent student. Meis' sister told the newspaper that the family wasn't commenting for the moment. But he hasn't been able to dodge the social media limelight, which has plastered his name and photos across the Internet with emphatic kudos. ""Hero"" was the common refrain. ""Jon Meis is a hero. I have no words for his courage,"" user Molli Elizabeth posted to Twitter. ""Jon Meis, You are my hero! Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. (Jn 15:13),"" Tweeter Shane Bengry posted with reference to a Bible verse. His longtime roommate Ryan Salgado told The Seattle Times about the pepper spray. He said Meis regularly carries it, just in case. CNN's Justin Lear and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Family friend describes hero as ""amazingly resourceful""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday announced a Justice Department program to try to thwart recruitment by extremist groups such as ISIS, attempting to involve social and mental health workers as well as religious leaders and police to spot radicalization early. This effort is an outgrowth of existing community outreach programs that in recent years have linked Justice Department prosecutors, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security with imams and local organizations hoping to prevent young people from joining terror groups. Despite those efforts, authorities say more than 100 Americans have traveled in recent years to join groups involved in the Syrian civil war. More than a dozen are believed to have joined ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. What's the world going to do about ISIS? The FBI and other agencies are grappling with trying to track those who not only support radical groups online but also help recruit and try to travel to join the fight. The Obama administration says the new program will reach out to social services and mental health workers to help spread what is known about extremist groups' recruitment methods. The idea is not only to counteract recruitment but also to encourage local community intervention efforts before law enforcement has to pursue possible prosecution. ""We have established processes for detecting American extremists who attempt to join terror groups abroad,"" Holder said in a video message posted on the Justice Department's website. ""And we have engaged in extensive outreach to communities here in the U.S. -- so we can work with them to identify threats before they emerge, to disrupt homegrown terrorists and to apprehend would-be violent extremists. But we can -- and we must -- do even more."" A U.S. official said one of the first such places expected to be part of the new program is Minneapolis, where in recent years young people have been recruited to join the Islamist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, and more recently Syrian Islamist rebel groups. The Justice Department has worked with local religious and community groups to help provide support when those communities face discrimination while using those contacts to find out when there are concerns about radicalization. However, in recent years, some imams and family members have complained about the heavy law enforcement response when they contact officials to express concern about specific members of their community. The U.S. efforts are similar to those done in the UK and other countries, which have sought to remove counter-radicalization efforts away from the focus of law enforcement.","Justice Department effort will try to involve community to spot radicalization early on .

"London (CNN) -- Andy McNab is trying to convince me that being a psychopath is good for business. ""When I look at CEOs, or even political leaders, I don't want them to have empathy,"" he says. ""What I want them to do is to have focus and to make the best decisions possible. ""I want them to be ruthless,"" says the ex-soldier with a hint of passion so fierce it risks betraying his claim to ""have no feelings."" If the timbre of McNab's voice gives much away, his face is inscrutable in the darkened basement room chosen for our interview. His true identity is hidden because of the anti-terrorism operations he was once engaged in as a member of Britain's elite SAS. McNab isn't even his real name, rather a pseudonym adopted to write the 1993 book, Bravo Two Zero, recounting his time behind enemy lines in Iraq. Trauma, it seems, has been a recurring theme in McNab's life, which may explain the man's ability to master his emotions. Left at the door of a London hospital as a baby in a Harrods carrier bag, McNab had a rough upbringing, in and out of juvenile detention in South West London, before finding himself suited to the discipline of the army, which he joined at 19. Although he was only officially diagnosed as a psychopath four years ago, McNab says he always knew he was different. ""As kids you run around the housing estates in gangs,"" he says. ""Well, when the gangs started their smoking and their drinking, it didn't interest me at all... I was always slightly detached from that."" As a professional soldier, McNab says he first killed a person during his first year in the military and was surprised to have felt no remorse. ""You are in a situation where nine out of ten times in conflict they are trying to do the same to you. So you've got a responsibility to yourself to stay alive... you've got a responsibility to keep everybody else alive,"" he says. But what exactly is a psychopath? And is the disorder a hindrance or can it be a help? From Charles Manson, to Ted Bundy, the annals of crime history are replete with examples of what you might term traditional -- or dysfunctional -- psychopaths, people capable of carrying out the most abhorrent crimes, those without feeling or the ability establish meaningful relationships. Now after extensive research scientists have begun to realize a scale of less extreme psychopathic traits that may lie in some of us, ones which, if harnessed correctly, McNab says can be a secret weapon. ""When we look at psychopaths, we always look at the Hannibal Lecter-type character. Or Norman Bates, but it's a broad spectrum,"" he says. ""Focus is the key. And, in my line of work, I have found where I am on the psychopathic scale has been nothing but an advantage."" Today, though, the grenades and guns are long gone. McNab saves his fighting talk for the boardroom, coaching top management on how to become better leaders, with a seat on five boards and a new book called The Good Psychopath's Guide to Success. ""The board room is the same as the situation room,"" McNab says. ""Nine out of ten times the decision processes are the same. ""I tell them, get rid of the empathy. Focus on what you've got to do. The most important thing is the mission,"" he says. ""Ask yourself what am I here to achieve?"" And ""empathy,"" he concludes, ""doesn't help you get there."" While McNab's message might sound harsh, his doctrine isn't new. In 2011, Jon Ronson's book ""The Psychopath: A Journey Through the Madness of Industry"" estimated the incidence of psychopathy among CEOs was four times larger than in the rest of society at large. In an interview with Forbes magazine, the journalist said the prevalence of psychopaths in the business world appears heightened because capitalism selects for their specific behavioral features. The psychopath, Ronson tells the publication has been ""hailed and given high powered jobs, and the more ruthlessly his administration behaved, the more his share price shot up."" And nothing makes a share price soar more than news of cost cuts. Which brings me to the question: how does a psychopath fire someone? McNab, it seems, is often called upon to help navigate this corporate minefield. ""One particular woman I spoke to was brought on board to make about 400 people redundant. She had empathy for these people, for their families, for their mortgages."" ""For her it was [taking] a huge emotional toll. And it was a case of sitting down with her and trying to get her to think of it in a different way."" So does McNab think the free market has taken the stigma out of the word ""psycho"" to society's detriment? ""Certainly if we are looking at capitalism, what we have seen is the ones who step up more tend to be high on the psychopath trait level. That doesn't mean to say they're the Gordon Gekko types. Far from it."" McNab says some two million people have logged on to take his web site's psychopath test while numerous chief executives have bought his new book. But McNab insists he isn't trying to convert all heads of industry to his unique line of thought. ""We're not trying to make everyone a psychopath. That would be totally counterproductive. ""What we are trying to do is to clear the decks for them to understand how their brands work, how their brains work, so that they can become more productive."" And to sum up his strategy McNab uses a word rarely mentioned in the context of the psychopath's condition. ""It's about striking a balance,"" he says. ARE YOU A PSYCHOPATH?

"(CNN) -- We've all heard the old adage that travel is about the journey, not the destination. Now, a travel company in Taipei, Taiwan, is taking the concept so literally that it's not even bothering to list the destinations on its newest city tour. That's because not even the company knows where its customers will be heading once they've booked a tour. The company is called Topology and its unique, experiential tour is called the Taxi Diary. 'We're going where?' Though the results can range from mundane to memorable, the Taxi Diary concept is simple. Customers pay NTD1,000 ($33) for the privilege of doing a ride-along in a local taxi for a four-hour stint. The tourists travel wherever the taxi is called upon to go by its normal customers. Topology -- the same company that let travelers to be a sweet potato mama for a day -- says the appeal of the tour comes from traveling to destinations entirely dictated by whoever hires the taxi. ""This idea came to me a long time ago when I was a passenger in a taxi,"" says Peter Lin, Topology co-founder. ""That driver was so talkative that we chatted nonstop during the half-hour drive. He told me where to find great food in town."" ""Ever since, I've thought letting taxi drivers and local commuters be city guides might be a good idea."" Topology's Taxi Diary tour was launched last month. So far one traveler from the United States and one from England have tried the tour, according to the company. Those two tours ended up zipping past usual tourist spots such as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Xinyi District and the Office of the President. They also took in places that aren't easily accessible to travelers, such as locations in New Taipei City, an hour from Taipei's city center. Unknown alleys, dinner invitations . Lin took a trial ride before the tour was officially launched. ""At first, it felt really weird, honestly, because we never sit in a taxi for such a long time and (never) meet people we aren't familiar with,"" he says. ""But even for those of us who were born and raised in Taipei, we hit some alleys we've never been to and saw scenes that we wouldn't see if we were on foot. It felt great."" Aside from new sights, Lin says the main draw of Taxi Diary is the chance to meet local people. ""Taiwanese are famous for our hospitality, so travelers can make friends with local commuters and the driver,"" he says. ""One passenger invited Harry, our traveler from England, to her new house in the Linkou District and treated him a big meal with her family."" Finding the right drivers . Finding taxi drivers willing to collaborate was challenging at first. ""We needed to convince drivers that this tour wouldn't impact their business, that it's (actually) going to help due to the extra income they receive from the tour,"" says Lin. Taxi Diary now works with five English-speaking taxi drivers. Signs displayed in each cab explain the tour concept to potential customers before they decide to hire the cab. Another bonus for the drivers, according to Lin, is exposure to foreigners. ""The drivers might not have too many chances to go abroad, but travelers can bring the world to them,"" he says. ""Our taxi drivers are all happy to have the chance to connect to the world."" So what if there aren't a lot of passengers during a given tour? ""This never happens, but our backup plan is to take travelers to traditional tourist spots and enjoy a local meal with the driver. ""Taxi drivers are the best tour guides -- they know Taipei so well and the meals they choose are always awesome. ""A journey is not about the sights, but about the insights gained from the experience and the people you meet. ""These are what make a journey unique and unforgettable."" Topology Taxi Diary; NTD1,000 ($33) for four hours; discount of NTD350 ($12) for the first three participants each month; booking available online on the Topology website; tours can accommodate up to two travelers.","A new tour in Taipei, Taiwan, allows tourists to do four-hour ride-alongs in local taxis .

"(CNN) -- The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is playing out before the world's eyes. Each new update about the disease's spread is breathless; each new detail is related with dramatic flourish. ""Ebola Outbreak Hits Home"" reads one headline; ""Ebola outbreak is 'out of control,' "" says another. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, workers in hazmat suits carefully transported a second American patient with the disease to an Atlanta hospital for treatment. It is no wonder people are frightened of Ebola despite the fact that an outbreak has never happened in a developed country. ""What if Ebola just wipes us out?"" one Twitter user asked. Our fears are reflections of an infectious disease narrative fed to the public for years -- by health officials, by the media and through a potent story delivered in books and movies about the ""Bug or Virus That Will Kill Us All,"" experts say. The drama of infection, and the horrible death wrought by Ebola, only adds to our morbid attention. ""We're fascinated by epidemics,"" said Philip Alcabes, director of the public health program at the Adelphi University Center for Health Innovation. ""What we see on this side of the ocean is poor people dying, and doctors and health aides in space suits. 9 questions about this new Ebola drug . ""It looks like the movies, and we've been prepped for a cinematic response,"" he said -- for the plot to unfold much like it does in a film. ""People perceive this as a very dramatic disease,"" said David Quammen, a science writer and the author of ""Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic."" ""There is almost hysterical fear about Ebola on behalf of distant people in developed countries who think, 'This is going to come and get us.' "" Hysteria tends to take hold, experts say, the moment that health officials label an outbreak of disease an epidemic or pandemic. Priscilla Wald, author of ""Contagious: Cultures, Carriers, and the Outbreak Narrative"" and an English professor at Duke University, says those pronouncements are often the beginning of an ""outbreak narrative."" ""A terrifying disease, easily transmitted, spreads from a developing country and threatens to become apocalyptic,"" she says, roughly summarizing the plot of movies such as ""Outbreak"" and books such as ""The Hot Zone."" ""That story has been told so many times, even when people hear one piece of that story, that one element may invoke the entire narrative,"" she says. Conflating movie images with reality, and seeing those same images cycled through newscasts, may explain the roots of our fears about infectious diseases generally, but there is a deeper quality to our consternation about Ebola. ""Ebola has been the disease people around the world love to fear,"" says Quammen, adding that the SARS outbreak in 2003 infected thousands more people than the current Ebola outbreak yet caused significantly less worry. ""SARS wasn't as dramatic in terms of symptoms,"" he said. ""It wasn't as vividly gruesome as this disease sometimes is."" An Ebola infection can cause profuse internal bleeding. One online commenter interpreted it as ""... your internal organs rot into a bloody pulp and you're living through it."" Alcabes says, ""Sometimes we're morbidly fascinated with diseases that are disfiguring."" Alcabes, author of ""Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to Avian Flu,"" compares current attitudes about Ebola with how people decades ago feared leprosy, another disease that is not highly contagious. Our anxiety tends to overshadow facts about the disease that could temper our unease, he says. Ebola outbreaks have occurred only sporadically since strains of the virus were first identified in the mid-1970s. The outbreaks have tended to appear, affect a few hundred people and eventually fizzle out. (Considering that history, the current outbreak that's killed more than 900 people might be cast as an unsettling anomaly.) What you need to know about Ebola . When an Ebola outbreak is investigated, the source of an infection usually points back to an animal. The virus infects, say, a chimp or gorilla, and a human who has close contact with that animal becomes infected. Coming into contact with, or eating, the types of animals that become infected with Ebola would be a highly unusual scenario in the United States -- as unusual as mass human-to-human infection. Still, ambivalence is not the attitude we should have when it comes to diseases such as Ebola, says Wald, the ""Contagious"" author. We should have some level of deference to Ebola's virulence; it kills between 60% to 90% of the people it infects. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that becoming infected is difficult. ""Should you be scared? Yes and no,"" Wald says. ""You shouldn't be impervious to the situation. You should experience an appropriate level of concern without allowing it to spiral into unrealistic panic."" Quammen says, ""(People) should be scared in a rational way. But to be simply scared that this is the boogeyman that's going to come and get us is ignorant and wrong."" Ebola is horrible, he adds, ""but it has killed far fewer people than things we think of as mundane diseases like measles, influenza and malaria."" In other words, Quammen says not to buy into the cultural myth, the sort of drama that has suffused the conversation about Ebola. For some, that may be easier said than done. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? The difficulty with corralling our fears is that at the root of our despair is potentially something basic, even natural. Perhaps Ebola fears are a proxy for heavier questions we may be subconsciously pondering about our collective demise. ""We humans dread death,"" Alcabes says in his book. ""It is only natural that the mass mortality brought by great plague makes us afraid."" Quammen, who has written extensively about fears of ""The Big One"" -- the virus that could wipe us out -- says that Ebola is not it. In a recent New York Times editorial, he said Ebola is not ""... an incipient pandemic destined to circle the world, as some anxious observers might imagine. It's a very grim and local misery, visited upon a small group of unfortunate West Africans, toward whom we should bow in sympathy and continue sending help. ""It's not about our fears and dreads. It's about them."" Ebola is here: 5 reasons not to panic . Experimental drug likely saved Ebola patients .

"(CNN) -- American University professor Adrienne Pine began her first day back in the classroom this semester the same way she has since her teaching career began: making sure her research was up to date, her notes reviewed, and the lecture she was about to give was ready. But before she left for school, she noticed her infant daughter wasn't feeling well. Since her usual daycare center doesn't allow children with fevers, Pine decided to bring her baby to class. What started as a challenging day for the single working mother soon exploded into a national controversy because after her daughter started fussing, the professor began nursing -- in front of 40 students -- to get her to stop. The campus newspaper quickly heard about it and a student reporter from the Eagle asked the professor for a comment. Pine, angered that her actions were seen as provocative, fired back -- hard -- on the website CounterPunch, saying she was ""annoyed that this would be considered newsworthy"" and that she ""had no intention of making a political statement or shocking students. I merely had a sick baby who I couldn't leave at daycare on the first day of class. ... As it turned out, the baby got hungry, so I had to feed it during lecture. End of story."" Her remarks ignited a small protest on campus in Pine's favor and against the student newspaper. Pine's comments, which went viral, also forced the Eagle to defend its reporting. Meanwhile, some criticized Pine's response to the student journalist and the tone of her rebuttal. Today professor Pine spoke with CNN: ""Frankly I felt, and I continue to feel, that the most professional thing I could do was to carry out the class with as few as possible interruptions. Leaving class for 10 minutes would have been a serious interruption for my students. And I also feel that since I've been breastfeeding inp public in every place possible -- in buses, on planes -- I didn't realize the degree to which people are afraid of breasts in this country and in particular, in the workplace."" American University, which today acknowledged it does not offer any emergency backup child care for its faculty or staff, says this controversy has given rise to a much-needed internal debate. ""We want our faculty to be the best teachers and scholars possible and, at the same time, we are sympathetic to the need for work-life balance. Now that this important question has been raised, we consider it healthy to discuss it and we are indeed addressing it in our community,"" said Phyllis Peres, senior vice provost and dean of Academic Affairs. Latch on NYC: In support of breastfeeding . Missing in all this finger-wagging is a discussion about access to emergency backup child care for working parents. Is there enough, and if not, should employers of all stripes -- public, private, big, small -- be compelled to offer more? And if it's the child who is sick, and not the babysitter, what provisions do these centers reasonably need to provide? According to the latest Families and Work Institute National Study of Employers, only 6% of companies surveyed in 2005 offered backup child care. This year, the number has dropped to 3%. Bright Horizons, a leader in the field of backup care, serves the emergency needs of more than 750 companies and even provides services when a child runs a fever. Last year, a representative of the company said, it provided backup care to infants, toddlers, preschoolers, school-aged children, as well as disabled, ill, and elderly adults on more than 640,000 occasions -- meeting the emergency needs of 4.6 million employees. I know about Bright Horizons because like professor Pine, I'm also a working parent, and Time Warner, the parent company of CNN.com, is a client. When my children were younger and I worked for another network, I've used a similar center on various occasions when my regular child care imploded. But unlike professor Pine, if my son or daughter was ill, I thought ahead and had a plan. I never brought a sick child to work. And the fact that professor Pine did on August 28 only fueled the uproar over her actions. Breastfeeding intuitive and easy? No! I recognize Time Warner is a big company and many smaller organizations and schools of higher learning don't have the budget to offer backup child care to employees. But that's not an oversight in my thinking -- it's central to my point. Perhaps in this election year, uneven access to emergency backup child care is something President Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney need to address for all working parents. While I am not a single mother, I've known my own brand of child-care challenges. My husband's parents never wanted to play backup babysitter -- they had their own full and busy lives -- and my parents are deceased. In reality, working parents always need to have reliable, go-to options when a child gets sick -- a friend, a neighbor, a relative -- and if you can't come up with even one alternative, you may want to consider if you're honoring your end of the bargain when accepting a job. There does seem to be good news in all this, particularly for professor Pine. Between 2009 and 2011, Bright Horizons reports, the field of higher education has seen the second fastest growth rate of all industries it serves in terms of number of employees covered by backup child care. Liz Kennedy, a spokeswoman for the company says, ""One of the reasons we are seeing a shift in demand for backup care in higher ed is the changing demographic makeup of college faculty and professors."" And if American University chooses to move in that direction, professor Pine might feel she has real backup child care options as a working parent, instead of believing, as she currently seems to, that she has no choice at all.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two unconnected overseas emergencies -- the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Syria -- are prompting President Barack Obama to embark on a two-day U.S. road trip that the White House hopes will demonstrate a commander at work. The spread of Ebola in West Africa, which hasn't slowed despite $100 million of pledged U.S. aid, is unrelated to the U.S. mission to degrade ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. But both have prompted worry among Americans about their personal safety and led to charges the White House isn't doing enough to combat the hazards. The dual foreign plagues have yet to pose an immediate threat to the United States homeland, the White House says, though each has claimed the lives of Americans abroad. And officials say both Ebola and ISIS could grow to become unmanageable problems if action isn't taken now to stamp them out. Obama's trip, which begins Tuesday, will take him to the Atlanta headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later to the U.S. Central Command at the MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The President's stop Tuesday at the CDC comes amid loudening criticism from health experts on the global response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where almost 2,500 people have died. At the U.S. public health agency Obama will be briefed on the outbreak and speak to officials there about how the U.S. is responding. Afterwards he's likely to announce new U.S. commitments in combating the virus' spread, the White House said Monday. Though officials would not specify how the U.S. may increase its response, steps Obama could announce include sending more medical equipment and U.S. doctors and nurses to combat the virus, and ramping up training for local medical teams. The Defense Department may also be asked to increase its support in handling logistics of the large-scale response already underway, which involves multiple countries and aid groups. Epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries aren't sending enough resources to the three nations most affected: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The U.S. has committed more than $100 million in the effort to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Obama plans to call on Congress to approve an additional $88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government. Last week USAID said it would spend $75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment. But so far the U.S. aid has been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which Obama and White House officials are calling a national security problem. Particularly concerning, U.S. officials say, is the potential for instability in the countries where Ebola is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form. Ebola currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide, health experts say. Speaking Monday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said there was still a ""very low"" likelihood the Ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the United States. ""Right now, the risk of an Ebola outbreak in the United States is very low, but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the United States,"" Earnest said. The potential for increased risk to the U.S. homeland has also inspired the more robust response to ISIS terrorists, who Obama announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside Iraq and Syria. That mission is run from U.S. Central Command in Tampa, where Obama will receive a briefing on battle plans Wednesday. The White House said the President would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility. Obama and his aides maintain that ISIS fighters don't currently pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland but warn of the potential for militants with U.S. or Western passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern. Secretary of State John Kerry has been engaging Arab and European nations in building a coalition to fight ISIS, though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague. ""We're pleased with the level of conversations that we're having with these governments and their willingness to contribute in a tangible, important way to this broader effort,"" Earnest said Monday. ""We'll have some announcements to make in terms of what sort of cooperation and involvement and commitment that we have from the international community. And based on the tenor and tone of the kinds of private conversations that are underway right now, we expect those commitments to be substantial.""","Obama hits road Tuesday for briefings at CDC and CENTCOM .

"Camden, Maine (CNN) -- Follow Daniel Kish out onto a dock and ask him about the view. ""There's this pylon here and there's an object about 20 feet away -- here -- and another one, about 50 feet away,"" says Kish, overlooking a bay in coastal Maine during the recent PopTech conference, where he was a featured speaker. ""I guess those are boats. I can't tell from this distance, really, but they're solid and we're on the water -- so it stands to reason."" Kish is completely blind -- he lost sight in both eyes by age 13 months. Yet he uses his ears to see. When he walks around unfamiliar places -- he loves hiking -- he clicks his tongue and then listens as that sound bounces off nearby objects. He says he's trained his brain to turn these sounds into an image of sorts -- an auditory map he follows with the help of a cane. ""When you send out a sonar call ... you're interrogating the environment,"" he said. ""You're asking, 'Where are you?' and 'What are you?' And the environment answers back."" Kish is the founder of a nonprofit called World Access for the Blind. His goal is to teach this technique of ""human echolocation"" -- or seeing the world through sound -- to blind people all over the world. So far, the group has taught at least 500 blind children to see with their ears. ""It isn't that difficult to teach. It really isn't,"" he said. ""I believe that the brain is already at least partly wired to do this. All that needs to happen is the hardware needs to be awakened. It needs to be activated, and we believe we've found ways of doing this."" Not everyone believes him. ""Many of Kish's colleagues believe that echolocation, if it's taught, should remain a secondary skill for the blind,"" Daniel Engber wrote at Slate. ""And some disability advocates worry that all the hoopla over sonar makes blind people seem like superhuman freaks, with special powers that more than compensate for their problems."" In a presentation at PopTech, a conference about new ideas in science and technology, Kish describes himself as a ""real-life batman"" and showed videos of his blind students riding mountain bikes through obstacle courses, playing basketball and skateboarding."" But he sees the technique as much more than a gimmick. ""This is not aiming at making our students daredevils or 'super-blind' or anything like that,"" he said. ""It's really aimed at opening opportunities and helping students ... to lead day-to-day lives."" On the controversy surrounding his teaching, he added: ""I think that has a lot to do with a dogmatic adherence to tradition -- if it ain't broke, why fix it."" Kish, who lost both his eyes to cancer when he was an infant, says something is broken with the way blind students all over the world learn. By and large, they're taught to be dependent on sighted people -- in part because 99% of them, he said, are taught by people who can see. Kish aims to liberate students. By clicking their tongues and listening for echos from buildings, cars, dogs and the like, he believes they can be less dependent on sighted people. ""Our view is that should one solicit assistance, that one should do so out of a matter of personal choice rather than being cornered into it,"" he said. If you saw Kish walking down the street you'd hear him make repeated clicking sounds with his tongue -- click! click! click! -- as he weaves through traffic or ducks to miss tree branches. The clicks usually aren't terribly loud, but they come at a continuous clip. He makes the sound more often when he's a bit confused or comes to an intersection. Other times he's silent as he walks with the help of a cane. Kish is quick to eschew instructions from those who travel with him, said Bill Wolfe, who worked with Kish at the PopTech event. Kish admits that echolocation isn't perfect. Other creatures that use sonar to see, such as bats, emit ultrasonic frequencies. Humans, of course, can't do that. ""A bat can determine an object the size of a gnat from so many meters away,"" he said. ""For me, the object has to be at least the size of a softball. So bats definitely have the edge on humans in terms of their use of ultrasound."" Kish founded World Access for the Blind in 2000. So far, he hasn't hasn't found much interest from groups in the United States. Of 50 schools for the blind his group has contacted, only two have expressed interest in teaching echolocation, he said. Similarly, of 1,300 agencies that deal with issues relating to blindness, only 10 wanted to work with World Access for the Blind, he said. Kish, however, seems undeterred. He's been clicking his tongue as a way to see for as long as he can remember -- it's an adaptation, he says, to the fact that his parents raised him just like they would have any sighted child. They didn't give him a break because he experienced the world through other senses. And he's on a breakneck world tour evangelizing for the idea. ""It's like seeing with dim flashes of light,"" he said of the tongue-click method. Those dim flashes are enough, he says, to change a person's life -- allowing him or her to go hiking alone, ride a bike or do something as simple as enjoying a view of the coast. Not allowing blind people a chance to do these things, he said, would be ""very shortsighted.""","Daniel Kish teaches a technique to help blind people ""see"" with their ears .

"Washington (CNN) -- Attention, all drug runners. Your days of using caltrops to avoid apprehension are over -- at least in Texas. Caltrops -- more commonly known as road spikes -- are small spiky objects like those used in the game of jacks. When tossed on roadways, they always point up and have a devastating impact on tires. Drug runners have increasingly used the devices when fleeing from law enforcement officers, officials say. Beginning Thursday, caltrops are illegal in the Lone Star State. State Rep. Aaron Pena crafted the caltrop ban at the behest of the U.S. Border Patrol, whose tires have borne the caltrops' trademark slashes. ""There's a portion of my district which goes right up to the border, the (Rio Grande) river,"" Pena said. ""And caltrops are used there probably more than any other location in the United States."" Almost all reported cases of caltrop use can be found in a 20-mile stretch of the border west of McAllen, Texas, authorities said. ""The first time we were exposed to this was 2008 when we had one incident,"" said Rosendo Hinojosa, chief of the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector. In 2009, there were 12 incidents, with 13 last year. The homemade caltrops found in Pena's district probably are made in Mexico. Typically, they are little nails that are welded together. They are cheap, easy to deploy and, Pena says, very effective. ""If you run over a caltrop, your tires will deflate,"" he said. Caltrops also are indiscriminate. Those that do not puncture the tires of pursuing police cars sometimes puncture the tires of citizens' cars. No one spoke in opposition to the ban at a hearing, Pena said. Hinojosa said while caltrops are effective, the Border Patrol has a countermeasure. ""They can't spike our helicopters,"" he said. But caltrops are hardly a new idea. There are numerous references throughout history to caltrops being used to puncture the feet of enemy soldiers or the hooves of their horses. The notorious bank robber John Dillinger, employing a similar tactic, is alleged to have tossed nails behind his car to defeat pursuing police officers following a heist. The Dillinger gang ""actually did it several times. It became part of their robbery technique,"" said Tony Stewart, author of ""Dillinger: The Hidden Truth - Re-loaded."" The new Texas law prohibits the possession, manufacture, transportation, repair or sale of caltrops. But it exempts tire puncture strips that are designed to puncture tires when driven in a specific direction, such as those at car rental facilities, and caltrops used as curios, such as those in museums, or on display in Pena's office. Will the ban stop drug runners from using caltrops? ""No,"" Pena conceded. ""No, it won't. But it is a small measure that taken with other small measures will add up to an effective response.""","U.S. Border Patrol requested the new law .

"(CNN) -- Sierra Leone is facing its toughest test to date. The Ebola virus, very deadly and currently without a cure, is fast-spreading throughout the small West African country. Ebola has overburdened Sierra Leone's already fragile health systems, and shown firsthand the devastating effect underdevelopment and lack of investment can have on a country's well-being. Decades of poor political decision making, bad investments and brain drain have rendered Sierra Leone incapable of managing a health crisis of this magnitude. In a desperate cry for international help, the government of Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency, informing the world that it has lost control in its battle against the virus. Today, there are a handful of qualified doctors and nurses left to manage this health emergency. Many health practitioners have left for better working conditions and higher wages elsewhere in the world. Many of those that have remained have contracted the virus. Their reward for their bravery is treatment in Sierra Leone's substandard facilities. While we are dealing with a worldwide epidemic, it is those living inside the country who are feeling the brunt of their government's mismanagement. The number of those infected has doubled in recent weeks, forcing for the government to call a four-day lockdown starting this week in a bid to control the virus. What this means is that every Sierra Leonean is quarantined inside their homes, unable to leave until after the lockdown. It is a method that some critics argue only drives those infected underground, and will do little to actually curb the spread. Everyday life in the country is a challenge at the best of times, with many Sierra Leoneans living on the margins of society, and 60% of whom already live below the poverty line. Now, cut off from the rest of the world and facing a health crisis of unparalleled proportions, those same countrymen are likely to be pushed over the edge. Those living in Freetown, the nation's capital, have to resign themselves to treatment in substandard health facilities, while watching infected Americans and British citizens be treated to a higher, more efficient level of medical care in their home countries. The Ebola epidemic will certainly leave scars across the country. Sierra Leone's economy is expected to shrink by 3.5% as a direct result. If Sierra Leone can ever hope to recover from this slump and get back on fiscal track, it will need a healthy working population and increased business confidence. Right now, that's going to prove a challenge. The British government has recently offered a glimmer of hope on that front, announcing it will build a 62-bed, first-class medical facility in Freetown. Should the building come to pass, it would bring some much-needed confidence to an already strained health sector. But more than anything, what Sierra Leone needs right now is for its government to show leadership at this critical point in the crisis. There needs to be a unified process for identifying and isolating suspected cases, and a centralized health system that can shoulder the weight of those already infected. Because until the virus is brought under control, there will be a continual slowdown in all sectors of Sierra Leone's economy, a slowdown from which it might never recover. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ayo Johnson.","Sierra Leone's economy is expected to shrink by 3.5% as a result of Ebola outbreak .

"(CNN) -- Here's a presidential election prediction you can bet on. Right after the winner is announced, somebody somewhere in America will fall on their knees and pray, ""Thank you Jesus."" And somebody somewhere else will moan, ""Help us Jesus."" But what Jesus will they be praying to: a red state Jesus or a blue state Jesus? If elections are about choices, so is faith. And in Christianity, liberals and conservatives choose to see Jesus in different ways. Some liberals see Jesus as a champion of the poor who would support raising taxes on the wealthy, while some conservatives think Jesus would be more concerned with opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. Good luck to anyone who tries reconciling their Jesus with the biblical accounts of his life. Even Jesus' earliest followers clashed over who he was and what he meant. ""Jesus didn't leave clear instructions,"" says Molly Worthern, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in religious history. ""He was a man who said many things that were quite cryptic. All Christians tend to pick or chose to emphasize some of his teachings over the other.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A southern California woman convicted of cutting off the penis of her then-husband and throwing it into a garbage disposal was given a life sentence Friday with the possibility of parole after seven years, authorities said. Catherine Kieu, 50, of Garden Grove, California, and her husband were going through a divorce at the time of the July 2011 incident. The couple married in December 2009, but in May 2011 the husband filed for divorce, which was granted in August 2011, according to Orange County court records. Kieu laced her husband's dinner with the sleep medication Ambien after they had an argument over a friend possibly staying with them at a later date, the Orange County district attorney's office said in a statement Friday. When the husband went to sleep, Kieu tied his legs and arms to the four corners of the bed, and when he awoke, she pulled down his pants and severed his penis with a knife, prosecutors charged. Kieu then threw the severed penis into the garbage disposal, turned it on and mutilated it, prosecutors alleged. Kieu then called 911 about how her husband was bleeding, and he was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery, authorities said. The victim's name has not been made public because he is a victim of spousal abuse, police said. The ex-husband, 60, described the trauma in an impact statement during Friday's sentencing, according to a statement by the prosecutor's office. ""The convicted (person) viciously deprived me of part of my life and identity,"" the ex-husband told the court. ""Then, as is routine in cases of violence that involve something sexual, the victim must endure, at the hands of the defense, a second attack. This was a cruel and calculated violation of a person's body and mind. I now struggle with what is before me. She has torn off my identity as a man. She has caused doubt in my belief in good. She has betrayed my trust in people."" On April 29, a jury convicted Kieu of one felony count of torture, one felony count of aggravated mayhem, and a sentencing enhancement for the personal use of a knife, prosecutors said. The Vietnam-born Kieu is also known as Que Anh Tran, court papers said. She and her ex-husband had no children, divorce papers said. During the trial, Kieu's attorney said she suffered mental health issues, including depression, and the lawyer argued she shouldn't be found guilty, the prosecutor's office said. The Orange County case was widely compared to the1993 attack against John Wayne Bobbitt by his then-wife, Lorena, who cut off his penis with an 8-inch carving knife while he slept. Lorena Bobbitt then drove away, tossing the penis out her car window. The penis was eventually found and surgically reattached. Lorena Bobbitt was later found innocent by reason of insanity. During her testimony, she tearfully described her life at the hands of what she described as her abusive husband. In a separate trial, John Wayne Bobbitt was acquitted of sexually assaulting his wife. He later made adult films.","Catherine Kieu, 50, is sentenced to life with possibility of parole after seven years .

"(CNN) -- Wine-making in Georgia has been an integral part of the country's culture for millennia; so ingrained is viticulture in the country that imagery of grapevines can be seen adorning churches and public monuments. But a Russian embargo on Georgian wine imports imposed in 2006 has meant its vineyards have been transformed more in the last six years than the previous 8,000. Until the embargo, the country of 4.5 million people in the Caucasus region sold around 50% of its wine to Russia. A year after it was cut off from its biggest market, sales dropped by a further 25%, according to the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia. Safety concerns were the official reason behind the Russian ban on all beverages imported from Georgia, although many within the wine industry believe the move was politically motivated. ""In 2004 the wine industry started its reforms and by 2006 (counterfeiting and sub-standard quality wine) was partly solved,"" says Levan Davitashvili, of Schuchmann Wines, an independent winery in Georgia. While little known to most wine drinkers in western countries, Georgia has traditionally had a reputation for producing the best quality wine from the region, especially among former Soviet states. With over 500 endemic varieties of grapes it is one of the world's most diverse for types of wine, with most families owning small vineyards using traditional wine-making methods -- typically in huge, underground amphorae-like vessels called ""qveri"". Yet its good reputation was diluted by counterfeiting that increased during the late 1990s and early part of the last decade. One of the most common ways to produce fakes was to pass off substandard wine, sometimes not made in Georgia at all, as a better quality product. ""In the bottle its grape juice or wine from elsewhere but it bared the label of Georgian appellation,"" says Irakli Cholobargia of the Georgian National Wine Agency. ""The other type of counterfeit isn't wine in the bottle at all, but something else like juice of radish or carrots with alcohol."" Cholobargia says that is was easy to spot the fakes even before drinking them because they were sold a much cheaper price than the authentic wines. Despite Cholobargia's contention that the counterfeiting was limited, fakes would turn up in other markets apart from Russia even as far as the U.S. The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been a substantial export market for Georgian wine and some estimates have suggested that before 2006 there was twice as much fake Georgian wine as authentic sold there. ""Georgia's wine players all suffered because of the name infringement and it hit the reputation of Georgian wine overall,"" says Cholobargia. The result of the embargo and loss of the biggest export market was that many wine-makers simply had to close while those that survived had to upgrade their facilities and quality. Many, like Schuchmann Wines, have recast themselves as boutique vineyards with an eye to tapping into the western market. Previously known as Vinoterra and founded in 2002 by a small group of Georgian winemakers near the eastern city of Telavi, it was bought by German investor and wine aficionado Burkhard Schuchmann in 2008. The aim was to provide a higher quality wine that would impress European wine drinkers. ""Western consumers have better expectations rather than those who have an established history of drinking Georgian wines,"" says Davitashvili, who also says that the 300,000 bottles that Schuchmann Wine produces each year could be expanded to one million as China's thirst for wine increases each year. While sales of Georgian wine have been increasing for the last three years, it could still take another five years for the volume of sales to surpass pre-2006 levels, according to Cholobargia. With only 45,000 hectares of vineyards (one of the world's largest wine producers, Spain, has over one million hectares), Georgian wine will always be a relatively bespoke operation. ""But if we get back the same volume (as 2006) the value will also go up,"" says Cholobargia. Since 2004 the Georgian government has taken steps to protect and encourage the industry, legally reclaiming Georgian names from companies registered in Israel and the U.S., and in April an agreement with the EU came into effect on mutual protection of trademarked food and drink. ""Wine is very important for the country,"" says Cholobargia. ""It's one of the high quality products of the country. The key instrument to raise awareness, plus the uniqueness gives us the opportunity to attract international attention."" CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports.","Georgia is thought to be the world's oldest wine producing area .

"(CNN) -- With the blockbuster success of ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" many people are curious about dipping their toes (not to mention other body parts) into more sexually adventurous waters. I'm always careful to make clear that while the adventures of Ana and Christian may make for a compelling erotic yarn, their story is by no means an accurate depiction of BDSM relationships (bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, masochism), nor is ""Fifty Shades"" any sort of guide book. For instruction on that topic, you'll need to turn to the works of true sex-positive educators such as Clarisse Thorn or Tristan Taormino and their books ""The S&M Feminist"" and ""The Ultimate Guide to Kink,"" respectively. But there's no denying that ""Fifty Shades"" has sparked widespread interest in how to improve our sex lives -- and what better way to do that than via a good ""how-to"" book? If you're uncomfortable talking about sex to your friends, doctor, therapist or even your partner, such books can be an important resource, whether they impart new information, help you work through an issue, inspire you to become more adventurous or simply turn you on. So, in the spirit of sharing, I asked some of my favorite sex experts to pick their favorite sex books: . Debby Herbenick, a research scientist at Indiana University and the author of ""Sex Made Easy:"" ""Hands down, I recommend 'The New Male Sexuality' by Bernie Zilbergeld. A classic in the field, it gives a rich picture of men's sexual lives including myths they're taught about sex and common problems such as erectile issues, communication blocks and rapid ejaculation as well as solutions for these problems."" Joe Kort, a clinical sexologist and founder of the Center for Relationship and Sexual Health: . ""I recommend Jack Morin's 'The Erotic Mind,' which helps remove the shame of sexual behaviors and fantasies by understanding what they mean in a nonsexual way. Morin addresses where fantasies and desires come from and how shame can be removed and replaced with healthy acceptance for individuals and couples."" Stay-at-home dads are sexy . Amy Levine, sex coach and founder of Ignite Your Pleasure: . "" 'Hot Sex: Over 200 Things You Can Try Tonight' by Jamye Waxman and Emily Morse is a fun, sensual, seductive, creative and tantalizing book filled with more than 200 ways to tease, play, entwine and explore. When I coach couples who are in a sex rut, I suggest they use this book as a tool."" Laura Berman, sex educator, researcher and therapist: . ""If I had to pick, I would choose either 'The Anatomy of Love' by Helen Fisher or 'The 5 Love Languages' by Gary Chapman. Both are extremely helpful for couples to understand how men and women are wired differently and to learn how to love one another in a way that lasts."" Justin Lehmiller, Harvard University social psychologist and online sex columnist at The Psychology of Human Sexuality: . "" 'The Technology of Orgasm' by Rachel Maines chronicles the history of 'hysteria,' a bogus female medical condition that led to invention of the vibrator. Maines' book is a meticulously researched, fascinating and humorous look at the origin of hysteria and the birth of the motorized sex toy. ""I also adore 'Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex' by Mary Roach, which traces the history of how scientists have studied sexual arousal and orgasm in a very engaging way that refuses to take itself too seriously and never gets bogged down in jargon or technicalities. ""On a personal level, 'Bonk' holds a special place in my heart for helping me realize how much fun a career in sex research could be."" Megan Andelloux, certified sexuality educator and sexologist: . "" 'America's War on Sex' by Marty Klein describes ridiculous sex laws and research that Americans are led to believe are true. It's a must-read book for anyone interested in sociology, psychology, sexuality education, law and parenting. ""I'm also a fan of 'My Secret Garden' by Nancy Friday, which discussed women's fantasies well before erotica became truly popular."" Are you too tired for sex? I've read and recommend many of these books myself, and this list is only the beginning of many exceptional works worth exploring and learning from. In my opinion, no list would be complete without Esther Perel's ""Mating in Captivity,"" an excellent guide to integrating a sense of sexual mystery into long-term relationships. And on a personal note, in 10 years of writing sex books, my first, ""She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman,"" remains my most popular. At the time, I often mused that many men -- through no fault of their own -- knew more about what was under the hood of a car than under a woman's clothes or what was behind her orgasm. In writing ""She Comes First,"" I am grateful to the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers and their book, ""A New View of a Woman's Body"" (unfortunately now out of print) and to Rebecca Chalker's excellent book, ""The Clitoral Truth."" Any man or woman truly interested in deepening their knowledge of a woman's full sexual potential should give this book a read. No matter where your sexual interests lie, you're sure to find something new on the shelves of your local bookstore. And if you're too embarrassed to shop in person -- well, that's the beauty of the Kindle, Nook and other e-readers -- no plain brown wrapper necessary! Any books to add to the list that have helped you improve your sex life? Tell me about them in the comments below. I'm always looking for a good read.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- If Hillary Clinton decides not to run for president -- and yes, that is still possible -- her return to the media lion's den might be a factor in her thinking. She's done a national book tour and the paid lecture circuit, but Clinton got an up-close look at today's frenzied political news environment last weekend when she visited Iowa for the first time in seven years, a spectacle primed for an avalanche of media coverage given her expected campaign and her tortured history with the Hawkeye State. I joined more than 200 other reporters who swarmed the scene and tweeted away, even though most Americans on social media that day probably cared more about Robert Griffin's ankle. The press scrum that assembled to witness noncandidates Hillary and Bill Clinton flip Hy-Vee steaks with Sen. Tom Harkin -- behind a barricade, of course -- was as large, if not larger, than the media hordes that covered her at the height of her 2008 campaign. One reporter got whacked in the head with the butt of a big television camera. Another photographer dramatically toppled off his ladder while straining to get a shot. It was a little absurd. When the Clintons approached the media zoo for question time, Bill Clinton leaned in and relished the scene. Hillary kept her distance. Political Twitter, though, wasn't just a stream of gauzy Instagram-filtered pics of the Clintons: It was also rife with media criticism, some fair and some not, from politicos and press critics who pointed to the event as another example of lazy ""pack journalism"" with little journalistic upside. The sniping had some credibility. What was the competitive advantage of being there, just one more reporter among the herd, all of us racing around to get the same quotes and the same pictures? This was especially true for the many journalists in attendance who rarely travel outside of Washington or New York to cover politics but decided to open up their travel budget for this one trip. Couldn't their time have been better spent reporting on an undercovered Senate or governor's race in some other part of the country, far away from the rest of the media scrum? Of course, the academics would say. But the incentive structure of today's click-driven news economy begs to differ. Hillary gets eyeballs. Arkansas' Tom Cotton does not. This is the world we live in. As much as I believe in straying far, far away from the rest of the media pack -- this was a lynchpin argument in ""Did Twitter Kill The Boys on the Bus?,"" the Harvard Kennedy School study I wrote last year about the hyperactive political news media -- I did find value in covering the Steak Fry. For one, I lived Clinton's 2008 campaign up close as an embedded producer for CNN, living on her campaign plane for six months and ingesting every single stump speech, gaffe and gross turkey sandwich in front of me. It was useful for me to see whether her political skills and her willingness to play the Iowa game had shifted since she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama. The whole thing was broadcast on CNN and C-SPAN, which is fine and good, but television cameras don't pick up the small things reporters can sniff on the ground: The receptiveness of the crowd, the impressive organizational prowess of the once-meager Ready for Hillary super PAC, the absurdity of the staged photo-ops and press scrums, and the rope-line body language of Clinton herself, which was noticeably more cautious than her husband Bill (some things never change). Those are the kind of atmospherics I chose to focus on when crafting my report from the scene as well as this week's episode of Hambycast. And of course, there's the reporting that went on nowhere near the Steak Fry, those meetings with Democrat and Republican sources in and around Des Moines. Was all that worth the plane ticket to DSM? Definitely. Will I go somewhere where other reporters aren't for my next trip? You bet. Watching the Iowa theatrics from afar, the journalist Dave Weigel wrote that Hillary's protocandidacy is a ""problem for the media, which simultaneously is ready right now to cover her like a nominee -- 200 reporters! -- and yet so palpably bored with how she talks, and runs."" But the ever-growing press corps, weaponized by Twitter, will also be a problem for Clinton and her team, who must find ways of engaging with a massive entourage of reporters that is constantly on the hunt for ""news"" -- i.e., anything off-message or click-worthy -- while also trying to drive the conversation on their own terms. The hyperguarded Mitt Romney encountered this same dilemma during his ill-fated 2012 presidential bid. Watch more Hambycasts . When he avoided the press, he got punished by a cranky and access-starved press corps. When he held a rare press conference to push a policy idea, his comments were drowned out by a cacophony of horse-race questions or some Twitter-driven ""controversy"" unfolding hundreds of miles away. So he chose to get his message out on his own terms, through paid media or friendly Fox News interviews, without the filter of the ""traditional"" press, whatever that means. In the end, it wasn't enough. That political reporters are motivated by conflict, personality and the ups-and-downs of a campaign is nothing new, and it's unlikely to change despite carping from media critics. What has changed is the atomized and hyperactive social news environment we all live in now, and it's changed dramatically since Clinton last announced a presidential bid in 2007, before the iPhone existed and well before Twitter took hold among the political class. If she runs again, there will be reporters covering her campaign who were barely in diapers when Bill Clinton was elected President, who came of age in an era of Internet journalism that prizes exclusives and micronews, who have very different incentives than the television and newspaper reporters that the Clintons dealt with during his presidency or her last campaign. They hold the Clintons in high-regard, but not nearly as high as the regard the Clintons have for themselves. Hillary got a taste of this during her book tour -- her de-facto re-entry into political life -- when various comments that had even a whiff of controversy or gaffe-status rocketed across the Internet at warp speed, with an assist from Republican opposition researchers. Life as a candidate, of course, is something much different. Clinton knows this. But her Iowa pop-in was her first glimpse of the thorny new reality that awaits.","Hambycast is a weekly digital show produced by CNN Politics and CNN Digital Studios .

"(CNN) -- Could the phrase ""burn a disc"" soon be interred in the computing graveyard, resting peacefully alongside 8-bit graphics and the chirping, buzzing hum of a dial-up modem? Some technology analysts, along with some of the most influential computer makers in the world, say yes. Optical disc drives take up precious space in our ever-shrinking gadgets, and the ability to stream music or movies on demand has made CDs and DVDs less essential. The disc drive's spin into obscurity may have started swirling faster last week. Apple's new iMac, its flagship desktop computer, was released Friday. For the first time, it has no disc drive. This marks a trend that has already begun on some laptops, like Apple's MacBook Airs, and of course with mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. ""Over time, an optical disc will be as much of an historical curiosity as a floppy disk,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a tech-industry analyst with research firm Gartner Inc. According to Apple, where sleeker, thinner designs are always en vogue, dumping the disc drive was a no-brainer. ""These old technologies are holding us back,"" Phil Schiller, Apple's head of marketing, told CNN sister publication Time. ""They're anchors on where we want to go. We find the things that have outlived their useful purpose -- our competitors are afraid to remove them. We try to find better solutions -- our customers have given us a lot of trust."" If the company's track record on such things holds, the optical drive may be doomed. The original Mac dumped the 5-inch disk for a 3.5-inch floppy, and the first iMac was one of the first desktops without a floppy disk drive. ""It's clearly a long-term trend, but Apple's always been aggressive about making moves like this sooner as opposed to later,"" Gartenberg said. The company's tiny Mac Mini, for the record, has been disc drive-free since last year. Sony has already announced that it will stop making optical drives itself. And the release of Microsoft's Windows 8, an operating system that works on disc-free smartphones and tablets as well as laptops and PCs, suggests that computing giant would be well positioned for such a move as well. For some users, Web habits have already begun trending away from actions that require external media. CDs? There's music streaming or digital downloads. DVDs? Netflix, Amazon or a host of other online movie sites. Video games? There's digital distribution like Steam and, increasingly, downloads from the major console and game makers. ""As personal cloud services become ubiquitous and broadband speeds increase, there's very little reason for many consumers to use an optical drive on their computer going forward,"" Gartenberg said. There are always USB ports available on the occasion that an external device is needed (Apple, for what it's worth, offers an external optical disc drive for $79). Much as Google has with its Google Drive service, Apple has embraced cloud computing with its iCloud offering, which lets users store documents, photos, music and movies on Web-based servers. A move to the cloud could mean internal storage is less of a concern for users going forward. Combined with advances in ""solid state"" internal storage and quicker broadband speeds that make downloads and streaming less painful, a post-DVD era could grease the skids for Apple and its competitors to make increasingly thin, light and inexpensive computers. Witness the new Chromebooks, laptops that run Google's Chrome system, that rely almost exclusively on the cloud and sell for around $250. To be sure, the transition may be rough on some users. ""For those who still own DVDs and want to watch them on their computers, the iMac isn't the ideal solution,"" Fortune's JP Mangalindan wrote in a review of the new iMac. ""Sure, there's a $79 external SuperDrive that connects via USB cable, but that means shelling out extra for -- let's face it -- a feature that still comes standard on most PCs. It also means messing with the iMac's minimal-looking setup."" But like it or not, folks who still pop in a disc may not have long to keep doing so. ""While it may be too early to say for certain that the optical drive is absolutely dead,"" wrote Chris Pirillo, founder of blogging network Lockergnome, ""it is certainly showing all the early warning signs of a technology that is past its prime.""","New innovations could spell beginning of the end for DVD drives .

"(CNN) -- Once more, as I often do, I find myself wishing for the late, great Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. It was he who said, ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."" But it was Florida Gov. Rick Scott who brought Thompson's maxim to life Wednesday. In fact, Gov. Scott brought it to the stage of a televised debate. To begin with, Scott has all the telegenic appeal of a garden slug: lean and hairless and slick and creepy. But then again, I've been a friend and business partner of James Carville for 30 years, so who am I to judge? What Gov. Scott demonstrated to the world is that, beneath that creepy exterior is an even more creepy psyche. A guy who is so deeply weird, so twisted and nutty that he would boycott a debate at the last second because his opponent had a small electric fan beneath his podium to keep him cool. Granted, the fan was a violation of the rules, but who cares? A human being would have sent minions out after the debate to note that his opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, broke the rules. A politician with even a dash of personality might even have used it to mock Crist: ""I suspect Charlie was worried his face would melt"" -- a sly shot at Crist's perma-tan. I have seen and done a lot of crazy stuff in political debates. In 1992, my compadres and I stole the stools Bill Clinton rehearsed on from a Williamsburg, Virginia, hotel and put them on the stage of the Bush-Perot-Clinton town hall debate in Richmond, so Gov. Clinton would have the home-butt advantage. I made one client so angry before a debate that he rhetorically bludgeoned his opponent until the poor man wept onstage. I know a politician who whispered the name of his opponent's mistress to him in the opening handshake of a debate. I even saw the governor of Texas forget how to count to three in a nationally televised debate. But I ain't never seen nothin' like Rick Scott's fan dance. Scott refused to come on the stage for seven excruciating minutes. The moderators were flummoxed. Crist could not conceal his glee. He had the same expression on his face that I had when I was an 18-year old pizza delivery boy called to bring lunch to the lovely dancers at The Doll House in Austin. ""I cannot believe my luck. This is not really happening."" Everything since that magical moment for me has been anticlimactic, and I'm sure everything from now on will be for Crist. No matter. Crist will become governor again, and Rick Scott will slink back under the rock from whence he emerged. But even there, in the gritty grime of the fetid Florida sand, he will be recognized and remembered as the guy who blew it because of a fan. When Dr. Thompson removed himself from this Earth he had his ashes shot out of a cannon. A spectacular explosion of fireworks scattered Hunter's earthly remains over Colorado. Rick Scott's political demise was considerably less spectacular; the remains of his career as a politician were blown all across Florida by a one-foot-wide electric fan.","Paul Begala: Hunter Thompson said: When going gets weird, the weird turn pro.

"(CNN) -- It's been more than half a century since the U.S. military executed a service member. Army Pvt. John Bennett was hanged in 1961 at Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas, convicted of raping and attempting to kill an 11-year-old Austrian girl. The 26-year-old soldier's execution barely made the newspapers, according to a profile of Bennett published in 2000 in the Los Angeles Times. But by today's standards, it probably would have generated a huge amount of attention and controversy. Bennett was black, the Austrian girl was white, and Bennett's defense was ""brief and ineffective,"" the Times reported. The Times story went on to say that during the six years between Bennett's trial and his execution, eight other black soldiers were executed -- but the six white prisoners on death row lived. The white prisoners ""had killed little girls or killed more than once. ...President Dwight Eisenhower commuted sentences of four. Two were spared by the court,"" the paper said. And there was evidence in Bennett's case that he suffered from mental health problems that, in today's justice system, might have spared him. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . The soldier's lawyer never brought up Bennett's mental history, and Bennett didn't testify, the newspaper said. ""The biggest concern with the military death penalty was that it fell disproportionately on African-American soldiers,"" says Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. During World War II, blacks accounted for less than 10% of the Army. During the war, 70 soldiers were executed in Europe and, of those, 55 were black, wrote Dwight Sullivan, a military law expert, for the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, which analyzes and studies issues surrounding capital punishment. After President Harry Truman ordered an end to segregation in the armed forces in 1948, the racial disparity in executions increased, Sullivan said. Between 1954 and 1961, 11 of 12 service members executed were black. A 2012 study that analyzed racial disparity in military death penalty cases between 1984 and 2005 found minorities were twice as likely as whites to be given the death penalty, a finding considerably higher than in civilian courts, said Catherine Grosso of Michigan State University's College of Law, a co-author of the study. As commander-in-chief, the U.S. president is the only person who can sign a death warrant for a service member. Eisenhower signed off on Bennett's execution, but by the time Bennett's final day came, President John F. Kennedy was in office. ""The data were sufficiently troubling that when Pvt. Bennett's case came before President Kennedy, an analysis was done of all military cases, and his staff was concerned about adverse public reaction,"" Fidell said. ""In the end, JFK declined to interfere with the execution."" Apart from the Times story, few news outlets appear to have written about Bennett, an indigent son of a Virginia sharecropper. According to the paper, the ammunition handler and truck driver's court-martial happened in Austria. The trial lasted five days. The girl, who the Times says was named Gertie, came into contact with her attacker while she was walking across a meadow in the town of Seizenham. Residents said that a man who looked like Bennett had stumbled into their homes, asking for a prostitute. Bennett, the paper said, claimed he and the girl had consensual sex. Later, the wife of an Army sergeant, said that the girl showed up at her home and repeatedly used the word N-word, the Times reported. Bennett was charged with rape, and prosecutors added a charge of attempted murder for leaving the girl in a meadow, the newspaper said. Gertie testified for the prosecution and pointed Bennett out at the trial, according to the Times. Bennett was in the disciplinary barracks' boiler room at Leavenworth and ""waited calmly"" as Col. Weldon W. Cox read his sentence, according to a 1994 Military Law Review article. Cox asked the condemned soldier whether he wanted to make a final statement. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""I wish to take this last opportunity to thank you and each member of the staff for all you have done in my behalf."" Hagel orders review of military judicial authority .

"(CNN) -- The Scots are talking a lot this week -- perhaps you've heard a little something about an independence referendum -- and that makes us happy. That's because we like how the Scots talk. Not necessarily what they say -- just the way they say it. Imagine the way your Scottish pals might pronounce ""pour"" and ""poor."" The Scottish accent is like no other. Then again, neither is any other accent. It's estimated that there are nearly 7,000 languages on earth. That's nearly 7,000 different ways to traipse clumsily through the English language -- or to sex it up like an old Justin Timberlake song. Of course, no accent is sexy when it's strong enough to crush a beer can. Which means not all accents are created equal. You choose: Hottest accents . All of this got us talking this week about which accents we like most. So we decided to hold a vote of our own -- a Facebook poll to ask which accents you prefer. (Trinidadian has charged to the front at the time of writing. You can cast a vote via this link:: on.fb.me/1wHkW0y.) Below is the list of sexiest brogues we came up with by deploying an admittedly unscientific methodology -- meaning we asked around the office, which does at least account for more nationalities than colors in the M&M universe. Our also-rans included Australian (as appealing as warm Foster's to some, tantalizingly exotic to others) and Japanese (the language of repressed salarymen is also strangely designed for pillow talk). Feel free to state your objections and/or rain your accolades in the comments section below and vote in our Facebook poll. Because when it comes to accents, there are no absolutes. Except that the one that makes you cringe is absolutely horrible. You know which one we're talking about. 13. Argentine . Famous tongues: Fernando Lamas, Gabriela Sabatini . A historical refuge for Spaniards, Italians and Germans, the hyper-libidinous South Ameripean melting pot of Argentina has cultivated a proud, pouty tone. With its own pronunciation of Spanish letters (""ll"" sounds like ""shh"") and its own words (""you"" is ""vos""), this is a dialect that's hard to get. (Or at least plays that way.) Sounds like: A tightly tuned guitar of G-strings strummed by a lamb shank . 12. Thai . Famous tongues: Tony Jaa, Araya 'Chompoo' Hargate . With five tones comprising their native speech, the traffickers of this often fragile accent turn any language into a song of seduction. Thai is largely monosyllabic, so multi-beat foreign words get extra emphases right up until the last letter, which is often left off, leaving the listener wanting more. Sounds like: R-rated karaoke . 11. Trinidadian . Famous tongues: Nicki Minaj, Billy Ocean . For fetishists of oddball sexuality, the Caribbean island of Trinidad offers an undulating, melodic gumbo of pan-African, French, Spanish, Creole and Hindi dialects that, when adapted for English, can be sex on a pogo stick. Sounds like: A rubber life raft bobbing on a sea of steel drums . 10. Brazilian Portuguese . Famous tongues: Alice Braga, Anderson Silva . Perhaps owing to its freedom from French influence, the Brazilian Portuguese accent has a more colorful, puerile flair than its coarser European counterpart. The resulting yowl of drawn-out vowels reveals a flirty freedom of spirit that suggests a permanent vacation. Sounds like: The near, then far, then near again hum of a low-wattage vacuum cleaner that runs on dance sweat . 9. U.S. Southern . Famous tongues: Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Lawrence . There's nothing sexy about being in a hurry, and you could clock the growth rate of grass with the honeyed drawl of a Southern beau or belle. Sounds like: Molasses taking a smoking break . 8. Scottish  Famous tongues: Ewan McGregor, Rose Leslie . Some of the vocal strangulations heard echoing around Glasgow are registered as a danger to shipping, but in less industrial corners of Scotland melodic voices capable of ranging a full octave in a single ""aye"" tumble like soft rain on warm bagpipes. These are gentle, knee-melting tones that conjure cozy firesides and beguiling knitwear before their sudden swing to reproach leaves us whimpering for more. Sounds like: A stroked tartan cat . 7. Irish . Famous tongues: Colin Farrell, Andrea Corr . Valued slightly more in men than in women, the Irish brogue is a lilting, lyrical articulation that's charming, if not exotic. Fluid and uplifting, it can swing from vulnerable to threatening over the course of a sentence, restoring your faith in the world again ... right before it stabs you with a broken bottle top. Sounds like: A marauding pixie . 6. Nigerian . Famous tongues: King Sunny Ade, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde . Dignified, with just a hint of willful naivete, the deep, rich ""oh's"" and ""eh's"" of Naija bend the English language without breaking it, arousing tremors in places other languages can't reach. Sounds like: The THX intro with teeth . 5. Queen's English . Famous tongues: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley . Authoritative. Upright. Erudite. Scholarly. Few accents promise the upward nobility of the Queen's English. It's a take on the language that sets hearts devoted to James Bond and Hermione Granger aflutter. And, should the speaker fail to slake your most wanton desires, eh, at least you'll learn something. Sounds like: A crisply ironed shirt playing a harp . 4. Czech . Famous tongues: Petra Nemcova, Jaromir Jagr . Like Russian, without the nettlesome history of brutal, iron-fisted despotism, Czech is a smoky, full-bodied vocal style that goes well with most meats. Murky and mysterious, the Bohemian tone is equal parts carnal desire and carnival roustabout. Sounds like: Count Dracula, secret agent . 3. Spanish . Famous tongues: Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz . Sensual and beckoning, but with the passion to unleash hell kept just barely restrained, Castilian is like a dialectic Hoover Dam. But then there's the lisp. Tender, vulnerable and cute as a baby's hangnail -- no one owns the ""th"" sound formed by tongue and teeth like those who speak the language of Cervantes. Sounds Like: An outboard motor on Lake Paella . 2. French . Famous tongues: Marion Cotillard, Jean Reno . The come-hither condescension and fiery disinterest of the French tongue remains paradoxically erotic. Sounds like: A 30-year-old teenager . 1. Italian . Famous tongues: Monica Bellucci, Alessandro Del Piero . Raw, unfiltered, the Italian accent is a vowelgasm that reflects the spectrum of Italic experience: the fire of its bellicose beginnings ... the romance of the Renaissance ... the dysfunction of anything resembling a government since Caesar. Insatiable, predatory and possessive, this is sex as a second language. Sounds like: A Ferrari saxophone . Which is your favorite accent? Leave a comment and vote in our Facebook poll.

"(Southern Living) -- Southern Living's intrepid restaurant scout Jennifer V. Cole hit the road to determine the top 100 places to eat in the South now. The list leads with the South's 10 best new restaurants and continues with Jennifer's favorite restaurants for 2014, both new and old, in her most frequented towns. This list is always evolving, so follow @jennifervcole on Twitter for her latest stops. Eatocracy asked Cole how she arrived at the larger and more pared down lists. ""The whole list is a mix of both established restaurants and newcomers in alphabetical order. For each restaurant in the top 100, I asked myself first and foremost 'Is the food delicious?' I then considered the restaurant's relevance in the modern food landscape. I took into account a chef's technical skill and his or her creativity with ingredients. Geography obviously played a role; I included restaurants within the Southern Living coverage area (17 states plus DC). And I factored in the overall experience,"" Cole explained. Southern Living: Secret Recipes from the South's Best Dives . For the 10 best new restaurants, Cole says the restaurant had to have opened between July 2013 and June 2014 to be considered. She visited each anonymously and Southern Living paid for all of her meals. ""I traveled nearly 24,000 miles while researching this list,"" said Cole. ""Of course, I applied the same stringent criteria as with the overall list. In addition, I considered what each new restaurant contributes to the patchwork quilt of Southern food. How does it draw on and respect tradition? How does it reflect today's influences? How does it apply the flavors of the modern South?"" Southern Living: 88 Top-Rated Dessert Recipes . And Cole found some trends emerging throughout her travels, notably a relaxing from the white tablecloth, tasting menu, suit-wearing waiters that had been a hallmark of some Southern dining until recently. So what did she find? ""More open kitchens, exposed wood, and waitstaff in jeans and button-downs. That's not to say service is diminished or we're relegated to burgers. I just think we're in a period that's less about fine dining and one that's more about casual grace or fine casual."" And now that you know how the list-making sausage got made, let's get to the main course. Southern Living: What's Your Southern City? 10. The Shack -- Staunton, Virginia . What To Order: Crispy Lamb Shank with English peas, a soft-cooked egg, and hot sauce vinaigrette. At Ian Boden's shotgun-style restaurant in tiny Staunton, Virginia, he serves up designer dishes from, quite frankly, the sticks. With the lamb shank, Ian layers fresh (sweet green peas), rich (a crisp puck of meaty goodness), and creamy (a perfectly cooked runny egg) to produce a model of simple decadence. Most days, the hand-written menu reads like a bipolar expression of flavors: cold ramen with razor clams and a pickled egg listed above chili cheese fries. Burgers alongside Sardinian Gnocchi with pulled rabbit, morels, ramps, and mustard. But on Friday and Saturday nights, Ian switches to a three-course prix fixe menu that highlights not only the seasonal bounty of rural Virginia but also his impressive talents behind the stove. 105 South Coalter Street; facebook.com/theshacksva . 9. Cinco Y Diez -- Athens, Georgia . What To Order: Grilled Chesapeake Oysters with mezcal lime butter, and the Red Chile Pozole. Influences from France to western Africa have long informed how Southerners eat. Today, it's Vietnam and Latin America that are most shaping the modern South. At Cinco y Diez, chef/owner Hugh Acheson, an outspoken proponent of the all-inclusive table, highlights the vibrant Latin traditions through a soft-focus Southern lens. And executive chef Whitney Otawka transforms the Southern pantry into a fiery amalgamation of cross-cultural flavors. Oysters from Chesapeake waters sizzle with tangy mezcal lime butter. In the pozole, chunks of silken pork bathe in a red chile broth with Anson Mills hominy, escarole, and fresh radish slices. 1653 South Lumpkin Street; cincoydiezathens.com . Southern Living: The South's Best Barbeque . 8. San Salvaje -- Dallas, Texas . What To Order: Fried Whole Snapper with pickled green beans and mango-habanero mojo. At chef Stephan Pyles' modern take on haute Latin, expect creative riffs on traditional dishes. You'll find ceviches, tacos, empanadas, and the like, but with modern interpretations. With the Fried Whole Snapper, the fish is split and stuffed with a spiky fistful of tempura-battered pickled green beans and placed atop a chunky mango-habanero mojo. The Ahi Tuna Ceviche, served in a halved coconut shell, arrives scented with kaffir and studded with sweet coconut. The Chocolate Tamal, a mole-rich expression of a tamale, is stuffed with wild boar and topped with cherry salsita. San Salvaje showcases chef Pyles' current obsession with Central and South American flavors, with perfect measures of ingenuity and restraint. #100, 2100 Ross Avenue; sansalvaje.com . 7. Edmund's Oast -- Charleston, SC . What To Order: Carolina Gold Rice Heritage Chicken Porridge. I like to think of Edmund's Oast as a stylish gastropub with righteous charcuterie. But that almost undersells it. The craft beer program is unparalleled in South Carolina, with some 40-odd beers on tap, including a handful made in-house, and over 30 bottled options. The cocktail program is relentlessly ambitious. And dishes like the buttermilk fried wings, the pickled shrimp on rye bread, and the roasted-and-smoked chicken with cornbread pudding demonstrate the kitchen's finesse with classic grub. But it's the outliers—creamy spiced turnip custard, lemony chicken porridge with poached shrimp, braised lamb meatballs with apricots—that make me want to return. 1081 Morrison Drive; edmundsoast.com . 6. CBD Provisions -- Dallas, TX . What To Order: Berkshire Pig Head Carnitas. At this meat-centric, Texas-style brasserie, you can't go wrong with the roasted pig head. It arrives at the table—snout, ears, and all—crisp and fatty atop a wooden plank. For anyone who loves a proper pig pickin', this is your tableside porcine dream. Wrap the rich and smoky meat in fresh tortillas, pile on crunchy bits of skin, and top with radishes and roasted tomatillo salsa. Plan to come with friends—this dish is meant to be shared. 1530 Main Street; cbdprovisions.com . Southern Living: 75 Most Stylish Southerners . 5. Rhubarb -- Asheville, NC . What To Order: Brick Oven Prince Edward Island Mussels in a Celery-Fennel Broth with Benton's Bacon and Grilled Chapata Bread. John Fleer, the chef who shone a light on Appalachian foodways at Blackberry Farm, emerged last fall with Rhubarb in Asheville. Touchstones of his legacy (Benton's bacon, Sunburst trout) are there. But Rhubarb is no history lesson. He digs deep into the region's traditions, adds global influence, and highlights the local larder. Benton's bacon shows up in a bowl of mussels in a silken celery-fennel broth. The roasted whole trout bathes in wood smoke before joining a crisp potato-celeriac latke. At Blackberry, John put Southern foodstuffs on the map. At Rhubarb, he's showing just how far he can stretch them. 7 SW. Pack Square; rhubarbasheville.com . 4. The Obstinate Daughter -- Sullivan's Island, SC . What To Order: Favas and Peas or Mepkin Abbey Mushrooms . Though the wood-fired pizzas and pastas conjure Italy, Jacques Larson relies mightily on the flavors of the Lowcountry. Under the Plates section, Jacques' command of flavor as sense of place shines. Oyster mushrooms from the nearby Mepkin Abbey join earthy kale and a runny Sea Island egg under shards of Parmesan. Favas and peas sit atop ricotta made with milk from John's Island, accented with sea salt from nearby Bulls Bay. 2063 Middle Street; theobstinatedaughter.com . 3. The 404 Kitchen -- Nashville, TN . What to Order: The Crudo . Chef Matt Bolus calls his brand of cooking fresh and uncomplicated, but there's some cloaked modesty there. Everything about this industrial-chic 40-seater blends functionality, novelty, and a little ""I'm with the band, but I'm not the rock star"" attitude. In the Crudo, simple slices of cobia are dotted with pickled strawberries, pea tendrils, and Marcona almonds. For his Tomato Galette, Matt envelops lemony ricotta in a toasted cornmeal crust, and piles on heirloom tomatoes—a twist on tomato pie without any pretension. Much like Nashville these days, it's all familiar—but new. 404 12th Avenue South; the404nashville.com/kitchen . 2. Rose's Luxury -- Washington, D.C. What To Order: Uni Scrambled Eggs. For chef/owner Aaron Silverman, luxury isn't about fine china and Champagne poured in unison. ""It's how you feel, how people treat you,"" he says. And as a result there's a homey—never folksy—sophistication that resonates throughout the restaurant. The custardy bowl of scrambled eggs makes a decadent leap with briny, rich layers of uni (sea urchin): pureed, sliced, and whisked into hollandaise. As with anything, it all boils down to the execution. And so far, Rose's is doing luxury right. 717 Eighth Street SE.; rosesluxury.com . 1. Kimball House -- Decatur, GA . What To Order: Oysters and absinthe-based cocktails. I've yet to see another spot in the South with such a thoughtful—and joyful—oyster program. The menu lists, give or take, 22 oyster varieties, most sourced from small family farms and flown in daily, with the kinds of tasting notes more frequently reserved for wine lists. The Chelsea Gems from Eld Inlet, Washington, are likened to ""anise and buttered truffle""; the Northern Cross from Fisherman's Island, Virginia, ""salted parsnip and green onion."" And local bar hero Miles Macquarrie wields his magic wand with drinks like the Afternoon Delight, a heady yet refreshing mix of absinthe, lime, pineapple, tarragon, and bubbles. 303 East Howard Avenue; kimball-house.com .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers lost her life after having an apparently minor elective procedure at a Manhattan medical clinic last week. The routine surgery was on her throat, according to the New York Fire Department. She apparently suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during the procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy. She was transferred by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital and died on Thursday. The outpatient clinic is now being investigated by the New York State Department of Health, according to its spokesperson, James O'Hara. No criminal investigation is under way, according to several New York law enforcement officials. The state health department is investigating whether there was any malpractice by the doctors and their staff, the same officials said. What Rivers wants at her funeral . Rivers' autopsy was inconclusive, the medical examiner's office said. The routine nature of the surgery has left some asking how it could have killed her. Doctors say just because a surgery is called routine or elective doesn't necessarily mean it is simple. ""Elective typically just means it is something you can plan ahead of time, as opposed to emergency surgery where you need to get someone in right away,"" said Dr. John Sweeney, chairman of the department of surgery at Emory University in Atlanta. When Sweeney talks to his patients about surgery he explains that there are always risks involved. There could be complications due to bleeding or infection during the procedure. Or there could be specific risks related to the type of operation. 25 of Joan Rivers' best jokes . Endoscopy usually refers to an evaluation of the esophagus or GI tract, according to Dr. Joel Zivot. Zivot is an assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University School of Medicine. He said sometimes patients will have these procedures so doctors can evaluate their vocal cords. Endoscopy is normally done under general anesthetic. Operating on the vocal cords is trickier, because a tube that would normally help someone breathe during such a procedure couldn't go across the vocal cords. To tolerate that kind of evaluation, Zivot said, someone would need to be in a deep unconscious state. The center has not released the specifics about the kind of procedure Rivers had, so it is unclear if she would have had a simple anesthetic spray on the throat or something where the airway was compromised. ""People have endoscopy safely every day in this country,"" Zivot said. ""Generally speaking, it's well tolerated."" There can be risk with surgery if someone has any kind of underlying health problem. Rivers gave misfit girls permission to dream . In the initial surgery consult, Sweeney said he always asks patients: Do they smoke? Do they have diabetes? Do they have heart problems or lung disease? Essentially, do they have any kind of physical problem that would put them at an increased risk for complications? ""Some doctors will throw in age as a risk, but I would call that 'chronological age,' because I have some 51-year-old patients that are physically in much worse shape than someone who is much older,"" Sweeney said. ""She is not someone you look at and say 'that woman looks frail,'"" said Dr. Jonathan Flacker. Flacker, also at Emory, sees a number of older patients in the geriatrics department. Neither he nor Sweeney treated Rivers. Rivers was a pointed, pioneering comedian . ""She was vibrant and engaged and great at intelligent conversation, everything someone would want to be when they are older,"" Flacker said. But he added, older people, no matter how energetic they appear, do have an inherent age-related disadvantage when it comes to surgery. When people get older they have less of what doctors call repertoire and reserve. That means their older body and brain lose some ability to cope with stress. ""Older people tend to lose their repertoire and their ability to cope with stress through a variety of reasons and not all of them relate to a disease state. They come along with age for everyone,"" Flacker said. Surgery of any kind, he said, is a real stress on the body. That's what makes surgery riskier for older people.

"(CNN) -- An outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in West Africa has spread to Guinea's capital and beyond its borders in an ""unprecedented epidemic,"" a leading aid agency reported Monday. A total of 122 patients are suspected of contracting Ebola and 78 have died, Doctors Without Borders said. Most victims have been in Guinea, but the World Health Organization reported Sunday that two deaths in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia are suspected to have been caused by the Ebola virus. Cases have been identified in three provinces in Guinea near the borders and in Conakry, its coastal capital, said Mariano Lugli, the Doctors Without Borders coordinator there. ""We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,"" Lugli said in a statement issued by the organization. Previous outbreaks ""were much more geographically contained and involved more remote locations,"" he said. ""This geographical spread is worrisome, because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organizations working to control the epidemic,"" Lugli said. The organization, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain. It is rare but creates panic, because there is no cure and it's fatal in up to 90% of cases, according to MSF. The variant seen in the Guinea outbreak is the so-called Zaire strain, which Lugli called ""the most aggressive and deadly.""","Ebola toll rises to 78 in Guinea .

"Washington (CNN) -- American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn is calling for attacks on U.S. ambassadors around the world. In a 39-minute video, Gadahn praised the death of Libya's U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens on September 11 last year -- and urged wealthy Muslims to offer militants rewards so they can kill others, according to SITE, a jihadist monitoring group. Specifically, he referenced a bounty set for the death of U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, Gerald Feierstein. ""These prizes have a great effect in instilling fear in the hearts of our cowardly enemies,"" Gadahn who has a $1 million dollar bounty on his head, says in the video. ""They also encourage hesitant individuals to carry out important and great deeds in the path of Allah."" The California-raised Islamic convert, also known as Azzam the American, spoke entirely in Arabic throughout the video, ""The Exploits of Muslims and Infamies of the Criminals."" It was produced by al-Qaeda's as-Sahab Media Foundation and posted to jihadi websites. ""The dead American ambassador Christopher Stevens wasn't a friend of Libya"" Gadahn asserts, saying instead he was ""representative of the empire of evil and corruption, America"". Multiple American embassies across North Africa and the Middle East were closed earlier this month in light of intelligence information suggesting a possible attack. All have reopened. But an administration official, asked whether the closures were linked to the Gadahn video, told CNN that while al Qaeda's general intentions were a factor in the closures, ""this video was not specifically a factor."" Gadahn has made similar videos in the past. In 2007, he also called for attacks on U.S. diplomats, vowing that al Qaeda would target American diplomats and embassies in retaliation for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

"(CNN) -- British singer Cliff Richard has denied an underage sex allegation dating from the 1980s as ""completely false."" South Yorkshire police searched Richard's home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Thursday as part of an investigation into the alleged offense. ""A search warrant was granted after police received an allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1980s involving a boy who was under the age of 16 at the time,"" police said in a statement. Thames Valley police confirmed it had assisted South Yorkshire police in the execution of the search warrant. Richard, 73, issued a statement denying the allegation. ""For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online,"" he said. ""Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen."" The singer said that he was not presently in the United Kingdom and that police had given no notice of its search ""except it would appear to the press,"" but that he would cooperate fully with its inquiry. ""Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded,"" Richard said. Richard -- born Harry Rodger Webb -- has sold more than 250 million records in a career that began in the 1950s. His first No. 1 hit in the UK was in 1959 with ""Living Doll.""

"(CNN) -- The Batmobile has come a long way from flashing lights and tail fins. On Wednesday night, the world got an official look at the newest version of Batman's ride, and it's more of a tank than a car. Zack Snyder, director of the upcoming ""Batman v Superman,"" released an image of the militarized machine on Twitter. With double guns in the front, it's one of the more weaponized versions the movies have ever seen. Some fans think the double-barreled hood ornaments might be a bit much for a superhero who isn't supposed to use guns. But there are still plenty who think this version is very cool.

"Washington (CNN) -- John Allen, the retired four-star Marine general and former commander of American forces in Afghanistan, will take on the role of coordinating the international coalition to battle ISIS, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Friday. The move marks a return to the head of a difficult and challenging mission that bears no clear or obvious solutions for a successful outcome. Allen is a veteran of many of many of those. How foreign fighters are swelling ISIS ranks . Allen is certainly familiar with the rocky terrain he is about to enter having been one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the ""Sunni Awakening,"" a program that worked to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate then operating in Iraq. The militant organization now swallowing portions of both Syria and Iraq that President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy is the successor to what was once that al Qaeda group. Obama's strategy: Kill ISIS before they kill us . Allen graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1976, and has racked up a long and distinguished list of accomplishments both on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as an attempted role as peacemaker to one of the longest and most intractable conflicts in the Middle East. Obama tapped him in 2011 to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- the NATO-led coalition of military forces in that country -- after Obama nominated Gen. David Petraeus, then that coalition's commander, to become director of the CIA. Allen was the first Marine tapped to head up the military effort in Afghanistan. Kerry later appointed him to develop a security plan for Israel and the West Bank during negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over the possibility of a future Palestinian state that eventually collapsed. Before his command in Afghanistan, Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East. He is also a decorated veteran of the armed forces, having received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the Defense Superior Service Medal among others. While controversy mostly eluded his impressive rise to the top ranks of the U.S. military, Allen was briefly caught up in the 2012 scandal involving Petraeus' infidelity that ultimately led the widely admired retired general to resign his CIA post. An investigation into ""flirtatious"" email exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley, the Florida woman whose complaints about threatening emails from Petraeus' mistress, Paula Broadwell, brought the scandal into the public, led Allen to withdraw his nomination by Obama to become NATO's supreme allied commander in 2013. The Defense Department eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing, and Allen retired from the Marines. Allen is the married father of two daughters and holds master's degrees from Georgetown University, the Defense Intelligence College and the National War College. CNN's Alan Duke and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Retired Gen. John Allen was commander of American forces in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Which airline, hotel and rental car rewards programs are worth your while? With all the mergers and changes in the travel industry, it's nearly impossible for the occasional traveler to know. The 2014 FlyerTalk Awards highlight companies that still impress the road warriors of the sky. FlyerTalk's online veterans know the pros and cons of nearly every aspect of travel, including the coveted perks of loyalty programs. That information is especially valuable as many reward programs make it harder to reap their benefits. Delta Air Lines' plan to award dollars spent rather than miles flown is the latest move in that direction. While there are many industry awards for best travel loyalty programs, ""users of these travel services are better judges of the services than the industry,"" says Brent Conver, general manager of FlyerTalk. Thousands of registered FlyerTalk members nominated their favorite programs in December and voted for the winners, which are being announced Wednesday. Here are their picks for best overall airline, hotel and rental car programs and best specific program benefits around the world. Best overall rewards programs . American Airlines AAdvantage won for top airline affinity program in the Americas, with United Airlines coming in second place. Starwood's Preferred Guest program edged out Hilton HHonors in the hotel category. And Hertz Gold Plus Rewards took the rental car honors. Frequent travelers want to turn their airline and hotel points into more travel easily. ""People who are big fans of American say they have the best award availability, and they love that Starwood allows its points to be transferred to different airline programs,"" he says. They also love Starwood's flexibility (in) allowing travelers to use a combination of points and cash to book rooms. In the Europe/Africa category, British Airways Executive Club was voted top airline affinity program. Starwood Preferred Guest and Hertz Gold Plus Rewards both came in first place in this region, as well. Hertz -- which collected several FlyerTalk awards -- also spends a lot of time thinking about their elite travelers, and it shows up in their fan base at FlyerTalk, says Conver. In the Middle East/Asia/Oceania region, India's Jet Airways JetPrivilege was the surprise winner in the airline affinity program, upsetting the winner for the last two years, Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles. Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces' InnerCircle took top hotel honors. And no surprise in the rental car category: Hertz swept all three regions with its Gold Plus Rewards. Best travel reward program benefit (Americas) FlyerTalk's American Airlines AAdvantage members love their Executive Platinum member upgrades. Members get eight free one-way upgrades systemwide upon qualification or re-qualification of elite status. In the hotel benefit race, the love that Marriott Rewards members have for the Concierge Lounge dominates. Their club lounges in the United States offer free food and drink and a dedicated concierge. And once again, Hertz Gold Plus Rewards' Gold service wins in the rental car benefit category. While Gold service is a package of upgrades including faster reservations, a speedy vehicle pick up process and VIP treatment, it's packaged together and treated as a single benefit. Best travel reward program benefit (Europe/Africa) In the airline awards category, British Airways Executive Club members love their Avios upgrades. British Airways uses distance-based award charts, which allows travelers to trade in fewer miles (called Avios at the airline) for short trips, says Conver. ""British Airways spends a lot of time working with their elite travelers, and they have a fan base,"" he says. Travelers love their Hilton HHonors Executive lounge access, naming it the best hotel benefit in Europe and Africa. The lounges offer free food and drink, and none of the lounges are exactly alike. Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program wins again in this category for giving members points toward free rentals or exchange for other programs' miles or points. Best travel reward program benefit (Middle East/Asia/Oceania) Members of Jet Airways JetPrivilege say that program's top perk allows them to pay cash for domestic award ticket upgrades. Hotel guests voted Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces InnerCircle's room upgrades the top benefit. FlyerTalk members didn't nominate any car rental benefits in this part of the world. Maybe next year?","Airlines with flexible and available award tickets got top honors from FlyerTalk .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- These are tense times for the English Premier League. Going sponsorless: The 2008/2009 football season has seen numerous issues with shirt sponsors. The cause of the tension isn't the battle between the leading title contenders on the pitch; instead it's the waiting to see what impact the international financial crisis will have off the field. Outside of television rights packages, one of the major strands of income for football clubs is various sponsorship deals; and as big companies hit by the financial crisis have either folded or slashed spending budgets -- these agreements have come under serious threat. Tell us whether you think football's massive salaries will survive the financial crisis in the Sound Off box below. Barclays, the bank which has been the naming sponsor of the Premier League since 2001, is currently reviewing its sponsorship deals -- a process which includes considering its £66 million ($100m) three-year deal in England. And like many other banks, financial institutions and major businesses, Barclays has been hit hard by the recent economic climate, so a new deal is certainly not a done deal. But it's not just the English game that faces sponsorship uncertainty. Last month FIFA President Sepp Blatter acknowledged that broadcasting and sponsorship revenues are decreasing across the global game, following a year tarnished by the credit crunch. In December, the third Channel One Cup in Israel was cancelled after Roman Abramovich's National Academy Fund (NAF) pulled sponsorship for the event. In September, English Premier League side West Ham United lost their shirt-sponsor in a high-profile collapse which left the team wearing temporary covers on the front of their playing kits. Fellow Premiership side West Bromwich Albion does not have a shirt sponsor. Several further sponsorship deals have been affected for various reasons in recent months. The nationalization of Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis resulted in both Feyenoord and Anderlecht having the bank removed from their shirts; Manchester United needs a new shirt sponsor after its £14m ($21m) per year shirt sponsor -- the troubled U.S. financial institution AIG chose not to renew its contract; Philips pulled out as PSV Eindhoven's shirt sponsor; and David Beckham and Pepsi brought their decade-long £2m ($3m) per year deal to an end. Despite these mounting examples of sponsor uncertainty, sports business experts believe the game of football will survive the international financial crisis. Head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, Dan Jones, told CNN there were reasons to be optimistic that sponsorship levels would not decline significantly. ""I think sponsorship is one of the areas people will look at closely in the current environment ...but, that said, sport sponsorship is one of the areas that has grown very significantly. ""Yes it's a difficult time but sports have done well in increasing their sponsors and I think they have delivered on that,"" he said. Jones told CNN shirt sponsorships are not major sources of income for most football clubs, and some, like Spain's Barcelona, had chosen to use the shirt space to promote a charity (UNICEF) rather than seek sponsorship money. Jones said that big brands like Manchester United and Real Madrid would perform better than their lesser known counterparts in coming years, but he said it wasn't all bad for the smaller clubs. ""It's more a case of the richer getting richer and the poor getting richer, but not as fast."" In Europe, countries such as Germany were more heavily dependant on sponsorship money, so competitions like the Bundesliga could be the hardest hit by a drop in sponsor revenue, he said. Sports columnist at The Guardian, David Conn, said it was likely revenue from advertising and corporate hospitality would also increasingly feel the impact of the financial crisis. Conn said corporate hospitality, which generated a large portion of match-day takings, could be one of the worst hit areas. ""It doesn't affect them (football clubs) in a catastrophic way, but all of it put together can have quite an impact."" Conn believed teams at the bottom reaches of England's Premier League and below would be the worst hit clubs, and agreed with Jones that the larger clubs would survive the crisis. Despite the worries, Jones said there was no need for global alarm. He said the football market is not immune to recession but it is ""reasonably resistant"". ""There are a lot worse places to be trying to run in the current economic climate than a large sports business,"" he said.","International financial crisis means big sponsors are reviewing their activities .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than 20 years since he fought in a sandpit, but Lone Chaw still recalls the dusty village lots of his youth, unmarked except for footprints stained by sweat and blood. Stamping about in a ritual known as ""lat kha maung,"" he slaps his open palms against his elbows, imitating the wings of a fighting cock, as if attempting to summon its spirit. Lat kha maung is performed before the matches as a kind of ritual that originated in farming villages. This is the way of Lethwei -- Myanmar's traditional form of boxing. Hidden from the rest of the world for decades, the sport, like Myanmar itself, is experiencing a revival and rediscovery both at home and abroad. In August, the Woodlands Sports Hall in Singapore hosted an international bare-knuckled Lethwei challenger fight. Similar events in Bangkok have helped usher in a new era for Lethwei. Fighters turned trainers . Once derided as a sport fit for only rugged brutes -- Lone Chaw required eight stitches in his face after a fight at age 17 -- Lethwei is finding new respect at the Thut Ti Myanmar Lethwei Club in Yangon. Here, Lone Chaw teaches introductory lessons to a stratum of society distinctly different from the fierce yet humble fighters he grew up facing in the Ayeyarwady Delta region. His students are local doctors, foreign investment bankers and even Myanmar celebrities, including advertisement pinup Wutt Hmone Shwe Yi. ""Two years ago, foreigners began coming here,"" says Win Zin Oo, founder and director of the gym. ""Today the Lethwei classes are, on average, half foreign and half local."" Weekend classes can attract up to 10 students, he says. The boxing club is especially proud of having trained a headline-making Lethwei fighter from the UK, ""Mr. Hammer"" Sean Bardoe. During a fight in 2013, Bardoe, 44, displayed a ""mental and physical toughness,"" according to Mr. Win, that won over the crowd and landed him a draw in the ring. But those interested in taking up the sport don't have to have professional aspirations. ""The workout for extreme pro fighters may not be appropriate for starters so we use a more simplified form for our students,"" says Mr. Win, who by day is the Humanitarian and Emergency Affairs Director for World Vision, an American NGO. Mr. Win (as he prefers to be called) is Mickey to Lone Chaw's Rocky. He coached the Golden Belt freeweight champion until the fighter's retirement. One of Mr. Win's fondest memories of coaching was Lone Chaw's first fight in Japan, 10 years ago. Competing under Lethwei rules, a local jujitsu star went up against the then-29-year-old Lone Chaw. Lone Chaw took him down in less than a minute, leaving the Nagasaki crowd astonished. ""They watched a country boy KO his opponent in the first round, unexpectedly,"" Mr. Win recalls with pride. Fewer kicks, higher intensity . At Thut Ti Gym, Lone Chaw and Mr. Win now work as tag-team instructors, offering training sessions for 5,000 kyat ($5) per person. The setting is typical of the improvised simplicity familiar across Myanmar. An iron-wrought roof and plastic tarps are all that shield the gym from the elements. Novices practice agility by bouncing on tires. The modest ring vibrates with energy every Saturday, when practitioners spar. Though it bears some resemblance to the Muay Thai practiced in neighboring Thailand, Lethwei is different in a number of ways. ""In Muay Thai, kicks and knee strikes prevail, but Lethwei fighters use more punches and fewer kicks,"" explains Mr. Win. ""Traditionally, Lethwei fighters don't fight with gloves, and we use a lot of other components such as throwing, choking and head butts. At a more elemental level, the momentum and fighting intensity are much faster."" Bare-knuckled fighting . Watching matches, that momentum becomes evident. Strikes are uncompromisingly fierce. Knockouts come quickly. ""There are no five or six rounds in Lethwei,"" says James Ko, a 30-year-old private equity professional from Hong Kong, now living in Yangon. ""Fundamentally, it's a bare-knuckled sport. ""If you get close and elbow [your opponent] once, then you got him. It's really about that one blow."" In its traditional form, Lethwei is ""fought with bare knuckles bound by cloth,"" says Mr. Win. Boxing gloves are a recent development. As part of its current revival and reform period, contemporary mixed martial arts matches incorporating Lethwei fighters tend to enforce the use of gloves. ""Myanmar Lethwei fighters never put on gloves until now,"" says Mr. Win. Still, the old sandpit spirit perseveres. Having previously trained under Muay Thai rules, James Ko has over the past year become one of the most dedicated foreign attendees at Thut Ti Gym. Above all, he says he's learned that in Lethwei, self-defense is crucial. ""Before taking up Lethwei, I didn't realize I was so unprotected,"" says Ko. ""If you wear a 14-ounce [boxing] glove, your chin is protected, but when you are in a Lethwei fight it's much easier [for your opponent] to make contact, so you must be more on guard."" It's a lesson an increasingly diverse array of students is learning in Yangon and across Asia. Thut Ti Myanmar Lethwei Club, Kabaraye Pagoda Road, Yangon; +95 9 731 87441; about $5 per session (5,000 kyat) In Asia since 2006, Justin Calderon's work has been featured in The New York Times, Newsweek (Japan), CNN Travel, Global Post, Borneo Post and The Nation (Bangkok).","Ignored for decades, Myanmar's traditional boxing form of Lethwei is experiencing a revival .

"(CNN) -- Heavily armed militants staged an attack on a U.N. peacekeepers' base that was sheltering civilians in South Sudan on Thursday, killing at least 48 people and seriously injuring dozens more, a U.N. spokesman in the country said Friday. The attack on the U.N. base in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, began when militants used rocket-propelled grenades to breach the compound, U.N. spokesman Joseph Contreras said. Contreras said the gunmen then opened fire at the base, where peacekeepers had been hosting and protecting nearly 5,000 civilians. Details about how the attack ended were not immediately available, but the death toll is expected to rise, Contreras said. A search of the site continued Friday, he said. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the violence. Ban called the attack a ""serious escalation."" Any attack on U.N. peacekeepers is ""unacceptable and constitutes a war crime,"" the Ban said in a statement released on Thursday. He also called on the government to take immediate steps to protect all U.N. bases in the country. South Sudan erupted in violence in mid-December when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup to oust President Salva Kiir. Since then, militia loyal to Machar have battled government forces. Violence has quickly spread, with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. But numerous armed groups have remained active in the oil-rich country.","Militants use rocket-propelled grenades to attack U.N. base in Bor .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- It was August, 2011, the night rebels seized control of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's compound and Tripoli fell. I'd already done a couple of business shows earlier that day and was about to go home when the news broke. I ended up staying on the air through 4am. I didn't know it then, but I was having my own attack as well. First, the harsh studio lights. I could barely focus my eyes on the camera in front of me. Fortunately, we do not use teleprompters in breaking news situations. It's almost all ad-libbed. There was no way I could have read any words on a screen. Organizing sentences in my brain became increasingly difficult -- and it wasn't just the usual fatigue from a sustained marathon of breaking news at CNN International. By the end of it, my face felt numb, and I thought this must be what it's like when someone's having a stroke. Out of the studio, the racket of my earpiece out of my head, the lights dimmed, I immediately felt better, made it home and flopped into bed. When I awoke the next afternoon, it was all ""Alice in Wonderland."" The room, the hallway, the doorframes, everything was on a tilt. I was so dizzy, I had to hold on with both hands to walk down the hall. This was my first major flare-up of a compromised vestibular system, the complex network of the inner ear, the brain and the eyes we never think about, but is largely responsible for keeping humans upright. One doctor thought it was Ménière's disease since I had previously suffered hearing loss in my left ear. I was terrified. Am I going deaf? No one could answer. It took a couple of months, but I finally found the right doctor who specialized in vestibular disorders and who nailed it right away. I also learned I was in good company. According to the Vestibular Disorders Association (VEDA), an estimated 35 percent of Americans aged 40 or older experience vertigo or persistent dizziness sometime in their lives. That's about 70 million Americans. NBA stars Pau Gasol and LeBron James, and the NHL's Sidney Crosby and Chris Pronger are just a few famous professional athletes and public figures who suffered vestibular problems related to concussion or injury. Some have been career-ending. Many cases remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Having a chronic vestibular problem is a bit like having a hurricane inside your head. While the disorder is often associated with brain injuries, anyone can get hit. In my case, it was a combination of the hearing loss and the work environment: bright lights, loud noise, intense stress and fatigue which are all typical in the life of a news anchor on a 24-hour, international network. Florida-based chiropractic neurologist Dr. Ted Carrick, who sees patients from all over the world, including dozens of celebrity athletes, says: ""People lose their autonomy with vestibular issues. ""There is nothing better... than when I see a person who can't walk without their hands on a wall get their life back."" Carrick points to the prevalence of falls which he says are the greatest cause of accidental death after the age of 21. ""We have tens of millions of patients at risk of falling and don't even know it. ""You can feel good because the brain compensates, but the compensation isn't permanent and it isn't full. ""People are aware of heart attacks and cancer, but they're walking around in a bigger time bomb."" Cynthia Ryan, Executive Director of VEDA, adds: ""Many of our members tell us that they feel they have an invisible chronic illness. ""Their symptoms and condition are not always acknowledged, leaving them to deal with the devastating consequences on their own."" That's where public awareness comes in. VEDA promotes ""Balance Awareness Week"" to encourage undiagnosed patients to seek help from a vestibular specialist. Reducing the time it takes to be diagnosed could save lives. In my case, a quick diagnosis and the right therapy put my life back on track. Although protecting my hearing, and managing fatigue and stress mean TV anchoring is out, I'm passionate about advocating and mentoring the next generation of journalists at Georgia State University. It's a slower, calmer life, but it's also a balanced life, literally. ""Balance Awareness Week"" in the U.S. is September 15-21. VEDA has partners in the UK and Australia as well.","Colleen McEdwards finished a shift anchoring breaking news so dizzy she had to hold on to the wall to walk .

"(CNN) -- HBO has just launched a new TV series based on a novel by Tom Perrotta called ""The Leftovers,"" which in turn is based on the fundamentalist Christian idea of the rapture. Apart from the title, which suggests a refrigerator full of stale food, the series looks promising. It's a terrific premise: Jesus returns and calls to heaven 140 million people, leaving behind billions of stupefied, confused, and grief-stricken others. In the show, a mother loses her baby, who disappears. A boy's father seems to have vanished as he pushes a shopping cart. Cars collide as drivers go missing. Chaos strikes in the fictional Mapleton, New York -- and throughout the world. How to cope? The famous ""Left Behind"" series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins was already out there. It consisted of 16 best-selling novels on the same premise, and it's about to come to the big screen again, in a film starring Nicholas Cage. The original film adaptation (of three) appeared in 2000. And then there is the Christian real-time strategy video game called ""Left Behind: Eternal Forces."" If anyone hasn't noticed, the rapture has become a commercial juggernaut, endlessly shape-shifting, finding new and highly entertaining outlets. But what about the theology behind this industry? The rapture notion goes like this: Jesus is coming back, and when he does, he will first return before a time of so-called tribulation begins, calling up into the clouds with him those who are ""saved."" Horrible suffering will then occur on the miserable Earth for seven years. Then Jesus will come yet again, for a final judging. There are many different versions of this scenario, so it's difficult to summarize. It's fair to say, however, that only fundamentalist Protestant churches bother to think about the rapture at all. (Catholics discount the idea completely.) The rapture concept is relatively new. It started with an Anglo-Irish theologian, who in the 1830s invented the concept. This may come as a shocker to many, but it's a fact: Before John Nelson Darby imagined this scenario in the clouds, no Christian had ever heard of the rapture. The idea was popularized by Cyrus I. Scofield, an American minister who published a famous reference Bible in 1908, one that developed the idea of an elaborate series of final periods in history known as dispensations. Scofield, like Darby, read the Book of Revelation as a vision of the future, not a fiery dream of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. The latter view remains, in fact, the most common interpretation of the Book of Revelation by mainstream theologians and was described recently by Princeton scholar Elaine Pagels in ""Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation."" It's a problem, however, for rapture-minded Christians that the word ""rapture"" doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible, unless you're willing to think in broadly metaphorical terms. Rapture thinking is most often traced back to the Apostle Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians, where he writes: ""For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of an archangel and the trumpet of God. The dead in Christ will rise first; then we, who are left alive, will be snatched up with them on clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord."" (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17) First, it's important to note that Jesus himself never talked about the rapture, ever. We read in Mark about the ""Son of Man coming in the clouds,"" but this is a reference back to the Old Testament Book of Daniel, where we get the image of a ""son of Man"" who is actually going the other way, up to meet the Ancient of Days. It's all broadly metaphorical, a kind of dream. In Mark, the oldest gospel, this passage is about the vindication of Jesus as he comes to heaven and is recognized as a true son of the father. In Luke 19, we read about a returning king, but close study of this passage suggests that Luke is talking about God coming back to Jerusalem, not about Jesus returning to Earth. It's clear from looking carefully at everything Paul says about the future, as in I Corinthians 15:51-54 or Philippians 3:20-21, that he believes only that some day Christians will experience a kind of physical and spiritual change. They will be resurrected, but this is a complex term that suggests not necessarily resuscitation but evolution, a thorough transformation. In Thessalonians, Paul is writing like the poet he is, creating a spectacular vision of a returning lord who will be given a great reception in the air. The crucial word in the relevant verse is ""meet"": Those who are left alive will be caught up on clouds to meet the Lord in the air. The word ""meet"" in Greek is ""apentesis,"" and it means to gather for a reception for visiting dignitaries. Even the idea of being ""snatched up"" is thoroughly inadequate for the Greek word ""harpazo,"" which is better translated as ""gathered"" -- a point made by many biblical scholars over the years. In any case, Paul is being dramatic, imagining a holy reception committee that will greet the returning Christ. And why not? Yet it's amazing how scriptures get misused, and relatively new theological ideas -- such as the rapture -- get deeply embedded in certain circles. The rapture is really a plot device for popular entertainment and a bizarre theological teaching in fundamentalist circles, where it functions in a variety of ways. But it's bad theology, and Jesus himself would have been astonished to learn that thousands of years after him there were such notions afloat. At least he won't have to watch ""The Leftovers"" on TV.","Jay Parini: New HBO series takes off on novel based on Christian idea of 'the rapture'

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams gave a lot of advice. Whether in character or as himself, he was universally perceived as someone who knew things the rest of us had somehow missed. He often suggested reaching out for help, and from what we know, he took his own advice more than once. Whether on reaching out or fighting indifference, his words carry as much power now as they ever did. In 2013, Williams participated in a question and answer session on the social media site Reddit. He spoke on a variety of topics, from the kind of animal he would be (a dolphin) to his recipe for success. Q: Robin, your movie ""Good Morning Vietnam' inspired me to become a broadcaster. Any advice you would give to my fellow radio hosts and myself? A: Enjoy the time! If your intent is to pursue this once you get out of the service, see if you keep going once you get out. And know that you mean something. Q: What do you believe is the key to life? A: Once again: family and friends. And a good pet. For pure loyalty there is nothing like a pug. Q: What is, in your opinion, the recipe to success? A: Truly loving what you do. Because there will be good days and bad days. Q: College tips for a freshman? A: Eat ramen, and also, don't wait until the day before the final to cram for the test (which is what I did for my economics final). Q: Any advice out there for people like me who may be going through bad times themselves, for whatever reasons? A: Reach out to friends. They're out there. And know that you are loved. Spoiler alert: Video clips below may reveal key plot points. 'Good Will Hunting' As a therapist in ""Good Will Hunting,"" Williams plays a psychologist helping a brilliant but troubled young man find his identity. In this scene, Williams and his client, played by Matt Damon, speak about the myth of perfection in a scene that had even the cameraman laughing. ""People call these things imperfections. But they're not. That's the good stuff. And then we get to choose who we let in to our weird little worlds. You're not perfect, sport. And let me save you the suspense. This girl you met, she's isn't perfect either. But the question is whether you're perfect for each other. That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about.""

"(CNN) -- Sean Sasser, whose relationship with the late Pedro Zamora on MTV's ""The Real World: San Francisco"" broke cultural barriers on U.S. television, has died, his longtime partner told CNN on Thursday. Sasser was 44. Sasser, who had been HIV positive for 25 years, died Wednesday from mesothelioma, a rare form of lung cancer that was diagnosed just last month, Michael Kaplan said. He died in the Washington home he shared with Kaplan. Sasser was not one of the original cast members but became a household name as his relationship with Zamora was explored during the show's third season in 1994. The couple's exchange of vows during a commitment ceremony, the first ever broadcast on U.S. television, became a landmark moment in TV history. The couple began dating during the taping of the series. Their relationship and Zamora's battle with AIDS while living in ""The Real World"" house with seven strangers became must-see-TV for teens and young adults, many of whom had never been exposed to a gay couple, much less someone living with HIV. Zamora, who had been diagnosed with AIDS at age 17, was a well-known AIDS activist at the time he was cast on the show at age 21. Sasser, who was also working as an activist and educator, also revealed on the show that he was HIV positive. During the taping of the series, Zamora's health took a turn. ""This wasn't a romantic death. It wasn't a heroic death. It was horrible, and Sean couldn't do anything except watch it happen,"" fellow co-star Judd Winick told the online magazine POZ in 1997. Winick chronicled his friendship with Zamora and Sasser in the graphic novel ""Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss and What I Learned."" Zamora died on Nov. 11, 1994, with Sasser at his side just hours after the airing of the final episode of the season, which featured the two men exchanging their vows, according to MTV. Sasser continued his work as an AIDS activist and educator. Sasser recently moved from Portland, Oregon, to Washington when Kaplan took a job with AIDS United, a non-profit group. The couple had dated off and on for years since the 1990s, but moved in together about six years ago, Kaplan said. Sasser was a pastry chef at RIS, a Washington restaurant, but he was unable to work for the last five weeks, Kaplan said. His last week was spent in bed at home, his partner said. His illness evolved quickly, with the July diagnosis of stage 4 mesothelioma following a June blood test showing an abnormality, Kaplan said. News of Sasser's death spread quickly across social media, with Winick posting a series of photos of Sasser and Zamora via Twitter. Actor and gay rights activist Wilson Cruz wrote on Twitter: ""My heart breaks. Another beacon of light in our community is darkened tonight with the passing of Sean Sasser."" ""It is because of Pedro and Sean that I made safe decisions about protection and partners in 1993 at just 15. Thanks,"" Yasemin Abdulraouf wrote in a post on Twitter. Another person, identified by the Twitter handle Hollis, wrote: ""U & Pedro showed true grace & dignity in the face of adversity. Hope u have found peace."" MTV wrote, simply: ""RIP to a member of the MTV family, groundbreaking Real World star + AIDS activist."" People we lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a film of first-time triumphs: It's writer/director Benh Zeitlin's first feature, and the first acting roles for two of its stars, Quvenzhane Wallis and Dwight Henry. The movie follows Henry's Wink, a father struggling with illness who tries to impart valuable survival skills to his daughter, Hushpuppy (Wallis), as a storm disrupts their life in a sheltered community called the Bathtub on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Henry's performance is raw, unsettling and powerful and all the more remarkable for someone new to acting. Wallis, 8, also turns in a phenomenal performance in her debut. Following a limited opening in New York and Los Angeles last month, ""Beasts"" has received nearly universal critical acclaim, becoming one of the summer's most-talked about films. It's carving out space in between superhero flicks and ""Ted,"" the movie about the stuffed talking bear, as it expands into theaters across the country. Henry, 45, a baker (and the owner of the Buttermilk Drop Bakery and Cafe in New Orleans), will tell you in his cool, Southern drawl that he's taking everything in stride. But after the film won the Sundance Film Festival's grand jury prize, the Hollywood doors have opened up. Henry just wrapped his second film, ""Twelve Years a Slave,"" working alongside director Steve McQueen and actors Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt. CNN spoke to the baker/actor from Los Angeles about his new career on the big screen as well as some theories as to the success of ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" CNN: Growing up, what types of movies were you into? Dwight Henry: I liked the westerns. I was into Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson type of westerns. I always worked a lot, but I had time to watch a lot of cowboy movies. I like a lot of Morgan Freeman's movies and Russell Crowe. ""Gladiator"" is one of my all-time (favorites). I can watch ""Gladiator"" at least once a month. CNN: I read that you turned down the role of Wink three times. Henry: Reluctantly, I turned it down. Reluctantly. Not turned it down like snubbing my nose turning it down. I was obligated to my business; it had just opened up, and it was hard to leave. But it was what they seen in me ... They had me believing that I was the only person who could do this part. After I turned them down, reluctantly, three times, they really convinced me that no one could do this part but me. They sold me. They had so much belief to put their whole film, millions of dollars, into my hands. When I finally took the part, I remember all three of the producers came into the bakery, the accountants came in with them and they were like, ""You gotta do this."" They seen something in me. I worked things out with my partners and moved out of town. I just finished shooting another film, ""Twelve Years a Slave."" Steve McQueen directed the movie. Steve was telling me, ""Man, they're right about you."" I have to believe what certain people say. They say I have this gift, and I have to take it for what it is. CNN: What was the first day on the ""Beasts"" set like? Were you nervous? Henry: Not really. I'm not the type of person. ... I wouldn't say I was nervous. It was something new to me -- cameras on me, people watching me. I'm more the type of person that accepts challenges, and I believe in myself because I wouldn't have the success I've had in business without believing in myself. CNN: The film takes place in a very specific place, within a very specific culture, after an event we all recognize as a significant storm. Henry: You have to be from down there to relate to some of the difficulties and challenges that we face, living on the Gulf Coast, in that region. There (are) particular parts to that region that are protected to a level where they can always recover, but there (are) parts of that region that are forgotten about, unprotected. CNN: In the course of your life in New Orleans, you must've come across people who were very similar to the characters in ""Beast."" Henry: Yeah. I know some resilient people. Resilient people meaning under the worse circumstances in the world, they won't leave the things they love. We often have to go through that. Just like that last situation we had with Hurricane Katrina. A lot of people refused to leave. We're not just going to walk away from these things. I'm one. I stood back, I was in neck-high water and got stranded down there and had to run for higher ground, trying to stay back and protect the things I loved the most. I understand a lot of what the people in that movie, who live on that island, what they go through. CNN: But a lot of people that are not from that area are responding to the film, the performances and the story. Henry: But you know something? ... This is a story that has a lot of love in it, passion, a lot of family unity. All of these different things, people naturally respond to these things. Everywhere we went, from the East Coast to the West Coast, all the people responded the same to it. It's a movie that you get a lot of feeling when you watch it. It's a movie that everybody can go see, the Baptists, the Catholics, the Republicans, the Democrats, the blacks, the whites. Everybody can go see and love. CNN: Before acting, have you always been in the restaurant world? Henry: Always been. When I got out of school in the 11th grade, I started working at the ... Sunrise Bakery. It was a local bakery in the Ninth Ward. I fell in love with the bakery business and went from bakery, to restaurants, to other bakeries. That's all I ever did, my whole life. Never tried to do nothing else. I loved it and I love what I do, where I worked hard and put something together and opened my own business. I was already blessed. CNN: Wink is the first person you've brought to life on-screen. What do you think is remarkable about him? Henry: The love, the passion that he has. He has a heart the size of Texas. He loves the people that's on that island with him. He loves his daughter more than anything. He loves the ground, the land, the dirt. He just loves everything about everything. He's not going to be on the Earth that long, and the most important thing in the world is for her to survive. CNN: What's on the horizon for you? Henry: I have another business I'm about to open up in New Orleans called Wink's Bakery and Bistro, down in the Central District. I have some different things. If the right part comes along, I'd love to do more film. But it has to be something special.","Dwight Henry lands his first acting role with ""Beasts of the Southern Wild""

"(CNN) -- The gruesome civil war in Syria has terrorized residents and left world leaders scrambling to stop the carnage that mounts daily. Here are the latest developments in the spiraling 18-month crisis: . On the ground: Explosions, casualties . Fighting and shelling persisted all day Sunday and into Monday morning in Aleppo, with both the regime and the opposition blaming each other for dozens of fatalities. A bomb landed on a kindergarten in Aleppo, leveling a residential block and causing a ""great number"" of casualties, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said Sunday. The opposition activist group described it as a barrel bomb attack, saying regime forces have been dropping barrels full of TNT, nails and fuel onto civilian areas. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that warplanes shelled a residential building next to a nursery, causing its collapse and leading to ""dozens of martyrs and casualties."" Syrian state-run media, meanwhile, said Sunday that regime forces had killed numerous ""terrorists"" in Aleppo and freed 30 people who had been ""kidnapped by the armed terrorist groups."" Heart-rending choices in warzone hospital . For over a year, the Syrian government has refused to acknowledge the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule and has blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for fueling the bloodshed. Meanwhile, 27 civilians were killed and another 64 wounded in a car bombing near two hospitals in western Aleppo, the state-run SANA news agency reported, citing Aleppo's Gov. Mohammed Wahid. This blast significantly damaged the two hospitals, a school and other buildings. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that 27 people had died in the attack around what is known as the Earth area of Aleppo. It was not immediately clear, the opposition group said, whether those killed were civilians or regime forces. The violence was hardly confined to Aleppo, however. Across the country, at least 160 people were killed Sunday, opposition activists said. A quarter of those deaths were in and around the Syrian capital, as well as 22 in Daraa and 22 in Homs -- nine of them killed in a ""massacre"" in Rastan, according to the LCC. The opposition group reported Sunday evening that 19 people on one Damascus street died ""after a mortar shell landed on homes in the area."" Citing a source, state media reported 14 ""terrorists"" were killed in a clash with regime forces in the al-Qusayr countryside. Both SANA and the LCC, on its Facebook page, identified the same three men as being killed in the area -- with the opposition group saying they died after ""a land mine planted by regime forces in a road exploded."" U.N. employee shot dead in Damascus . In the country's capital, a 28-year-old employee of the United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency died Sunday after a bullet struck him in the chest, the agency said. Baby survives as family dies in Syrian onslaught . It was unclear whether his death, which occurred just south of the Yarmouk residential area in Damascus, ""was caused by a stray bullet or one fired by a sniper,"" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement. The death was the second in three days for a U.N employee working around Yarmouk, which the world body said is home to about 1 million Syrians and 150,000 Palestinian refugees. Ten Palestinian refugees were also killed between September 6 and 8 by violence stemming from the broader civil war. Late Sunday night, the opposition Local Coordination Committees accused Syrian forces of launching ""raids and (making) indiscriminate arrests in a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus. ""UNRWA deplores the tragic loss of life and expresses the view that threats to (Palestinian) refugees and other civilians can be avoided. All sides must refrain from conducting the conflict in civilian areas and must comply with their obligations under international law,"" the statement said. Diplomatic front: New envoy to Syria to work with Arab leaders . International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in Cairo on Sunday to meet with Arab League officials on the Syrian crisis, Egyptian state media reported. This is Brahimi's first such meeting since becoming the U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria. He faces the daunting task of trying to help stop the bloodshed in the war-torn country. While in Egypt, Brahimi will meet with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and several Syrian opposition figures to talk about the Syrian crisis, his spokesman Ahmed Fawzi told Egypt's state-run MENA news agency. British Foreign Secretary William Hague will arrive in Cairo on Monday night for a two-day visit focused on Syria, the Palestinian-Israeli issue and economic matters, according to MENA. A family's desperate story . After spending a few days in Egypt, Brahimi has said he will head next to Damascus. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Eraqij told his nation's semi-official Mehr news agency on Sunday that Brahimi has indicated he'll visit Tehran soon after his trip to Syria. The United Nations says more than 18,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have been killed in Syria since March 2011. Opposition activists put the toll much higher, at more than 24,000 people. Jouejati, an LCC spokeswoman, said Sunday that the situation should be classified as ""genocide."" CNN cannot independently verify death tolls because the Syrian government has severely restricted access to the country by foreign journalists. Russia: Sanctions against Syria hurt Russian business . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said U.S. sanctions on Syria and Iran are harming Russian business interests. ""The unilateral American sanctions against Syria and Iran are increasingly becoming extraterritorial in nature and are directly affecting the interests of Russian business, in particular banks,"" Lavrov said Saturday, according to the state news agency RIA Novosti. The United States and other Western countries have sharply criticized Russia, accusing it of defending the Syrian regime for financial interests and thereby allowing the regime's bloody crackdown on dissidents to continue. Russia, along with China, has repeatedly vetoed attempts at the U.N. Security Council to take tougher action against the Syrian government. But Russia will push the Security Council to endorse a peace plan that would set up a transitional government in Syria, RIA Novosti reported. World leaders agreed on the plan in Geneva this year. But while U.S. and British leaders said they don't foresee al-Assad in the transitional government, Russia said the Geneva plan ""did not imply that Assad should step down,"" RIA Novosti said. U.S. politician says his country needs to take further action . U.S. Sen. John McCain blasted President Barack Obama for not doing more to back the Syrian opposition, calling his administration's actions thus far ""shameful."" The Arizona Republican said the United States should get opposition fighters weapons ""so it's a fair fight"" and establish a ""sanctuary or free zone"" from which the opposition can operate. He said he is not asking that U.S. troops be sent into Syria to battle government forces. McCain, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, said a lack of international action to date has contributed to the ""rise of extremists, rise of al Qaeda, (and a) greater threat of chemical weapons."" ""We've sat still and watched this massacre go on now (with) over 20,000 people (killed),"" he told CNN Saturday. ""How many have to die before we act?"" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Roba Alhenawi, Amir Ahmed and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: State media reports 27 civilians are killed in a car bombing in Aleppo .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- While the whistleblower website WikiLeaks is shaking up the United States and its diplomatic relations with the international community, India has got its own spate of ""audio leaks"" which has gripped local media and the public. The controversy has hit top government officials, some of the nation's wealthiest tycoons and the 'Oprah of India.' Recordings of phone conversations between a lobbyist and prominent journalists, industrialists and politicians leaked in the past few weeks reveal that some of India's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of India's biggest scams ever. The ""2G scam,"" as it is known in India, involves telecommunications minister A. Raja underselling mobile phone licenses in the world's fastest growing mobile phone market. The leaked audio tapes recorded in 2009 reveal lobbyist Niira Radia asking senior journalists Barkha Dutt, group editor of leading news channel NDTV, and Vir Sanghvi, advisory editorial director of the Hindustan Times, to mediate with the ruling Congress party about cabinet posts. The tapes suggest Radia was lobbying for the continuation of Raja's post as telecommunications minister after the 2009 elections and both journalists agreed to help. Indian auditors say this cost the country some $40 billion in lost revenues as the mobile phone licenses were sold at prices set in 2001 under Raja's watch. Raja was forced to resign last month, but the 2G scam has put parliament in a logjam for the past two weeks as recriminations fly across party lines. While allegations of corruption are commonplace in India, revelations that some of India's most influential journalists were involved have shocked the public. Dutt is known as the 'Oprah of India' and Sanghvi is a widely-read columnist. ""It's very, very disappointing. Neither of them is corrupt, nobody is saying they are corrupt. But corruption when it involves ethics is worse then taking money,"" senior political journalist Tavleen Singh told CNN. Some 104 tapes have been leaked and are now widely available on the internet. The transcripts were first published in two Indian magazines, which sourced them to audio recordings submitted recently to the Supreme Court as part of the 2G scam. While the recordings feature many conversations, the focus has been on Radia's multiple conversations with Dutt and Sanghvi. In one conversation, Dutt says to Radia, ""What do you want me to tell them (Congress Party)? Tell me, I'll talk to them."" In another recording, Sanghvi tells Radia he can offer a fully scripted and rehearsed TV interview for India's wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani. Radia's public relations firm represents Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries and the Tata Group. ""When I started out as journalist in Delhi, the government had other ways of controlling the media. It used to be by giving free houses and other freebies like trips with the prime minister. Now they are controlling access. So if journalists cooperate, they are given exclusive access to information, VIP parties and this is most worrying,"" Singh said. One of the recordings also features Radia's conversation with the head of India's largest conglomerate, Ratan Tata. Tata petitioned the Supreme Court on Monday to bar further dissemination of the tapes, contending the leakage has infringed upon his fundamental right to privacy. ""We have somewhat slipped into a morass of series of allegations ... unauthorized tapes flooding ... the media going crazy on alleging, convicting, executing ... literally character assassination ... stop this sort of Banana Republic kind of attack,"" Tata said in a statement. While both Dutt and Sanghvi have not denied the authenticity of the recordings, they both maintain they were simply placating a source for news gathering purposes and believe they have done no wrong. In a Twitter post, Dutt said: ""Unless we only cover news based on bland press conferences, we have to talk to all sorts, good and bad, I think there is nothing wrong in stringing along a source for info...I think EVERY journo has the right to engage a source, its NO CRIME...as a matter of record, I never passed the message. But info sharing per se is not immoral in a fluid news situation."" Other senior journalists believe the Indian media is facing a crisis of credibility. ""The feedback I'm getting is nobody trusts us journalists anymore,"" Singh said. ""Barkha and Vir are very good friends of mine, I still continue to respect them. But I just wish they had said sorry and ended it there. India has 300 television channels, most of them in very rural areas. If this is happening in Delhi just look at the consequences lower down.""","Leaks of recordings among journalists, lobbyists and politicians have gripped India .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Israel's ground incursion into Gaza, which it says is intended to destroy Palestinian militants' tunnels and stop rocket fire into Gaza, has entered its fifth day with the death toll mounting on both sides and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arriving in Egypt. CNN's Ben Wedeman, a veteran Middle East correspondent, puts the incursion into perspective. How does this incursion compare to previous ones by Israel into Gaza, in terms of military force? Unlike 2008/09, this incursion seems to be focused on areas with high concentrations of people, initially focusing on the Gaza City neighborhood of Shaja'ia. In '08/09 the focus was on areas where rockets were being fired, which were typically away from highly populated communities. And of course at this stage, it's unclear how many Palestinian casualties there have been in these locations. The people have been warned by the Israelis to leave these areas with phone messages, but while many have left, a significant proportion has stayed behind. My impression is that Israel has mobilized a much larger military force than in 2008/09 and in 2012. This is part of the picture of the Israelis going into heavily populated areas -- which is a much more dangerous operation, as can be seen by the deaths of at least 13 Israeli soldiers on Sunday. Is Israel likely to achieve its objective of destroying the tunnels, and stopping the rocket strikes? So far, Israel hasn't been wildly successful in its stated mission. Since this started, Hamas has been using tunnels in an attempt to ambush and capture soldiers and continues to fire rockets at Israel, although the number fired has gone down. What we see is that as Israel's capabilities have changed, so have Hamas'. Whenever Israel comes up with new tactics, Hamas and other factions seem to find new ways to counter them, such as by using longer-range rockets to fire at Israel, for example. What is significant now is that Hamas fighters appear to be better trained, with a new set of skills that I don't think Israel anticipated. One Israeli soldier who came out of Shaja'ia was quoted in an Israeli publication that Hamas is fighting like Hezbollah, which waged a successful guerrilla war against Israel's occupation in the 1980s and 1990s, and inflicted high casualties on Israeli forces during the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon. The last serious street fighting I saw in Gaza was in early 2008, and it was almost like it was ""amateur hour,"" with fighters in Gaza parading around with their weapons but not really able to stop the Israeli forces. Now it appears they've learned they must keep a much lower profile. They've developed what could be called commando tactics, and are taking full advantage of their knowledge of their turf. How long do you believe this incursion will last? How soon before it realistically is better described as a war? This is now a war, in my modest opinion -- it's gone beyond a mere incursion. Hamas shows no sign of backing down, and didn't jump at Egypt's cease-fire proposal. They want to show that they're a military force to be reckoned with, and are in it for the long run. Israel's defense minister said it would take two or three days to destroy the tunnels. If this crisis is to end soon, Israel will have to pull back and Hamas needs to stop firing rockets. In Hamas' opinion, they have achieved one of their objectives, which is to give Israel a bloody nose. They claim to have captured an Israeli soldier -- as yet this is unconfirmed -- but if true, it would be a huge feather in their cap, in their own terms. When Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas in a June 2006 raid near the Israel-Gaza border, it took five years before he was freed, in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- so, if true, this will be a huge bargaining chip for Hamas. Will the death toll already suffered by Israel have a serious impact on public opinion in Israel? Israelis are used to this sort of death toll from Hezbollah, but not from Hamas. I was on the streets of Gaza on Sunday night, when Palestinians celebrated the claims that an Israeli soldier had been captured. Shortly afterwards, the guns on Israeli navy boats opened up. The immediate conclusion of everyone in the street was that this was Israel's response to the capture of one of its soldiers. How much effect will the pressure/condemnation from the United Nations (and in the off-mic remarks from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry) have? I believe the U.N. remarks will have no effect in Gaza. There is a perception there that the U.N. ""talks but doesn't walk"" -- it's toothless in other words. Hamas realizes it has few friends in the outside world. The remarks of the White House last week though will not go down well in Israel, I believe. And the comments of John Kerry on Sunday -- which left some wondering whether he was criticizing Israeli assurances that its ground offensive in Gaza would be limited -- indicate American patience may be wearing thin. After one of his deputies mentioned the latest number of Palestinian casualties, Kerry was heard to say, ""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation."" It is estimated that 70% of the more than 500 Palestinians killed in Israel's assault have been civilians. Washington has tied itself to Israel, and that country's right to self-defense, therefore the U.S. is going to feel some responsibility. Americans support Israel rhetorically, but this high Palestinian death toll is very problematic for the U.S. This is why Kerry may be feeling uncomfortable -- he spent almost a year trying to forge a Mideast peace deal, and what's he got to show for it now?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- An online media report that R&B singer De'Mario ""Raz B"" Thornton was in a coma in China was a hoax, according to his agent. The R&B singer was hurt in a nightclub brawl near Shanghai, but his injuries were not serious, manager Elayne Rivers told CNN Monday. ""The comments about Raz being in a coma did not come from his official representative,"" Rivers said. The singer's brother, who performs under the name Ricky Romance, said in a statement sent to CNN Monday afternoon that he had been ""misled by unknown reasons."" ""I was unfortunately unable to contact my brother at the time and then panicked,"" Romance said. ""I then alerted as many people of this information hoping to gather facts... Since the source that gave me this information was what I thought to be legitimately reliable I didn't question I just believed. I apologize if I seem like I jumped to conclusions but a coma is a serious situation and it was concerning my brother whom is my best friend as well. I sincerely apologize for the confusion I caused if that is the case."" A celebrity news website first reported the original member of the boy band B2K was in a coma Saturday, identifying its source as Toy Jones. Although Jones gave CNN the same information Sunday, she declined to give the name of the hospital -- only saying it was in the Zhejiang province near Shanghai. Several hours later, Jones sent CNN a written statement saying the singer had miraculously recovered from the coma and would be released from the hospital in days. The unedited statement reads: ""Doctor says Numerous Brain scans showed that Raz's entire cortex- the parts of the brain that give us consciousness, thought, Memory and understanding is now functioning. Doctors say its a miracle and told his family that he stands a strong chance of survival and no signs of being brain dead for the rest of his life against all odds,Raz woke up this morning and is in stable condition We ask the the fans and media respect our family's privacy"" CNN chose not to report the story until the story until details could be confirmed by the U.S. State Department, officials at the U.S. embassy in China or Chinese officials. Raz B also reached out personally to CNN in an e-mail asking that nothing be published. Rivers sent a statement distancing the singer from the coma report on Monday. When CNN asked Jones about the statement, she said ""as far as I know it is true"" that he was in a coma. She said she was hired by Raz B's family to get the story out to the news media. Dozens of news agencies around the world -- including in China -- repeated the coma story, giving Raz B more publicity in one weekend than he's likely had since his group disbanded nine years ago.

"(CNN) -- Autopsy results on former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner show he died from a single gunshot wound to the head that was likely self-inflicted, authorities said Friday. The renegade cop killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades, before apparently taking his own life. ""While we're still compiling the information and putting our reports together, the information that we have right now seems to indicate that the wound that took Christopher Dorner's life was self-inflicted,"" Capt. Kevin Lacy, with the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department, told reporters. Speaking at the same news conference, Sheriff John McMahon revealed that Dorner likely hid for days just steps from their command center in the Big Bear Lake area. Authorities to decide fate of Dorner reward money . Investigators began scouring the mountains for Dorner on February 7, when they found his scorched pickup. Police, sheriff's deputies and federal agents worked through a weekend blizzard, but the trail was cold for days. It picked up again on Tuesday, when Karen and Jim Reynolds, upon returning to their home across the street from the command center, came across a man who looked like Dorner. The sheriff said authorities now believe that Dorner had entered the Reynolds' unlocked home, locked the door, and hid there for days. In fact, when deputies knocked on the Reynolds' door on February 7, Dorner was likely inside, McMahon said. ""In hindsight, it's probably a good thing that he did not answer based on his actions before and after that event,"" he said. Ex-girlfriend: Dorner was stressed out, bottled up . Also Friday, Sgt. Travis Newport said that authorities have recovered various items from the places and vehicles Dorner occupied, including assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns. They also found high-capacity magazines, tear gas, a military-style helmet and 10 silencers. The developments came three days after a shootout, standoff and fire at a cabin in the mountains east of Los Angeles. Dorner's remains were identified through dental records. Dorner was fired from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2009 for falsely accusing his training officer of kicking a subdued suspect. After unsuccessfully challenging his dismissal in court, police say, he launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the LAPD, targeting numerous officers involved in his case and their families. Dorner was cornered and died Tuesday afternoon in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city he had once sworn to protect and serve. The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in the cabin after a shootout with law enforcement that left a sheriff's deputy dead and another wounded, McMahon said. The cabin caught fire when police shot tear gas canisters into it, McMahon told reporters this week. Although the canisters included pyrotechnic tear gas, which generates heat, ""We did not intentionally burn that cabin down,"" he said Friday, echoing earlier comments he's made on the case. In a manifesto announcing his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case. Those allegations have struck a chord with some who say Dorner was seeking justice.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Susan Todd loves her daily coffee fix. ""I can drink four or five cups, easily, comfortably,"" said Todd, 59, of Clinton Township, Michigan. Skeet Spillane (right) got severe headaches when he quit caffeine. His wife said he was cranky most of the time. But if she skips her regular dose of caffeine, Todd warned, watch out. ""I feel lousy all over. It's not that anything hurts,"" she explained. ""I just feel sluggish, and a cup of caffeine will cure that."" Todd is among the estimated 80 to 90 percent of North American adults and children who consume caffeine products every day. Experts estimate about half that number will experience headaches and other symptoms from caffeine withdrawal syndrome. There are a number of reasons why someone might need to reduce or stop their daily caffeine intake. Experts tell pregnant women not to consume more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day (about one 12-ounce cup of coffee). Caffeinated products are not recommended for people who are prone to panic attacks or those who suffer from anxiety. Some surgical patients may also experience the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal syndrome on the day of surgery, because they are told not to eat or drink anything. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, recognized the condition as a disorder five years ago after reviewing decades of studies. They concluded the higher the caffeine intake, the more likely a patient was to suffer from severe withdrawal symptoms when denied the ingredient.  Watch more on caffeine withdrawal syndrome » . Researchers also reported that some caffeine users considered themselves addicted to caffeine because they were unable to quit or cut down on their usage. Michael Kuhar, chief of the division of neuroscience at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, prefers to use the word ""dependent"" rather than ""addicted."" Even though he called caffeine a drug, Kuhar wouldn't go so far as saying it has reached the status of cocaine or heroin. According to Kuhar, caffeine is a mild stimulant. ""If you take a cup of caffeine you're likely to feel good and energized,"" he said. Miss that cup of ""Joe"" or can of cola and don't be surprised if you start feeling funny, Kuhar warned. He said some people complain of ""headache, fatigue, sleepiness, inability to focus and concentrate."" Others report experiencing flu- like symptoms, irritability, depression and anxiety after skipping as little as one cup of coffee a day. Kuhar explained that caffeine blocks receptors in the brain that can dilate blood vessels causing headaches. ""Withdrawal symptoms can start from 12 to 20 hours after your last cup of coffee and peak about two days later and can last about as long as a week,"" Kuhar added. It is not just coffee that can lead to caffeine withdrawal. While a 6-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 100 milligrams of caffeine, tea and cola have about 40 milligrams each, a bar of milk chocolate has about 10 milligrams and hot chocolate has about 7 milligrams. Kuhar said that means adults as well as children may be suffering daily physiological and personality effects of caffeine withdrawal. He recommended that people who are motivated to give up caffeine, or cut back on consumption, do so very carefully. ""The thing to do is what we do with so many drugs -- basically you wean yourself off slowly,"" Kuhar suggested. ""That doesn't mean it is going to be easy at every step, but it should be easier than going cold turkey."" Johns Hopkins researchers also endorsed a stepped approach to quitting caffeine. They instruct patients to gradually substitute decaffeinated products or noncaffeinated products over time in order to reduce the likelihood of experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Kuhar suggested the process also can begin with reducing caffeine consumption by a half to a whole cup a day. Technology consultant Skeet Spillane, 42, of St. Petersburg, Florida, started a step-down program after years of consuming up to three cups of coffee each day. He felt he was ""drinking way too much caffeine."" Spillane said he knew right away that he was suffering from caffeine withdrawal when he started getting severe headaches. His wife told him he was cranky most of the time. He now drinks tea instead, and occasionally sneaks a cup of coffee. Looking back, Spillane admitted going through withdrawal was ""tough for a while,"" but he's feeling better these days and he's glad he's not so dependent on caffeine.","Up to 90 percent of North Americans consume caffeine products every day .

"(CNN) -- Cancer is plaguing a growing number of first responders and rescuers who worked at ground zero after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. These are cancers the federal government says are thought to be directly related to that effort -- cancers like leukemia, myeloma, thyroid and prostate cancers. There are at least 1,646 certified cancer cases that have been documented by Mount Sinai Selikoff Centers for Occupational Health. There are some additional 863 cancer cases among both fire and EMS personnel, according to FDNY, which keeps a separate database for its members. That's a total of 2,509 cases. The center has screened more than 37,000 World Trade Center rescue and recovery workers since 2002. It will continue to monitor those workers and volunteers for any new cases. Some reports suggest the number of cancer cases in this group has doubled since last year. While that may be mathematically true, cancer experts caution that we can't draw any significant conclusions from the increase. ""For every decade of life, if you look at a population ... cancer rates go up the older you are,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the chief medical and scientific officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society. ""Looking at an increase from one year to the next is a nonscientific way of making an assessment that is incredibly biased to find a link between the activity and the cancer."" Many have cancers after 9/11 . To be scientifically accurate, Brawley said someone would have to look at all the cancer records for the people in the 9/11 group and compare them to a group that had the same age makeup, same gender, and other demographic data. There would also have to be a significant portion of firefighters in that sample, because as a profession they tend to have higher cancer rates than the general population, Brawley said. A deep scientific analysis of available medical data through 2010 showed a 20% increase in the rate of cancer cases for 9/11 rescue and recovery workers when compared to the general population, according to Mount Sinai. Government reports suggest workers at the World Trade Center were exposed to a number of chemicals that were known to be carcinogens, or agents that may cause cancer. Many people who worked at the site are struggling with devastating cancers they may not otherwise have had, had they not responded to the tragedy. That much is clear, according to the U.S. government, which set up a special World Trade Center Health Program. The program provides medical monitoring and treatment services for 9/11 responders and survivors. Nearly 65,000 people are enrolled. Enrollees are qualified to get health care treatment through several reputable medical centers that keep experts on staff who are qualified to treat and identify illnesses related to the terrorist attacks. The program plans to continue to monitor those workers. ""I think all of us are open to the possibility that these brave folks were exposed to things that caused further illness,"" Brawley said. ""What's most important is that someone has cancer and needs help and we should continue to provide them with the good care they truly deserve.""

"(CNN) -- Deep in Tunisia's Sahara desert is an abandoned settlement, part submerged by the sand, somehow alien, yet strangely familiar. The surrounding landscape looks like it's from another world, in a galaxy far, far away -- which is why movie director George Lucas chose it as a location for filming parts of his blockbuster ""Star Wars"" series. The Tunisian Sahara was transformed into Tatooine -- the barren planet with twin suns that was the birthplace of Anakin Skywalker, otherwise known as Darth Vader. At the Tunisian government's request, the lavish set for Anakin's home town, Mos Espa, remains intact -- a beacon in the desert. Read more: Stargazing in the desert . The set of 20 buildings, situated northwest of the city of Tozeur, covers an area of around 10,000 square meters and remains a pilgrimage destination for avid ""Star Wars"" fans from around the world. Former rally driver Tahar Karya is an expert at tackling the Sahara's sand dunes in his four-by-four. He was George Lucas's personal driver during the filming in Tunisia and has a personal attachment to the set. He believes that Lucas's decision to use the area in his film was a great boon for the region. ""More than 1,500 background actors were employed. Agencies and hotels also benefited,"" he says. ""Over a period of two-and-a-half months, (Lucas) brought activities to the region and beneficial economic activity. We hope he comes back here again."" The crew faced difficulties dealing with the weather in the Sahara. Temperatures reached 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 C) during filming, then production was slowed by a rare summer rainstorm. Still, facing scheduling and budget constraints, Lucas was able to get the scenes he needed, which appear in ""Star Wars"" movies ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones."" Read this: Hollywood classics get African photo remake . But for those who want to experience this important piece of film history, time is running out. Although the set has withstood the elements for more than a decade, the desert's sand dunes are moving to engulf the fictional town. ""Ever since they finished the part of the movie shot in 2003, sand dunes have surrounded the film set from every side. They should not have allowed this to happen,"" says Tahar. A team of scientists has tracked the movement of a large sand dune, which has already started to cover the set. it is moving at a rate of 4 cm per day and It won't be long before this alien town is buried beneath the sand. Like any desert Oasis, this one too will soon disappear. Each day tourists -- mostly from Europe -- arrive by the car load. Trips to the abandoned film set are included in hotel vacation packages and it's one of the few things that will draw visitors into the baking-hot desert. What really matters to Tahar is that the tourists keep coming, especially because the country is struggling to rebuild its economy after its 2011 revolution. ""Tunisia is a very beautiful and safe country,"" he says. ""I advise the whole world to come visit Tunisia. Tunisia is a country of security, comfort, and stability ... Besides, in Tunisia there are more than 300 days of sunlight. This is a country where life is good!"" As the sun beats down on the alien homeland, Tahar says he is proud to have been part of something iconic. But fans who want to visit Mos Espa will need to act soon, before the Sahara Desert swallows it up.","George Lucas filmed parts of his ""Star Wars"" films in the Tunisian Sahara Desert .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations declared a famine Wednesday in parts of southern Somalia and warned that the suffering could rapidly spread without a massive and immediate international response. ""Nearly 3.7 million people are now in crisis,"" said U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""We need donor support to address current needs and prevent a further deterioration of the crisis."" The crisis in Somalia -- a failing state mired in internal conflict and suffering the worst drought in half a century -- has been escalating steadily for months as aid agencies have pleaded for the international community to intervene. Wednesday, the humanitarian agency Oxfam blamed international donors for the potentially catastrophic situation at hand. ""Several rich governments are guilty of willful neglect as the aid effort to avert catastrophe in East Africa limps along due to an $800 million shortfall,"" an Oxfam statement said. Thousands of Somalis have fled the country in search of food and water, trekking for days under scorching sun toward refugee camps in neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia. ""If we don't act now, famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months, due to poor harvests and infectious disease outbreaks,"" Mark Bowden, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, told reporters from Nairobi, Kenya. ""It is likely that tens of thousands of people have already died -- the majority of these being children."" He said nearly half the people in Somalia are in crisis and roughly $300 million in aid is needed in the next two months. Aid workers call it the worst food crisis since a famine in Ethiopia in the mid-1980s that killed about 1 million people. ""Every day of delay in assistance is literally a matter of life or death for children and their families in the famine-affected areas,"" Bowden said. The United Nations uses a five-stage scale to measure hunger. Stage 5, or famine, means that acute malnutrition rates are 30% or more, people do not have adequate calorie or water intake and mortality rates are greater than two adults or four children per day per 10,000 people. Think of it this way, said Lawrence Haddad, director of the U.K.-based Institute of Development Studies: If famine were declared in the United States, 3,000 or more children would be dying every day from lack of food and water. ""This is big,"" he said. ""We have to act quickly, now."" Oxfam defines famine as a cocktail of causes: A ""triple failure of food production, people's ability to access food and, finally and most crucially, in the political response by governments and international donors. Crop failure and poverty leave people vulnerable to starvation -- but famine only occurs with political failure."" Famine used to be a term equated solely with a large-scale shortage of food. But the term slipped out of the official lexicon after it came to encompass a variety of factors that add up to a complex emergency, said Patrick Webb, an expert in food security at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. ""Actually, a lot of famine happens when there is food in the market,"" he said. ""It's about people's inability to acquire that food. Famine represents a catastrophic failure of all the systems that people rely on to survive."" That includes the deaths of livestock, displacement of people and conflict. And that is what has happened in southern Somalia, where people have had to make heart-wrenching choices simply to stay alive. A mother might have to decide whether to keep her baby alive or split her money to feed all her children. A family may take down their thatched roof, the only shelter they have, to make sure a precious cow can eat. Grandparents might forgo their share of a meal to ensure survival for the youngest generation. Webb said many Americans stung by the recession have had to make difficult life choices. Multiply that by many times to get an idea of what it means to be Somali right now. ""The thing about food is that you have to have it every day,"" he said. ""It's not like buying a car or clothes. It's where the rubber meets the road."" After Wednesday's declaration of famine, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced $28 million in additional funding for the crisis. ""We have already responded with over $431 million in food and nonfood emergency assistance this year alone,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""But it is not enough -- the need is only expected to increase and more must be done by the United States and the international community."" Part of the problem with donations is that it's politically difficult to give money for an event that has not happened yet, Haddad said. He understood Oxfam's position and the frustration of aid workers on the frontlines who are bearing witness to immense human suffering. But how do you justify millions for a catastrophe that ""might"" happen, he asked. About 10 million people are at risk of famine in the Horn of Africa. Somalia, wracked by years of internal violence and insecurity, is the worst affected. Many Somalis have fled to the Dadaab camp, a refugee complex in Kenya intended to house 90,000 but now bursting with 400,000 people. Internal strife has exacerbated drought-caused food shortages and livestock deaths. The nation has not had an effective government for two decades and government forces have been battling Al-Shabaab militants in the capital, Mogadishu. Humanitarian agencies have not been able to reach famine-affected areas, said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""Al-Shabaab is principally responsible for exacerbating the consequences of the drought situation by preventing its own people from being able to access critically needed assistance,"" she said. Al-Shabaab, a group of Islamist insurgents with affiliations with al-Qaeda, controls large portions of Mogadishu and parts of southern and central Somalia. The militants had accused Western humanitarians of being anti-Muslim. But earlier this month, the al Qaeda-linked group pledged to allow aid groups access to areas under its control, reversing an earlier decision banning them. ""President Obama and Secretary Clinton have aggressively worked to and asked us to test Al-Shabaab,"" said Dr. Rajiv Shah, chief administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, in an interview from the Dadaab refugee camp. ""If they're going to provide humanitarian access, we're going to stand with the United Nations and other partners to make sure that humanitarian organizations can get in and can reach the most affected people. It's no coincidence that the precise geography that have been labeled a famine and have met the technical designation of famine are precisely those areas where Shabaab has limited access, has harassed aid workers and has made it difficult for people to eke out a basic standard of living and existence."" Humanitarian agencies have welcomed the pledge by Al-Shabaab, but said the earlier ban intensified the crisis. U.N. officials were able to airlift emergency supplies to southern Somalia last week after the Islamist militants promised to lift the ban. The south is home to about 80% of the nation's malnourished children, the U.N. Children's Fund said. ""More than ever, Somali people need and deserve our full attention,"" Bowden said. ""At this time of crisis, we must make exceptional efforts to support Somalis wherever they are in need and expect that all parties will do the same.""

"(CNN) -- For conservatives conflicted over how to vote on a major measure Wednesday that would fund the federal government and authorize the President to arm Syrian rebels, their decision might have gotten a bit easier. The conservative group Club for Growth announced that it will not hold lawmakers accountable for their vote. The bill, which would fund the government until mid-December, includes an amendment to arm Syrian rebels to attack ISIS. Club for Growth informed members of Congress that the group is ""withdrawing its key vote"" because ""the ISIS language does not make this a revealing vote about economic policy."" The group, which focuses on reducing government spending, keeps a scorecard of votes it deems important and uses it against members in re-election campaigns. With the Club removing its pressure on the spending portion of the bill, conservatives who went to Congress to reduce the size of government are free to vote their conscience on the ISIS provisions. House leaders lobby wavering colleagues ahead of ISIS vote . Some members of Congress have been pushing for a stand-alone vote on ISIS, insisting that the seriousness of the matter deserves its own debate. But Congressional leadership in both parties are reluctant to hold a critical vote so close to the midterm elections, therefore tying it to a measure to keep the government functioning past September 30. Also part of Wednesday's House vote is a measure to extend the authority of the Export-Import Bank, a small government agency that has sparked the ire of tea party conservatives for subsidizing U.S. businesses to conduct international trade. Conservatives have been elevating the Export-Import Bank vote for several months, but now that it is tied with the continuing resolution to fund the government and the ISIS vote, it has almost disappeared as an issue. While conservatives are complaining that no one is focused on the bank anymore, the ISIS component of the bill could help House Speaker John Boehner, who supports the bank's extension, to pass it. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","House votes on measure to fund U.S. government and arm Syrian rebels .

"(CNN) -- I used to chuckle at people who complained about their glasses -- their thin, wispy glasses. It sounds snobby. But I was blind enough to be an honorary bat. In kindergarten, I got in trouble for constantly leaving my seat to approach the blackboard, but I couldn't read it otherwise. Coke-bottle glasses quickly followed. I graduated to contacts at age 10; by 30, anything more than 3 inches past my nose was impossibly blurry without them. As with many who can't see without corrective lenses, I always carried bottles of eyedrops and saline solution. I fumbled for my glasses even to read the bedside clock. I spent hundreds of dollars on contacts each year. I love to travel, and I'm also a worrier (though I prefer the term ""highly prepared"") by nature. So I obsessed about contingencies: What if I have to sleep in the airport or I tear a contact in the dim light of a hotel bathroom? What if I get a speck of sand under a contact and have to rinse my eye out? I began to wonder what would happen if I were in an unfamiliar place -- say, asleep in a hotel -- and needed to get out quickly but couldn't find my glasses. Could I pick the correct shapes out of the odd blobs of color that made up the world? It looked as if that was how life would always be, after I was rejected for Lasik eye correction. My prescription was too high -- -9.5 diopters in one eye and -10 in the other, roughly equating to 20/1000 vision -- and my cornea too thin for the tissue removal required to correct my nearsightedness. I don't mean to seem overly dramatic, as there are obviously many people who get along just fine with vision even worse than mine. But for me, it was enough of a daily interference that I wasn't ready to accept it. I mentioned it almost offhandedly during an annual eye exam, and my ophthalmologist said he knew of something that might help. It's a contact lens put IN your eye -- not for the squeamish, I know. But the implantable lens, made by STAAR Surgical, was approved by the FDA in 2005. It functions in a similar manner to an everyday contact lens, bending light rays so they focus correctly on the retina. But unlike a contact, this lens is inside the eyeball. The procedure was quick and simple. After my eye was numbed and dilated, I was given a sedative and wheeled into the operating room. I was awake for the procedure, but I remember only some bright lights. The doctor created a tiny slit in the cornea, the transparent front part of the eye, and inserted the slender, flexible device to form an arch over the existing lens. It's made of collamer, an organic material, and the eye doesn't recognize it as a foreign object. (A similar device approved by the FDA in 2004 goes over the iris, the colored part of the eye, rather than behind it.) ""We have a great, great success rate with ICL,"" said Dr. Ilan Cohen of 5th Avenue Eye Center in New York, who was among the first to perform the implantation surgery in the United States. ""The amazing thing about it is that it does not require any corneal removal, and it's reversible."" Since Lasik permanently alters the eye, any complications or changes in vision afterward can require even more treatment. The Visian lens can be switched out or removed at any time. ICL has been approved to correct nearsightedness from -3 diopters (or roughly 20/300 vision) up to -16 diopters and to treat patients up to -20 diopters. Of course, the procedure is not without its risks. The medical drawback is that it's done inside the eye, Cohen said. ""We do it usually one eye at a time (with a delay of one or more days between surgeries) because the risk is slightly higher for infection inside the eye and complications that could happen inside the eye. ""Besides cataracts, other complications such as glaucoma"" can occur, he said. ""These are very rare complications."" About 300,000 procedures have been performed worldwide. Visian's maker, Starr Surgical, says less than 1% of patients experience complications. Since the device has been in use for only about 10 years, little is known about long-term effects. Some patients may still need reading glasses as their eyes go through the typical aging process. But perhaps the most daunting factor for most candidates is the cost of the procedure, which can be many times that of Lasik. It can run $10,000 or more. ""The cost of the lens is high,"" slightly less than $1,000 each, Cohen said. ""Then you have to consider the cost of the surgical facility where you're doing the surgery. And we do it one eye at a time, whereas Lasik, we do both eyes in one sitting. So all these things add up to higher cost."" And unlike with Lasik, very rarely do insurance companies pay for this procedure. Three years after the procedure, my vision is 20/15, better than ever. No more squinting at the bedside clock or toting contact lenses (and all the accessories) when I travel. For me, perfect vision is worth the price.","The implantable lens, made by STAAR, was approved by the FDA in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- Monday's 2009 Major League Baseball home opener for the New York Mets at their new ballpark promises to reignite controversy -- and not just over the team's suspect pitching. Some Mets fans feel the $400 million stadium-name deal is a bad one for all parties in these economic times. Though the Mets played exhibition games there earlier this month, they will officially debut their new home, Citi Field, against the visiting San Diego Padres. The $800 million-plus Queens facility is undoubtedly a state-of-the-art baseball complex with many modern upgrades from the Mets' home for the past 44 years, Shea Stadium, which is still in the process of being demolished a few hundreds yards away. One lifelong Mets fan summed up his emotions about saying goodbye to Shea and hello to Citi by saying: ""It was time for a new stadium, but I'm going to miss Shea very much."" The controversy arises not from the disappearance of the venerated old stadium but from the fact that rather than attach the iconic Shea name to the new ballpark, in November 2006 the Mets entered into an agreement with Citigroup for naming rights for the new stadium. Reports have put the value of the deal at $400 million spread out in payments of $20 million per year over the course of the next 20 years. That would make it one of the most lucrative stadium naming arrangements in history. According to the Mets, besides the naming rights for Citi Field, ""The fully integrated partnership includes Citi brand and business unit presence throughout the new ballpark."" While other corporations have invested in similar deals in the past, the financial crisis has focused particular attention on Citigroup, the Mets, and the practice of paying vast sums of money for what is essentially a long-term advertisement. Citigroup, which now does business as Citi, has been the recipient of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailout money over the past year, causing many to question the prudence of $400 million going toward branding Citi Field, especially when Citigroup cut nearly 75,000 jobs in 2008, capped by 50,000 announced in November. Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, has been an outspoken critic of the deal. He has called attention to the issue of corporate spending discretion, or lack thereof, particularly when jobs are at risk. ""At the same time they're defending this $400 million stadium-naming deal, they lay off 50,000 people. Now, how many people could you employ for $400 million?"" The Mets claim that the construction of Citi Field created more than 6,000 temporary full-time equivalent jobs, with approximately 1,000 new positions resulting from ongoing operations at the ballpark. One person whose job isn't at risk is Mets all-star third baseman David Wright. One of the franchise's most popular and marketable players, Wright is careful not to make any ""errors"" when confronted with the controversy surrounding his new Citi Field home. ""I don't comment on things that I don't know about. I'm a baseball player, so I go out there and worry about my swing,"" he said.  Watch fans give views on Citi Field name game » . Kucinich conceded that paying to name a stadium is indeed ""great advertising except for one thing, the American taxpayers have invested heavily in these banks and the bailout fund should not be used for this purpose."" He advocates that the government, now a direct investor in Citigroup, has the obligation to monitor all aspects of how federal bailout funds are used, which in Kucinich's opinion includes any marketing or promotional endeavors. Not all Mets fans agree. One ardent fan said he's happy his hard-earned tax dollars are going to help fund the Mets' new stadium. ""A lot of people pay for advertisements every day. We shouldn't be ashamed of it. Taxpayer money goes to waste on a lot of other things. Let's go Mets, I say!"" But another fan said, ""If it is indeed our tax money that is actually running the stadium, I wish that I wouldn't have to pay as much money to go see a game."" A group of fellow fans, many liking the sound of a ""Mets rebate"" in these troubling economic times, warmly greeted his idea before an exhibition game against Boston on April 3. David Wright and the rest of the New York Mets, along with 42,000 boisterous fans, will formally open the new ballpark when the first regular-season game there begins at 7 p.m. Monday.","Mets struck deal in 2006 with firm for naming stadium.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court is about to hold hearings on whether the police need a warrant to attach a GPS tracker to a suspect's car and trace its movements while it is in a public space. (The case at hand, United States v. Jones, concerns a major drug dealer, and the police could not use the data collected while his car was parked in his garage.) The intense debate the case has already elicited among legal scholars, civil rights and libertarian activists, and those particularly concerned with public safety and national security is largely focused on the question: what would the Founding Fathers have said about the case? As I see it, at least equal weight should be accorded to the question: How well are our public authorities doing in their dealings with criminals? Who needs more tools and who should be denied access to cyber-age technologies if we are to keep a balance between our profound and essential commitments to privacy as well as our security? According to national statistics for 2010, less than half (47%) of violent crimes committed in this country are ""cleared"" (that is, suspects are arrested, charged, and turned over for prosecution) and only one out of five (18%) criminals who commit nonviolent crimes (such as burglary) are caught and tried. For obvious reasons there are no such statistics available for terrorists, and the fact that there was no successful attack in the U.S. over the past 10 years tends to make us complacent. However, if one takes into account that there are many millions of people in the world who hate us and wish us harm (and at least a few right here in the U.S.), we should maintain our vigilance. As one terrorist group once put it, ""You have to be lucky all the time. We only have to be lucky once."" To argue that the preceding data show that the government should be given some more leeway is not a violation of the Constitution, but directly sanctioned by it. Unlike the First Amendment, which is worded in absolute terms -- ""Congress shall make NO law"" -- the Fourth Amendment bans only unreasonable searches. That is, it recognizes that there is a whole category of searches that are fully legitimate and violate no one's rights. As to what is reasonable, it obviously changes with the circumstances. Given that criminals can use freely all the new technologies -- including of course GPS trackers, smartphones and spyware -- it seems eminently reasonable that the police should also be able to use some of these, especially in public spaces, in which people have no expectation of privacy (or at least should not have one). Opponents argue that the Founding Fathers provided that before a warrant is issued, the police need to show probable cause by bringing data to a judge, who reviews the facts and determines whether a warrant is appropriate and how it should be issued. However, this is needed only for searching people's private spaces -- their homes, personal effects, and personal records such as diaries -- and not for using a technology that does what cops have been doing for a century: Track a suspect in public spaces, without a warrant. Moreover, often some such surveillance is needed before a tip or lead can be developed to the point that it meets the standard of probable cause. The counter-argument that if the police are allowed to proceed, we shall be all tracked seven days a week, round the clock does not withstand minimal criticism. At most, the GPS data tells us that someone drove a car to certain places. Who lives or works there, what happened, etc. etc., all remain to be investigated. If the police put GPS devices in all the cars on the road, or even only in one out of every thousand, cops would be buried under an endless flood of data points -- among which suspects would be lost. At the same time, the police should be required to file reports after the fact about their use of GPS trackers. If it turns out that they are employed too often or to track people who are, say, political activists, the police should be reprimanded and if they persist, elected officials (say, a city council) should set limits on the use of this and other crime-fighting technologies and punish those who abuse them. If the data ran the other way -- if most criminals were neutralized and we did not have to be concerned about terrorists -- reasonable people who seek to deny the police the use of GPS trackers without probable cause might have a much stronger case. However, even then, I have a hard time believing that the Founding Fathers meant for the police to be denied tools available to all others, including the bad dudes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","Should law enforcement need a warrant before planting a GPS tracking device on a car?
No, the Supreme Court ought to decide that they should not, says Amitai Etzioni .
In this case, our need for security outweighs privacy concerns, he says .
Cops have already been tracking suspects in public places for a century, Etzioni says ."
"(CNN) -- More than 30 arrests have been made in the diamond heist last February at Brussels Airport and some of the stolen diamonds have been recovered, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor's office said Wednesday. Police arrested 24 people Tuesday in Belgium, eight in Switzerland, and one in France, said Jean-Marc Meilleur, the office's spokesman. Police in Belgium raided about 40 houses in Brussels on Wednesday. Authorities discovered some of the stolen diamonds in Switzerland, and money in Belgium, Switzerland and France, Meilleur said.

"(CNN) -- The once-powerful Hurricane Odile weakened to a tropical storm as it worked its way across the Baja California peninsula early Tuesday. Still packing 65 mph winds, the storm lashed the region with torrential rains and the potential for flash flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. Rainfall amounts of 6-12 inches are forecast, with isolated amounts of up to 18 inches. Odile left a mess in its wake -- snapped palm trees, washed out roads and tapped tourists trapped at Mexican resorts. The storm left stunned residents and tourists in its wake. Sarah McKinney, who was in Cabo San Lucas on maternity leave from her job in Arkansas when the then-Category 3 storm hit with 125 mph winds Sunday night, tweeted photos of the wreckage Monday: the collapsed roof of a restaurant, a shuttle van flipped over, a resort's swimming pool pushed into the ocean. Every car she walked by after the storm had broken windows, she wrote. The normally pristine marina in the idyllic resort town was littered with debris. ""2 days ago we walked along the marina happy with not a care in the world,"" she said. ""Today I'm shocked and saddened."" The powerful storm caused severe damage at the airport in Los Cabos, Mexico's national director of civil protection said, according to CNN affiliate FOROtv. Early Tuesday the storm was about 25 miles (40 km) west-northwest of Santa Rosalina, Mexico, packing winds of 65 mph (100 kph) as it headed northwest. It was expected to continue to weaken, becoming a tropical depression on Wednesday, forecasters said. On Sunday, gales from Odile whipped torrents of rain ashore, chasing visitors in popular tourist destinations into close quarters. Streets in Cabo San Lucas were drenched. Palm trees were knocked over, and outdoor markets were trashed. Raul Frias, from Mexico City, was at Club Regina in Cabo when he tweeted that he felt a ""great vibration"" in a shelter and that something ""big was coming down."" McKinney and her newborn daughter, Madison, had already evacuated out of harm's way from their first hotel to a second one. But even there, the room roared like a wind tunnel as Odile passed over. At least 15,000 tourists were sharing McKinney's experience in Cabo, Mexican civil defense official Luis Felipe Puente said. She piled up her belongings in the bathtub to protect them from the water seeping through the door to her room. She dammed it up with a mattress, but it still came in about an inch deep. ""I've cleared the beds and linen closets and have my daughter and I held up in the bathroom,"" she told CNN. Then the winds subsided. Madison fell asleep. ""The pressure was horrific, but now it is eerily calm -- just how people describe when the eye passes over,"" she said. But then the winds smacked the hotel again, and McKinney headed back into the bathroom. ""The backhalf is definitely worse,"" she posted to Twitter. ""More debris and stronger winds and rain. Bedroom is getting soaked from water seeping in."" Odile was earlier predicted to bring possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said Sunday. Ports and beaches have been closed, and school classes and celebrations for Mexico's Independence Day were canceled in Baja California Sur state. Independence Day is Tuesday.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Major League Baseball season begins Thursday and Opening Day will be full of sights, sounds, smells ... and stains. Fans love to watch the cat-and-mouse game between the pitcher and hitter or the wonderful defense dance of a 6-4-3 double play. Still others watch the players get dirty with ground-in dirt and grass stains and wonder, ""How do they get those uniforms looking so brand new for the next day?"" To answer this tough question, I went to the people who would know best: ""clubbies."" A clubbie is the nickname for the guys who work in the clubhouses. They're in charge of things like making sure the players' gear is ready to use and that the uniforms look good for the next game. ""The process used to be just spraying some kind of a detergent right directly onto the fabric itself and scrubbing the heck out of it and causing it to look like some kind of a fur or something,"" said Mitch Poole, clubhouse manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers. ""It was very labor intensive, too."" I asked Poole whose uniform they dreaded most? Who is the dirtiest guy on the team? ""We don't like to talk about it, but his initials are James Loney,"" laughed Poole. ""He's hard to figure out."" ""We have to put that tape that police put around dead bodies around his laundry,"" he joked. I searched out first baseman Loney and found him on the way to the batting cage for a little pregame batting practice. I felt a little bit like a stoolie when I told him what Poole said about him: that he's the dirtiest guy on the team. ""Probably,"" Loney said proudly. ""I gotta get dirty, you know, playing defense over there, getting on the bases. There are guys who give false hustle and they got false dirt,"" he said. He explained that false hustle and false dirt happen when a player who is stretching gets a little dirt on his uniform and then acts like he got that stain from a hustle play. ""But I'm legit,"" Loney said. So how do you get a uniform like James Loney's clean? First, it's a matter of understanding baseball-specific stains. They are called nature stains: grass, ground-in dirt, blood and sweat. Grass stains are probably the toughest. Grass contains a green dye called chlorophyll. So, in fact, the stain from grass is actually a chlorophyll stain. If you combine that with ground-in dirt or red clay, which is used a lot in infields, you have one nasty stain. The detergents and soaps that break up the surface tension of the water are called surfactants. They allow the detergent to quickly penetrate the cloth. Then the agitation of the machine helps to emulsify, or surround, the dirt so it won't go back into the clothes. Much of this depends on the electrical charges in the water and the detergent. But if the stains don't come completely out, you have to resort to using Poole's ancient pretreat, brush and flush method. ""We did it that way for, shoot, 24 years at least,"" Poole said. Then, during a road trip to Phoenix about four years ago, Poole was talking with the clubhouse manager from the Arizona Diamondbacks and discovered the team used a new product, ""Slide Out."" It's an industrial stain remover specifically made for Major League Baseball by Perry Best and his partner, chemist Mark Simmons. The two men were in the cleaning business and heard how clubs used all different types of pretreatments and other products to get the uniforms clean. So they formed their own company, Brody Chemical, and set out to develop a better cleaning product. Poole said what they came up with, Slide Out, is to him a miracle product. ""It's a two-part process"" Poole said. ""Slide Out one -- a real dark purplish-brown liquid that goes on and it permeates into your fabric. And when you do it you think you're crazy because there is no way this is going to come out because I just made a big mess,"" he said. ""Then there's Slide Out No. 2, which is a clear liquid that when it goes right onto the fabric and the chemical it turns it pretty much white. It takes everything out. It takes all the dirt, all the soil, all the metals that are in there and just pulls it right out."" Best would not say what the secret ingredient might be, if there is one, but he did say the product would be available for consumers soon. So, mom and dad can look forward to having their kids' uniforms looking major-league clean every game.","Clubbies get ready for Thursday's Opening Day in baseball by cleaning uniforms .

"(CNN) -- Today, former Senate candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina announced a new initiative called the Unlocking Potential (UP) Project, which will organize conservative and Republican women in key states to educate and turn out voters. According to Fiorina, the UP Project will engage women at the grassroots level to help conservatives close the gender and technology gap. It will utilize cutting-edge technology and techniques to target, persuade and turn out female voters in six key states with competitive 2014 Senate races: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Virginia. This morning, I spoke with Fiorina about the effort and whether or not she has any future plans to run for office. S.E. Cupp: Is this a direct response to the Democrats' ""War on Women"" campaign strategy? Carly Fiorina: Yes, exactly. And the idea really came to me when I spoke at CPAC earlier this year. In my speech, I took on the ""War on Women"" directly, and the response was overwhelming. I heard from so many women saying this is what they needed. It can help deliver their messages and provide resources to get them mobilized. Cupp: It sounds like you're talking about dispatching an army of women to go door-to-door. I can't decide if that's a retro approach or a modern one. Fiorina: Well, I think one of the things that we learned in both the Obama campaign and the tea party movement -- so, truly polar opposites -- is that they engaged people on the ground in a very personal manner, with personal outreach. And that's what works. And it particularly works with women. They are persuaded by other women they know. Cupp: So, no parachuting in at the last minute, running an ad, and expecting women to turn out? Fiorina: No. All the data says that people are most persuaded by people they know. We are going to engage people in the communities where they live and work, train them where they are, and measure the results so we know what's working. That matters a lot. Cupp: So is it old-fashioned grass roots campaigning? Fiorina: Well, it's modern in that we're using technology to train our messengers and broaden our messages. But the politics of personal relationships still matters the most. Cupp: So Democrats will merely say, ""Candidate X opposes the Paycheck Fairness Act. Candidate X is against women."" It won't matter, by the way, if Candidate X is a woman herself. How should conservatives combat this? Fiorina: I think in some cases we just have to take on the facts. There are plenty of laws in place today that a woman can look to if she's truly discriminated against at work, where she's actually earning less for the same job as her male counterpart. So the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- these are tokens. They're gestures. They don't truly help women advance. We can't avoid the factual arguments, because they're on our side. Cupp: Are women single-issue voters? Fiorina: Absolutely not. Of course, there are some people -- men and women -- who truly vote on single issues. But they are not a majority, and certainly not a majority of women. Women make up 53% of the vote, and their views are as broad and diverse as are men's. Most women care about jobs and the economy, and the polls bear this out. And you know, even when the issue is life and choice, most women think that abortion after five months is egregious. Cupp: So what hasn't the GOP been doing right to target women voters? Fiorina: It's not a question of doing things wrong. It's a question of leaving things out. First, all of the ads that run are very helpful, but they're not as helpful as an effective grassroots plan. Sometimes we talk at a high level about policies and principles, but we need to bring it down to a personal level. We talk a lot about less taxes and less regulation -- as principles. But if you're a single mom with two kids and you're trying to open a hair dressing shop, it's going to take you over a year to deal with all the regulations to do that, and you have a tax code that's thousands of pages long. You might get discouraged. We're destroying more businesses than we're creating in this country. Cupp: Do Republican male candidates need ""sensitivity training""? Fiorina: (Laughs) Sometimes men know these are sensitive, hot-button issues and so they're afraid to deal with them. And some, not many, really do put their foot in their mouth. It's not that women don't listen to men. They do. But they also listen to other women. So it's less about who's doing something wrong and more about what's missing. We need to be more empathetic and less judgmental. We need to be more optimistic. Cupp: Do Republicans need to nominate a woman to defeat Hillary? Fiorina: I don't want to say that necessarily. If a woman emerges, that's terrific. But we can't let this ridiculous charge stand. We just can't. We have to deal with it head on for 2014, never mind 2016. Cupp: Any plans to run again yourself? Fiorina: You never know! I never close off any possibility in life. And when people encourage you to do it you have to think about it. But right now I'm focused on the UP Project and getting candidates elected for 2014.","S.E. Cupp interviews former Senate candidate Carly Fiorina about her new initiative .

"(CNN) -- In the blink of an eye, Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States, soaring in recent days to a market value of $18.2 billion. That's bigger than Hertz and Avis combined. But is the Uber story really as good as it seems? Taxicab drivers clogging the streets of Europe this past week, protesting against Uber, are only part of the challenge. Far more dangerous could be an emerging pattern of not paying sufficient respect to customers. Companies like Apple, Zappos, FedEx and Amazon are passionately committed to building a love affair with consumers as the center of their universe. In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul. Still, the business model is brilliant, the growth eye-popping and the initial Uber experience is generally excellent. In big cities like New York, on a rainy night, when cabs are always full, finding an Uber car quickly through your iPhone can be a godsend, even though you may have to pay a ""surge price"" at a multiple of twice or even more of the regular price. This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption, blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that don't always serve the interests of consumers. So what are the dangers? Lack of transparency may be one. Consumers usually want a company to be proactive about explaining what they do and how that can affect their lives, especially when physical safety is at stake. Uber puts most of the meaningful detail on what service it actually provides into its Terms & Conditions, which most people don't read when they download the app. According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service. It's a passenger procurement service for private car drivers. The car drivers are Uber's actual customers. Lack of accountability may be another danger. The entire risk of using the service is on the passenger. You are warned that you could be exposed to situations that are ""potentially dangerous, offensive, harmful to minors or unsafe"". Surprisingly, Uber does not claim to ""assess the suitability, legality or ability"" of any third party providing services procured through Uber, and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted. Does all this mean you may have a hard time suing the company if your driver is negligent and you get hurt? Lane Kasselman, Uber's spokesman, didn't directly address this question of liability when I asked him about it in an email, but points to company attention to passenger safety, noting Uber is ""the first to ensure end-to-end insurance coverage for ridesharing."" Privacy is also a concern for consumers. As we saw with the fallout from the Target data security breach (which included the CEOs resignation), people expect a company to protect their privacy. I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app. To me this raises further concerns: what are Uber's rating criteria for passengers, what happens to the data , how can I see the data on me, what's the dispute process if I disagree? Uber's Kasselman answered by writing ""Rider ratings are available easily by visiting t.uber.com/support or just by asking your driver."" Sounds fair enough, but on their support site I was asked to submit an email request for my passenger rating and wait for a response. (I did receive it Monday afternoon.) And, again, I may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating. Uber's blog says it is ""exploring ways to show the rider's rating in the next generation of the app"". In addition to the security of corporate data, there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how Uber protects riders from unauthorized breaches. When asked about this in an email, Kasselman, responded: ""Uber driver partners do not have access to any personal information through the platform, including credit card data. We use state-of-the-art anonymization technology, meaning the driver doesn't keep a record of the rider's phone number. Drivers and riders are able to connect either by calling or texting, with the anonymization described above, in place."" From a logical standpoint, this makes sense, but from a brand standpoint they have yet to tell me that protecting my safety and privacy is crucial. And then there's change. Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber. People know that innovative companies create constructive chaos that usually benefits consumers. But disruptive companies can also be seen as dangerous. For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad. Despite the surge in rider sign-ups during the European taxi driver protests last week, Uber's challenge will be answering the same questions raised here, as more and more new people come online to use its platform. But the taxi driver action also creates the perfect context for Uber to explain why shaking up the regulatory environment -- and the ensuing mess -- is a good thing for both consumer and regulator. If I were advising Uber on how to best achieve revenues that would justify its $18 billion valuation, I'd focus on two things. First, get very sharp about what you stand for and start building bridges with consumers that go beyond the functional role of delivering things from point A to B. Rise above the kitten delivery stunts and bull-in-a-china-shop attitude to establish the value of your company in consumers' lives. That suggests being more transparent, protective, inclusive and explanatory about your business and the impact of your actions on their safety, privacy and overall riding experience. Second, turn the negative fallout from disruption -- from forcing Uber's model on municipalities and shaking up the status quo -- into a positive global movement. Explain to the entire ecosystem of drivers, riders, regulators, regulated, investors and employees the value and benefit of the turmoil Uber brings when it rolls out in new markets. Investors have spoken, and they're all in for Uber. But the jury may still be out with consumers. I happen to love Uber. But if Uber doesn't seize this moment to build a valuable, trusted position in my life, and move beyond the emerging dangers, I will become a consumer who is confused about what it stands for. This requires Uber to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers. It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers, not its business model. Otherwise, down the road, a competitor might more easily turn my head: one that delivers exactly what they promise me.","Cab drivers in London protested the mobile cab app Uber, tying up traffic .

"(CNN)  -- More than 200,000 children were spanked or paddled in U.S. schools during the past school year, human rights groups reported Wednesday. Schools in 21 states can use corporal punishment. ""Every public school needs effective methods of discipline, but beating kids teaches violence, and it doesn't stop bad behavior,"" wrote Alice Farmer, the author of a joint report from Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Corporal punishment discourages learning, fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it."" Corporal punishment in schools remains legal in 21 U.S. states and is used frequently in 13: Missouri, Kentucky, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida, according to data received from the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education and cited in the report. The highest percentage of students receiving corporal punishment was in Mississippi, with 7.5 percent of students. The highest number was in Texas, with 48,197 students. ""When you talk to local school officials, they point to the fact that it's quick and it's effective -- and that's true,"" Farmer said. ""It doesn't take much time to administer corporal punishment, and you don't have to hire someone to run a detention or an after-school program."" But she said, ""We need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong."" In addition, corporal punishment can be linked to poverty and lack of resources. For instance, the report said, ""Teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics."" Overall, 223,190 students received corporal punishment in 2006-07, according to the Department of Education statistics. That number is down from 342,038 students in 2000-01 as more and more districts abolished corporal punishment.  Watch how one Texas family feels about corporal punishment » . The punishment is disproportionately applied to black students, according to the organizations. During the 2006-07 school year, for instance, black students made up 17.1 percent of the nationwide student population but 35.6 percent of those paddled at schools. Black girls were paddled at twice the rate of their white counterparts in the 13 states using corporal punishment most frequently. And although boys are punished more often than girls, the report found that African-American students in general are 1.4 times more likely to receive corporal punishment. In addition, special education students with mental or physical disabilities were more likely to receive corporal punishment, according to the ACLU and Human Rights Watch. Evangelical leader James Dobson's influential Focus on the Family group is among those stopping short of calling for a full ban on paddling in schools. ""Corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels, and I do not recommend its application,"" Dobson said on the organization's Web site. ""It can be useful for elementary students, especially with amateur clowns (as opposed to hard-core troublemakers). For this reason, I am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word. We're now down to a precious few. Let's not go any further in that direction."" Andrea Cancellare said her then-13-year-old son was paddled -- or ""swatted"" -- three years ago for flicking rubber bands in class, despite the fact she had written a letter directing school officials in Alpine, Texas, not to use corporal punishment against him. School officials told her they could not find the letter when she complained. When she approached the principal and superintendent, Cancellare said, they told her that ""most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment. It gets the kids back in class. It doesn't disrupt instruction. It's like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems."" Alpine Independent School District Superintendent Jose Cervantes said that both the principal and superintendent have taken other jobs, but for the past several years, the district has had a clear policy allowing parents to sign a waiver form and opt out of corporal punishment. ""It works on some, and it doesn't work on others,"" Cervantes said. ""If you're one of the individuals that it does work on, yes, it will become a deterrent."" Cancellare disagrees. ""I don't think it's the school's place to make decisions like that,"" she said. ""I'm not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either, but I feel like if somebody makes that decision, it should be the parent."" Most states typically leave it up to individual districts whether to use corporal punishment, and some of the nation's largest school districts -- among them Houston and Dallas, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Atlanta, Georgia; and Mobile County, Alabama -- have banned the practice, according to the report.

"Watch the full interview with Ted Nugent Wednesday. ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (live simulcast), 1200 GMT, and 2000 GMT and HKT. CNN -- ""Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead,"" Ted Nugent tells CNN's Piers Morgan. ""Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called gun-free zones, we're going to beat you. We're going to vote you out of office or suck on my machine gun."" The rocker and gun rights activist known for hits like ""Cat Scratch Fever"" and ""Stranglehold"" and nicknamed the ""Motor City Madman"" gives his unique take on firearms, America, and more on Wednesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" When Morgan pointed out that 80 people a day die from gunshot wounds in America, Nugent argued that ""78 of those 80 are let out of their cages by corrupt judges and prosecutors who know the recidivism is out of control, know that they'll commit the crimes again, and they let them walk through plea bargaining, early release, and programs. Kiss my ass. Where you have the most armed citizens in America, you have the lowest violent crime rate. Where you have the worst gun control, you have the highest crime rate."" Nugent, a strong proponent of the Second Amendment -- the right to keep and bear arms -- told Morgan, ""More guns equals less crime. Period."" Nugent went on to point out that legally owned guns in the U.S. ""are used millions of times a year to save innocent lives."" ""I surround myself with positive, productive people of good will and decency,"" Nugent told Morgan. ""So my view of America right now is so beautiful I can hardly stand myself."" ""You know what I think about America?"" Nugent continued. ""Unlimited generosity -- people traveling thousands of miles to help people they don't even know. That's the glowing, unstoppable good."" Nugent went on to explain that what he doesn't like about America is ""what is being celebrated in politics where instead of being the best that you can be, we seem to be engineering more and more safety nets which creates, encourages, and rewards an uncaring disconnect."" Nugent uses the welfare system as an example of that safety net, telling Morgan ""welfare isn't just about helping the needy anymore. Welfare is now about rewarding people who take advantage of the corruption and abuse of that condition."" Nugent pointed out that he is particularly devoted to charities which benefit military heroes. ""I got guys with no legs that went into that war on terror hell storm knowing that they would probably not come out without any legs or arms and maybe in a flag-draped coffin,"" said Nugent. ""But they went anyway because that's the warrior spirit that they have. And they're still waiting for their prosthetics. They're still waiting for the special wheelchair. But maybe there's some child rapist in prison who's getting a new liver transplant this week. That's the corruption and the abuse."" ""You're very, very pro the troops and I get that,"" Morgan told Nugent. ""But you, yourself, I mean, you dodged the draft."" Nugent replied that he was happy to clear up the matter for ""the ten millionth time,"" stating ""I did not dodge the draft. I was 17 and I was a clueless idiot."" Nugent went on to explain that he was enrolled in a community college at the time and had a 1-Y deferment. 1-Y classification -- which has since been eliminated -- was given to men deemed qualified for military service only in times of national emergency. 1-Y deferment was abolished in 1971. ""Did I register? I registered. Did I volunteer? No. Should I have? Yes."" When Morgan asked if the Ted Nugent of today would serve his country in Vietnam, Nugent said he would, telling the CNN host ""There is no nobler sacrifice, none. But you have to be wise enough, knowledgeable enough to make such a noble decision. And I was incapable of both at that age. Nugent told Morgan that he holds so many benefits for American troops not out of guilt, but ""because I've learned that freedom is not free and I found it -- the reason the whole world sucks and America sucks less is because the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights outlines an experiment where freedom rules the day of individuality and that that can only be secured by crushing those enemies that would take it away."" ""So those warriors that put themselves in the face of that evil enemy,"" continued Nugent, ""and anybody who would take away our individual rights and individual freedoms, they're the enemy. They need to be killed. And the guys that went over and did that, they had paid the ultimate sacrifice."" Nugent went on to suggest that more Americans ""do what the Tea Party is doing. Get our heads out of our ass and get involved. This experiment self-government demands that we all participate."" Nugent expressed his deep admiration for Sarah Palin, saying that the former Alaska governor represents a ""great woman, perfect American."" Nugent called the former vice presidential candidate an ""ass kicker"" who ""got involved as just a citizen"" and ""became mayor because she voiced concerns that were supported by the majority of her neighbors."" Nugent went on to say that he liked Alaska so much because that state had Palin ""taking care of business, fixing things, getting rid of wasteful taxes and demanding accountability."" When Morgan asked Nugent what defines a proper American, Nugent said, ""Start with a positive spirit, really a Herculean work ethnic -- not just a work ethic but one that drives. If you met all my family and all my friends, my band, my team, my management, everybody, they get up early, they kick ass all day long, they cover every detail, they wallpaper, carpet, get the job done and then, boom! We go to bed later at night. And we set the alarm and we get up and start over again."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Fancy gadgets that can be used to jam cell phone signals are illegal and potentially dangerous, experts say. So, why was Google lighting up Monday with people searching for them? You can thank a guy in Philadelphia who got fed up with folks yakking during his daily bus ride and a local news reporter who happens to ride the same bus. Days after the story broke on Friday, the apparently fresh interest in the devices, which can be had online for anywhere from less than $40 to more than $1,000, is cause for concern among some security experts. ""The general public doesn't realize what they're jamming if they were to start using these things,"" said Richard Mislan, an assistant professor of computer and information technology at Purdue University who specializes in cyberforensics. ""What's not obvious is all the wireless connectivity systems that are in the background and maintaining data communications in our daily lives."" Last week, Philadelphia TV station NBC10 reported on a man who admitted to using a cell-phone jammer during his bus commute to shut down fellow passengers when they were talking loudly. ""I guess I'm taking the law into my own hands, and quite frankly, I'm proud of it,"" said the man, who the station identified only as ""Eric."" He called people using their phones on public buses irritating and rude. ""A lot of people are extremely loud, no sense of, just, privacy or anything,"" said ""Eric,"" who was first noticed by a writer for the station. ""When it becomes a bother, that's when I screw on the antenna and flip the switch."" The story spread. And, apparently, piqued people's interest. Throughout the weekend, and as recently as Monday afternoon, ""cell phone jammer"" was one of the top 10 searches on Google Trends, cropping up between searches for Lindsay Lohan's ""Saturday Night Live"" performance and news about the Super Tuesday primaries. The legality of the jammers varies from country to country. In the United States, it is generally illegal to sell, own or use one without the government's permission. The devices are offered for sale on a handful of websites. Mislan, a former communications electronic warfare officer in the U.S. Army, said law enforcement has ""very specific worries"" about how cell-phone jammers could be used by criminals. But even someone looking to do no more than hush an annoying neighbor on the bus could do some harm, he said. For example, in the Philadelphia case, the jammer could have cut off the bus driver's communication with a dispatcher who was trying to communicate emergency or traffic information. And that's not to mention other folks in the area (aside from the offensive loud talkers) who may have missed potentially important phone calls. ""Who is he to play god with our cellphones?"" Mislan said. Jammers work in much the same way online denial-of-service attacks on websites do -- transmitting a signal on the same frequency as mobile phone calls in the area. ""In layman's terms, they basically just interrupt the signals in the area,"" Mislan said. ""They are a louder signal, if you will, than anything else in the area. As a phone tries to connect to a tower, it can't because there's this other noise, if you will, in the way."" Under federal law, illegally using a jammer can result in jail time and fines up to $16,000. So, if they're illegal and potentially harmful, why is it so easy to find a jammer online? ""It's the Internet. I can buy anything I want, anywhere at any time,"" Mislan said. ""Unfortunately, it's all about the dollar.""","Philadelphia bus rider spurs interest in cell phone jammers .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft's search engine Bing is copying results from Google, the dominant search engine on the internet, has claimed. Suspicious of their new rival, Google engineers set up random results on their site for a series of unlikely search terms, such as ""hiybbprqag."" (Google arranged for the nonsense word to point to a Los Angeles theater seating plan on its search engine.) ""Within a couple weeks of starting this experiment, our inserted results started appearing in Bing,"" Google said in a statement on its official blog Tuesday. Google said it welcomed honest competition, but sneered at Bing's ""recycled search results from a competitor."" Bing did not deny that it took Google into account when producing its own search results, but suggested they were only one factor among many. They also accused Google in turn of a ""spy-novelesque stunt"" that would only affect very unusual search terms. ""We use over 1,000 different signals and features in our ranking algorithm,"" Bing vice president Harry Shum said Tuesday, referring to the mathematical code that search engines use to choose their results. Each company develops its own search algorithms, and the quality of the results depends on them, making them the key to a search engine's effectiveness. Bing gets ""a small piece"" of the data for its algorithm ""from some of our customers, who opt-in to sharing anonymous data as they navigate the web in order to help us improve the experience for all users,"" Shum said, saying many internet companies used ""collective intelligence"" gathered online the same way. He shrugged off Google's sting as ""a creative tactic by a competitor, and we'll take it as a back-handed compliment."" Google had more than 70% of the U.S. search engine market as of the end of August, when it started running its sting, according to Experian Hitwise, which monitors web traffic.

"Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- On a dusty day in the northern-most Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, 40-year-old Jasim Ali wrestles playfully with his four-legged friend Teymour over a chew toy. But Teymour is not a dog -- he's a fully-grown African lion. ""There is a special language, I can say, between him and I,"" said Ali. Ali rescued Teymour from a farm where, he says, he was a neglected pet. ""I treated him differently than how he had been treated before. So, a love story began between us. He would only eat if he saw me there. If I wasn't there, you would feel he was upset. He would wait for me."" With an African lion, love can be tough. Ali said he's been bitten several times -- always during play --- and although he trusts Teymour implicitly, he always treats him with caution and respect. Ali's main concern during playtime is that one of Teymour's claws may accidentally come out. ""He could tear my flesh,"" he said. Ali manages the Ras Al Khaimah Wildlife Park, set up a few years ago under the patronage of Sheikh Taleb bin Saqr Al Qasimi, one of the Ras Al Khaimah's royals. He has been adopting neglected and mistreated animals for more than 15 years. Many of those animals, including Teymour, are endangered or exotic, and were initially bought on the black market. Owning an endangered animal as a pet is illegal in the United Arab Emirates, a signatory of the Convention on the Illegal Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). However, the trade in endangered wildlife remains a problem in the Gulf, where owning expensive exotic pets, especially big cats, is the ultimate status symbol. A rare white lion sells for around $50,000 on the black market, Abu Dhabi Wildlife Center. None of the pet owners we approached would speak on the record about illegally purchasing exotic animals, but many amateur videos uploaded online attest to their popularity among young men in the Gulf. In one YouTube clip that was widely viewed in the region, a man frightens his friend by chasing him around the living room with a chained lioness. Another clip shows a group of men walking a cheetah on a leash in an indoor location. There's even a man trying to ride a fully grown lion. It is all about bragging rights for the men buying these animals, says Ali. ""If someone buys a very expensive animal, he is boasting that he has enough money to get anything he wants,"" he said. ""If he has a tamed wild animal like a lion, he is trying to show off that he is brave. But this is not courage; this is animal rights abuse."" It has largely fallen on private individuals like Ali, backed by the government, to care for neglected illegally obtained animals. More than 200 illegal animals in the United Arab Emirates were confiscated alive by the authorities in 2010, according to CITES. Most big cats are sent to the Abu Dhabi Wildlife Center, which is privately funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahayan, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family. The large cages harbor a staggering variety of rare animals -- white lions, white tigers, black jaguars, cheetahs, baboons and wolves -- to name a few. Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi foodies ditch fast food for fine dining . Ayesha Kelaif shoulders the burden of smaller animals. The the petite mother of four cares for almost 300 animals as varied as iguanas, alpacas, foxes, monkeys and pheasants in her residential villa that doubles up as the Dubai Animal Rescue Center. All the animals were abandoned or rescued and some are exotic and endangered. Her closest friend, an endangered South American macaw named Rio, was abandoned in a cardboard box in a parking lot. Rio sits perched on her shoulder throughout the interview, pecking at the microphone. Relying on help from volunteers, Kelaif spends most of her income taking care of the animals. The recently widowed government employee spends a hefty $10,000 per month to cover everything from veterinary costs to electricity for 19 air-conditioning units for the animal cages. ""We don't save anything. I don't have any retirement fund; it's all for the animals,"" said Kelaif. She added that she carries financial burden because the reward is priceless. ""The passion and the love that you get from (the animals) is amazing and if there's anything I can do to help animals you can't put a price on it."" Recently granted land by the Dubai government, Kelaif cannot afford to build the infrastructure for the rescue center that she hopes will one day be her legacy. Her passion for animals goes back to her childhood. Both her parents died of cancer when she was nine and her siblings were split up. Kelaif says animals helped her cope. Also on Inside the Middle East: How to rebel, Saudi style . ""I got so much love from these guys, they used to make me so happy, I used to just go sit in the alleyways and just feed a dog or touch a cat and I used to be so happy,"" she said. Kelaif said people buy exotic animals without understanding the unique needs they have and the level of responsibility involved. People who buy baby lion and tiger cubs can no longer take care of them when they get larger and start showing violent tendencies. It's not just locals -- many expatriate families leave their pets behind when the leave the country. Both Kelaif and Ali realize they are in a legal gray area when it comes to the exotic animals they shelter. Any endangered animal needs appropriate paperwork from CITES. Animals that have been smuggled into the country, even if rescued, technically remain illegal by international standards despite having permissions from local authorities. But these animal lovers say paperwork will not stop them from doing the right thing. Ali said he has reached out to animal rights groups and wants their help setting up a wildlife reserve in Ras Al Khaimah, since the animals' legal limbo makes repatriation difficult. He says he is surprised that recent media attention, instead of bringing him assistance, has brought him criticism from some. ""My wish is that, instead of criticizing me, these people would offer me help. I haven't done anything wrong; I've protected these animals and created a sanctuary for them. I'm trying to get them to appropriate wildlife reserves.""","For many young men in the Gulf, keeping an exotic pet -- a lion, tiger or cheetah -- is an ultimate status symbol .

"Washington (CNN) -- A year after Mexican trucks were first permitted to conduct long-haul operations in the United States, so few trucks have signed up for the pilot program that government auditors fear they won't be able to complete a congressionally mandated study of the program's safety. Only six Mexican trucking companies -- most with a single truck -- are participating in the program thus far, with some 24 other companies under review. As of July, Mexican trucks had made fewer than 100 long-haul trips into the United States. Unless the number of participating trucks increases significantly, the Department of Transportation's inspector general says, the department will not have the data needed to determine whether Mexican trucks present a danger on U.S. highways. The low participation seemingly belies critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, who feared the agreement would unloose thousands of Mexican trucks on U.S. highways, displacing American trucks and endangering American lives. But opponents of the program attribute the low participation to other factors, including bureaucratic roadblocks to participation, the trade imbalance and a reluctance by Mexican companies to join a temporary program. The opponents say they remain fearful that the program ultimately will hurt American trucking jobs. Further, they said the inspector general's report confirms fears the U.S. government will not hold Mexican trucks and truckers to the same safety standards as their U.S. counterparts. ""The Inspector Generals report pretty much has confirmed everything that our organization has contended since Day One,"" said Todd Spencer of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has applied a ""double standard"" to Mexican operations, he said. The report says FMCSA auditors allowed Mexican drivers to respond in Spanish to test questions, and that some Mexican drivers were unable to explain the meaning of signs labeled ""Railroad Crossing"" and ""Wrong Way."" And one FMCSA auditor did not investigate why one Mexican trucking company submitted a report containing incomplete drug and alcohol tests. The FMCSA said it has taken steps to address problems uncovered by the inspector general. It now requires English responses to questions about traffic and road signs, and requires testing of all 21 signs used in the test. ""Safety is our first priority, and we will continue to look for ways to improve our program,"" the agency said in a statement to CNN. ""The agency has already incorporated several important safety recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General."" As for program participation, the FMCSA said it is working with the Mexican government to provide program information to other trucking companies. ""The agency recognizes that statistically valid results will require much broader participation,"" the FMCSA told the inspector general. Under the program, approved Mexican trucks are allowed to carry Mexican goods throughout the United States -- well beyond the commercial zone in border states where they previously had to off-load. Before receiving permanent long-haul authority, participants must go through a series of inspections and safety evaluations. The program is not open to hazardous material trucks or passenger carriers. To date, the Department of Transportation says, none of the participating Mexican carriers has had a reportable crash in the United States since joining the program. Supporters of the program blame the low participation on the temporary nature of the program. ""It's a bit of a 'Catch-22' because the Mexican trucks have been yanked around so long they are hesitant to spend the money on a pilot program,"" said James Clark, director of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce's Mexico Business Center. ""I think they are concerned about making an investment in something that might be temporary."" ""Many of them say, 'To hell with it. We have enough business in our own country,'"" Clark said. Clark dismissed concerns that Mexican trucks were less safe than U.S. rigs. ""I think it's a jobs concern disguised as a safety issue,"" he said. ""I mean they can frighten people by saying, 'Oh my God, They'll have these old ramshackled trucks (on U.S. roads).'"" But, he said, that trucks ""have to pass the exact same safety standards"" as U.S. trucks, and the drivers must be equally qualified.

"London, England (CNN) -- The controversy known as ""climategate"" erupted in November 2009 with the publication of more than 1,000 e-mails to and from scientists at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia in eastern England. The e-mails, dating back to 1996, were published on Web sites run by climate change skeptics who claim efforts had been made to manipulate data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. The head of the CRU, Professor Phil Jones, stepped down from his post while reviews were conducted. It was announced Wednesday that Jones would return to the role of Director of Research at the university after an independent review cleared the CRU of manipulating or falsifying data. ""We concluded that these behaviors did not damage our judgment of the integrity, the honesty, the rigor with which they had operated as scientists,"" said the review's chairman Muir Russell. In early July, an investigation by Penn State University into one of the authors of the e-mails, Professor Michael Mann, found that he had not strayed from accepted practices for ""proposing, reporting or conducting research."" Who is the CRU? The CRU is one of the world's leading research bodies on natural and human-induced climate change and has developed a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including the global temperature record used to monitor the state of the climate system. It played a key role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 -- a collaboration between the United Nations Environment Program and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) -- considered to be the most authoritative report of its kind. Since the e-mail scandal broke, the credibility of the IPCC has been brought into question. In January, the panel admitted its assessment report had wrongly stated that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. How was the climate data allegedly manipulated? In one particular e-mail, Professor Jones relates to the preparation of a figure for the WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 1999. He writes, ""I've just completed 'Mike's Nature trick' of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ... to hide the decline."" The alleged 'Climategate' e-mails . According to critics, this ""trick"" worked in the following way: when temperature readings taken from tree rings showed an apparent decline in temperatures from the 1980s to the present, the researchers added in measurements taken later by more modern instruments, which gave them the answer they wanted. What was the CRU's response? In a statement posted on the university's Web site late last year, the CRU said the use of the word ""trick"" was not intended to imply a deception. It said: ""The requirement for the WMO Statement was for up-to-date evidence showing how temperatures may have changed over the last 1,000 years. ""To produce temperature series that were completely up-to-date (i.e. through to 1999) it was necessary to combine the temperature reconstructions with the instrumental record, because the temperature reconstructions from proxy data (such as tree rings) ended many years earlier whereas the instrumental record is updated every month."" The statement went on to say the illegally obtained e-mails have been ""taken out of context and misinterpreted"" as evidence that CRU manipulated climate data to present an unrealistic picture of global warming. It added that ""this conclusion is entirely unfounded and the evidence from CRU research is entirely consistent with independent evidence assembled by various research groups around the world."" It called for an independent review to be set up, and since late 2009, the team, led by Sir Muir Russell, has been examining dozens of submissions. What impact did 'Climategate' have on the case for global warming? The e-mails appeared just weeks before the United Nations Conference on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in December 2009. At the time, many climate change experts claimed the files were stolen in an attempt to undermine the talks. ""Given the wide-ranging nature of change that is likely to be taken in hand, some naturally find it inconvenient to accept its inevitability,"" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri told reporters in the Danish capital. ""The recent incident of stealing the e-mails of scientists at the University of East Anglia shows that some would go to the extent of carrying out illegal acts, perhaps in an attempt to discredit the IPCC."" After its completion, the December Copenhagen climate conference was widely seen to have failed in its aim of agreeing a global deal on climate change. CNN's Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","In November 2009, more than 1,000 e-mails were published online .

"(CNN) -- The California man who kidnapped 16-year-old Hannah Anderson ""tortured and killed"" her mother and brother before snatching her as she left cheerleading practice, according to formerly sealed warrants that were released Wednesday. Investigators did not detail in the warrants how the torture was carried out, but they did reveal new details about how authorities believe James Lee DiMaggio carried out the killings and abduction. ""DiMaggio tortured and killed his best friend's wife and eight-year-old son. DiMaggio also shot and killed the family dog,"" according to one of the affidavits. ""After the double homicide, DiMaggio set the house on fire."" The details were revealed the same day that a preliminary autopsy showed that DiMaggio was shot at least five times by an FBI tactical agent during a confrontation in the Idaho wilderness over the weekend. That confrontation ended a massive manhunt that began in San Diego County, California, after authorities found the bodies of Hannah's mother and brother in his burned out home.

Amber alert successes: More than 650 kids rescued . As firefighters were trying to put out the blaze, they noticed flames in the home's detached garage, according to search warrant and arrest warrant affidavits dated August 6. A couple of firefighters quickly doused that fire while others focused on putting out the fire engulfing the cabin. Inside the garage, a fire captain discovered the body of Hannah's mother, 44-year-old Christina Anderson, face down in the garage, covered with a tarp.

The Ransom Center raised $30,000 in a 2010 online campaign to preserve the outfits, says Wilson, also the center's curator of film. 'Gone With the Wind' still attracts fans, cash and controversy . Memos from David O. Selznick . The exhibit traces the long, arduous process of how producer David O. Selznick adapted Mitchell's best-seller, offering up more than 300 items, including storyboards, casting call sheets, photos, scripts, screen tests, letters from fans and critics alike, audience preview cards, and, of course, memos from Selznick. The exhibit received ""generous support"" from Turner Classic Movies, which shares a parent company with CNN. The Ransom Center archives contain a voluminous collection from the producer, whose sons donated more than 5,000 document boxes of material to the research library and museum in 1980. ""That was his management style,"" Wilson says of Selznick's famous memos that detail his thinking over the three-plus years he struggled to bring the movie to the screen. ""It's good for us."" ""The Making of 'Gone With the Wind' "" covers the behind-the-scenes drama that included the search for an unknown to play Scarlett, constant script revisions, the comings and goings of directors, concerns over the authenticity of Southern accents, censorship problems, and controversy over the portrayal of African-American characters. ""Race is absolutely at the center of the film,"" says Coleman Hutchison, associate professor in the Department of English at the University of Texas who was a faculty adviser to the exhibit. ""It's really shaped how people think about the South and the memories of the Civil War and Reconstruction,"" he says, noting that it's ""outdated at best, terribly racist at its worst."" ""Its version of history is compromised,"" he adds. Opinion: How slavery haunts today's America . Controversies over race, historical accuracy . Selznick faced pressures over racial issues almost from the beginning, receiving letters from people concerned about the depiction of happy and subservient slaves. NAACP official Walter White urged the producer to name an African-American adviser to ensure the film's historical accuracy, but Selznick resisted, feeling he already had too many advisers. A blistering editorial in The Pittsburgh Courier, a prominent African-American newspaper, criticized the film's script for including the N-word, predicting it would be worse than ""The Birth of a Nation."" Facing pressure from the black press, his staff and movie censors, Selznick decided to remove ""the hate word,"" Wilson says. ""If that word had been in the film, we would be so embarrassed and offended by it that we wouldn't be discussing the film today,"" he says. Selznick also eliminated references from the movie that were in the novel regarding the Ku Klux Klan -- specifically when Scarlett gets attacked in an area known as Shantytown. In a memo to screenwriter Sidney Howard, he explained that he had ""no desire to produce any anti-Negro film."" In spite of those changes, ""Gone With the Wind"" remains racially problematic for audiences today, says Caroline Frick, another faculty adviser to the exhibit. Still, Frick says she finds it valuable to show the movie to students in her film classes at the University of Texas. When her students see the racial bigotry ""they physically recoil,"" the assistant professor says. ""It's a good reminder."" Frick, an admitted fan of the film since childhood, calls it ""a complicated movie"" that also deals with gender, class and regionalism as well as the Civil War and race. ""It brings up a little discomfort in a very beautiful Technicolor package."" Universality of Scarlett . Wilson, the exhibition curator, sees hunger, war, migration to the cities and the loss of a connection to land as themes central to the heroine's popularity at the time of the movie's first release. ""The story of the making of 'Gone With the Wind' is the story of the Depression, more than the issue of the Civil War,"" he says. ""A lot of these issues that concerned Scarlett O'Hara also concerned the public."" He says many of the letters Selznick received came from fans pleading to be cast as Scarlett, not because they wanted to be famous, but because they identified so strongly with her. ""Gone With the Wind"" is still considered the top movie moneymaker of all time when adjusted for inflation, and the novel is second in popularity only to the Bible, according to a 2014 Harris Poll. But it's unclear whether Scarlett will retain her hold over popular audiences in the 21st century. Perhaps time has taken a toll on the character the way it has with the 75-year-old dress that symbolizes her so well. The dress has ""a lot of fading and discoloration on the fabric,"" says Jill Morena, the Ransom Center's assistant curator for costumes and personal effects. Morena says it's impossible to know how the dress looked in 1939, explaining the Technicolor process altered its appearance. While it seems almost emerald green in the film, it has an olive hue in person, she says. She says it would have been too risky to touch up the color so ""we decided we weren't going to change it."" ""It's a strong visual embodiment of the tenacity of Scarlett,"" Morena says. ""It still lives in the public's imagination."" 'Gone With the Wind' actress Alicia Rhett dies at 98 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It took a U.S. former president with global celebrity status to free two American journalists from a North Korea prison. Former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore greets freed U.S. journalist Laura Ling. Laura Ling and Euna Lee arrived back in the United States Wednesday morning with former President Bill Clinton, who flew to North Korea to negotiate their release after they were sentenced to a labor camp. Iain Clayton said Wednesday that his wife, Laura, told him through a telephone conversation that the North Koreans were willing to grant the two journalists amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang. But there was no shortage of envoys ready to travel to North Korea and negotiate the women's release. Some heavyweights were turned down by the North Koreans: former Vice President Al Gore, a co-founder of the media outfit the women were working for when they were arrested, and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations whose previous missions to North Korea included negotiating the release of a detained American. Lower-level envoys such as former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and current Korea Society Chairman Donald Gregg, Sig Harrison, an expert on North Korean nukes who has traveled there several times, and Han Park, a scholar at the University of Georgia, all offered their services. Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was also closely involved in coordinating efforts with the White House and State Department to free the women. According to sources intimately involved with the efforts, Sen. John Kerry -- chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- received an official invitation to visit Pyongyang to facilitate their release and open a larger dialogue on the nuclear issue after several weeks of quiet direct diplomacy between Kerry and his aides and North Korea. In the end, it was Clinton whom North Korea wanted. Two senior Obama administration officials described on background how Clinton's mission to Pyongyang to secure the release of two U.S. journalists imprisoned by North Korea evolved. Officials said that while President Obama never spoke directly with the former president about this issue, negotiations were under way within the administration. During the weekend of July 24-25, Clinton spoke with National Security Adviser Gen. Jim Jones about his willingness to take on this mission. Clinton ultimately agreed to go on the mission but made it very clear in every communication that this was purely a humanitarian effort. Clinton also wanted to make sure, based on the due diligence of the national security team, that there was a high likelihood of success if he went. ""We were convinced this would be the result, and based on that we could advise President Clinton that his trip was going to be successful,"" one official said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Wednesday that ""we did our homework ... to make sure that if President Clinton did take this trip, that we would be able to ... win the freedom for these two."" Kelly said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also had a role in the mission, adding that ""The State Department was very involved."" More details, he said, will be released. Administration officials also said it was always made clear by Clinton and the national security team that this would be a humanitarian mission. ""We had one goal in mind, which was in the U.S. interest, which was to seek the release of these two U.S. Americans,"" one of the officials said. ""And it wasn't in any way about our disagreements with the DPRK with respect to its conduct, or with respect to our intention to vigorously enforce resolutions and to vigorously seek the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" Clinton and his team engaged in a 75-minute meeting with President Kim Jong Il and then had a dinner which lasted a little over two hours. ""So the total amount of time that they were in meetings or agendas with each other was about a little over three hours and 15 minutes,"" one official said. Asked if the nuclear issue at least was discussed, the official said, ""I don't have an answer to that question. I'm sure President Clinton gave President Kim his views on denuclearization and his views are well known with respect to denuclearization."" While Gore was turned down by North Korea, he was, however, actively involved in this effort from the start, speaking often with the families and the Obama administration. On Wednesday, Obama thanked the former vice president, saying he ""worked tirelessly in order to achieve a positive outcome."" Clinton's humanitarian help was not lost on Obama -- who reached out to the journalists' families on Tuesday night. ""I want to thank President Bill Clinton -- I had a chance to talk to him -- for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,"" he said at the White House. ""My hope is that the families that have been reunited can enjoy the next several days and weeks understanding that because of the efforts of President Clinton and Gore they are able to be with each other once again."" CNN's Dan Lothian, Ed Hornick and Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Former President Clinton talked with national security adviser before trip .

"New York (CNN) -- The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday endorsed an upgraded U.N. status for the Palestinian Authority, despite intense opposition from the United States and Israel. The resolution elevates their status from ""non-member observer entity"" to ""non-member observer state,"" the same category as the Vatican, which Palestinians hope will provide new leverage in their dealings with Israel. Its leaders had been working with dozens of supporting nations to develop a formal draft, enlisting the backing of European countries such as France and Spain. The vote was 138 delegates in favor of the measure, nine against and 41 abstentions, including Germany. Read more: Palestinian United Nations bid explained . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the move, which many call symbolic, represents a ""last chance to save the two-state solution."" It comes on the heels of an eight-day conflict that raged between Israel and Hamas fighters, where a series of airstrikes and rocket launches drew international attention and threatened regional stability. ""We did not come here seeking to delegitimize a state established years ago, and that is Israel; rather we came to affirm the legitimacy of the state that must now achieve its independence, and that is Palestine,"" he said. But Israel's U.N. ambassador Ron Prosor said the move largely ignores the specifics of longstanding issues, such as settlements in disputed lands, and cannot substitute for direct negotiations between Jerusalem and Ramallah. This resolution ""doesn't pursue peace,"" Prosor said, criticizing Abbas for being unable to represent the Gaza Strip, where a Hamas-controlled government presides. ""It pushes it backwards,"" he said. Izzat Al-Rashq, a member of the Hamas' political bureau, welcomed the decision but made demands reflecting Hamas' unwillingness to recognize the state of Israel. ""We need to put this in its normal context as a part of the National Strategic vision based upon the rights and national principles without compromising an ounce of soil from our Palestinian lands extending from the Ocean to the (Jordan) river,"" he posted to his Facebook page. He called for the establishment of a Palestinian state ""with Jerusalem being its capital"" on land that includes what is Israel. The effort stalled last year when it became apparent that the bid could not get the necessary support in the Security Council. Observer state status does not require Security Council approval, unlike full membership recognition. The observer status resolution needs only a majority of the U.N.'s 193 members to approve. Read more: Palestinian move at U.N. won't solve anything . The United States and Israel have remained steadfast in their opposition, saying the move will not advance the cause of Middle East peace. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said American leaders could not support a measure that circumvents direct talks and cautioned that Thursday's decision did ""not establish Palestine as a state."" Rice urged both sides to the resume direct negotiations without preconditions. ""Israel is prepared to live in peace with a Palestinian state,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday. ""But for peace to endure, Israel's security must be protected, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state and they must be prepared to end the conflict with Israel once and for all."" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev called the resolution ""political theater."" Opinion: Why U.S., Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. But Palestinian leaders have said they had the right to go to the U.N. because Israel failed to comply with agreements signed more than two decades ago. ""It's about a contract. Our contract is that in five years, we should have concluded the treaty of peace and all core issues. This did not happen, and we're talking about 20 years later. And going to the U.N. is not a unilateral step,"" Palestinian Authority chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said in September. The last round of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was in 2010. Erakat said the new status would eliminate Israeli justifications for building settlements in the disputed areas of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. But Israeli officials disagreed. ""No decision by the U.N. can break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel,"" Netanyahu said. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, however, threw his full support behind the new status for the Palestinian Authority. ""What the Palestinians moved to do today in the U.N., I think is in basic line with the strategy of a two-state solution,"" Olmert told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. The peace process is completely stalled at the moment, but Olmert said Israel must move rapidly toward a two-state solution. ""Time is running out for Israel more than for the Palestinians,"" he said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who supports a two-state solution, said Thursday's vote ""underscores the urgency of a resumption of meaningful negotiations."" ""I urge the parties to renew their commitment to a negotiated peace,"" Ban said. Meanwhile in Washington, Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak addressed his country's relations with Iran and expressed doubt about sanctions against that country. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog has said Iran is cooperating enough in a review of its nuclear programs. ""I don't believe that these kinds of sanctions will bring them to a moment of truth where they sit around a table and look at each others eyes and decide that the game is over, they can't stand it anymore, they are going to give up their nuclear intention,"" Barak said. Barak was visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who noted how the Israeli defense chief announced his retirement from political life. Panetta praised Barak's ""brilliant strategic mind"" and ""warrior heart.""

"(CNN) -- Envoys from Iran and the European Union will meet at the end of this week in Switzerland for talks on the implementation of a deal that requires Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The meeting was reported by Iranian state news agency IRNA and confirmed by a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Ashton's deputy, Helga Schmid, and Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, will take part in the meeting in Geneva, Ashton spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said. The nuclear deal struck in November between six world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to limit its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marziyeh Afkham said Tuesday that a timetable for implementation would be set after a few issues were resolved, according to IRNA. Afkham said more details on the process would be made public after the meeting between Schmid and Araqchi, the news agency said. State-run Iranian media reported last week that a deal had been reached in negotiations between Tehran and the six world powers -- the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany -- to begin implementing the agreement in late January. But U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said then that progress had been made but the implementation plan was still to be finalized. The deal has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over Tehran's nuclear program. But after initially celebrating a diplomatic success, Iran has reportedly lashed out at the United States for making public a modified version of the agreement that does not reflect Tehran's interpretation. Late last month, Iranian lawmakers drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported. The move came only days after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions. The United States and other Western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. CNN's Elise Labott and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Deputy foreign policy chiefs from Iran, EU will meet for talks this week in Geneva .

"(CNN) -- ""I guess you want to have a heart attack?"" That is the question you should ask yourself every time you put off taking a vacation. Here's the deal. Studies have shown that not taking vacations is linked to health problems. And if people skip vacations, there's a chance that they may die younger than those who don't. I think employers should be required to post warning labels in the workplace similar to those on cigarettes packs. I'd love to see a big sign in the break room that reads: ""WARNING: Working too many weeks without a vacation is going to kill you. Seriously, you are going to die from it."" We are all well aware that stress is harmful to our health. It causes problems ranging from ulcers to body aches to insomnia. Vacations are one of the major antidotes to stress. Travel: Relax, it's only a vacation . One study found that men at high risk for coronary heart disease, and who failed to take annual vacations, were 32% more susceptible to dying from a heart attack. Another study compared women who vacationed at least twice a year to those who took one every six years or less. Astoundingly, the women who did not vacation annually were almost eight times more likely to develop coronary heart disease or have a heart attack. As a nation, we are obsessed with work. Some view taking a vacation as a sign of weakness. Others who haven't vacationed in years see it as a badge of honor. And still others apologize for taking a vacation, as they feel guilty for taking time off even though they have earned it. The average American worker has 14 vacation days per year, but most only use 12 of those days. Worse than that, about 25% of Americans don't take any vacation at all. The U.S. is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not legally require workers to be provided a set number of paid vacation days. This is in stark contrast to Europe where the European Union mandates that workers be provided with 20 paid vacation days every year. Anyone wants to guess which place has higher life expectancy: U.S. or Europe? European countries win, of course. In fact, the U.S. is 28th in the world in life expectancy. If saving your life isn't enough of a reason to take a few vacations, here is another: People who take annual vacations are more productive. A 2010 study found that 35% of Americans feel better about their job and are more productive after a vacation. Vacations have been found to help us recharge -- we sleep better during them and for a period of time afterwards. And our brain responses become quicker after vacations. As difficult as it is for some to believe, working more hours does not necessarily translate to a better bottom line or higher productivity. For example, Greeks work the most in Europe -- averaging 2,017 hours per year. Yet, they are no better off as their economy is a wreck. Now take a look at Germany -- Europe's economic powerhouse. I'm sure some would guess that the Germans work longer hours. Wrong. Germans work on average 1,408 hours per year, placing them second to last among the 25 European nations in hours worked annually. They also receive on average 30 paid vacation days a year -- the most in Europe. A vacation doesn't have to be two weeks on the French Riviera. It can be a trip to the Jersey shore -- the real one, not the one with Snooki and Mike ""the Situation."" It could be a camping expedition or a few days in the mountains. Â The point is -- it could be as adventurous or low key as you want it to be. I have seen first hand the consequence of not taking regular vacations. My father -- the workaholic -- hated vacations. He refused to take them on annual basis. Sadly, he passed away some years ago after his third open heart surgery at a much younger age than his peers. There's no doubt that stress reduction -- such as yearly vacations -- could have extended his life. Travel: Readers share vacation planning tactics . So if you're thinking of skipping your vacation, it's not too late to change your mind. The summer just started. You'll feel better rested, healthier and more productive. Or, you can choose to keep working non-stop like a hamster running on a wheel that keeps going faster and faster. Until, finally, one day, you collapse, are carried off on a stretcher, and replaced by a similar looking creature. What's it going to be? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Studies show not taking vacations is associated with health problems .

"(CNN) -- The man who authorities accused of assaulting the 2-year-old son of NFL player Adrian Peterson now faces a murder charge. State prosecutors released a grand jury indictment Monday that charges Joseph Robert Patterson with second-degree murder. The new charge comes more than a week after the death of the Minnesota Vikings running back's son, who was living with his mother in South Dakota. Patterson, the 27-year-old boyfriend of the toddler's mother, is accused of recklessly causing ""serious bodily injury to the child,"" according to the indictment. He also faces charges of first-degree manslaughter, aggravated battery of an infant and abuse or cruelty to a minor. Authorities have said that the child suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse. ""Patterson will be booked under the new charges and will be arraigned in the near future,"" the Lincoln County Office of the state's attorney said in a statement Monday. Peterson returned to the field last week. In a text to a Fox Sports reporter, Peterson said he decided to play again for the same reason he participated in the NFL's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007. ""God wants good to come from it,"" he told ""NFL on FOX"" sideline reporter Laura Okmin in a text before the game Sunday. He tweeted thanks to fellow players, some of whom had taken to the social network to defend his decision to play. ""The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players,"" he tweeted after his son's death. After the game last Sunday, Peterson's teammate, tight end Kyle Rudolph, praised Peterson's determination and heart. ""I can't imagine, you know, the heavy heart that he had today, being out on the field,"" Rudolph said. ""But he spoke to us right before the game, right before he took the field and said he was going to give it his all, for all four quarters, and that's exactly what he did."" ""He said, 'I'm going to give it my all, and I expect you guys to do the same,'"" Rudolph said.

"Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN)  -- A man walks into a pawnshop in Gulfport, Mississippi. Others may bring guitars or a piece of jewelry, but this man has something special.  It's a 16th century blunderbuss from Japan. Kevin Riley, the owner of Dad's Super Pawn, gingerly turned the 500-year-old weapon over in his hands, examining the antique with an expert eye. ""Wow that's pretty cool,"" he said. Pawnshops are wonderlands of the obscure.  In Dad's there's a jersey signed by cast members of TV's ""Sopranos"" that was picked up from a rabid fan, a guitar made from a toilet seat that was sold to the store by a band member down on his luck and a script from TV's original ""Dukes of Hazzard.""  ""We paid pretty good money for it because it was unique,"" Riley said of the script. ""I honestly don't think it's a seller, it's just a conversation piece.""  There's always a lot to talk about in a pawnshop.  Every item has a story. You can tell a lot about the health of a community based on the items people are selling.    There is a glut of power tools on the shelves, speaking to a lack of new construction in Gulfport.  Hurricane Katrina, the Great Recession and now the Gulf oil disaster have battered the town's economy.  More first-time pawners are coming to the shop and they're bringing with them the mementos of better days, said Riley. ""We've been seeing a lot more high-end jewelry, one-, two-, three-carat diamonds,"" he said. ""Stuff that people bought when the economy was booming and are now having to sell."" Mississippi's middle-class have become new customers. Pawnbrokers are often portrayed in the media as fencers of stolen property, predatory lenders or simply people who prey on folks who are down on their luck. The current economy is changing these stereotypes, according to Riley.  ""The average person pawning stuff right now ... is the blue-collar guy out there working and trying to make ends meet,"" he said. ""Right now the job market is terrible and there are a lot of people not working, so in order to feed the family they've got to get some money."" The owner of the Japanese rifle said he'd been offered $4,000 for the gun. Riley politely told him that he needed to do some research before he would commit to buying it. ""Similar guns are selling for between $400 and $2,000, but I need to make sure that it's not a replica,"" said Riley. Riley said he's been successful in the pawnbroker business by being not only shrewd, but also fair with his clients, some of whom have been coming to him for years. A regular customer can expect to make slightly more on a sale or pawn then someone just walking in off the street, he said.  ""We're not in the power tool business or the musical instrument business, we're in the people business ... 99 percent of our customers are good people, they're just not money managers,"" said Riley. ""That's their biggest problem.  They don't know how to sit down with a budget because it was never taught to them.""","Gulf pawnshop reports more middle-class clients in wake of oil spill .

"(CNN) -- More than a month and a half into the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the murmurs are growing louder. What if the Boeing 777 that disappeared over the southern Indian Ocean is never found? It was a dismissible thought at first. After all, how could a jetliner carrying 239 passengers and crew simply disappear without a trace? But so much time is passing with no debris, no oil slick and no bodies. What if? 1. It will go down as one of the world's most enduring mysteries . The disappearance of Flight 370 would rank right up there with Amelia Earhart. This story has intrigued folks for generations. The swashbuckling aviatrix and pioneering woman embarked on the first around-the-world flight at the Equator in June 1937. After completing about two-thirds of the flight, she and navigator Frederick Noonan disappeared. A search never found any trace of her, Noonan or their plane. Some believe they ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea -- similar to one theory of what happened to the Malaysia Airlines plane. Then there's the Bermuda triangle. Many ships, planes and people have disappeared in this section of the Atlantic Ocean -- a ""triangle"" marked by the points of Bermuda, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. U.S. officials cite hurricanes, sudden storms, the powerful Gulf Stream and shallow Caribbean waters as reasonable explanations for the lost vessels. But so far, there's been no explanation for Flight 370's disappearance. Of course, not all mysteries last forever. It took two years for search parties to recover the black box from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, en route to Paris from Rio with 228 people aboard. Sometimes even when you know just about where something is, it's hard to find. There was no GPS and sea charts in 1912 when the RMS Titanic went down on its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic. It wasn't until 1985 that the British luxury liner was found. Seventy-three years is a long time to wait, but some answers take time. 2. Families never get the closure a tragedy deserves . If you want to see agony, look into the faces of the relatives of the 153 Chinese nationals who flew aboard the ill-fated flight. They're guests of Malaysia Airlines in a Beijing hotel while the search continues. They don't expect miracles, but they do want information. ""As time goes on we know that the odds of my son and the other relatives on the plane having survived becomes smaller and smaller,"" a grey-haired man named Wen said recently, scarcely keeping his composure. A Malaysian diplomat listened intently. ""To know that somebody is alive, you need to see them. To know that somebody is dead, you need to see the body. That's all I ask of you,"" Wen concluded, sobbing uncontrollably into a microphone. It's been a roller coaster of emotions for the families. A dearth of information from Malaysia officials and repeated delays has provoked outright anger. ""Live up to commitments! No more delays! No more lies!"" fist -waving family members said. Heartbreak compounded by disappointment will do that. Grieving also gets tougher when there's no body to bury. How do you let go if you can't say goodbye? Yet, hope still burns in the heart of Prahlad Shirsath, whose wife was on the plane. ""I can not let go of that idea, because still we have hope. And deeply I am really convinced in my heart ... that she will come back,"" he said. ""She has to come back, because so far we have not found any reason to lose that hope."" 3. False sightings will raise and dash hopes . Every few months or years, someone will come up with a new theory about how the plane disappeared -- or someone will spot what they think is debris. The fleeting moments of hope will give way to fresh anguish. Madeleine McCann's parents know this all too well. The 3-year-old vanished in June 2007 while on a family vacation in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide -- and remains a mystery 7 years later. There have been unconfirmed sightings of McCann ever since she was abducted. They bring with them varying degrees of promise. But Madeleine remains missing. ""In the beginning, it all consumes you. Everything in your life takes second place, goes on the back burner,"" Dave Holloway, the father of Natalee Holloway, told CNN last year. The Alabama teen went missing on a trip to Aruba in 2005, and her body's never been found. The Holloway case captivated the country, and even now from time to time, a new lead in the case will make headlines. ""I feel for those families who are totally clueless,"" Halloway said. ""At least we know who is responsible for our daughter's disappearance. They have no idea. At least we know."" 4. There will be big insurance payouts . There's no tally yet on just how much Malaysia Airlines will owe the relatives of the flight's victims, but it'll be a substantial figure. Some attorneys, citing their past work on plane crashes, say the total for each passenger could vary from $400,000 to $10 million. The industry norm for insurance that airliners carry on their planes totals between $2 billion and $2.5 billion per aircraft, according to aviation attorney Dan Rose of Kreindler & Kreindler. That breaks down to about $10 million per passenger. There were 239 people on flight. The numbers can add up quickly. Under an international treaty known as the Montreal Convention, the airline must pay relatives of each deceased passenger an initial sum of around $150,000 to $175,000, but that's just a starting point. Relatives of victims can also sue for further damages. The plane's manufacturer, Boeing, could be another target of lawsuits. But until the jetliner is recovered, families won't have much of a case. It's like trying to prove a murder without a body. 5. There will be changes in policy . Every disaster brings changes in policy. But when you don't even know the cause, where do you begin? U.S. regulators have already approved a new 90-day standard for pingers attached to flight recorders, so search teams have a better chance of finding them under difficult circumstances. The two-year hunt to find Air France Flight 447 was the impetus, not MH370. Locator beacons that transmit for 90 days should greatly increase the odds of finding a lost jetliner even in deep water. Flight 370 had 30-day batteries in its beacons. They were about out of juice by the time aquatic listening devices picked up their signals for a short time. Another 60 days would have helped their cause. By 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration will require all new planes to come with the 90-day capability. All older planes must have it by 2020, the FAA says. Malaysia has sent its preliminary report on Flight 370 to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation. But it hasn't released it publicly. ""It just adds fuel to the fire -- which is like a furnace now -- of disbelief, particularly in China, as to what is going on,"" said Geoffrey Thomas, managing director of AirlineRatings.com. There are so many questions. Are there better ways to track commercial aircraft? Can planes be followed better by using satellites to track their movements with transmitters that can't be shut down? Every phone has GPS. Can't we keep closer tabs on aircraft worth hundreds of millions of dollars? The U.N. aviation agency did tell CNN about a safety recommendation in the report: Malaysia said the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after the Air France disaster. But ""nothing seems to have happened,"" CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. For now, though, the focus of determined search crews and anguished families remain on finding the Malaysian jetliner that disappeared without a trace. CNN's Michael Martinez and Gergory Wallace contributed to this report .","Amelia Earhart and Bermuda triangle are other lingering mysteries .
It will be difficult for families to get closure if no bodies are found .
Billions in insurance claims will likely be paid out .

"(CNN) -- When Amazon released its Fire TV system this month, it propelled the company into the increasingly competitive marketplace of devices that stream Web content into the living room. The set-top box now competes with Apple, Google and Samsung, as well as early innovator Roku and even the gaming world's top consoles for the eyeballs of people who stream services like Netflix, Hulu and YouTube onto their televisions. These devices are relatively new innovations: Roku first announced a simple Netflix-streaming box in 2008. But in recent years, more and more people have begun using devices that harness the Internet's bountiful offerings and send them, usually via Wi-Fi, to a TV set. According to Experian, almost half of all U.S. adults and 67% of young adults now watch streamed or downloaded video at least once a week. And 7.6 million households in the United States have ""cut the cord,"" using Web streaming and downloading exclusively instead of cable, satellite or broadcast, for their television viewing, the company said in a report this week. But it's still a new concept for a lot of folks. And with so many players in the game, not to mention a new wave of ""smart TVs"" that hook up to the Web on their own, it can be hard to pick a favorite. If you own a smart TV, you may not need a separate device for streaming. But the software on many smart TVs is still clunky, and most Web-streaming gadgets offer a larger menu of apps and channels.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Back in 2010, the conservative columnist and CNN contributor David Frum was worried about what he saw in his own party. Frum, who had worked as a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, feared that Republicans would be tempted by tea party Republicans to shift far to the right to achieve short-term electoral gains that would cost the party in the long run. ""A party must champion the values of the voters it already has,"" Frum wrote, then warning, ""But it must also speak to the votes it still needs to win."" For several years, the tea party helped energize a moribund Republican Party. After the 2008 election, with conservatives reeling from the dismal approval ratings of Bush and the defeat of John McCain, tea party activists injected some life into the Republican grass roots, bringing out voters in the primaries who were frustrated with the political status quo. They pushed the GOP to focus more on the issue of deficit reduction and government spending, while creating immense pressure on the congressional leadership to avoid compromises. The midterm elections of 2010 put President Barack Obama on the defensive and constrained him for much of his first term. But Frum was right about the long run. The tea party has extracted some very high costs from the party from which it will be difficult to recover. The most immediate cost was control of the Senate. In 2010 and 2012, tea party activists knocked out some powerful Republican candidates who probably would have been victorious and improved the chances for the party to win a majority in the Senate. Is the tea party ready to deal on the fiscal cliff? In 2010, the nation was riveted when Christine O'Donnell defeated U.S. Rep. Michael Castle in Delaware in the GOP primary. Most agree Castle would have won the Senate seat. O'Donnell could not. The seat went to a Democrat. Nevada's Sharron Angle and Colorado's Ken Buck suffered similar fates. This year, powerhouse Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana was defeated by Richard Mourdock, who uttered some explosive comments about abortion that fueled perceptions the GOP was far right. Democrats won the seat. Besides the Senate, the electoral costs were also evident in the Republican presidential primaries, when Mitt Romney felt the need to make the kinds of ""severely conservative"" statements that cost him enormously in the election. The tea party Republicans also made it difficult for Republicans to sign off on a $4 trillion ""grand bargain"" about taxes and spending when Obama's back was to the wall in 2011. The most zealous Republicans were unwilling to capitulate to the president on the issue of tax increases in return for the spending cuts they sought. They gambled that Americans would elect a Republican in 2012, which would give them free rein on Capitol Hill. But things turned out quite differently. Instead, Republicans don't have control of the White House and face the possibility of taxes going up for all taxpayers, as well as steep cuts in defense, if nothing is done. They don't have the leverage that existed in the post-2010 election. By most indications, they will now have to settle for ending some of Bush's tax cuts and possibly domestic spending cuts that are not as deep as they could have gotten a few years ago. If the automatic cuts go through, a product of the failure to reach a deal when the wind was at their backs, conservatives will see heavy reductions on defense, something not likely to please the Republican base. Even if an acceptable deal goes through, after the 2012 election Americans will likely see Obama as the driving force and Republicans taking a deal because they didn't have any other choice. The tea party has also undermined efforts by the GOP to position itself as the party of governance rather than the party of extremism. The tea partiers are part of a dynamic in the party, that started with Barry Goldwater's run in 1964, which pushed out moderates and made it more difficult for the Republicans to build a long-term coalition, as Geoffrey Kabaservice documents in his book ""Rule and Ruin."" The demand to remain ideologically pure has consistently pushed Republican leaders to move to avoid saying yes to almost anything, preventing House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell from cutting deals. The inaction of the GOP and the ideologically charged rhetoric from its members have played directly into arguments by scholars such as Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein that the GOP is moving far to the right and is responsible for the dysfunctional state of politics in Washington. Finally, the tea party is making it increasingly difficult for Republicans to win over hugely important voting blocs that can play a major role in 2016 and 2020. In 2012, the Republicans paid dearly among Latino voters for the rising power of hard-line anti-immigration advocates. The tea party helped to drown out voices such as those of Bush who believed the party needed to broaden its appeal and reach out to new constituencies, not shrink its electoral map. They have also turned off many younger millennial voters, another key constituency finding less to like about the Republican Party. All of these point to the ways in which the embrace of the tea party has taken its toll on the Republicans. Recently, observing the losses that resulted from tea party candidates, Frum asked: ""Have we learned our lesson yet?"" The answer is uncertain. At a moment when the party needs to avoid an electoral free fall with more red states turning blue, or at least becoming swing states, party leaders need to do some hard thinking about whether one of their greatest challenges does not come from Democrats, but from within. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: The tea party helped GOP bounce back from Bush years, McCain loss .

"(CNN) -- The Obamacare website is open for business. But the Charlton Memorial Hospital in Folkston, Georgia, is closed. Because Republicans in half the states have blocked the expansion of Medicaid, funds to public hospitals with large uninsured populations have been slashed. So far, at least five public hospitals have been closed this year and 5,000 hospital employees have been laid off nationwide. The closures are expected to worsen in the coming years. In Georgia, as many as 15 more rural hospitals may close ""within months"" and in Tennessee, which is putting off a decision on expanding Medicaid, almost half of the 61 rural hospitals in the state might face ""major cuts or closure."" This is a direct — and disastrous — consequence of Republicans' ideological opposition to Obamacare. When the Affordable Care Act was originally passed, subsidies to hospitals with large uninsured ""charity care"" populations were cut, figuring that the expansion of Medicaid under the law would replace this funding. But then the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide whether to expand Medicaid or not. Half the states have said they will not extend Medicaid or are putting off deciding. These are states mostly controlled by Republican governors, state legislatures, or both. There was really no downside to extending Medicaid to cover individuals who earn up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government is covering 100% of the cost of Medicaid for the next two years and 90% afterward. Columnist Josh Barro has pointed out the bind: ""(W)hen Republican state officials decline to participate, they will have to explain to both medical providers and potential Medicaid beneficiaries that they turned down free federal money just to spite the President."" And yet the 25 states that have indeed refused Medicaid expansion will soon find they're not just spiting the President but also their own citizens. The people who rely on these ""essential hospitals"" aren't just low-income folks. Middle-class Americans who live in rural communities will have to travel 40 or 50 miles just to reach the nearest emergency room if these hospitals close their doors. According to Bloomberg News, Pam Renshaw crashed her four-wheeler in Folkston, Georgia, and suffered painful second- and third-degree burns on nearly half her body. But her local hospital had shut down. It took two hours for her to get to an ambulance center 20 miles away and then on to a hospital in Florida where she could get treatment. As more of these horror stories emerge and as more hospitals close, even the most diehard Republican voters in these rural communities won't care about ideological grandstanding. They'll just want their hospitals open. On the heels of news of rural hospitals shuttering come reports that health care costs overall are falling and that the cost of Obamacare is expected to be billions of dollars less than expected. Of course, some of the decline in health care cost is certainly the result of a still-sluggish economy. Yet does anyone doubt that if health care costs had risen in the same period to even a fraction of a degree, Republicans would be screaming from the rooftops, blaming Obamacare? We might not be able to expect fervent anti-Obamacare ideologues to act rationally in the face of facts — but what we can expect is that their constituents will be even more vexed to see that as health care costs nationwide are falling, the hospitals on which they depend are closing. Desperate to try to blame everything and the weather on the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have tried to pin the cuts in subsidies to hospitals on the dynamics of the law alone. A spokesperson for Georgia's Republican Gov. Nathan Deal blamed the Affordable Care Act for cutting subsidies to the hospitals that treat the uninsured while refusing to acknowledge the governor's power to expand Medicaid at the state level and solve the entire crisis. You heard that right: Republicans like Deal, constantly railing against the federal government and clamoring for ""state's rights,"" are suddenly abdicating state responsibility and blaming the feds for not fixing the problem. It's the same hypocritical dynamic at work in more than 30 states that have turned their roles in setting up health insurance exchanges over to the federal government. It seems Republicans want state authority when it comes to pushing their conservative agenda but not when it comes to providing basic health care and access to insurance for their residents. Not that Republicans at the federal level are any more responsible. Congress refused to pass a law that would have delayed the subsidy cuts for rural hospitals until more states decide whether they're extending Medicaid. These acts of ideological intransigence by Republicans at the federal and state levels will not hurt Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, its components are broadly popular with the majority of American people and it will only become more so as it is fully implemented and most people see the quality of their care go up as their costs go down. No, Republicans are only hurting their constituents — folks in redder parts of red states who rely on rural hospitals for emergency room treatment, oncology visits, maternity wards and other basic care. Purely for ideological reasons, Republicans are creating a health care crisis — in their own states. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","GOP states blocked expansion of Medicaid, and public hospitals are closing .
Sally Kohn: Medicaid expansion was meant to provide funding for these hospitals .
Kohn: Republicans put ideology over health care; refused to delay cuts to hospitals .
Kohn: States trying to spite Obama will find they are only hurting their own people ."
"(CNN) -- The 18 operators of a high-end escort service allegedly banking on Super Bowl week to deliver ""party packs"" of cocaine and prostitutes have been charged with drug and sex trafficking, New York authorities said Thursday. The nearly year-long undercover investigation discovered that in addition to selling the ""party packs,"" the ring allegedly laundered the illegal proceeds through front businesses that included a clothing wholesaler, a wig wholesaler, a limousine service and a beauty supply wholesaler, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The ring targeted wealthy customers in New York for large events, authorities said. Last week, a text message was blasted to frequent customers noting that ""new sexy & beautiful girls R in town waiting for u."" The enterprise also ran numerous advertisements on the Internet and on public access television. Last year alone, the ring made $3 million dollars in credit card sales, authorities said. Schneiderman said the ring involved thousands of clients and hundreds of prostitutes, primarily women from Korea brought by ring members to the United States. ""Every two months they would bring in a new wave of girls and they increased the importation... because of the increase in demand that accompanies the Super Bowl,"" Schneiderman told CNN's Deborah Feyerick. Schneiderman said authorities were identifying the sex trafficking victims ""to try to get them out of this cycle of captivity, poverty and abuse."" ""This is not viewed any longer as a victimless crime,"" he said. ""This is viewed as something where woman are seized in their own countries, they're blackmailed and held in captivity. This is a crime with a lot of victims. We are approaching these cases now by identifying the woman as victims, not perpetrators."" Intercepted conversations involving the ring revealed that it used various code names for cocaine, including ""party,"" ""jewelry,"" ""powder,"" ""maek"" and ""Soojaebi,"" a Korean noodle and vegetable soup, the statement said. The prostitutes delivered the cocaine to the customers in what was referred to as a ""party pack."" The enterprise allegedly generated millions of dollars in illegal proceeds and planned to target high-end clientele coming to the New York area for the Super Bowl this weekend. The 11-month investigation involved undercover investigators, physical and electronic surveillance and reviews of business records, the statement said. The attorney general's Organized Crime Task Force and the New York Police found that the criminal enterprise spanned Manhattan, Brooklyn, Long Island, Queens and several states. The operation was based in Manhattan. Customers were charged for sex and drugs as a package deal, ""sometimes billing for cocaine in an equivalent number of 'hours' of prostitution,"" the statement said. The ring commonly supplied customers with large quantities of drugs to get them impaired, authorities said. Then the room would be flooded with additional prostitutes, and the customer's credit cards would be charged, at times upward of $10,000 for one night. Through front businesses, the ring would charge credit cards for goods and services not actually provided in order to hide the purchases of cocaine and sex. Most of the 18 suspects were arrested but some were still being sought. Those charged with various felony and misdemeanor counts were identified as Tony Yoo, 34; Jopseh Landrum, 32; Hyun Ok Yoon, 41; Young Ok, 38; Kyung Chun Min, 33; Sun Lee Ahn, 56; Young Mi Lee, 40; Ji Young Moon, 40; Janice Lee, 35; Hee Jung Chern, 42; Haiming Quan, 41; Kyong Bin Cho, 44; Jung Hee Jang, 43; In Suk Cho, 49; Ji Young Lee, 34; Hada Jang, 26; Nina Kim, 31; Hajoung Heath, 40.","Operators accused of selling ""party packs"" of cocaine and sex .

"(CNN) -- It's the end of the world as we know it. And yet the world feels fine. Friday was supposed to be the day life on Earth ceased to exist. The predicted apocalypse -- which spawned a disaster movie ""2012,"" a TV show tracking ""Doomsday Preppers"" taking extraordinary measures for the end-of-a-lifetime event and numerous jokes on social media and elsewhere -- stemmed from the end of an important phase of the ancient Mayan calendar. Founded around 2000 B.C. and still active, though its numbers and influence have waned significantly over the past several hundred years, the Mayan civilization measures time in cycles called ""baktuns"" of 394 years each. The winter solstice that occurred Friday marks the end of the 13th baktun. 2040 looks good, too: Asteroid is going to miss us . ""It will happen!"" a CNN.com commenter using the handle Robert Lawless predicted cheekily. ""All credible Mayan historians will agree, the Mayans predicted the World would end the same year Twinkies went extinct! HOW DID THEY KNOW????"" Some took the possibility of the day of reckoning much more seriously. Ryan Croft in Asheville, North Carolina, for instance, said he was teaching his family how to subsist on alternative sources of nourishment like algae, roasted mice and earthworms, as well as making a one-of-a-kind assault rifle -- a hybrid between an AR-15 and AK-47 -- to deal with signs of doom lurking around the corner. ""I taught about economic collapse and how it actually looks on the ground,"" Croft told CNN affiliate WHNS, noting he wasn't expecting the world's total obliteration but rather a more gradual slide into chaos. ""People want to act like it can't happen or doesn't happen, and it happens around the world. There are places on fire right now."" But not even modern-day Mayans bought into the coming apocalypse. They view the calendar as portending the end of one era and heralding the start of a new one, not the death of all the world's species. ""It's an era. We are lucky to see how it ends,"" said wood carver Santos Esteban in Yaxuna, Mexico, a sleepy village of fewer than 700 Mayans. End of the world still makes for fun movies . True to Esteban's less-than-dire prediction, Friday came and went in countless locales around the world -- from Sydney to Stockholm, from Kathmandu to Capetown -- without any epic calamity. That's not to say Judgment Day isn't coming, and possibly soon. Some who study the Mayan calendar say the date for the end of the period is not Friday, but Sunday. And numerous groups, through the years and all around the world, have prophesied the end of the world on specific days. They've all been wrong -- so far. CNN's Greg Botelho, Nick Parker and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Pointing to the Mayan calendar, some said life would end on the winter solstice .

"(CNN) -- A dreaded curse that has nagged Chicago's Wrigley Field for decades may have triggered a grotesque prank Wednesday, when an unidentified man in an unmarked truck dropped off a package containing a severed goat's head at the stadium. The gruesome parcel was addressed to the club's owner, Tom Ricketts, CNN affiliate WBBM reported. While the delivery -- confirmed by the Cubs and caught on surveillance footage -- was certainly offensive, it's nothing new. Local media have reported shenanigans with dead goats in the past. They may have been efforts to reverse the curse. Billy goats have struck mortal fear deep in the heart of an inveterate Cubs fan since 1945, after Chicago tavern owner Bill ""Billy Goat"" Sianis pronounced a curse on the club on October 6 of that year -- just a month after the end of World War II. Sianis went to Wrigley Field to support the Cubs as they battled the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, according to his tavern's website, which dedicates a page to the legend of the Billy Goat curse. For Game 4, he purchased a ticket for himself and one for his goat ""Murphy,"" who he thought would bring the Cubs good luck. But ushers stopped Sianis from entering the stadium with Murphy, according to the Billy Goat Tavern. Sianis appealed directly to then club owner P.K. Wrigley, asking him why he couldn't take his beloved pet and personal mascot to the game. ""Because the goat stinks,"" Wrigley is said to have replied. So Sianis placed a curse on the team. ""The Cubs ain't gonna win no more!"" he cried. So goes the legend. When the team lost the game that day, Sianis sent a telegram, the website says, to Wrigley proclaiming: ""Who stinks now?"" The team's record hasn't been the same since. And it has garnered the nickname ""the Lovable Losers."" Fans have made many attempts over the years to put an end to the curse, according to the Cubs' website. A Chicago charity, Reverse The Curse, was founded in 2011 and donates goats to impoverished communities around the world in the name of stopping it. Last May, a group of five Cubs fans took a goat named ""Wrigley"" on a trek across the country in an attempt to lift the curse. It didn't work. The Chicago team finished the 2012 season with 61 wins and 101 losses. CNN's Joseph S. Miller contributed to this report.","An unidentified man in an unmarked van delivered a goat's head to Wrigley Field .

"(CNN) -- When he was 6 weeks old, Kaiba Gionfriddo lay flat on a restaurant table, his skin turning blue. He had stopped breathing. His father, Bryan, was furiously pumping his chest, trying to get air into his son's lungs. Within 30 minutes, Kaiba was admitted to a local hospital. Doctors concluded that he had probably breathed food or liquid into his lungs and eventually released him. But two days later, it happened again. It was the beginning of an ordeal for the Youngstown, Ohio, family that continued day after agonizing day. ""They had to do CPR on him every day,"" said April Gionfriddo, Kaiba's mother, who later found out her son had a rare obstruction in his lungs called bronchial malacia. ""I didn't think he was going to leave the hospital alive."" With hopes dimming that Kaiba would survive, doctors tried the medical equivalent of a ""Hail Mary"" pass. Using an experimental technique never before tried on a human, they created a splint made out of biological material that effectively carved a path through Kaiba's blocked airway. What makes this a medical feat straight out of science fiction: The splint was created on a three-dimensional printer. ""It's magical to me,"" said Dr. Glenn Green, an associate professor of pediatric otolaryngology at the University of Michigan who implanted the splint in Kaiba. ""We're talking about taking dust and using it to build body parts."" Kaiba's procedure was described in a letter published in the most recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. ""It was pretty nifty that (doctors) were able to make something for Kaiba on a printer like that,"" April Gionfriddo said. ""But we really weren't so worried about that. We were more worried about our son."" Toddler gets new windpipe from her own stem cells . Green, who has been practicing for two decades, and a UM colleague, biomedical engineer Scott Hollister, had been working for years toward a clinical trial to test the splint in children with pulmonary issues when they got a phone call from a physician in Ohio who was aware of their research. ""He said, 'I've got a child who needs (a splint) now,' "" referring to Kaiba, said Green. ""He said that this child is not going to live unless something is done."" Green and Hollister got emergency clearance from their hospital and the Food and Drug Administration to try the experimental treatment -- which had been used only on animals -- on Kaiba. The child was airlifted from Akron Children's Hospital to C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at UM. ""It was a mixture of elation and, for lack of a better word, terror,"" said Hollister, a professor of biomedical and mechanical engineering who has been studying tissue regeneration for more than 15 years. ""When someone drops something like this in your lap and says, 'Look, this might be this kid's only chance' ... it's a big step."" The next big step was getting a CT scan of Kaiba's lungs so that the splint could be fitted to his organs' exact dimensions. Hollister used the results of the scan to generate a computer model of the splint. The model was fed into a 3-D printer that can engineer structures using a powder called polycaprolactone, or PCL. PCL is malleable; it can be fashioned into all kinds of intricate structures. When a splint is created using PCL, it becomes a sort of biological placeholder, propping up structures while the body heals around it. PCL has been used for years to fill holes left behind in the skull after brain surgery, according to Hollister. As time passes, PCL degrades and is excreted out of the body, hopefully leaving behind a healed organ. What followed in Kaiba's case was a painstaking process of creating the splint on the printer in layers. Information about each layer is transmitted from the computer to a laser beam, which melts the PCL into a 3-D structure. ""We can put together a complete copy of a body part on the 3-D printer within a day,"" Green said. ""So we can make something very specific for a patient very quickly."" Green then took the splint, measuring just a few centimeters long and 8 millimeters wide, and surgically attached it to Kaiba's collapsed bronchus. It was only moments before he saw the results. ""When the stitches were put in, we started seeing the lung inflate and deflate,"" Green said. ""It was so fabulous. There were people in the operating room cheering."" ""This case is a wonderful example that regenerative technologies are no longer science fiction,"" said Dr. Andre Terzic, director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Medicine, who was not involved in Kaiba's case. ""We are increasingly ... finding new solutions that we didn't have before."" The technique used by Green and Hollister is part of a burgeoning field called regenerative medicine, which involves engineering therapies -- using things like stem cells, or ""body parts"" constructed out of biological material -- to harness the body's ability to heal itself. Creating a part that is specific to a patient's organ takes on even more importance with diseases like bronchial malacia, in which conventional intervention is risky and often the alternative is life on a ventilator. But while cases like Kaiba's are a medical boon, both Terzic and the UM researchers stress that this and other regenerative procedures must be replicated in a wider patient population. ""This gives us the opportunity to really do patient-specific and individualized medicine,"" Hollister said. ""So we don't have to do one-size-fits-all. But there is still a lot of work to be done."" While that work is being done, Kaiba's family remains grateful that, 15 months post-surgery and at age 18 months, he is still able to breathe on his own. ""I'm just so happy he's still here, that he was able to make it through,"" April Gionfriddo said. ""Hopefully (soon) he'll be able to run around and be an even happier child."" The splint will take three years to degrade, and in the meantime, Kaiba's lung should continue to develop normally, said Green. Green and Hollister hope to begin clinical trials in a larger patient population this year or next.","Kaiba Gionfriddo stopped breathing daily and had to receive CPR .
Doctors tried the equivalent of a ""Hail Mary"" pass .
They created a splint on a 3-D printer to enable him to breathe ."
"(CNN) -- If he had been listening from his car Monday morning, radio veteran Steak Shapiro knew what he would have thought of a bit mocking a former New Orleans Saint now battling Lou Gehrig's disease. ""I would have been offended."" Why? The now former host of ""Mayhem in the AM"" on Atlanta's 790 The Zone offered up plenty of reasons in an interview Tuesday with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. And none of his descriptions of the now infamous two-minute radio bit were positive. Stupid. Not thought out. Offensive. Awful. And not funny. ""You walk a fine line trying to be somewhat on the edge,"" Shapiro said. ""We blew it. We blew it in a huge way."" Shapiro and the show's two other hosts -- Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini -- were fired Monday evening. It all started, he explained, as the show's crew batted around ideas during a commercial break. The Atlanta Falcons are big in Georgia, and the New Orleans Saints are likely their biggest rivals. And it just so happened that Gleason, one of the men most associated with the Louisiana team, had been the guest writer for Peter King's popular ""Monday Morning Quarterback"" column this week on SI.com. But Gleason isn't just any Saint. He's a hero in New Orleans not just for his play as a defensive back but, more recently, for his battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neuromuscular disease also known by its acronym ALS and as Lou Gehrig's disease. The illness has hindered many of Gleason's functions, but it hasn't stopped him. To put together the column, he pointed out, he used technology that allowed him to type with his eyes. Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease. ""ALS prevents your brain from talking to your muscles. As a result, muscles die. As a result, every 90 minutes people die,"" he wrote. ""I am a person."" The ""Mayhem in the AM"" crew decided to spoof Gleason's illness, specifically, the fact he speaks with a synthetic voice. The segment featured punchlines of an imaginary Gleason telling knock-knock jokes, using a would-be synthesizer, with punchlines like ""Smother me, do me a favor."" On Tuesday, Shapiro offered no defense for the segment, which he described as quickly conceived and ill-advised. At the outset, he realized the bit wasn't funny but wasn't prepared as it quickly got slammed on social media and beyond. ""The pressure is to try to do a good radio show, and that wasn't a good moment,"" Shapiro recalled. ""It was a horrible moment."" Within hours, the radio station and its parent company had suspended Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro. By day's end, they were all out of a job. ""790 The Zone, our owners, sponsors and partners in no way endorse or support this kind of content. We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family and all those touched by ALS,"" Rick Mack, the station's general manager, said in a statement . All three hosts have apologized on Twitter and personally to the Team Gleason foundation, as Gleason himself wrote on Facebook. ""Received and accepted,"" he wrote. ""We have all made mistakes in this life. How we learn from our mistakes is the measure of who we are."" Since the story broke, Gleason said, there's been a lot of talk about ALS, an ailment he characterizes as being ""not (well) understood ... and largely ignored."" Hopefully, this unintentional uproar will help change that, he said. That's Shapiro's hope as well. At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans. The 18-year radio veteran knows New Orleans well: he attended Tulane University, was married in the city and even has a daughter named Nola. ""It's a place I understand their passions and their heroes,"" Shapiro said, counting Gleason as one such hero. ""And to make fun of those, it's an awful thing. I feel awful about it."" Outrage over radio hosts' comments is hardly unprecedented, especially in a ""shock jock"" age in which some push the line in order to entertain listeners. And sometimes the hosts get fired. That's what happened when Gregg Hughes and Anthony Cumia's ""Opie and Anthony"" show got pulled in 2002 for a stunt in which they broadcast descriptions of people having sex in public places, including New York's St. Patrick Cathedral. Five years later, CBS abruptly ended Don Imus' radio show after his remarks about Rutgers University's women's basketball program that some deemed racist and sexist. Both Imus and ""Opie and Anthony"" are still in the radio business and have nationwide followings. More recently, two popular Australian radio DJs made headlines for a prank call targeting a pregnant Catherine Duchess of Cambridge that was followed by the suicide of a nurse fooled by their call. Those radio hosts were suspended, not fired. That's what should have happened to Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro, according to Sirius XM radio host Jay Thomas of New Orleans, where he says ""Steve Gleason is an icon."" Thomas is an accomplished actor, winning three Emmy awards as Candice Bergen's love interest, talk show host Jerry Gold, on ""Murphy Brown."" He also worked on ""Cheers,"" playing hockey star Eddie LeBec, husband of Rhea Perlman's Carla Tortelli. Thomas -- who admits being a ""huge Saints fan"" who doesn't like Atlanta -- believes 790 the Zone's management overreacted to ""a bad joke."" He noted that TV shows such as ""Family Guy"" have repeatedly featured caricatures of Steven Hawking, who also has ALS and uses a synthetic voice, in its shows with no equivalent uproar. The Atlanta saga would have ended better if the fired radio hosts, after being suspended for some time, had returned to talk about ALS with Gleason and raised money for the cause, said Thomas. ""That was a dumb thing to say, but no one is yelling for them to get fired,"" Thomas told CNN. ""... It 's a terrible thing, a stupid thing. But yeah, you make mistakes."" CNN's Matt Smith and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","An Atlanta radio station fires three hosts for mocking ex-Saints player Steve Gleason .

"(CNN) -- Well, guess that argument's settled for now. Google is a more valuable brand than Apple. At least that's the assessment of an annual study by Millward Brown, a communications company that ranks Google as the world's most popular brand, topping Apple, which had held the top spot for the past three years. And, yes, we realize the report will change virtually no minds in the tech world's long-running battle of fan loyalty. But it's fun to talk about. According to the 2014 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brand ranking, Google's brand value rose 40% last year, to $159 billion. Apple, meanwhile, slipped 20% to $148 billion. According to the report, it was Google's spirit of innovation, and Apple's perceived lack of it, that led to the flip-flop. ""I think the world is looking at Apple as a brand that created an Earth-shattering revolution, and I think that has slowed down a bit,"" Oscar Yuan, vice president at Millward Brown, told AdWeek. ""The fact that (Google) doesn't see themselves contained in one sector is really a testament to their boldness and willingness to try new things."" In the past year, Google's Android mobile operating system continued to gain popularity worldwide, its connected Glass eyewear became more of a wearable-tech staple and stories about its long-range products, like a self-driving car, continued to captivate imaginations. All that is in addition, of course, to its search engine, which remains essentially unrivaled. Apple, meanwhile, was criticized by some for failing to keep breaking new ground, settling instead for incremental upgrades to its breakthrough products like the iPhone and iPad. Long-standing reports suggest that Apple has a smartwatch and a television system on the way. And the tech giant also is reportedly on the verge of buying headphone and digital-music company Beats. But there have been no visible results on those fronts. The Millward Brown list was decidedly tech heavy. Rounding out the top five were IBM, Microsoft and, representing the nontech world, McDonald's. Amazon, which continues to strengthen its foothold in the streaming-TV and tablet markets, entered the top 10 for the first time. Twitter and LinkedIn debuted on the list at numbers 71 and 78, respectively, and with a 68% increase in perceived value, Facebook was the second-biggest climber on the list, reaching number 21. Of course, it's always hard to know exactly how much stock should be placed in these research-company rankings. As with Millward Brown, many of them use proprietary tools and research that they offer to clients for a fee and don't care to explain to the public. The company does say that the rankings came, in part, from 150,000 interviews with consumers from around the world. But how did it measure the value of an Apple fan's willingness to sleep on a sidewalk in order to buy a new phone versus the free press Google gets every time it cranks out a really cool Doodle for its search page? Nobody knows. But, hey, it's something for diehard fans to debate between now and whenever the iPhone 6 is announced.","An annual brand survey ranks Google No.1, ahead of Apple .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is not often upstaged. But ahead of a charity match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Melbourne, the 17-time grand slam winner played second fiddle to a bona fide Australian sporting great. In the arena which bears his name, Rod Laver -- a former world No. 1 and winner of 11 grand slam singles titles -- returned to the court. Before facing Frenchman Tsonga in a match aimed at raising money for the Roger Federer Foundation, the Swiss exchanged a few rallies with the 75-year-old who retired in 1976. For Federer it was an opportunity to hit with his hero, even if Laver isn't the athlete he once was. ""Hitting with Rod Laver for me clearly is an absolute dream come true,"" Federer, who will be bidding for a fifth Australian Open over the next fortnight, told reporters. ""It's in his arena as well, it's named after him and he deserves it so much. He told me that his wrist was hurting less on the forehand so he asked me to play there a bit more often. ""While I was playing my racket was feeling extremely heavy, that means I was very nervous which I really was because you don't want to miss a shot. ""I was happy we had some rallies. What an honour it was for me and I hope that the crowd enjoyed it and I'm very thankful that he was willing to do something like this because it's not normal in any way and that's why I really appreciate it."" While Federer will be competing for a winner's check $2.3 million winner's check at Melbourne Park, Laver earned a comparatively modest $1.5 million during his glittering 13-year career.","Roger Federer and Rod Laver delight Melbourne crowd by playing a few rallies .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Calling's lead singer, Alex Band, told police he was abducted, beaten and robbed Sunday, just hours before his group announced a comeback effort. Band suffered ""a fractured lower spine, 15 stitches to lower chin, three broken teeth and is bruised on his side and stomach from the baton beating,"" his publicist said Monday. The singer countered speculation that the attack was related to his drug use or a hoax. ""This just happened to me. I didn't kidnap myself, or beat the crap out of myself. So the whole hoax thing is honestly kind of disgusting to even think about, or hear,"" Band told CNN. He told investigators he was walking down a street in downtown Lapeer, Michigan -- where his group had just performed at a music festival -- about 3 a.m. Sunday when two men forced him into a blue minivan, according to a police statement. ""Alex was grabbed by his shirt and hit from behind and lost his footing,"" publicist Brad Taylor said. ""He was beaten with a police baton with a gun pointed to his face demanding Band's 'Hollywood money.' After Band fought back, he was cornered in the van with gun to his face."" Band picked up the story from there. ""At this point, I was crying, I'll admit it, I was scared, and I was pleading for my life, but then it occurred to me. I was like, 'You know, I just found like a couple of weeks ago that I'm going to be a dad,'"" he said. The assailant responded, ""It's your lucky day,"" Band said. ""He kicked me out of the car onto the train tracks, and that's when I hit the tracks and I fractured the bone in my lower spine, and I was unconscious and they left,"" said the singer. According to his publicist, Band was left for dead at a local railroad track in Lapeer. Earlier, Band issued a statement to CNN about the incident. ""I never thought my unborn child would be my savior,"" Band said. ""I am grateful to be alive and I know that I am destined for bringing my music back to my fans."" The singer ""reported being assaulted, robbed and dropped off on another street,"" according to Lapeer Police Sgt. Craig Gormley. Another band member picked Band up and took him to the emergency room at McLaren Lapeer Region hospital, Gormley said. He was treated and released, he said. Police, who interviewed Band at the hospital, are investigating, Gormley said. Word of Band's alleged abduction hit online celebrity websites Monday morning at the same time entertainment reporters received an e-mail from a publicity firm announcing that The Calling is coming back ""stronger than ever"" after ""fighting through trials and addictions."" The singer has ""brought together a new band and has a fresh look on his past hits like 'Wherever You Will Go,'"" the news release said. Band ""was at the height of music stardom in the early 2000s pop world but took a severe, almost death drop on a roller-coaster of a ride by almost dying from drug abuse combined with the struggle of personal relationships,"" the release said. ""Having a global hit was amazing, but due to my personal struggles and relationships, I was robbed of the enjoyment of being on the top of a musical high of a career,"" it quotes Band as saying. ""I dropped everything to fight for my ailing wife, followed by a divorce, which equaled with a substance abuse problem that almost took my life. Coming out of my addiction with yet another struggle is something of a freedom. This second chance and has given me great fodder for our new music."" The rock/pop group is ""in the midst of signing a major record deal and are setting up a global tour to bring forth their music to a worldwide fervent fan base,"" it said. ""He is jumping back into finishing the record to help in the healing process and is resting for optimal healing,"" his spokesman said. The comeback announcement would normally get little attention in the media, but coverage of Band's alleged abduction put The Calling back into the headlines. CNN's Denise Quan and Tory Dunnan contributed to this report.","NEW: Alex Band: ""I'll admit it, I was scared, and I was pleading for my life""

"(CNN) -- If you thought dirty money was only found in offshore bank accounts, check your wallet instead. But you may want to wash your hands afterward. Almost 60% of Europeans believe cash is the dirtiest item they come into contact with, ahead of escalator handrails, buttons on payment terminals and library books, according to a survey of 1,000 people released on March 25 by Mastercard. A further 83% of the respondents, taken from 15 countries across Europe, believe cash carries a lot of bacteria. And they are right. Independent tests on European money conducted by a team of scientists at Oxford University in December 2012, revealed that the average banknote contains 26,000 bacteria, enough germs to make you feel nauseous, and possibly even spread disease. ""Europeans' perceptions of dirty cash are not without reason,"" Ian Thompson, the professor from Oxford University who tested the cash, said in a news release. ""The bank notes we tested harbored an average of 26,000 bacteria, which, for a number of pathogenic organisms, is sufficient for passing on infection."" Even the newest, and therefore cleanest, notes tested contained 2,400 bacteria, with Swiss Francs and Danish Krone the dirtiest money of all. ""(The bacteria) comes from multiple hands,"" Hany Fam from Mastercard told CNN's Richard Quest. ""These notes have a long time in circulation, they're handed, hand to hand, from different individuals and it's inevitable that germs accumulate on them."" Clearly, a credit card company like MasterCard has its own economic interests in pushing people away from cash. ""No, I'm not just advocating credit cards: I'm just saying that consumers are increasingly flocking to other forms of payment -- not only for cleanliness, obviously, but for ease, for convenience, for lots of reasons,"" Mastercard's Fam said. Still, cash is dirty. A 2002 study published in the Southern Medical Journal also found bacteria-laden banknotes. Over 80% of cash tested carried germs that could be harmful to people with lowered immunity. Seven percent of bills showed traces of bacteria that can cause serious illness, including Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia, according to the study. Only 7% of the bills were germ-free. Another study conducted in 2008 at Switzerland's University Hospitals of Geneva found that some flu virus cells could last for up to 17 days on Swiss banknotes, according to SmartMoney.com . So what to do? To prevent infection, scientists suggest basic hygiene: Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth, and wash your hands often. But that won't necessarily prevent illicit banknote contamination. Last year three employees at a Michigan Circle K store became ill after handling money that had been contaminated with methamphetamine residue, according to a local news website, Ann Arbor.com. Cocaine is also a common contaminate in the U.S. A 2009 study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth found up to 90% of paper money circulating in America contained traces of cocaine.","Almost 60% of Europeans believe cash is the dirtiest item they touch .

"Panmunjom, Korean border (CNN) -- Just ahead of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea, the world's most tense border, South Koreans take their last chance to protest -- behind them lies no-man's land. ""There are no human beings in the DMZ,"" says CNN's Kyung Lah as she waits for a military escort into the area. The presence of five lone protesters on this remote and heavily policed strip of road provides an incongruous welcoming party to a strip of land so explosive that visitors are told not to point or draw attention to themselves in any way. ""It's weird. There's just five of them wearing South Korean flags and they're protesting against North Korea and urging the reopening of Kaesong,"" she says, referring to the joint venture industrial zone that Pyongyang recently restricted access to. The Wednesday media tours of the DMZ are a regular target of South Korea's die-hard protesters; a last chance to get their message across before the press enter a zone where mobile phones and any type of communication is strictly forbidden. Just two kilometers further along the road lies the knife edge in the tensions between the two Koreas. Panmunjom Truce Village is a study in barely contained hostility: on one side South Korean border guards adopt the pugnacious stance -- arms behind back, legs astride -- that has become one of the abiding feature of the DMZ. On the other side, the high peaked hats of their North Korean antagonists glare through binoculars at their foes just a few hundred meters away. ""This is the weekly press tour, they hold them every Wednesday, the difference this time is that the tensions are higher,"" Lah says. ""At other times when there haven't been so many reporters, the press have been able to interview soldiers, and do stand-up reports along the border. ""We weren't granted any of that. It was like they had a stopwatch on every single stop we had -- they didn't want us to linger too long. As always, they didn't want us to point at anything in case the North Koreans misinterpreted it."" While visibly not much has changed along the DMZ -- the North's Propaganda Village with its fake facades and preposterously large flagpole still baldly punctuates the view -- the tensions were felt in the heightened restrictions. ""At certain points they restricted our visuals, told us not to shoot, but mainly it was time: 'Hurry up move along, hurry up move along'."" Speaking to Americans at the border, Lah says there was more concern among Americans stationed and living in South Korea. Timeline: North Korea's war of words escalates . ""But basically viewed it's viewed by them as an ugly sibling rivalry between the Koreas,"" Lah says. The DMZ stretches for 250 kilometers (160 miles) and is approximately 4 km wide, according to the U.S. State Department. Despite its name which suggests otherwise, it is the world's most heavily militarized border. On the southern side, South Korea has 639,000 battle-ready troops, and 2.9 million reserves, according to South Korean government figures. They are backed by a permanent force of 28,500 U.S. armed forces, according to U.S. government figures. North Korea, meanwhile, has one of the largest standing armies in the world. The Korean People's Army has an estimated 1.1 million military personnel under arms and a massive 8.2 million in reserve, according to CIA World Factbook figures. Under the Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953, the DMZ required both sides to back off 2,000m (2,200 yards) from the frontline along the 38th parallel. Running down the middle of the DMZ is a line known as the military demarcation line (DML) which indicates exactly where the front was when the armistice was signed that ended the Korean War in 1953. Soldiers from both sides are permitted to patrol the DMZ but none is permitted to cross the DML. Since 1953, more than 500 South Korean soldiers and 50 Americans have been killed along the DMZ. The high point of the tension along the DMZ occurred between 1966 and 1969 during the Korean DMZ conflict: 397 North Koreans, 299 South Koreans and 43 Americans were killed during the low-intensity conflict. Despite a thaw since the heady days of the Cold War, the DMZ is still among one of the most dangerous places on earth. In October last year, an 18-year-old North Korean Army private defected, crossing the DMZ undetected after killing two of his senior officers.","Demilitarized zone (DMZ) between Koreas is most volatile border region on earth .

"(CNN) -- As harrowing images from the Philippines grieve the world, notice something that isn't happening: we are not hearing much debate about the connection between tropical cyclones and global climate change. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report warning that rising temperatures would lead to more frequent and violent storms. Last year, the panel tempered that conclusion. While warmer water makes cyclones more likely -- and while a higher sea level makes these tropical storms more dangerous -- changes in wind patterns might counteract those dangers. For Americans in particular, 2013 has proved the calmest hurricane season since 2002. Yet hurricanes are only one example of an extreme weather event. In January 2013, The New York Times surveyed shocks around the world: . ""China is enduring its coldest winter in nearly 30 years. Brazil is in the grip of a dreadful heat spell. Eastern Russia is so freezing -- minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and counting -- that the traffic lights recently stopped working in the city of Yakutsk."" ""Bush fires are raging across Australia, fueled by a record-shattering heat wave. Pakistan was inundated by unexpected flooding in September. A vicious storm bringing rain, snow and floods just struck the Middle East. And in the United States, scientists confirmed this week what people could have figured out simply by going outside: last year was the hottest since records began."" When we talk about climate change, we are talking about two issues that are too often treated as one: . Is climate change occurring? If so, is it changing because of human activity? The strong passions aroused by question 2 - and the huge economic interests at stake - can lead people to prejudge question 1. And within question 1 are two further subquestions: How harmful is climate change? How rapidly is the change coming? Greenhouse gases near record 39.6 million tons in 2013 . Some wisdom on these questions may be found in an important new work of history, ""Global Crisis."" It's Geoffrey Parker's examination of the last great climate shock experienced by human beings: the Little Ice Age. After a half millennium of very benign temperatures, the Northern Hemisphere began gradually to cool after about 1550. Slow cooling plunged into deep freeze in about 1620. Over the next half-century, the peoples of the Northern Hemisphere suffered climate catastrophe after climate catastrophe: . • Over the winter of 1620-21, the Bosporus dividing Europe from Asia (in modern-day Turkey) froze for the one and only time in recorded history. • The summer of 1627 was the wettest recorded in Europe for 500 years, followed in 1628 by one of the coldest summers recorded. • In 1641, the Great Canal that connected Beijing -- the planet's greatest city -- to its food supply in southern China dried up for lack of rain, again for the only time in recorded history. China suffered repeated crop failures through the 1640s because of patterns of drought and excessive rain. • 1641 saw the third-coldest summer recorded in the Northern Hemisphere; 1642, the 28th coldest; 1643, the 10th coldest. Crops failed across the British Isles and central Europe three harvests in a row. • The winter of 1649 was the coldest recorded in China. • In 1657, Massachusetts Bay froze solid, and farther south, people could walk across the ice of the Delaware River. • The next year, 1658, the Danish Sound froze so hard that a Swedish army and all its artillery could march over what is usually ocean water the 20 miles from Jutland to Copenhagen. • Poland recorded 109 days of frost in 1666-67, compared to an average of 63 days in recent years. • England's Thames River froze so hard that thousands of people could use it as a walkway for six weeks during the winter of 1683-84. These extreme events are just a few of the hundreds of individual examples cited in Parker's deeply learned history of the period. ""Global Crisis"" was published this spring by Yale University Press. Parker is best known as a military historian specializing in the Thirty Years War, the conflict that ripped apart Germany between 1618 and 1648, killing maybe one-third of the population by violence, hunger and disease. Climate change: Why nations, not global talks, are leading the fight . Now in a hugely ambitious, late-career work spanning the entire globe, he synthesizes the horrifying violence that erupted across Eurasia during the coldest and hungriest years of the Little Ice Age: the overthrow of China's Ming Dynasty and conquest of the world's most populous country by invaders from Manchuria; civil wars in Iran and northern India; the collapse of Ottoman power; pogroms against the Jews of Ukraine, the worst mass killing of Jews between the Crusades and the Holocaust; New England's merciless war upon the Pequot Indians; the destruction of Poland, till then Europe's largest state; the Fronde rebellion in France; the English civil war; Oliver Cromwell's rampage through Ireland; the successful Portuguese and doomed Catalonian rebellion against the Spanish Empire -- all of it accompanied by pestilence and famines, culminating in the last great bubonic plague epidemic in European history in the 1660s. Europe enjoyed only three years of complete peace between 1600 and 1700. Historians are familiar with the statistic that one-third of Germans died during the Thirty Years War. Parker suggests that this figure could be extended across almost the whole landmass from Lisbon to the Pacific, with China suffering most and worst. The Little Ice Age was obviously not man-made. The sun emitted a little less energy in the 17th century than we are used to, and more volcanoes erupted than usual. For tens of millions of human beings, the consequences of these unexpected events was miserable and fatal: death by violence, death by disease, death by hunger. Parker hammers home the lesson again and again: What matters most about climate change is not how it is caused, but how fast it takes place. Our contemporary debates over climate all seem to take for granted that change will unfold gradually over the next century, granting us all plenty of warning and time to react. In the 17th century, the catastrophe arrived astonishingly fast -- in one human lifetime -- and human beings adapted by dying in droves. There is in Parker's telling only one exception to the unhappy story: the Japan of the shoguns, where effective leaders found ways to manage and mitigate disasters they could not understand. If preparedness for the worst was possible for some human beings in those prescientific days, surely it is possible for more of us in our advanced age? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: When we discuss climate change we act as if we have decades to prepare .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki set five tons of elephant tusks and ivory carvings ablaze Wednesday in the first national celebration of African Elephant Law Enforcement Day. The president burned 335 elephant tusks and more than 40,000 ivory carvings, which were seized from smugglers in Singapore, according to a news statement by the Kenya Wildlife Service. According to the agency, 187 Kenyan elephants were illegally killed in 2010. Kibaki said he wants his country to be at the forefront of wildlife conservation. ""Through the disposal of contraband ivory, we seek to formally demonstrate to the world our determination to eliminate all forms of illegal trade in ivory,"" Kibaki said. Hundreds of conservationists traveled to the country to highlight the ongoing fight against wildlife crimes, the statement said. The event marked the culmination of a week of conservation-themed celebrations that included the launch of a new African wildlife monitoring system. Noah Wekesa, Kenya's minister for forestry and wildlife, said the country is also finalizing a bill that will severely penalize poachers to ensure illegal wildlife trade has no ""haven within our region."" In May, Kenyan officials seized 115 pieces of ivory disguised as diplomatic baggage at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Kibaki said countries need to understand the effects illegal trade has on national economies. ""We cannot afford to sit back and allow criminal networks to destroy our common future,'' he said.","More than 40,000 ivory carvings and 335 elephant tusks are burned .

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad"" fans are staring into their post-Walter White life with mixed emotions. There's satisfaction for Sunday night's well-executed series finale -- appreciation for the inspiring and historic work from ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan, star Bryan Cranston and the rest of the team. But, ultimately, sadness that it's all over. (Thankfully, ""Breaking Bad"" has spared its fans from the ""rage"" portion of the series finale roller coaster -- unlike some shows we could mention.) So if you're mourning the end of ""Breaking Bad,"" and wondering just how you'll fill that void, know that your misery has plenty of (famous) company: . For the most part, viewers have applauded the conclusion to ""Breaking Bad's"" five-season run on AMC, but there are those who have been critical of its neat and tidy ending. ""I wish I'd been able to respond to how fundamentally sympathetic the finale was to Walt,"" says NPR's Linda Holmes. ""Here, however, I could not escape the feeling that by earning anyone's sympathy, Walt was getting away with one last self-aggrandizing con. ... I didn't crave a happy ending for him, and he got about as happy an ending as he possibly could have."" Esquire magazine agreed, critiquing that while the final stretch of season five ""had some great individual episodes,"" Sunday's series ender ""was maybe the most conventional of the entire series. ... We watched as a tarnished hero killed the baddies, set his captured sidekick free, and died. Endings don't come much more Hollywood."" Yet none of those who were disgruntled by the final moments of chemistry teacher-turned-meth kingpin Walter White could argue that the finale, and the series as a whole, was par excellence.

"(CNN) -- All eyes are on Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai as the favorite to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. But there's another top contender, according to the bookmakers. That man is Denis Mukwege, a pioneering doctor from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has dedicated his life to helping rape victims. Mukwege, 58, is the medical director of Panzi Hospital in the eastern Congo, which has been plagued by conflict for nearly two decades. In a nation that has been ripped apart by war, the Panzi Hospital -- nestled in the hills above the Congolese town of Bukavu -- provides a rare sanctuary for women who have been raped. Many travel hundreds of miles to have both their physical and psychological wounds healed by Mukwege. The use of rape as a weapon of war in DR Congo has been widely reported. Although exact figures are unavailable, the U.N. estimates that more than 200,000 Congolese women are rape survivors. Read more: Congo beyond the conflict . Many of the women Mukwege treats have been so violently attacked that they suffer permanent internal damage. At his hospital, women are treated for vaginal fistula -- a muscular tear caused by violent rape -- and are also given counseling and treatment for the psychological repercussions of their experiences. Mukwege thinks that fistula is one of the worst conditions a woman can experience: ""A fistula is dramatic for a woman,"" he told CNN in a 2009 interview. ""Everywhere she goes people don't want to be around her and reject her, so it's a disease that is worse than leprosy."" Mukwege's career has spanned more than 20 years, during which time he has treated tens of thousands of women. The women at Panzi Hospital view Mukegwe as a father. ""I may be the only one to whom they can express what they feel ,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's important to help them heal psychologically and tell them: 'You are not destroyed. They wanted to destroy you, but you are still a woman. You are a woman and you need to be strong.'"" In October 2012, armed men broke into his house, held his daughters at gunpoint and waited for him to return home. When he arrived home his security guard attempted to intervene and was shot dead. Mukwege threw himself to the ground and narrowly missed being shot. Mukwege then took his family to safety in Brussels. When he returned to Bukavu in January this year he was given a warm welcome by the community -- his patients had raised funds to pay for his return ticket by selling pineapples and onions. Mukwege was born in 1955, the third of nine children. He studied medicine in the DRC before traveling to France to specialize in gynecology, after seeing the complications resulting from childbirth in his home country. He has won multiple prizes for his work, including the U.N. Human Rights Prize in 2008. Mukwege told CNN he had never considered going abroad for more pay and better working conditions. ""Work is not only about money,"" he said. ""Earning money is not the sum total of life. Life is not about living in abundance, it's about what you can give to somebody else.""","Pioneering doctor Denis Mukwege is a top contender for Nobel Peace Prize .

"(CNN) -- Years ago, experts told the world that the Internet would radically change our cities. A lot of us are still waiting. How cool, they said. Cities will be able to use the language of data to virtually talk to us, sharing information so communities can become superefficient, saving untold billions of dollars. Traffic management would untangle our commutes. Carbon emissions would plummet. Life, they said, would get a little easier. Well, some of this stuff is actually happening in places around the world. But in many other cities, businesses and governments have been ... moving ... kind of ... slow. So. What's the hold up? Where's my talking city? Apparently all those predictions a few years ago resulted in a dubious backlash, says Constantine Kontokosta, department director at New York's Center for Urban Science and Progress. Experts ""made a lot of promises about what this technology, just for technology's sake, could do."" Now, Kontokosta says the emphasis is on using smart city technology to help people make better decisions for themselves. During the past few years, a handful of so-called smart cities have been built from the ground up, in places such as the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and Japan. You've got to wonder what they'll teach us about how to bring smarter technology to the places we live, play and work. How might that technology grow in the United States? What should American city dwellers expect in the next five years? Let's take a look at the smart coastal city of Songdo, near Incheon, South Korea. Price tag: roughly $35 billion. Although it's not due to be completed until 2017, tens of thousands of people live there already, according to developers. Eventually the city plans to be home to 65,000 residents and a workplace for 300,000 commuters. Sensors distributed throughout buildings and roads monitor and regulate energy consumption and traffic flow. Sensors also tell commuters when their bus is coming. Inside homes, a trash disposal system sucks household garbage from kitchens through long tunnels to waste processing centers. Near Porto, Portugal, construction of a smart city called PlanIT Valley has been delayed by the nation's economic troubles in 2011. Developers reportedly are about to begin building the first phase, which would house about 7,000. PlanIT Valley has what planners call an ""operating system,"" which includes millions of sensors that send data in real time to a central computer that uses the information to keep the city working at peak environmental efficiency. Theoretically, buildings would be able to sense if they're on fire, alert firefighters and coordinate traffic flow to help first responders arrive a the scene as soon as possible. In the United Arab Emirates, the solar powered desert berg of Masdar City reportedly is about to break ground on its first neighborhood of 500 smart private homes. Masdar has boasted environmentally sustainable educational and business districts for several years, and planners promise its homes will include technology that make them ""super sustainable."" Japanese developers recently opened the town of Fujisawa SST, about an hour west of Tokyo by train. This solar powered city, built by Panasonic, is shaped like a leaf and built in three layers -- one on the surface and two underground. Residents started moving there in March, numbering about 30 families so far. The city manages its energy needs in real time by coordinating data from sensors linked to home appliances. By the time it's completed in 2018, Fujisawa SST is expected to include 1,000 households. It aims to provide a global showcase on how to generate renewable energy while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and cutting water use. ""It's important to remember that Fujisawa SST is not an experiment, but a project to create a smart sustainable town that continues to grow and develop, with the residents at the core,"" says Panasonic spokesman James Bell. The project website announces: ""We now release our Fujisawa model to the world!"" Confidence is high, but so are the stakes. These smart cities have a lot to prove. For one, they've got to show that their models can solve energy and efficiency problems comprehensively in places where people live and work. They also have to demonstrate their successes are not isolated examples. In other words, their solutions have to be replicable in other locations. ""The technology is the easy part, quite frankly,"" says infrastructure expert Robert Puentes of the Washington think tank, the Brookings Institution. ""We know that these things work. It's how you get it done in existing complex environments that's going to be the hard part."" Infrastructure has gotten smarter in existing cities across Western Asia, China and Africa. In Europe, it's especially evident in Barcelona, Spain; Copenhagen, Denmark; Vienna, Austria; Manchester, England; and Paris. In the United States, experts say smart cities built from scratch will be unlikely. Retrofitting smart tech into existing city infrastructure has been going on for a while now. The built-from-scratch cities might have lessons to offer. ""Masdar is developing water conservation solutions with lessons to be learned in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, cities which are still growing here in the United States,"" Puentes says. Innovation districts . Experts point to U.S. cities leading the way, such as Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston and Seattle. Some communities have established special innovation districts that are outfitted with smart technology and a lot of broadband Internet. The idea is to attract businesses that want smart tech efficiency to move to those districts. From those seeds, planners hope a smart tech wave will spread citywide. Now under construction on Manhattan's West Side: Hudson Yards, an ambitious 28-acre neighborhood of skyscrapers filled with offices, retail and residential space. By the time it's completed in 2018, Hudson Yards is expected to be highly wired up. How's the air quality? They'll track it. Energy use? Check. Movement of garbage and recyclables? They plan data for that. There will be data tracking movement of people on the property. If tenants want to, they can use the building's smartphone app to track their personal health stats. ""We have a lot of experiments going on around the U.S. right now,"" says Puentes. ""It's getting those routinized that's going to be a big challenge. That will be a big problem throughout the United States. There's really nobody that's doing it all completely perfect."" The key is looking at the data as a whole, so community leaders can use it to see the big picture and make changes that will yield big benefits like reducing carbon emissions or saving money. But progress has been slow. Experts blame the most recent recession, fear of risk and bureaucratic inertia. Also, differing business cultures add another layer to the challenge. ""In many cases the real estate industry is one that's very slow to change,"" says Kontokosta. ""This is a rather dramatic paradigm shift for how the real estate industry and how planners will conduct their business. So I think it's going to take a little bit of time, but we're starting to see momentum building."" Shake it up . One suggestion, say experts: shake up the bureaucracy. ""Historically cities have operated in silos along different agencies,"" says Kontokosta. ""But as we're getting into this ability to measure and monitor all kinds of data, cities really need to have much tighter cohesion -- much more coordination -- across different branches."" ""We've got to reform government in many ways and formalize collaboration between different city agencies,"" says Puentes. Problem-solving mayors are appointing business-savvy data chiefs who coordinate several departments. They're armed with mandates to make things happen. And it's not just about sensors inside buildings and bridges. In Louisville, Kentucky, smart sensors embedded in asthma inhalers were used in a medical study that pinpointed locations of asthma attack clusters and then investigated whether the locations contributed to the attacks. ""Where I see the best use of all of this smart technology is ways to improve quality of life,"" Kontokosta says. ""Including understanding the connection between poverty and health and the built environment."" Within the next five years, the U.S. can expect to see more smart tech linked to transportation. Why? Government officials with tight budgets will want to increase efficiency. ""Once states realize there's not a lot of money coming for new construction, they're going to have to figure out new ways to solve problems like traffic congestion,"" Puentes says. Right now, the biggest challenge surrounding the installation of large-scale smart tech is cost. The solution, Puentes says, includes finding the right mix of public and private networks that can finance retrofitting the nation's big cities. ""If we can get those business models done right,"" he says, ""then there's no stopping this."" What smart city tech are you seeing in your community? Let us know about it in the comments section below.","Unfulfilled promises of superwired smart cities spark a dubious backlash .

"New York (CNN) -- The mother of a man who died while honeymooning on a cruise in 2005 has new hope that the mystery surrounding his death will be solved after the FBI's New York office agreed to review the case. ""The tide is turning, I think, now,"" Maureen Smith, the mother of George Smith, told CNN on Tuesday. ""With their resources we are going to be charging ahead."" George Smith, 26, went overboard from the Royal Caribbean ship Brilliance of the Seas on July 5, 2005, at 4:30 a.m., according to Smith family attorney Michael Jones. His wife, Jennifer Hagel-Smith, was found passed out in a hallway of the cruise ship that morning, Jones said. Investigators found blood on the sheets in the Smiths' room and on the canopy over the lifeboats, about a 20- to 30-foot fall from Smiths' stateroom, the attorney said. A four-fingered bloody handprint was found on the ship's edge, where it appears Smith had been holding on before he descended into the water, Jones told CNN. The Smith family has long held the belief that George was murdered. ""It's very difficult, and we have had many obstacles put in our path, but we are still here and we are still fighting,"" Maureen Smith said. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for the FBI's New York office, told CNN the office was reviewing the matter. A statement Tuesday from Royal Caribbean International emphasized the cruise line has consistently ""provided unfettered support, assistance and cooperation to the FBI, including the provision of all documents and materials that were requested. ""As part of these efforts, Royal Caribbean assembled over 6,000 pages of documents covering its investigation of the disappearance of Mr. Smith and made all this information available to the FBI. The company has worked closely with all law enforcement agencies including the FBI and remains readily available to them if there is any further inquiry into the matter,"" the statement said. Jones said the family had been seeking the transfer of jurisdiction from the FBI's Connecticut office to the agency's New York bureau for almost two years, after a video surfaced that showed at least three Russian-American passengers on the same cruise joking about George's death. ""Two of the targets from the investigation reside in New York,"" Jones said. The attorney said he became aware of the video when lawyers for the cruise line turned over information and video after the Smith family reached a settlement with Royal Caribbean. Jones said the video is in the possession of the FBI. While he hasn't seen it himself, he said he's been told what's on it by an attorney for Royal Caribbean. It apparently shows one of the Russian-American passengers making an incriminating statement. The passenger ""stands up, hunches his shoulders and flashes gang signs, in the context of George's death,"" Jones said. The men were interrogated by police on the ship the morning Smith went missing, according to Jones. Smith had been hanging out with these men at the casino and then at the ship's disco the night before and into the wee hours of the morning, the lawyer said. James Walker, a maritime attorney who represented Smith's wife when she sued Royal Caribbean in 2006 for the wrongful death of her husband, believes a crime did occur. Walker said he took a forensic specialist on board the ship during his investigation into Smith's death in 2005. ""My only hope is that the FBI will make an arrest and there will be a prosecution because it's long overdue,"" Walker told CNN on Tuesday. CNN's Mary Snow and Julia Talanova contributed to this report.","George Smith went overboard the Royal Caribbean cruise ship in 2005 .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- China's new rich have rushed to show off their wealth by spending on luxury status symbols, with the country now the world's second biggest market for designer goods. It has meant boom times for European brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton and Chanel. Now, a small but growing group of taste-makers say China's fashion landscape is changing. Home-grown designers and brands are ready to challenge their Western counterparts as a new generation of consumers seek out items that reflect their own culture, rather than just the European heritage and exclusivity that have been so popular to date. Meet the people making made in China cool: . Hung Huang: The magazine editor . When Hung Huang decided in 2005 to devote her fashion magazine, iLook, to covering Chinese design, jaws dropped. Advertisers pulled out and people told her the move was suicidal. ""It was really hard, she says. ""They told me 'there's no such thing as Chinese design'."" But each month, Hung and her team managed to feature an up-and-coming Chinese designer, with the hope of putting Chinese fashion on the map. It was a brave move in a country that has embraced Western luxury labels like no other but Hung feels vindicated. By 2010, her team was fielding several telephone calls a week from readers interested in buying the products featured on the magazine's glossy pages. But with few shops willing stock lines by Chinese designers, Hung took the plunge and opened her own boutique in Beijing. Called Brand New China, it stocks designs by up to 50 Chinese designers and has seen sales increase by 60% a year. ""We didn't have any illusions about making a huge fortune from Chinese design but it is a sustainable business."" Sales have increased, she says, as consumers, already accustomed to Western luxury labels seek out something different. Plus, an anti-corruption campaign that has seen sales fall at some Western designer brands is also leading a change in appetites. But she cautions that it will be a while before we see a Chinese equivalent of Prada or Chanel. Young Chinese designers want instant fame, she says, and don't pay enough to the business side of the fashion world. ""They all want to be the next Karl Lagerfeld,"" says Huang, who has been described as China's answer to Anna Wintour and Oprah Winfrey. ""It will happen...but it will happen to a designer who is mature, who has commercially learned how to deal with international corporations and retailers."" Chris Chang: The designer . It's the morning after her show at Shanghai Fashion Week and designer Chris Chang is on the phone apologizing to her friends and clients who failed to get a front-row seat. Featuring dozens of models sashaying down the catwalk in vibrant hues and striking headgear, it attracted huge crowds to the marquee in the city's hip Xintiandi district. The designer, originally from Taiwan, has been based in Shanghai for seven years and says she has developed a loyal coterie of customers who love, as she puts it, her ""happy, glamorous clothes."" ""They've worn Chanel in the past, they've worn Prada but now they want something individual and just more fun and beautiful,"" she says, from her studio which, with its day-glo colors and Chinese pop-art sculptures, encapsulates her design philosophy. Chang designs four womenswear collections a year under her Poesia brand. Her biggest challenge, she says, is a lack of stores. She sells her clothes from her Shanghai studio and also travels to Hong Kong regularly for trunk shows. ""On our own we don't have deep enough pockets,"" she says. Chang, who previously worked as Prada's general manager for Taiwan, has also adopted a mentor role to the country's younger designers. She starred as a judge on My Style television show, China's equivalent to Project Runway. ""Right now, it's a novelty for the world to look into what Chinese designers are doing,"" she says. ""It won't take one day to overturn the negative images of made in China that people had in the past but I think it's coming along."" Chang, who takes her inspiration from anything from cartoons to China's ethnic minorities, says that it can be burdensome for local designers to get hung up on their Chinese ancestry and history and they need to focus on global clothes for a global market. ""I think we have to focus on how to be good designers instead of good Chinese designers."" Andrew Keith: The retailer . Andrew Keith runs luxury Hong Kong department store chain, Lane Crawford -- Asia's answer to Selfridges. It sells clothing, shoes and accessories from 500 international designers online and at its seven stores in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. In October, clothes by Chinese designers were sold for the first time alongside the likes of Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen at its newly opened Shanghai flagship store. ""It's a natural progression for us to work with design talent here,"" he says. ""What's surprised people is the prominence that we're giving these designers. We're already re-ordering so the demand for these designers has definitely hit."" Depending on their Shanghai reception, the designers will see their clothes in other Lane Crawford stores and for sale internationally on the store's website. For Helen Lee - one of three designers chosen -- it's a massive opportunity. Her Shanghai boutique lies at basement level near a food court beneath West Nanjing Road -- one of the city's swankiest shopping districts. One day she hopes her name will feature among the Gucci and Chanel boutiques above ground. ""We are proud of made in China. I think our image is getting better but I'm still not sure deep inside how much people appreciate local brands,"" says Lee. Keith believes that if China is able to marry its manufacturing capability with commercial acumen and the creativity of designers like Lee, it will become a fashion force to be reckoned with. ""We will see China referenced as a thought leader, as an innovator and a driver of ... trends.""","China's new rich have rushed to show off their wealth by buying designer goods .

"Jacksonville, Florida (CNN) -- When the topic of HIV/AIDS enters a conversation, Earl Thompson hears that it's ""just what gays get."" ""It's not a gay disease,"" said Thompson. ""It's a human disease."" When a person gets a disease like cancer, support pours in, said Thompson, a slender 27-year-old with a boyish face. Family and friends fund raise and make sure their loved one gets proper care. But that's not the case with HIV. ""It's like hush-hush,"" said Thompson, a Jacksonville native, who learned before his birthday in April that he has HIV. ""You feel unlovable. You feel tainted. They're going to point a finger at me and be judging me. ""Just from the community, I know they don't talk about it. Jacksonville has many years before we're close to Miami, Orlando or Tampa. If something goes wrong, you don't talk about it."" It's a problem all across the Bible Belt. The Southeast is disproportionately struck with higher HIV/AIDS rates than much of the rest of the country. Dealing with the epidemic in the South ""is extremely challenging, because the stigma and discrimination is worse,"" said Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There is less discourse around prevention, sexual health, comprehensive sex education in schools or having strong, community-based advocacy activities."" Pastor fights HIV stigma in rural town . Jacksonville has the fifth-highest number of AIDS diagnoses among U.S. cities, according to CDC statistics from 2008. The state says this could have been a statistical aberration because surveillance methods and HIV/AIDS reporting laws changed in Florida in 2007, causing fluctuations in the data. But local HIV advocates in northeast Florida say the problem is a real one, not just a statistical blip. ""Here in Jacksonville, we're kind of the buckle in the Bible belt,"" said Donna Fuchs, executive director of Northeast Florida AIDS Network. ""HIV carries a huge stigma in our city."" Fuchs said the organization had trouble finding office space in 2000. One property owner refused to rent to the group, saying he didn't want people with AIDS in his buildings. Today, the office sits on a quiet, tree-lined street with a simple sign that reads: NFAN. A red ribbon, the ubiquitous sign for HIV/AIDS, usually adorns the logo for the organization. But not here. ""Clients didn't want a red ribbon on the door,"" said Fuchs. ""We had to take it down."" Four blocks away, there is another HIV organization -- one named for NBA star Magic Johnson, who revealed in 1991 that he is HIV-positive. When that clinic opened a decade ago, the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held inside the lobby. Organizers moved the event indoors because people feared being seen and associated with the disease. Today, that one-story clinic tucked behind a towering magnolia tree no longer bears Johnson's name. ""The only way we can get people to come through the front door is to create a fictitious name."" said Todd Reese, associate director of Health Care Center operations at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. ""No one walks into any building or floor that has any association with HIV."" Although visible HIV signs may be scrubbed from public view, the epidemic has worsened. HIV cases in Duval County, which mostly consists of Jacksonville, increased by 33% in the first half of 2011. This year, the county Health Department reports an increase in new cases. ""It's really not acceptable,"" said Dr. Bob Harmon, the county's Health Department director. ""This disease is ruining lives, and it's still killing people, especially low-income people who don't get tested enough and who don't get treated early."" Several HIV/AIDS advocates in Jacksonville criticized sex education in schools that emphasized abstinence. The mentality is that HIV/AIDS is not an issue here, several advocates said. ""Denial is the biggest problem,"" said Reese. And those who reveal their HIV status struggle to find acceptance. Thompson observed that some people who knew about his HIV status avoided physical contact with him. In social settings, they watched their drinks to make sure their glasses didn't get mixed up. ""Sometimes you feel like a pin cushion, like you're never going to find acceptance,"" Thompson said. ""You feel like you're going to be looked at as a disease, not as a person."" What perpetuates the epidemic is a social issue, Reese said. In Florida, the HIV/AIDS focus has historically been placed in southern part of the state. Some of the earliest HIV cases were found in Miami and in the Haitian immigrant population in South Florida. Miami still struggles with new HIV/AIDS cases; often, it has the highest AIDS rates in the country. ""You can go to Miami and you can put up a billboard, you can talk about condoms, AIDS and sex,"" Reese said. ""You can't do that in Jacksonville. People will be offended. They don't want to talk about it or see it. They don't want to see billboards about it."" And Jacksonville is no small town: It has about 821,000 residents. iReporters share their stories on World AIDS Day . It's a different population, said Harmon. ""In north Florida, our population profile is more like Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi than it is central and south Florida. That generally means higher rates of poverty, lower rates of completing high school and college, and higher percentage of African-American population."" Duval County has a high percentage of African-Americans, and in Jacksonville, 71% of the total HIV cases are African-Americans. Wade Price, 46, is a black gay man, proud father of three and grandfather of three. He keeps a half-dozen orange prescription bottles of anti-HIV medications on his nightstand next to his red leather-bound Bible. The pages of his well-worn Bible are patchworks of green and orange highlights. He reads scriptures every night and attends a Baptist church twice a week. Because his faith is crucial, Price decided to tell the head minister of his church how he struggled with being gay. He wanted to have prayer meetings with ministers and start a church support group. Price told the minister: ""I'm not the only one. Lots of people are keeping quiet, living double lives."" The minister rebuffed him, saying, ""Wow, it's times like this, I don't like being a minister."" ""That's one aspect of black churches,"" Price said. ""They want to turn blind eyes to it. ... I'm fighting this battle on my own."" Price left that church and found another one last month that is more accepting. ""We pretend it's not happening,"" Price said. ""The virus is being spread. You want to pretend like sex isn't happening. They say, 'Condoms, oh, no! That's not for God!' What's not for God is living with ignorance."" The social climate in northern Florida tends to be more conservative, said Harmon. ""There may be a reluctance to talk about this in the family, in the church, in other social settings and to perhaps ignore it,"" he said. But there are signs of change. Churches in the community have started to talk about the HIV/AIDS epidemic, said Veronica Hicks, 50. Hicks has never felt the need to hide her AIDS diagnosis and told her fellow church members and her pastor. ""They embrace me with it,"" she said. And Hicks's church has already started an HIV/AIDS testing and awareness ministry in Jacksonville. While stigma persists in the community, it's getting better, she said. She reported seeing growing HIV support groups, increasing turnout at community HIV/AIDS events and a recent line of people waiting to get tested at a mobile clinic. ""It shows me that people are willing to become more educated because HIV is prevalent and relevant.""","HIV/AIDS is like ""hush-hush"" says one man who tested positive this year .
Advocates say they can't post red ribbons on their offices because of stigma .

"(CNN) -- Even if you know nothing about IndyCar Racing or NASCAR, the odds are you know the name Danica Patrick. The trailblazing racecar driver has been exposed to a global audience through Super Bowl commercials, modeling shoots and other mainstream partnerships. She's helped IndyCar and NASCAR spread their audiences beyond core racing fans. That brand awareness hasn't been lost in the video game space. A few years ago Patrick worked with Activision to promote its racing game, ""Blur."" And she is one of the featured drivers in both of Activision's licensed NASCAR console games. Now she's partnered with Sega for its new arcade racing game, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.""

Gamers can even put her up against Disney's Wreck-It Ralph for a virtual race. Patrick, who was recently named Nationwide's most popular driver by NASCAR fans, took some time to play the new Sega game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for CNN. How big of a gamer were growing up and what did you play? I played a lot of games growing up, as any kid naturally would do. I played ""Sonic."" I played ""Super Mario Bros."" I played any kind of racing game that existed, I played ""Track and Field."" I shot some ducks with ""Duck Hunt."" Do you have a favorite Sonic the Hedgehog memory from back then that you can share with us? Can anyone really remember that far back? I think more than anything what I remember is playing the games when I would be on the road racing go karts, and being in my van when I went to the track with my family and playing with my friends at the track. I remember the places more than I remember exact memories about the games. What's it like being featured in ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed?"" It's really neat to be a player in it, especially being such a famous game, such an iconic game. Being able to be able to be a player along with Sonic the Hedgehog and all the other All-Stars is very flattering and it's very cool. It comes full circle. How does this compare to seeing yourself in NASCAR games? NASCAR seems like it's kind of a shoe-in for me. So to be in something like a Sega game is to me more cool because it's something that's not common, and it's not given that I would be in those games. So I actually like it better. What tips or strategies would you give to anyone who is going to play ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed?"" My suggestion would be to first off, pick me to play me because I'll be a really good one to choose. I'll be fast and I have lots of skills and talents and I shoot balls of flames. It disables cars and allows you to be able to get by them. I think you need to find out for yourself how awesome I am in the game. How popular are video games in NASCAR? Video games are pretty popular, for sure. I think given the fact that we're in a racing environment, racing games tend to be something that's obviously really common, so growing up I've played them and some people continue to play them and I think it's a good fit. What games are popular on the field these days during the rain delays? I know a lot of drivers play iRacing, which is more of an online thing. What impact do you think the hand-eye coordination required in video games has helped drivers become better in real racing? Playing games and being an adult race car driver, I think it's more of a mental thing. If you think it helps you then it does, but I don't know. I need to feel the G-forces. For me, it's more about having fun outside of the car than it is about actually helping to be able to drive it. If that was the case, then everyone would just play games. And that's not a prerequisite to driving a race car. Do you think that racing simulators help NASCAR drivers at all? I do think that they can. I think that when you take it to the next level and these simulators that cost millions of dollars, I think they can be helpful. I've tried them, but there's nothing like the real thing. I know Formula One teams tend to do that quite a bit. It's not prevalent here in the States with NASCAR or IndyCar, so I don't. But if it's in your head that it's going to help you to play a simulator or play a racing game, then it will help. Do you have a favorite piece of technology that you can't live without? Well, that's the phone. I mean let's face it. What the heck did we do before cell phones? Half of all gamers today are female. How have you seen video games evolve to become more than something just guys play? Well, they're very visual. That's one thing that's for sure. They're visually really amazing, so I think that maybe that might appeal to the female eye. We kind of tend to be about appearance a little bit. I think it also is about being able to have fun, and the games just get better and better over time. Us women are smart. We just waited till the games got better. A lot of Sega's classic Sonic games are now on the latest tablets. What are your thoughts on these new gaming devices out there? Technology always is just fast forwarding. There are more easy ways for people to be able to play the games that they want to play, when they want to play them. That's just the day and age we're living in. Do you think we'll see more of you in future games? I guess we'll have to talk about that? I don't know. Maybe I could be a stable player. Is this where we're going with it? I'd like to think so. That would be pretty cool. How many different cars do you have for the track and how many cars do you have at home? With all the race teams I drive for and the different series I drive in, I have a lot of race cars at the track. There are always two per series that are at the track for me, but then there are lots of them back at the race shop being built, or ready to go to the next event, especially if it's a different style track like a short track or a big superspeedway or road course. There are lots of different cars having to do with racing. At home I don't have that many. Honestly, I only need two. I have a nice fancy car, and I have a daily driver. I don't need any more. To be honest, I give away a lot of my cars. But I did buy a couple of my race cars, so I do have a couple of those. What type of communication goes on inside a real race car? If you're listening on the radio to the race, you're going to hear a lot of spot reaction about where cars are and things like that. I trash talk in my mind for sure, but I've been warned not to say it out loud because then everyone can hear, including kids, so I try and be polite and nice. It's not always going to happen. You definitely get frustrated with drivers, you want to get by them and you're trying to -- and you get mad and sometimes you want to crash them. All those things are real and that happens in the game, too. It's just that you actually get to do it and it doesn't cost any money to crash the car. That's the wonderful world of fantasy.","Danica Patrick has partnered with Sega for a racing game, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed""

"(This Old House) -- A tide of foreclosed properties has been sweeping into the beleaguered housing market, bringing down property values, dislocating families, and sending municipal governments scrambling to manage the crisis. But some buyers see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the gloomy headlines; they are buying up foreclosed properties at ultra-low prices. Real estate agent John Lynch of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West says he has interested buyers calling from all over the country, and as far away as Israel. Some are buying in bulk. ""One investor I am working with right now wants to buy 200 houses all under 10K."" Would-be homeowners are not excluded from the bonanza. Despite economic fears and the struggling housing market, Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire of McMullan Realty in Cleveland says this may be an ideal time to think about the dream of first-time home ownership. She tells the story of a friend who waded into the foreclosure market and came out ahead. ""My girlfriend bought a house last summer. It has two baths, a two-car garage, and two fireplaces. She loves it. Her house is $350 a month, with taxes and insurance. She's in her late 40's and had been a renter all these years."" Those are the high notes, but these agents tell other stories, too. There's the one about a far-away buyer who learned he owned a bunch of vacant lots, instead of houses. ""It's not for the faint of heart,"" says Lynch. Lynch has seen the same house at foreclosure auctions more than once. ""That hurts us all,"" says Lynch. A check-in with real estate professionals, home inspectors, and federal housing officials offers these words to the wise on buying a foreclosed property. • Budget carefully. Agent Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says don't let a small price tag lure you into a quick deal. Be sure to ask yourself a number of questions: Do you have the money for the extensive repairs these houses often need? ""Do you have a crew. If you plan to rehab and then rent, can you afford the house if you don't find a tenant? If you do your homework, there's little risk,"" says Perkins-Stoudermire. • See the house for yourself. ""You can't buy them sight unseen,"" says Bill Richardson, president of the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI). ""If you're an investor from Chicago and you're buying in Tucson, you'll need someone to evaluate the house in person."" This Old House: What to expect from a home inspection . • Look at the neighborhood. Your homework should include evaluating the neighborhood. You may not be able to recoup the cost of the repairs if the value of the house is depressed by widespread foreclosures or high crime in the area. Tonya Perkins-Stoudermire says she also encourages buyers to study the neighborhood's appeal at all hours, including at night. This Old House: How to identify a promising neighborhood . • How long has the house been empty? The longer the vacancy the more damage there is, in most cases. Bill Richardson, of ASHI, says if a house hasn't been ""moth-balled"" carefully, a long list of ailments set in. ""The plumbing seals dry out, sewer gases back up, and bugs that are in the sewer get a chance to get into the house. That's true for the sinks, toilets, and washer drains,"" says Richardson. • Was it winterized? Don't turn on the utilities until you know the condition of the pipes. If the pipes cracked during a cold spell, water will leak into the walls, and mold could take hold when you turn the water back on. This Old House: Dealing with mold . • Look at the landscaping. ASHI's Bill Richardson warns, ""If the house has been neglected, untrimmed trees, vines and bushes contribute to the deterioration of the house."" Vines crawl into the windows, and tree seedlings send roots down into the foundation. ""It doesn't take very big trees to mess up pavers, and dead branches crash into the house,"" says Richardson. • Contract for a private inspection. Banks generally require a home inspection when lending money for a mortgage. But even if you're paying completely out of pocket for an ultra-cheap find, all the pros say it's crucial to get an up-to-date inspection. Richardson says previous inspections ""are only a snapshot in time,"" and conditions change dramatically. ""There's no caretaker on these properties. I've looked at quite a few,"" says Richardson. ""We've seen vandalism. We've seen previous owners steal cabinets and fixtures. Copper piping has been stolen."" In some cases an inspection will prevent further damage. For example, if inspectors determine the pipes are cracked, repairs can be done in advance. Richardson said inspectors charge $300 to $500. • Consider a HUD house. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently holding approximately 39,000 houses whose previous owners held mortgages insured by the federal government. HUD houses go to market about six months after foreclosure. Local governments get the first option to buy. After that, buyers who pledge to live in the house have the first opportunity to offer a bid. If the house is still on the market after a period of about 10 days, the listing is opened to investors. Owner occupants end up with about half of HUD's properties, according to HUD officials. A fraction of the total foreclosure market, HUD's inventory is concentrated in Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and other states where the mortgage crisis has been especially severe. But if one of these houses suits your fancy, HUD spokesman LeMar Wooley says the feds offer a few advantages. ""You will know the fair price of the property"" because HUD updates its appraisals regularly. It offers a ""property condition report"" too, though that report is not updated. Wooley is thus among the chorus of experts urging buyers to pay for their own home inspection before closing the deal. If HUD appreciates the value of a good inspector, inspectors likewise say HUD houses are better protected. ""The feds often take the steps to winterize the houses. They put anti-freeze in the traps, and drain the pipes. When HUD's involved it's a little bit better,"" says ASHI president Bill Richardson. • Don't expect to profit from a quick sale. Investors who buy intending to do as little as possible to a house, hoping to resell for a profit when the market turns around, may find little profit and a lot of headache. Some cities are cracking down on neglectful property owners, charging penalties that increase over time, and unmaintained homes lose value quickly. But real estate pros and housing officials report that, overall, investors are a welcome and all-too-scarce resource, and most are fixing up the houses they buy for rent or resell. What's more, investors and new owner-occupants might get the satisfaction of helping to turn a hard-hit neighborhood around. Get 2 Free Trial Issues .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama acknowledged Friday that the United States ""crossed a line"" and tortured al Qaeda detainees after the 9/11 terror attacks. The comments at a White House news conference were the President's strongest on the controversial subject since he came into office denouncing what he described as the Bush years of torturing alleged terrorists, also known as ""enhanced interrogation."" ""When we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line,"" Obama said. ""And that needs to be ... understood and accepted. And we have to, as a country, take responsibility for that so that hopefully we don't do it again in the future."" In the remarks, Obama was referring to a soon-to-be-released Senate Intelligence Committee report detailing the CIA's controversial interrogation and detention program following the 9/11 attacks. The document is a nearly 700 page summary of the full 6,800 page report that was approved a year and a half ago by a committee sharply divided along party lines. Senators on the committee have said the report is critical of the CIA's treatment of terrorism suspects, saying it amounted to torture -- an allegation CIA officials have denied. It also finds that those harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future terrorist attacks as many in intelligence community have claimed. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said later Friday that the report's public release will be delayed because of ""significant redactions"" by the CIA. ""We need additional time to understand the basis for these redactions and determine their justification,"" the California Democrat said in a statement. ""Therefore, the report will be held until further notice and released when that process is completed."" The report was returned to the committee Friday. Its creation has been controversial, with the CIA director apologizing after admitting that the agency spied on computers used by Senate staffers who prepared it. A public version was expected to be released as early as next week. In January 2009, President Obama issued an executive order disavowing torture and established a Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies. Details of those findings have never been made public. ""After I took office, one of the first things I did was to ban some of the extraordinary interrogation techniques that are the subject of that report,"" Obama said Friday. ""And my hope is that this report reminds us once again that, you know, the character of our country has to be measured in part not by what we do when things are easy, but what we do when things are hard."" In April 2009, Obama reiterated his position that waterboarding amounted to torture and ""violates our ideals and our values."" ""That's why I put an end to these practices,"" he said at the time. ""I am absolutely convinced it was the right thing to do -- not because there might not have been information that was yielded by these various detainees who were subjected to this treatment, but because we could have gotten this information in other ways, in ways that were consistent with our values, in ways that were consistent with who we are.""

"(CNN) -- During my travels to some western countries, there have been occasions when people have asked me where I come from. When some hear that I'm from Hong Kong, they would often say: ""So, you are Japanese!"" This has happened so often that I find it more convenient to simply tell them I'm Chinese, rather than explain how Hong Kong's sits in relation to mainland China. Hong Kong does not enjoy the global familiarity enjoyed by places like New York, Paris or London. The residents of these cities can just say they are from those cities to anyone in the world and there would be little questions asked about their nationality. Does the fact that the American doesn't mention he is from the United States make him less American? Of course not. One only has to walk down the streets of Manhattan and count the number of American flags to realize that New Yorkers are patriotic Americans. 'Mother China' In Hong Kong, whenever the Chinese flag and the Hong Kong flag are flown side by side, the Chinese flag is always placed a little higher. This rightly symbolizes the fact that Hong Kong is a city within the mother country of China. But this should not deny a Hong Kong person the right to explain the difference between their city and other Chinese cities. Those that like to stoke dissent often accuse such behavior as unpatriotic. It is a fact that Hong Kong is culturally and politically distinct from other Chinese cities. We are under a different political and legal system. We have a unique history of British colonialism. Our tradition of openness and internationalism has provided us with a unique set of circumstances. All in all, the Hong Kong identity is distinctive but one that China recognizes. It is this difference that has endowed Hong Kong with an important role to play within China in the same way that Shanghai and Beijing have their respective reasons to be. I believe the majority of Hong Kong people recognizes that Hong Kong cannot exist as an independent country. This is not just because of mere realism and practicality. It is fundamentally because we can readily identify with the traditions we share with our motherland and feel a substantial sense of pride in our ancient history. Unique identity . Whether or not we place Hong Kong before or after China depends on certain undeniable cultural anomalies. At the end of the day, the bond we have with our fellow countrymen in the mainland is stronger than our differences. If we can overcome this seeming contradiction and concentrate on celebrating our unique identity, we can fashion Hong Kong to be a place of global relevance and at the same time help China rise as a global player. Hong Kong is Asia's most culturally diverse city. We enjoy an international level of living standards. Our rule of law and freedom are things we cherish. We are geographically well placed to be Asia's cultural hub. It should be the place where all the world's important cultural events should be staged. In tandem with China's political and economic rise during our lifetime, Hong Kong's role in world culture is vital. It is important to recognize that it is the soft power of a country that is most appealing the world over. It is the tonic that helps to alleviate tensions that arises from issues such as territorial disputes and tourists behaving badly overseas. Countries that can handle their military, economic and cultural strengths with dexterity are those that are able to punch well above their weight. I believe the current generation of Chinese leaders are intelligent enough to recognize this fact. Under appropriate circumstances, Hong Kong people should be able to wear all our different hats with confidence and pride. As Asians, we should even be able to embrace our affinity with fellow Asians. Including the Japanese!","Hong Kong is culturally and politically distinct from other Chinese cities .

"London (CNN) -- Two iconic teams, each boasting a history and tradition that spans generations, will go head-to-head for club football's biggest prize on Saturday. Manchester United, the champions of England, face Barcelona, the champions of Spain, at London's famous Wembley Stadium for the right to be crowned Europe's best. These are teams whose exploits inspire emotions and evoke memories that are embedded in the psyche of fans all over the globe. But who will triumph in the UEFA Champions League final -- the culmination of a competition that began with qualifying rounds in June last year -- when the two titans clash in front of 86,000 avid supporters and millions more watching around the world? Will it be United, the home of the Busby Babes, George Best and David Beckham -- or Barca, where football legends Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff and Lionel Messi are revered? Pinto's picks: The European season in hindsight . CNN gives you the lowdown on why this match is so special, and why so many neutrals will be tuning in to watch the outcome. UEFA's dream final . Spain's Primera Liga and England's Premier League are regarded as the two best leagues in European football. However, only once in 55 previous finals have both countries' respective champions faced each other. Manchester United and Barcelona were also the finalists on that occasion two years ago in Rome, with the Spanish side running out 2-0 winners. And with only German champions Borussia Dortmund sandwiched between Barcelona (79,000) and Manchester United (75,000) in Europe's average home attendance table, it means demand for final tickets is almost unprecedented. With each club receiving just 25,000 tickets apiece, at prices ranging from $490 for the most expensive to $245 for the cheapest, never before will so many fans be watching from the comfort of their TV screens. UEFA spokesman Kimmo Bellmann told CNN: ""We expect viewing figures to be in excess of 300 million, which will make it the biggest final in the history of the European Champions League. ""The match will be aired in 220 territories by 113 broadcasters, while there will be 180 cameras covering the action, of which 38 will be in high definition."" UEFA has been accused of pricing fans out of attending the match, but the reality is that the ruling body could fill Wembley three times over because of the support that both teams generate. Financial fortune . A report commissioned by sponsors MasterCard predicts that the winners of the final will enjoy a record economic windfall of around $180 million. The figure is based on a  combination of official prize money, an increase in squad value, enhanced media rights and greater brand equity. Even the losers will receive in the region of $105 million for their efforts. Professor Simon Chadwick, author of the report, said: ""Manchester United versus Barcelona is the dream final as far as most football fans are concerned. ""But the English and Spanish champions are two of the most successful teams off the pitch too. They will collectively scoop $285 million, making this the most lucrative final in European club football's history."" Chadwick added: ""Forbes magazine last year listed Manchester United as the most valuable sports brand on the planet, while Barcelona claimed eighth spot in the league table. ""While the Champions League is a strong brand in its own right, the nature and strength of the brand is clearly heavily influenced by its constituent parts -- the participating clubs."" Battle of the giants . Alongside Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United are the two biggest clubs in European soccer -- with a tradition for playing the game with style and panache. Such is their popularity, they attract fans from all over the world, not just the Catalan region of Spain or the north-west of England. Barcelona have more than 1,300 officially registered supporters' clubs globally, with estimates that 25% of the Spanish population follows Barca. Meanwhile, United have long been recognized as the most supported football team in the world. The club's official Facebook page became the fastest growing of any sports side in the world, registering almost 2.4 million followers within two months of being set up in July 2010. Accountancy firm Deloitte recently estimated United had 75 million fans worldwide, although other estimates have the figure at a mind-blowing 300 million -- largely based on huge income streams from Asia, where the club has a massive following. United officially recognize over 200 supporters clubs in 24 countries, with huge swathes of support coming from the south of England, many miles from the club's Lancashire roots. The 22 players . Not every soccer fan supports Barcelona or Manchester United, but nearly every follower will be monitoring proceedings on television, radio or the Internet. As well as attracting worldwide support, there will be millions of fans willing either of the teams to lose -- especially in Madrid and Liverpool, where the bitter rivals of both clubs are based. For those neutrals just wanting to watch a game of soccer, a treat could well be in store. Busquets free for Champions League final . This current Barcelona side is being widely touted as the greatest to ever grace club football. Packed to the brim with players who helped Spain win the 2008 European Championship and 2010 World Cup final, they also have the best player in the world among their ranks. Argentina forward Messi is blessed with remarkable skill, balance and control and the 23-year-old is following in the footsteps of both Dutchman Cruyff and compatriot Maradona in starring for Barca while being universally recognized as the number one player on the planet. Add to the list the attacking talents of David Villa, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Dani Alves, as well as the defensive steel of Carlos Puyol and Gerard Pique -- the only player on view who has played for both teams after starting his senior career at United before returning to the Camp Nou -- then it's easy to see why the Spanish side are favored to win the match. Under coach Pep Guardiola, already a Catalan hero for his time as player with the club, Barca have won three Spanish league titles in a row and are on the verge of a second Champions League title in that period -- a remarkable record. United come into the game on the back of sealing a record 19th domestic league title, a significant achievement as it moved them clear of rivals Liverpool. They boast the greatest English player of his generation, striker Wayne Rooney, and golden oldies Ryan Giggs (37) and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar (40) -- the latter will be retiring at the end of the match. Why Scottish coaches rule English football . But perhaps United's main hope of halting Barca lies with manager Alex Ferguson, who can lay claim to being the greatest coach in soccer history. In his 25 years in charge of the club, Ferguson has won 12 league titles and countless other domestic trophies. If he leads United to victory on Saturday, he will become the first manager to win three Champions League titles. Battle for supremacy . The original European Cup was initiated in 1955 by French newspaper L'Equipe, under the jurisdiction of UEFA. Although the eventual premise was to involve only teams who had won their domestic league titles, in the early days L'Equipe actually invited those teams it considered to have the most fan appeal to participate. Barcelona's Spanish rivals Real Madrid dominated in its formative years, taking the trophy in the first five years, while English clubs dominated from 1976 to 1982, winning six times in a row courtesy of Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa. The format remained the same until 1992, when UEFA created the Champions League, involving not only domestic champions but also teams who finished second, third and fourth in their respective leagues. United and Barca both won the competition once under the old format (United in 1968 and Barca in 1992 -- ironically both times also at Wembley). And, since the introduction of the Champions League, the two teams have maintained identical records, both winning the cup twice and losing in the final once. Saturday's match will see one of the teams claim their fourth European title, overtaking the beaten finalist in the all-time winners' table. The wonder of Wembley . To much national debate, Wembley Stadium, the recognized home of soccer in England -- the country where the sport originated -- was closed in 2000, ahead of a controversial proposal to raze it to the ground before building a new arena on the same site. Football cathedral prepares for final . The stadium's dramatic opening in 1923 set the trend for 77 years of iconic images. That year, an estimated crowd of over 200,000 piled in to the newly-built arena to watch the FA Cup final between Bolton and West Ham, spilling onto the pitch numerous times only to be dispersed by a policeman on a white horse. That initial ""White Horse Final"" proved the prelude for a lifetime of sporting and non-sporting memories that gives Wembley its legendary status. From local hero Henry Cooper knocking down the greatest heavyweight boxer of them all (Cassius Clay in 1963 before he changed his name to Muhammad Ali) to England captain Bobby Moore wiping his muddy hands before accepting the 1966 World Cup trophy from Queen Elizabeth II, Wembley Stadium has been at the forefront of English folklore. But perhaps the most famous date in the stadium's history fell on July 13, 1985, when 72,000 music fans attended Live Aid, a 10-hour concert to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia which featured some of the biggest names in British music history coming together on an emotional and unforgettable balmy evening. When the new $1.3 billion Wembley Stadium finally opened its doors in 2007, following various legal disputes between its constructors and the English Football Association, seven long years had passed. Now, four years later, the famous stadium will stage its biggest match since being rebuilt.","Manchester United will face Barcelona in the Champions League final at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- If Batman and Iron Man got together in the lab to patch together a new outfit, it might look like this. Meet the Lorica, a new suit of high-tech armor named after the armor worn by the Roman legions. It's made from a blend of lightweight, flexible materials and comes with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, a point-of-view camera, a microphone and 52 pressure sensors that send data to an external computer program. It's built by an Australian company that had real-world warriors, not superheroes, in mind. The idea? To let martial artists compete at full speed with weapons in much the way bare-fisted fighters currently do in mixed-martial arts competitions such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship. ""We have been overwhelmed,"" said David Pysden, CEO of Unified Weapons Master, referring to the response from martial artists who have seen the suits. ""We literally have heard from hundreds and hundreds of people who have been practicing for 20 or 30 years in weapons-based arts who have had no true way to test their skills without seriously injuring someone, or worse."" The suit was developed over the course of four years by a team of martial artists and engineers with a digital-tech background. One of the developers is an armorer who helped build more than 2,500 suits of armor for the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Aside from its obvious role as protection, the suit's key feature is a set of 52 impact sensors spaced throughout. When struck, those sensors transmit data, via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, telling a computer where, and how hard, the blow landed. ""We know the damage that would have occurred to an unprotected competitor if they weren't wearing the suit, and we can display that in real time,"" Pysden said. The system would allow fighters in a competition to score points with each successful blow against their opponents while eliminating the guesswork sometimes involved with human judges. If this all sounds like something you'd love to watch, Pysden and his team hope you're not alone. He said they're currently in talks with several production companies about broadcasting a tournament of weapons masters using the suits. He said the event most likely will occur late this year or in early 2015. ""You look at the popularity of combat sports in video games -- the public loves seeing people fight with weapons,"" he said. ""We can throw a Samurai master against a Chinese Shaolin staff master and see who comes out on top."" The Lorica suits that the company currently showcases online are elaborate prototypes. Pysden wouldn't put a price on the current suits but said ultimately they'd like to offer a simplified, and less expensive, version for sale to the public. UWM's patent for the suit also lists law-enforcement and military uses, though Pysden says he doesn't expect to ever see soldiers storming the barricades in his armor. ""It's about them using that technology in a training environment,"" he said. ""It's not something to wear out as riot gear -- there's plenty of stuff out there already. This is about teaching them at full speed how to respond to a weapons-based attack.""","Unified Weapons Master has developed a high-tech suit of armor .

"(CNN) -- Insomnia, the inability to fall or stay asleep, can make the days feel fuzzy and the nights never-ending. Insomniacs often get antidepressants instead of drugs designed to help them sleep, research has shown . The disorder can increase the risk for depression and suicidal thoughts, lower work productivity and even raise blood pressure, studies have shown. About 40 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders that prevent them from getting good rest. Singer Michael Jackson struggled with insomnia, a nutritionist who worked for him told CNN.  Sources close to Jackson told CNN that during a world tour in the mid-'90s,  the pop star traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night, then ""bring him back up."" Stress or traumatic events can trigger the sleeping disorder.  Insomnia drugs help the patient sleep, but they do not treat the underlying cause, which could be a result of another illness, life changes or shifting work schedules. And patients who seek relief for insomnia may not receive the most effective prescription. Over the last two decades, doctors treating sleep disorders have prescribed more antidepressants than insomnia drugs, according to several published analyses. And there is insufficient evidence that most antidepressants are effective in treating insomnia, concluded a National Institutes of Health panel that convened on the topic in 2005. Doctors may be factoring in cost considerations and their own familiarity with prescribing antidepressants relative to newer sleep medications, experts said. Some doctors prescribe antidepressants because their patients have both depression and insomnia. Insomnia and depression often occur together, but which is the cause and which is the symptom is often unclear. Depending on the patient's circumstances, a doctor might prescribe antidepressants as the primary treatment for insomnia; for example, if there is a history of addiction. But the Food and Drug Administration has not officially approved antidepressants for insomnia. ""There's inadequate body of information to support use of the unapproved treatment,"" said Dr. Vaughn McCall, medical director of the Sleep Center at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""I think the harm in it is the delay of effective treatment. You've made a decision to ignore the proven effective treatment and decided instead to do who knows what."" McCall said he treats an insomnia patient with sleeping drugs first.  When those options don't work, he turns to antidepressants. Sleep experts say some antidepressants can help a person sleep, but their sedating effects can wane over time. There's ""a lot of inappropriate prescribing for insomnia,"" said Rajesh Balkrishnan, the director of the Center for Medication Use, Policy, and Economics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Antidepressants could ""tranquilize you for a shorter period of time,"" about five to six hours, Balkrishnan said.  Insomnia drugs can produce deeper sleep levels for a longer period of time -- about eight to 12 hours, he said. Antidepressants balance the natural chemicals in the brain that are involved in regulating mood. The drugs can block reabsorption of the chemicals, such as serotonin, leaving more available in the brain. Side effects for antidepressants can include headache, night sweats, nausea, agitation, sexual problems and dry mouth. Sleep drugs work by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep. They carry risks of addiction and side effects such as grogginess, headaches, nausea and bizarre behavior while sleeping. There are stages of sleep, from drowsiness to progressively deeper relaxation. The entire sequence normally takes about an hour, and the fourth stage is considered the deepest. After that, people go into what's called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. After about 10 minutes into REM sleep, the brain cycles back to the four other stages (known as non-REM). The cycles repeat throughout the sleep time. The use of antidepressants to battle insomnia could be influenced by cost, since generic antidepressants cost less than brand-name insomnia drugs, doctors said. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of Ambien, called zolpidem, for short-term treatment of insomnia. Despite the availability of a less expensive generic version, many doctors continue to prescribe antidepressants, McCall said. Doctors might hesitate to prescribe some types of sleeping drugs because they belong to the same class of drugs, called benzodiazepines, as Xanax and Valium. These drugs can be highly addictive over chronic use.  But not all sleep drugs are benzodiazepines. A sample of 3,400 physicians' prescription practices published in the journal Sleep in 2004 showed that antidepressants were approximately 1.53 times more likely to be prescribed by American doctors than insomnia drugs. ""A lot of it is a holdover from the days where the perception was that sleeping pills would cause dependence and there would be abuse liability,"" said author James Walsh, executive director and senior scientist at the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in Chesterfield, Missouri. ""There was a feeling that they only worked for short periods of time and you develop tolerance to those medicines. Those impressions came from pills used until the 1970s."" Three of the top four most commonly prescribed drugs for insomnia were antidepressants, according to Walsh's 2004 article. Five years later, Walsh doubts many of the prescription practices have changed. ""There are still a lot of doctors prescribing antidepressants and other sedating medicine for insomnia even though those medicines haven't been studied very well for treatment of insomnia and have some different types of risks,"" Walsh said. But Balkrishnan said, ""You can't put the blame solely on prescribers,"" adding that some patients insist on certain medications and find ways to obtain those drugs, despite their doctor's best efforts. The alternative to taking pills is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which teaches the patient how to get better sleep hygiene and ways to avoid sleep-disturbing behaviors. Unlike drugs, this method has no side effects. Using anesthetics to get relief from sleep disorders is highly unusual and inappropriate, several doctors have told CNN. Jackson requested an anesthetic, saying, ""I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep,"" Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who worked for Jackson for a time, told CNN. Doctors say that if Jackson was being anesthetized to battle insomnia, it was a dangerous practice. The possible role of an anesthetic, called Diprivan -- also known as propofol -- has swirled since the pop singer's death on June 25. ""Propofol induces coma, it does not induce sleep,"" said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists.","Doctors prescribed more antidepressants for insomnia .
There is lack of evidence that antidepressants are effective for insomnia .
Practice may continue because some sleeping drugs are benzodiazepines .
About 40 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders that prevent good rest ."
"(CNN) -- Iselle has cleared Hawaii, and all tropical storm warnings have been canceled, the National Weather Service said Friday. It is still a tropical storm, as it drifts farther away from the state. Hurricane Julio should pass by over the weekend and is expected to track north of Hawaii, according to current predictions, sparing the state. But the weather service advised the public to remain diligent, as weather conditions and the forecast could change. Iselle's top winds weakened to 60 mph as it made landfall at 2:30 a.m. Friday along the Kau coast of the Big Island. Had the storm remained a hurricane, it would have been the first to hit Hawaii in decades. By Friday night, the National Weather Service canceled the tropical storm warnings for Maui County and Oahu. Kauai, however, remained under a tropical storm warning. A warning for Hawaii County was canceled earlier. A flash flood watch remained in place for the state through 6 a.m. Saturday. Iselle was still producing locally damaging wind gusts over the smaller islands, the statement said. The state's primary election was expected to take place Saturday despite the storm. Abercrombie, who has taken advantage of the storm to show leadership and appear on television, is in a tough race against State Sen. David Ige in the Democratic primary. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz faces a challenge from U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Schatz was appointed to the seat after the death of longtime Sen. Daniel Inouye. Heavy rains were the biggest threat, with general rainfall predicted to be between 4 and 8 inches, although some areas could get more than a foot. Flash flood warnings cover much of the Big Island, while flash flood watches have been issued for the entire state. Iselle has already delivered 11 inches of rain on the Big Island, according to Mike Cantin with the National Weather Service. In a conference call, Cantin said the Big Island should expect more than a foot of rain. Doug Mayne, of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said heavy rains have prevented the agency from beginning to assess the impact of the storm. Conditions made it unsafe to get helicopters in the air to access the hardest-hit areas. Hawaii Electric Light said in a tweet that nearly 22,000 customers were without power in various parts of the Big Island. As the storm approached, supermarket shelves were swept bare, while schools and government offices closed. Sandbags were placed around homes and hotels, and ports told to close. In Hawaii County, 630 people have gone to shelters, Mayor Billy Kenoi told CNN affiliate KHON-TV in Honolulu. Track the storm . The state had prepared for a potentially devastating one-two tropical cyclone punch, starting with Iselle and followed by Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm, about 900 miles behind it. Hurricane Julio could affect the islands over the weekend, though forecasters expect it to brush the state only with its southern outer bands as it passes to the north as a weakened tropical storm. Julio had strengthened to a Category 3 storm with top winds of 120 mph by Friday morning, when it was centered less than 1,000 miles away. A relatively rare event . Direct hits are rare for the state. Since the 1950s, two hurricane eyes have hit Hawaii -- and both approached from the south, where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms' strength. That's not to say Hawaii hasn't had close calls. The central Pacific sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year, and some have brushed the state in recent decades. The cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern Pacific. But close to Hawaii, dry air, cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones, dissipating them before they can become a significant threat, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures. This year hasn't met the criteria for El Nino, but it could in the weeks ahead, Petersons said. Iniki killed at least four people and caused about $2 billion in damage when it hit the western Hawaiian island of Kauai, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. School's out; air travel disrupted . The schools on the Big Island and Maui were closed Friday as residents assessed Iselle's impact. Some airlines made concessions to customers. Hawaiian Airlines moved one flight, to Los Angeles, up by five hours to beat Iselle's arrival. For people who had been scheduled to travel to or from Hawai's airports on Thursday and Friday, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said they won't charge fees to change reservations, and they'll waive differences in fares for those changes. United canceled flights to Hilo and Kona. American Airlines and US Airways also called off flights out of Kona on Thursday but expected Friday's flight schedule to operate normally. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta Air Lines said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply. It said two flights had been delayed in leaving the islands. CNN's Taylor Ward, Mariano Castillo, Katia Hetter, Tina Burnside and Tony Marco contributed to this report.","NEW: All tropical storm warnings have been canceled .

"(CNN) -- To adapt to the new era of gaming, Atari is returning to its roots. The gaming pioneer -- which spearheaded arcade games and home video-game consoles -- is reinventing itself to adapt to the era of mobile and social games. Atari has been synonymous with games and gaming since Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded it in 1972. The company's products, such as ""Pong"" and the Atari 2600, helped define the computer entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. About five years ago, the company got away from developing its own games to focus on publishing and distribution. Atari CEO Jim Wilson said it was a complicated time for the company and the brand. ""(Atari) got bought by this retail distribution company that focused primarily on building non-Atari brands and distributing third-party titles,"" Wilson said. ""The Atari name was then being used as a corporate name on a retail distribution company. That didn't make any sense to me."" Wilson wanted to take Atari back to its casual-gaming roots and recognized the best way to do so was to embrace the social and mobile change in the gaming landscape. He said there are new business models in gaming and the company finally is ready to take advantage of them. ""What we're doing is we're going out to the best and the brightest of the developers in the mobile business,"" he said. ""We're looking at different ways to reinterpret or reinvent our classic franchises in ways that people are playing games today in the business model that people are playing today."" Atari released ""Atari's Greatest Hits"" for the iOS in the spring of 2011 to a resounding cheer from fans. The game featured classic arcade games such as ""Centipede"" (Wilson's favorite as a kid), ""Lunar Lander"" and ""Missile Command"" as well as games from the Atari 2600 home console such as ""Adventure,"" ""Haunted House"" and ""Yars' Revenge."" The game in the Apple App Store has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times. It was recently made available in the Android Marketplace, further expanding the market for Atari products. ""The great thing about Atari and its very brand is that it is recognizable,"" Wilson said. ""You understand what it is, and frankly, in the App Store or the Android Marketplace, discoverability is a big issue for people who are releasing their games. One of the benefits of Atari is that it creates instant recognition and discoverability in the App Store and the Android Marketplace."" Wilson then focused on re-imagining some of Atari's classic titles to make them more appealing to today's gaming audience. Men older than 30 make up the company's core audience, he said, so they've grown up with Atari, and they have the money to spend on games. ""What we're looking to do is build games. Some of our games are going to have a much more broad appeal and, for us, the ability to generate a community. ""However, we also (want) to address a larger audience and that's what it's going to come down to -- making games that appeal to a broader audience."" ""Asteroids"" was the first game to be reinterpreted as ""Asteroids: Gunner,"" a top 10 best-seller in the App Store in its first two weeks in November. The free app game featured a new look and new weapons as well as the opportunity to purchase Space Bucks inside the game to enhance players' spaceships. ""We believe there are multiple ways to reinterpret 'Asteroids,' and 'Asteroids: Gunner' was a great opportunity for us to create a time-based, premium model that seemed to go over well with our core male audience,"" Wilson said. In December, the company released ""Breakout: Boost,"" which has garnered more than 2 million downloads in the App Store alone. The game offers five free levels and more than 200 others that can be purchased inside the game. It would be easy for Atari to continue to re-imagine and rerelease its classic titles, but Wilson said to appeal to a broader audience, the company is also working with developers on original intellectual properties that fit the Atari brand. The company expects to release 10 to 15 new titles in the next year, with about five of those coming from outside developers, he said. They will hold true to the Atari brand but could appeal to those gamers outside the male-dominated, core audience of traditional Atari games. Wilson is counting on a blend of reinterpreted classics and original games for the social and mobile gaming arena to drive Atari's business for the near future. The company has slimmed down to 65 employees, most of whom are targeting the mobile gaming platform. ""If we stay true to the original brand ideas and we work with some of the best talent in the industry and we listen to our consumers, I think we have a very good opportunity to make a big statement and bring Atari to a new stage,"" he said. ""We have an opportunity to bring back a powerful brand that consumers know and love.""","Atari has been synonymous with games and gaming since its founding in 1972 .

"Washington (CNN) -- To the list of instructions you hear at airport checkpoints, add this: ""Put your palms forward, please."" The Transportation Security Administration soon will begin randomly swabbing passengers' hands at checkpoints and airport gates to test them for traces of explosives. Previously, screeners swabbed some carry-on luggage and other objects as they searched for the needle in the security haystack -- components of terrorist bombs in an endless stream of luggage. But after the Christmas Day attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit, Michigan, the TSA began a program of swabbing passengers' hands, which could be contaminated by explosive materials, experts say. The TSA will greatly expand the swabbing in the coming weeks, the agency said. ""The point is to make sure that the air environment is a safe environment,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN. ""We know that al Qaeda [and other] terrorists continue to think of aviation as a way to attack the United States. One way we keep it safe is by new technology [and] random use of different types of technology."" Security experts consulted by CNN said swabbing hands is a good move, and privacy advocates said they support the new swabbing protocols, provided the agency tests only for security-related objects and does not discriminate when it selects people to be tested. It's a ""very good idea,"" said security expert Tony Fainberg. TSA screeners currently swab luggage handles and parts of bags that are likely be contaminated by human hands, he said, and swabbing a person's hands increases the chances of finding explosive materials. ""Looking at the hands means you will probably get a better dose,"" he said. Under the new protocols, tests will be conducted at various locations -- including in checkpoint lines, during the screening process and at gates. Newer, more portable machines make it easier to conduct tests away from fixed locations such as the checkpoint. The TSA has more than 7,000 explosive trace detection (ETD) machines and has purchased 400 additional units with $16 million in federal stimulus money. The president's fiscal 2011 budget calls for $60 million to purchase approximately 800 portable ETD machines. Napolitano said the tests will not significantly increase wait times at airport checkpoints. The American Civil Liberties Union has ""always supported explosive detection as a good form of security that doesn't really invade privacy,"" said Jay Stanley, an attorney and privacy expert with the organization. Stanley said the ACLU is chiefly concerned that the TSA does not discriminate when selecting people for enhanced screening -- something the agency said it does not do -- and that it treat people with dignity. ""We would not want to see it implemented in a discriminatory fashion, for example, in a disproportionate way against Muslims and Arabs or, for example, people with red hair or anything else. Security experts from across the spectrum will tell you that that's not just unfair and unjust and not the American way, it's also a terrible way to do security,"" Stanley said. Swabbing also should not be used to test for nonsecurity-related contraband, such as drugs, he said. ""Under the Constitution, searches in airports are only for the purpose of protecting the security of airline transportation; they are not general law enforcement stops. And so it wouldn't be permissible for the government to use these trace portal detectors to look for drugs,"" Stanley said. The TSA said the machines test only for explosives. It declined to specify which explosives, citing security reasons. Because some legal substances -- such as fertilizers and heart medicines -- can result in ""false positives,"" Stanley said the ACLU also wants to ensure that people who test positive be treated respectfully. ""It's important that the government treat people who do show up as a positive -- fairly and with dignity -- and not parade them off in handcuffs and treat them as terrorists, but do rational things to investigate what the problem might be,"" he said. But swabbing hands does not, by itself, raise civil liberty problems, Stanley said. ""There's really not a big privacy interest at stake here,"" he said. ""They are basically looking for particles of explosives, which is not something that people normally have.""","After Christmas Day attack, agency to begin random swabbings .

"Murrysville, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A day after a Murrysville, Pennsylvania, teen allegedly rampaged through his high school's hallways, stabbing wildly with two kitchen knives, the first hints of a possible motive began to emerge. The attorney for 16-year-old Alex Hribal raised the specter that his client may have been bullied, telling CNN affiliate WTAE in Pittsburgh on Thursday that it looks like some kind of ""bullying event"" may have played a role. ""I think a lot of things have happened. I don't want to comment specifically, but I think there are some things that occurred that led to where we are today,"" Patrick Thomassey said. But an FBI official, familiar with the investigation, discounted bullying as a motive. ""He was disaffected but not bullied,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. Hribal, a sophomore, was charged as an adult and faces four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault in connection with Wednesday's attack at Franklin Regional Senior High School that left 20 teens and one adult wounded. Some classmates at the school describe Hribal as having few friends and being quiet but also as a ""really nice kid,"" a description that contradicts the image of a knife-wielding teen offered by authorities. Murrysville Police Chief Tom Seefeld said investigators haven't yet made sense of the mass stabbing. ""We believe, through the investigation, that this was random,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We don't have anybody that was targeted, as far as we know at this point."" Still, there were more questions than answers about what led the teen to allegedly attack his classmates with two steak knives believed to have been taken from his family's home. ""We're going to try to figure out what happened here. Obviously, there's a problem. You just don't leave and go to school, and do what he did yesterday,"" Thomassey told CNN earlier in the day. There is ""some deep-rooted problem somewhere that caused him to do this."" One thread that police are looking into is the possibility that there was a phone threat the night before, Seefeld said. But no immediate evidence has been found to confirm such a call, and Thomassey discounted the allegation. ""He was home all night the night before this occurred, with his parents,"" he told WTAE. ""They did not see him on the phone arguing with anybody."" The FBI has seized electronics belonging to Hribal, including a computer and cell phone, and will analyze them for any clues, the police chief said. In a telephone call Thursday, President Barack Obama assured Franklin Principal Ron Suvak that the FBI will continue to assist in the investigation, the White House said. 'All kind of a blur' Questions are also being raised by residents of Murrysville, a quiet middle-class enclave with a population of 20,000 east of Pittsburgh. How did this happen, and why? ""We are so small compared to other communities,"" said Paula Fisher, who left Pittsburgh to move to Murrysville almost 20 years ago. ""I came out here purposely to raise my children in a school district that we felt was safe as well as academically sound."" The mother of one of the teens wounded in the attack said everyone must ask themselves what alienated the suspect so much that he allegedly stabbed and slashed nearly two dozen people. ""...We need to look and say, how are our children coping with social skills these days? How are they with other children? How are they being tested in the world for negative or positive ways?"" said Amanda Hurt. Her son, Brett, was in the school hallway when he saw a ""kid"" run by and hit him in the back. A friend who was with him started screaming. ""I didn't really know what was going on at the time,"" Hurt told reporters. ""It was all kind of a blur."" As the attacker continued to charge down the crowded hallway, Hurt began to wonder if he was going to survive or die. Speaking from the hospital, Hurt said he suffered a stab wound in the back and a bruised lung. He expected to be released as early as Thursday. He reflected on whether Hribal would have chosen the path he allegedly did if he had had more friends or a better support group. ""I feel he has some issues he has to work out,"" Hurt said. Another student at the school who witnessed the attack said the attacker didn't utter a word. ""He was very quiet. He just was kind of doing it,"" Mia Meixner said. ""And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around, just stabbing whoever was in his way."" The attack ended when the assistant principal, Sam King, tackled the teen, authorities said. The accused attacker, Hribal, lived on the same street as King, just two houses down. Heroes in all forms step up during school stabbing . 'Not a dysfunctional family' Hribal couldn't seem more normal, the way his lawyer describes him. ""This is not a dysfunctional family,"" Thomassey, told CNN on Thursday. ""They're like the Brady Bunch. These parents are active with their two sons, and we're trying to figure out what happened."" The young man also did not seem to embody the cliche of digitally connected youth. According to Dan Stevens, the county deputy emergency management coordinator, Hribal had a very minor Facebook presence and didn't have much experience on Twitter. Thomassey said he would file a motion to move the case to juvenile court. Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck has argued against bail, saying that there could be no conditions that would protect the community and that Hribal made ""statements when subdued by officials that he wanted to die."" Hribal is being held without bail at the Westmoreland County juvenile detention center. He was treated for injuries to his hands, police said. The students who were hurt range in age from 14 to 17, emergency coordinator Stevens said. The injuries were stabbing-related, such as lacerations or punctures. CNN's Pamela Brown and Mary Kay Mallonee reported from Murrysville, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Mariano Castillo, Miguel Marquez, Chris Cuomo, Stephanie Gallman, Paul Courson and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","NEW: FBI official says teen accused in stabbings was ""disaffected,"" but not bullied .

"(CNN) -- The debut of the tiny $35 Raspberry Pi computer crashed its distributors' websites on the way to selling out within hours of launch. Looking like little more than a credit card-sized chip of circuit board, the powerful, fully-programmable PC can plug into any TV and can power 3D graphics and Blu-ray video playback. Its British-based designers at the Raspberry Pi Foundation hope the computer, which has been in the works for six years, will spark new interest in programming among children. ""The primary goal was to build a low cost computer that every child could own, and one where programming was the natural thing to do with it,"" said co-founder Robert Mullins. The computer's miniature uncased circuit board is crowded with an Ethernet connection for the internet, two USB ports and an SD card port for memory and is powered by a standard USB mobile charger. The low-cost computer runs a free, open-source Linux operating system and does not include a monitor or keyboard. The first version of the Raspberry Pi will ship soon to developers, and the hope is that they will design software that will enable children to design their own computer programs. The project came about when a group of Cambridge-based computer programmers noticed that fewer and less-qualified students were applying for computer science courses at Cambridge University. Inspired by computers like the BBC Micro and the Commodore 64 in the 1980s, the group of engineers set out to build a new programmable machine for a new generation. ""Each year we had fewer and fewer students applying, and most of them hadn't really done much more than write a web page,"" Raspberry Pi co-founder Eben Upton told CNN. ""So we kind of set out to recreate that feeling of the BBC Micro in the hopes it would spark a new wave of kids knowing how to program."" Upton told CNN that an even cheaper version of the computer, which will retail for just $25, is going into production within the next several weeks. In the long term, he hopes the computer will generate an additional 1,000 engineers in the UK each year -- an ""industry-changing development"", according to Upton. ""Anyone who expresses a desire to get into designing software should have a platform to do it,"" he said.","$35 credit card-sized Raspberry Pi computer sells out within hours of launch .

"(CNN) -- It's what so many girls and women dream of: That one special man, down on one knee, asking for her hand in marriage, holding out a sparkling engagement ring. But what if he bought the ring while he was picking up a jug of milk, a tub of butter and a jumbo pack of toilet paper? Would it take away some of the romance if he bought it at a warehouse membership store? OK, now take a closer look at the ring, because it could be worth $1 million. Are you breathless and giddy yet? Well, the groom-to-be probably wouldn't pack up the ring with his groceries because Costco is selling the 6.2-carat one-of-a-kind solitaire diamond ring, valued at $1,496,255 by the International Gemological Institute, only to members online for $1 million. But would the blushing bride-to-be showing off her super-sized bling face a potentially embarrassing question: ""Where did he buy it?"" There should be no stigma there, says HLN money expert Clark Howard, because ""nobody asks a woman where her diamond came from."" Howard bought his wife's engagement ring at a membership store ""because it was a deal, and she loved it."" ""The best part about buying a diamond from Costco is the right to return for a full refund for any reason at any time,"" Clark said. ""That is unheard of in the jewelry business."" Costco officials say they've seen a rise in jewelry sales since their e-commerce site went live five years ago. Their biggest sale so far is an engagement ring that sold for close to $500,000. Warehouse competitor Sam's Club also offers diamond engagement rings and luxury jewelry online. Currently, their highest priced item tops Costco's - a 97.68 carat total weight yellow and white diamond necklace set in platinum priced just under $2 million. Costco has received serious inquiries about its million-dollar ring, senior vice president Ginnie Roeglin said. ""Costco appeals to a high demographic profile,"" Roeglin said. ""We offer top-quality merchandise at a terrific value."" The company has recently marketed itself as a discount destination for couples tying the knot -- selling rings, invitations, gourmet food and drink, and even designer wedding gowns. But some couples say a (hopefully) once-in-a-lifetime purchase of this kind requires personalized service. Jack Guest says he shopped online and in stores a few months before finding the perfect diamond for his fiancee. The health care marketing professional decided to buy his ring at Buckhead Diamond, a small family-owned jewelry boutique in Atlanta. Guest said he didn't mind paying a little extra for his fiancee's ring because it was important to get to know the people who sold it. ""There's still something to be said for the local merchant,"" Guest said. ""They have value-added services, such as ring cleaning anytime she wants to stop by."" Buckhead Diamond owner David Ben Moshe says the ""Costco pricing mentality"" takes away the ""magic"" of purchasing such a personal piece of jewelry. ""If you are going to give your girlfriend an engagement ring, and she's going to see it among bread and tomatoes, she's not going to feel that special,"" he said.","A membership-only warehouse store is selling a diamond ring online for $1 million .

"(CNN) -- Three Delaware day care workers were arrested after police got hold of a ""disturbing"" and ""shocking"" cell phone video that, authorities say, shows two toddlers taking part in a fight the workers had organized. Police said Tuesday that they arrested Tiana Harris, 19; Estefania Myers, 21; and Lisa Parker, 47, who have been charged with assault, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy. On Saturday, authorities responded to an unrelated incident and a person whom police would not identify showed them video of the 3-year-old boys fighting in March. The toddlers were not seriously injured, but they were ""clearly hurting each other,"" said Dover Police Capt. Tim Stump. Authorities have not released the video but say one day care worker said ""No pinching, only punching"" after one of the boys complained that the other had pinched him. The video purportedly shows seven other children seated in the room with their backs to the fighting, according to police. ""It's not like they didn't know what was going on, and they were just encouraging them to continue,"" Stump said. ""One of the children attempted to run, but one of the teachers pushes him back into the fray. ""We are looking into the possibility that this was not the first time it happened, but it appears to be isolated, and it seems the administration was in the dark about this,"" he added. Police made the arrests Monday and addressed the incident that evening with parents and guardians of the children who attended the day care center. A spokesman for the state Division of Family Services said the agency dispatched an institutional abuse investigator to work with Dover police during their investigation. ""Depending on our findings, these women could be prohibited from working in the public sector, especially with children or senior citizens,"" agency spokesman Joseph Smack said, adding that all three women had passed background checks before their employment at the center. ""It's rare to see a case like this where the staff encouraged this type of behavior,"" Smack said.

"(CNN) -- San Francisco's lesser-known bridge unveiled a new look Tuesday night. As part of a unique art project celebrating its 75th anniversary, the West span of the Bay Bridge has been outfitted with 25,000 LED lights that will display a variety of undulating designs nightly for the next two years. Organizers say it is the world's largest light sculpture. ""Light has a very universal quality, almost anyone can see it and have some response to it. It's operating on a very primal level,"" said artist Leo Villareal, who has been working on the project for the past two and a half years. He says his goal with the Bay Bridge installation was to create a ""digital campfire."" The utilitarian grey bridge cuts a striking figure in the bay and transports 250,000 cars a day, but it has never been a tourist attraction like the nearby Golden Gate bridge. The Bay Bridge, which opened just six months before the Golden Gate in November 1936, can't compete with its neighbor's iconic touches: epic views, vivid orange paint job and art deco detailing. San Francisco officials hope the Bay Lights project will change that perception and boost tourism to the area. They estimate 50 million people will see the lights, and that the influx of tourists over the next two years will generate $97 million for the local economy. The project's overall cost is $8 million, $6 million of which has already been raised by organizers. The Bay Bridge lights will fire up nightly at dusk and turn off at 2 a.m. every night until 2015. The energy-efficient lights cost $30 a night to power for those seven hours. Villareal, who has works the Museum of Modern Art in New York CIty and the National Gallery in D.C., said one of the earliest mock-ups of the Bay Lights project was a one-minute computer animation. He worked with Ben Davis, producer Amy Critchett and a team of employees, volunteers and city departments to blow up those those tiny pixels into a huge computerized light sculpture. The final result is 25,000 LED lights strung up along the 1.8-mile stretch of bridge connecting San Francisco and Treasure Island. The individual lights are spaced 12 inches apart and each one can be set to one of 255 brightness levels. The designs Villareal created and programmed to flicker across the bridge don't include any images or text, and the sequence won't ever repeat itself. ""What people will be seeing are abstract sequences which are inspired by the kinetic activity around the bridge,"" said Villareal. ""It's not literally traffic or the water or any of those sorts of things."" The designs were also inspired by Villareal's previous experiences in the Bay Area in the 1990s, when he worked in a research lab in Palo Alto and attended the Burning Man festival. The result is an open-ended piece of art that Villareal calls highly subjective. Lights might dim slowly from the edges or shapes will unexpectedly dart across the surface like comets. The movements are playful, relaxing and unpredictable. ""You can imagine anything you want in these lights. For me, it's the mustache,"" said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who sports a signature tuft of hair on his upper lip. Lee was on hand for the opening ceremony, along with California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. While designing the sequences, Villareal had to address practical issues like safety for passing boats and drivers on the bridge, as well as artistic considerations such as making sure the animations were viewable from up close, below the bridge, and as far away as Twin Peaks, where the bridge can been seen on fog-free nights. After obtaining permits and securing funding, trimming the bridge was the final daunting step of the project. Teams worked from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. over the past few months to install the fiber optic network, choosing late night hours in order to have minimal impact on bridge traffic. They used custom clips to hang the lights on 300 vertical spans, mounting some lights as high as 500 feet. Locals have caught peeks of the final product over the past couple of months as producers tested the lighting system ahead of the big debut. On Tuesday, the hard work finally paid off as crowds of onlookers braved rain, cold winds and a few rogue waves to see the light display's first official showing. Artist Carolyn Tillie and her husband brought chairs, picnic food and wine to the show. Others accessorized outfits and even bikes with blinking lights to celebrate the occasion. Mayor Lee predicted an extended lifespan for the project, saying the city will want to keep the display longer than its two-year engagement. He hopes it will help give San Francisco the reputation as a location for world class art. Relieved to finally hit the On button for the project after years of work, Villareal isn't thinking that far into the future at the moment. ""We'll cross that bridge when we get to it,"" he said.","San Francisco's Bay Bridge was has been trimmed in 25,000 LED lights for a new art project .

"Mbabane, Swaziland (CNN) -- We met her in the car park of a small shopping mall on the edge of Mbabane, Swaziland's capital. She was too shy to get out of the car her friend had brought her in, too nervous of who might see, or what might be overheard. She told us that she knew an isolated place where we could talk. Ten minutes later we are in scrubland standing by the rubble and remains of someone's home. Here Nelsie - not her real name - stops fiddling with her plastic necklace and starts looking me in the eye, but even that appears to take considerable effort. She tells me that for the last two years, since both her parents died in a car crash, she has lived on the periphery, isolated from her remaining family and society. ""Right now I don't feel that I am a human being"" she confesses. ""Right now I am scared to greet my family because if I say that I am a prostitute all of the people will just say that I am a prostitute"". She wants us to know that this was not her first choice; she did try to find work. ""Here in Swaziland there are no jobs"" she says. The necklace fiddling starts again. ""I have no choice to be a sex worker, whether I like it or not, I must do that"". Tucked away in one corner of Swaziland's annual International Trade Fair we find the HIV/AIDS stands. It is an unusual addition at a trade fair but then so is the large number of children who have come here for a day out with their parents; there is barely a businessman or woman in sight. These stands are testimony to a tragic accolade; Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV and AIDS in the world. A staggering one in four people have HIV/AIDS in Swaziland. Read related: Opinion: How to end AIDS . At one stand Zelda Nhlabatsi, who runs the Family Life Association of Swaziland, is trying to raise awareness about the disease. The free condoms on her table seem to have attracted quite a crowd. Her organization offers support and education to sex workers and she believes there is a growing number of women, just like Nelsie, who are turning to prostitution because of the country's financial woes. ""Everyone needs food, those are basic needs and the unemployment rate is quite high so sex work for most people is a livelihood you know"". And the situation is likely to get worse she warns me. ""You are going to be seeing more and more people engaging in different kinds of work, including sex work."" Swaziland's government blames the financial woes on a drop in income from the Southern African Customs Union following a new tariff deal. Organizations like the IMF have urged Swaziland's government to cut its bloated civil service, reduce spending and attract foreign investors. At the height of the crisis, anti retrovirals were scarce, cancer treatment was stopped and schools were closed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment in Swaziland is currently over fifty percent. Political parties may be banned here but the unions are emboldened and have led angry protests on the streets. Read related: South African girl brides abducted as fabled HIV cure . South Africa's President Zuma has offered some respite after the IMF refused Swaziland a loan. A three hundred and fifty five million dollar bailout was agreed but so far, none of that money has materialized. Majozi Sithole, Swaziland's Finance minister, tells me. ""Right now I am not sure, we are waiting for the South Africans to engage with us whether that money is still available or not and if it is then we will gladly take it. It will assist us in meeting some of the fiscal challenges that we are currently facing but if it is not available then we are already taking steps to say let's look at what we have."" Critics of King Mswati believe he and his array of wives have contributed to the financial demise of this small landlocked kingdom. There are reports of shopping trips to Europe, a private jet from a private sponsor and plans for a second international airport for a country with just over one million people. However, the country's finance minister denies this. ""I can assure you that his Majesty, the Royal Family, they never overspend in what they have been allocated. If there are any challenges then they are in other ministries,"" he tells me when we met him in his office. ""Those who would blame it on his Majesty they do not have the information, he never overspends, we discuss the fiscal challenges on a weekly basis, I brief him, he has concerns and he will, as he did this year, say whatever you work don't even increase my budget because I understand the fiscal situation."" Read related: India's sex slaves face lifelong cycle of abuse . Sitting on a block of rubble with the sun fast descending behind her, Nelsie tells me she always wants the men she meets to use condoms. ""I am HIV positive, I have got HIV by rape, I was raped. While I was not raped I was HIV negative because I did not like to sleep with a man without a condom."" She and around 20 other women working in the neighborhood hide in the shadows of the night waiting for a car to pull up. To feed herself she says she has to have sex with twenty men in two weeks ""but sometimes in a day I used to sleep with five or six men"". Like many people who are struggling to make a living in Swaziland, there is no respite or prospect of a bailout. ""In this work we will die so while they do not think about us I do not think they are making an improvement in this country. We know that our economy is down but they must try, whether to supply us with food, whether to supply us with work.""","A growing number of people in Swaziland are turning to prostitution because of unemployment .

"Katherine Sutherland, an OB-GYN in Mountain View, California, knows something about terrible periods -- and not just from her patients. She used to go through tampons every hour, excusing herself to go to the bathroom between appointments. Heavy bleeding made doing what she really loved --hiking -- especially difficult. Truth is, she wanted her period to go away altogether. In 2003 Sutherland, then age 51, got her wish. She had a minor surgical procedure called endometrial ablation, or by its brand name, NovaSure, to remove her uterine lining and stop heavy bleeding. And she hasn't had a period since. ""I was delighted,"" she says. ""Up until that time I'd never missed one period."" Sutherland recently hiked 8,000 feet to the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu in Peru. About two-thirds of regularly menstruating women have premenstrual symptoms. Many women, perhaps 95 percent, have period issues -- bleeding like Sutherland's, debilitating pain, out-of-control PMS, or annoyances such as constipation or diarrhea. Thanks to a variety of new remedies that can make over (or eliminate!) periods, you don't have to suffer. We've collected the best fixes for five of your most common problems. Killer cramps . Virtually all women in their childbearing years have period pain (or dysmenorrhea). In fact, it's a leading reason for calling in sick to work or school. ""Your uterus is a muscle, and it squeezes really hard,"" says Susan Haas, M.D., an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University. ""Sometimes it can squeeze so hard it blocks the arteries coming into it. Just like in a heart attack, when the arteries are blocked, it causes pain."" Health.com: Pelvic pain -- solve the mystery . The fixes . Naproxen, aspirin, and ibuprofen help by short-circuiting the production of pain-causing chemicals called prostaglandins that are involved in muscle contractions. They work best if you start an hour before your cramps hit. ""Load up with a double dose and keep the blood level up,"" Haas says. (The maximum safe daily dose of ibuprofen is 2,400 milligrams, or 12 200-mg pills. Take the minimum dosage that works for you.) Right when you get your period, start with 800 mg and then go to 600 mg every six hours. But talk to your doctor if you have elevated heart disease risks; the Food and Drug Administration recently reported that all NSAIDs, except aspirin, may heighten cardiovascular risks. And remember that extended use of high dosages of aspirin or NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal troubles. Omega-3 fats from fish oil seem to block prostaglandin production, too. And research shows that women with low intakes of omega-3s have more painful periods. While mainstream docs are mostly neutral on the idea of increasing omega-3s to fight period pain, some think it makes sense. Heat is an old-fashioned, but useful remedy for relaxing crampy muscles. Get out your heating pad, or try new nonprescription heat wraps, which last for eight hours and can be worn under clothes. Health.com: Your guide to fibroid fixes . Severe bleeding . Ten million American women have heavy bleeding, also called menorrhagia. (The average woman loses about three to four tablespoons per cycle; more than five tablespoons is considered heavy.) The fixes . NovaSure, in which a wand is inserted into the uterus through the cervix, emits energy that, in most cases, permanently removes the uterine lining. It's best for women who, like Katherine Sutherland, no longer want to have children. (Getting pregnant after having the uterine lining removed could be risky.) The five-minute procedure is done in a gynecologist's office. Many women report lighter bleeding right away. And a recent study found that after seven years, more than 95 percent stopped having periods. The 365-day birth-control pill, called Lybrel, is another way to skip monthly menstruation. Approved by the FDA in May, Lybrel has no placebo pills, so you just keep taking an active pill each day. (Breakthrough bleeding can be an issue for about 20 percent of users. And, since Lybrel contains estrogen, it's not for women who are prone to blood clots, such as smokers, who get migraines with an aura or who are over age 35 with elevated heart disease risks.) Health.com: Is it safe to ditch your period? If you'd prefer having a period, just with less bleeding, the traditional pill is also useful for curbing heavy flow. Its constant level of progesterone causes the endometrium to develop a much thinner lining. During your week of placebo pills, you get a lighter period because you shed a thinner lining over time. Another option is to have a period just four times a year: With Seasonale and Seasonique you take 84 active pills in a row. Mirena may be for you if pill-taking isn't your thing. This intrauterine device secretes progestin on a daily basis, thinning the uterine lining so there's virtually nothing to shed. ""One-third of women get no period, one-third get a much lighter period, and the other third have only irregular spotting,"" says Dan I. Lebovic, M.D., a reproductive endocrinology and fertility specialist at the University of Michigan Health System. Drawbacks? Pain during insertion, and possible cramps and bleeding for about three weeks afterward. Punishing PMS . About two-thirds of regularly menstruating women have premenstrual symptoms, says Jean Endicott, Ph.D., director of the Premenstrual Evaluation Unit at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. It could be headaches, breast tenderness, or big, unpleasant mood swings. Up to 8 percent of women who have PMS suffer mood changes severe enough to cause problems in their personal lives and daily routines; this more serious version of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD. The fixes Calcium supplements are a good first thing to try, Endicott says, because research shows they ease symptoms. (Calcium may help even out hormone levels, although no one knows for sure why it works.) Besides, most women don't get enough calcium in their diets anyway. She suggests 1,200 mg daily, and not just on the day you're PMS-ing. ""It should help take the edge off"" over time, Endicott says. Daily exercise -- like fast walking, lifting weights, or even dancing -- may be the last thing you want to do when in the throes of PMS, but it has proven antidepressant and antianxiety effects. Antidepressants (Paxil, Prozac, Sarafem, and Zoloft, to name a few) can relieve severe symptoms. The new twist is that you don't have to take one daily -- but instead as soon as you feel anxious. ""We tell (women who choose this option) to put a red flag on the calendar noting when they're likely to have symptoms so they remember to take the medication beforehand, when it can be most effective,"" Endicott says. Another choice: Yaz, a birth-control pill that's FDA-approved to treat PMDD. Clinical trials show it can cut symptoms by at least half, though the reasons are unclear. Gastro upsets . Many women have diarrhea, gas, or constipation during their periods. Prostaglandins, the chemicals that cause cramping in your uterus, do the same in your bowels. ""For lots of women, it's common to have a loose stool or diarrhea on the day they have a lot of bleeding,"" says Leslie Miller, M.D., University of Washington-Seattle clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology. The fixes . Fiber can help keep GI issues under control. Aim for 30 grams a day from cereal, fruit with the skin, and vegetables. But don't add fiber to your diet too fast when you get your period; that could worsen diarrhea. For constipation, check your habits. Miller says women often hold in bowel movements because they're in public places. Before you know it, you are bloated and constipated. ""When you get the urge, go,"" Miller advises. Ibuprofen and other similar anti-inflammatory medicines may reduce gastro cramping. To avoid tummy irritation, take it with food. All of the above . Some women experience a combo of excessive bleeding, cramping, breast tenderness, headaches, PMS, and other troubles. What to do? The fix . Stop treating the individual symptoms. Miller recommends continuous birth control pills -- you just skip the placebo week and move on to your next pack. If your insurer won't pay for that, ask about Lybrel and the other pill options. Also, consider NovaSure if childbearing isn't in your future. E-mail to a friend . Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- More than $800,000 in cash, 30 firearms and fake IDs were found at the Santa Monica, California, apartment of fugitive mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who will be taken to Boston to face a string of charges, including multiple murders, the FBI said Thursday. Sporting glasses and a white beard, Bulger appeared relaxed Thursday at a Los Angeles hearing. He did not seek bond, according to a spokesman for federal prosecutors. It was not clear when the longtime fugitive will be transported. The FBI indicated the move may occur Friday. Bulger's girlfriend also was arrested. U.S. Magistrate Judge John E. McDermott asked Bulger if he was aware of the two existing indictments against him. ""I know them. I know them all. Thank you,"" he politely answered. Bulger, a Boston mobster on the lam for 16 years, ""appeared to be a guy who was healthy, vibrant and knew what was going on,"" said assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Dugdale. Bulger, 81, faces multiple charges related to alleged criminal enterprises that spanned two decades. He currently has a federal public defender. Bulger, subject of a $2 million FBI reward, has been living in a Santa Monica apartment and was arrested outside it, the FBI said Thursday. He is charged with 19 counts of murder and a slew of other crimes. Acting on a tip, members of the Fugitive Task Force staked out the residence Wednesday and arrested Bulger and Catherine Elizabeth Greig, 60, who was inside the home, said FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers. Greig is suspected of harboring Bulger. Neither put up a fight, authorities said. After the arrests, members of the Fugitive Task Force, which included the FBI and police, searched the apartment. Besides the cash and false pieces of identification, agents found 30 firearms, including pistols, rifles and shotguns and several knives, said Steven Martinez, FBI assistant director in charge in Los Angeles. The tipster called the FBI's Los Angeles office on Tuesday, and the information led authorities to the apartment, Martinez said. He would not divulge the city from which the call came. ""We were not aware he was in L.A.,"" Martinez said of Bulger. Asked by reporters if it was embarrassing to the FBI that Bulger, who reportedly used an alias, and Greig were hiding in plain sight, Martinez said, ""I wouldn't say embarrassing. I would say challenging. ""It's not the first time that a fugitive has evaded justice for many years,"" Martinez continued. ""But he was not able to be successful ultimately."" Martinez described Bulger and Greig's apartment as close to the beach. The apartment is near Santa Monica's shopping and tourist strip, an open-air corridor called the Third Street Promenade. CNN Boston affiliate WCVB said it obtained booking photos of the pair. In one photo, Bulger is smiling. Federal prosecutors have portrayed Bulger as a violent and dangerous man whose criminal enterprise included gambling, extortion, loansharking, narcotics and the alleged murders of people who got in the way or knew too much. Tipped off by an FBI agent about an impending racketeering indictment, Bulger disappeared into wanted posters and lore. The search even reached Italy, where a reported sighting of the South Boston crime figure didn't pan out. The end of the manhunt for one of the nation's most notorious gangsters came within days of the FBI launching a publicity campaign, airing ads about Greig in 14 markets across the country where the couple were known to have ties, authorities said. The arrests were a ""direct result"" of the media campaign, authorities said. The tip came in about 8 p.m. PT Tuesday (11 p.m. ET), DesLauriers said. Less than 24 hours later, Bulger -- one of the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted fugitives and the inspiration for the 2006 Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed"" -- was in custody. ""At approximately 5:45 Pacific Standard Time (8:45 p.m. ET Wednesday), using a ruse, agents and other task force members lured Mr. Bulger out of his apartment,"" DesLauriers said. Authorities did not detail what the ruse was. The agents determined Bulger's identity and arrested him ""without incident,"" then went in the house and arrested Greig, DesLauriers said. In addition to the murder counts, Bulger is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, narcotics distribution and money-laundering charges, the FBI said. He was an FBI informant before he fled in 1995. Some of the allegations go back 40 years, and it was unclear Thursday how many potential trial witnesses survive. Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said she believes the death penalty is not an option in the federal charges Bulger faces in her district, but that she believes he could face the death penalty for two cases outside the district. The arrest ""marks a milestone in an investigation of drug trafficking, murder and corruption by Bulger and his cohorts,"" said Michael Ferguson, assistant special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Agency's Boston field office, standing alongside DesLauriers and other officials at a news conference. FBI Director Robert Mueller traveled to Boston on Thursday to meet and congratulate staff involved in Bulger's capture. Mueller was an assistant U.S. attorney in Boston in the 1980s, during the height of Bulger's reign. Bulger -- known to alter his appearance through disguises -- was ""considered armed and extremely dangerous,"" according to his description on the FBI's Most Wanted list. ""He has a violent temper and is known to carry a knife at all times."" ""He's definitely a legend back there,"" Jimmy LeBlanc, who lives in California and used to live in Boston, told CNN affiliate KABC-TV. ""You've heard all the stories, things he's done, corruption and all that. A lot of people said, 'Oh he's dead,' or maybe they don't want to see him get caught. He might take down the whole FBI if he starts talking."" Sandra Patient of Manchester, New Hampshire, said she was elated and relieved to learn that the man accused of killing her uncle, Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett, was in custody. Patient said Barrett was killed after he robbed a bank and Bulger wasn't happy with the amount he was given. ""Does he sleep at night?"" Patient asked CNN New Hampshire affiliate, referring to Bulger. On Tuesday, the FBI began airing a 30-second public service announcement, buying about 350 spots in 14 U.S. cities. The ad focused on Greig and targeted female viewers around the same age. It described her as loving dogs and other animals and frequenting beauty salons. It said she had worked as a dental hygienist and has had multiple plastic surgeries. An ""avid reader with an interest in history,"" Bulger was known to frequent libraries and historic sites, the FBI said. The agent who tipped Bulger about an impending indictment, John Connolly, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for racketeering and obstruction of justice. Connolly was later also sentenced to 40 years in prison for a mob-related killing of a witness who was about to testify against Boston mob members. Prosecutors said Connolly was corrupted by his two highest-ranking snitches: Bulger and Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. Bulger's brother William, former president of the Massachusetts State Senate, had no comment Thursday morning when a Boston Globe reporter approached him at his South Boston home. William Bulger stepped down as president of the University of Massachusetts in 2003 after months of pressure by then-Gov. Mitt Romney. He had accused Bulger of being evasive during congressional testimony about his fugitive brother's whereabouts. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer, Michael Martinez, Carol Cratty, Paul Vercammen, Josh Levs and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","More than $800,000 found at residence, source says .

"London (CNN) -- Europe's leaders are battling to keep the eurozone and the wider European Union together in the face of a financial crisis that threatens to split partnerships forged over more than half a century. So why are they putting so much effort into preserving unity? And can they prevent today's debts and differences from dividing the continent for decades to come? Why is unity so important to Europe? The answer lies in Europe's history: The continent has historically been split by long-running conflicts that pitted neighboring countries against each other. But despite this, the nations of Europe also share much in common, as Professor John Loughlin, of the University of Cambridge's department of politics and international studies explained. ""In the 19th century there was an idea that Europe had a natural unity, that its constituent parts shared an identity, a culture, a history,"" he told CNN. ""People were keen to recover this 'lost unity' which dated back to before the fragmented days of the individual nation states, to previous unions, and even to the Roman Empire."" Where did the idea of a European Union come from? The idea of a united Europe goes back centuries, and has been proposed by everyone from William Penn -- the founder of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania -- to philosophers Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham. French novelist and activist Victor Hugo backed the idea of a ""United States of Europe"" in the 19th century, looking forward to the day when the U.S. of A. and the U.S. of E. would ""stretch out their hands across the sea... and join together to reap the well-being of all."" Hugo, author of ""Les Miserables"" and the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" predicted that: ""A day will come when there will be no battlefields but markets opening to commerce and minds opening to ideas. A day will come when the bullets and bombs are replaced by votes."" However, it was not until after World War II that a European union became a realistic prospect. Why then? By 1945, much of Europe had been devastated by two massive wars in quick succession. Amid the rubble and ruins, politicians and the public -- exhausted by years of violence -- shared the belief that such conflict should never be allowed to happen again. Rather than focus on trying to find a shared ideology -- the reason behind much of the earlier conflict -- politicians saw economic unity as a way of preventing future clashes. French politician Robert Schuman, regarded as one of the founding fathers of the EU, came up with the idea of pooling coal and steel production in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), so that the ""raw ingredients"" for war -- munitions -- were placed out of reach. He hoped the ECSC, created in 1951, would mean that, ""any war between France and Germany [became] not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible."" What is it? The ECSC, which was made up of six nations (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) later evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) -- under which the member states established a common market, and worked to harmonize their policies on everything from agriculture and fisheries to monetary policy. Over the following decades, the EEC became the European Union, and expanded from the original six nations to today's 27 members, from Finland in the north to Malta in the south. That enlargement has also seen many members of the former Soviet Union join up -- highlighting another of the EU's key roles. ""During the Cold War, Western Europe united to form a bloc against the Soviet Union, because there was a genuine fear that the Communists would sweep across Europe in their tanks,"" Loughlin said. ""After the fall of the Berlin Wall, that part of the world was extremely unstable. It had had a kind of peace, but one built on oppression, and once that collapsed there were real fears of conflict. ""The EU was very important in ensuring peace and stability in the region -- it helped countries' transition to democracy, and build economic prosperity."" Has it worked? Loughlin says the union has succeeded in its most basic aim. ""It is still a very important aspect of European unity that there has been no major war since World War II. ""There have been smaller conflicts, in Northern Ireland and in the Basque country, and of course there was the situation in the Balkans, but in that case, the prospect of joining the EU has been a very powerful factor in preventing further wars."" It hasn't all been plain sailing though -- national differences persist, and many issues have caused divisions and debates between the member states, from the introduction of a single currency to the war in Iraq. ""Not all the tensions have gone away,"" said Loughlin. ""Not all the conflicts have been resolved. ""The old reflexes, the old fears persist. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, for example, [President Francois] Mitterand [of France] and [Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher [of Britain] were very nervous about the prospect of a united Germany."" However, the euro crisis has provided the union with its biggest challenge yet -- and it is one that is playing on national prejudices and resentments. ""The Greeks are very upset that their whole character seems to be being called into question, that they are being portrayed as profligate, irresponsible. ""The old stereotypes are still there, and they tend to resurface at times of tension. The danger is that they can really affect the outcome of these situations, and there is just too much at stake here."" How determined are Europe's current leaders to support unity at any cost? In 2011, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy insisted that Europe would never give up on the euro. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said: ""We will never abandon the euro. Never! Euro spells Europe, the euro is Europe. Europe has meant 60 years of peace on our continent. We will never abandon that. ""To imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each others' throats for centuries, we now have one wish, and that is lasting peace."" However, by the end of last year, both France and Germany -- the two driving forces behind the euro -- had admitted that in order to ensure the currency's survival, Greece may have to withdraw. Can European unity survive the current crisis? ""The EU was formed for three reasons: To prevent war, to bring political unity, and for economic integration.

"(CNN) -- Hail! to the victors valiant . Hail! to the conqu'ring heroes . Hail! Hail! to Michigan, . the champions of the West! What in the name of a Wolverine does the University of Michigan fight song have to do with why, in the second decade of the 21st century, we cannot vote online for president? ""From a security point of view, it is an insane thing to do,"" David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and chairman of Verified Voting, told Computerworld in March. In this election cycle, estimates are that about 3.5 million voters in 32 states and the District of Columbia will be able to use their keyboards for at least some portion of the voting process, most of them military service members or Americans living overseas. ""The biggest concern I have about Internet voting is that we don't know how to do it securely. It sounds wonderful but it's an oxymoron. We don't have Internet experts who know how to secure big pieces of the Internet from attack,"" Ron Rivest, an expert in cryptology and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a conference last year at Central Connecticut State University. Meanwhile, there remain concerns about the voting machines currently in use. ""This is a national security issue. It should really be handled by the Department of Homeland Security,"" said Roger Johnston and he should know. Johnston led a team at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, in one of the most disturbing e-voting machine hacks to date, in the view of Brad Friedman, proprietor of the Brad Blog and a vocal critic on the subject of voting machine security. How secure is your electronic vote? Hacking on the cheap . Call it hacking on the taxpayers' dime -- and on the cheap, too. Voting machines used by as many as a quarter of American voters heading to the polls in 2012 can be hacked with just $10.50 in parts and an 8th-grade science education, Friedman reported in a review of the experiment. ""...the Argonne team's attack required no modification, reprogramming, or even knowledge, of the voting machine's proprietary source code. It was carried out by inserting a piece of inexpensive 'alien electronics' into the machine,"" he wrote. This is just one of several hacks in recent years designed to reveal vulnerabilities in voting machines, including one in which the video game Pac Man was installed on a voting machine. If you want to know what types of equipment your state uses for voting, check out www.verifiedvoting.org. According to the group's website: . â€¢ One-quarter of the nation's registered voters will use paperless electronic voting machines that provide no paper record of votes cast. In six states (Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina) there is only paperless electronic voting. In five states (Indiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia), the heavy majority of ballots cast are paperless. â€¢ Two-thirds of American voters use paper ballots. In 19 states, voters will use paper ballots statewide. In 13 states and the District of Columbia, optical scan voting will account for the majority of ballots. â€¢ Thirty-three states plus the District of Columbia provide a paper record for every vote cast. That may be a paper ballot or a printout that the voter can view before casting a ballot on an electric machine. Sandy has election officials scrambling . 'Voting systems frequently fail' Check out countingvotes.org for a ranking of the states based on voting equipment security. This survey -- released in July by the Verified Voting Foundation, the Rutgers University Law School and Common Cause -- found that more than 300 voting machine problems were reported in the 2010 midterm elections and more than 1,800 in the 2008 general election. ""Every national election since 2000 has shown us the same thing: Voting systems frequently fail,"" the study said. ""When they fail, votes are lost. Voters in jurisdictions without paper ballots or records for every vote cast, including military and overseas voters, do not have the same protections as states that use paper ballot systems. This is not acceptable."" Now, back to ""Hail to the Victors."" Several weeks before the November 2010 election, University of Michigan computer science professor J. Alex Halderman and his students penetrated the District of Columbia's pilot project of an Internet-based voting system for overseas voters. Granted, the District did challenge experts to test its system. ""Our objective was to approach the system as real attackers would: starting from publicly available information, we looked for weaknesses that would allow us to seize control, unmask secret ballots, and alter the outcome of the mock election,'' Halderman and the team wrote in a paper published earlier this year. The Michigan team changed votes, reportedly casting one in a school board race for Bender, a robot from the animated series ""Futurama,"" found voters' personal information, took control of remote cameras in the computer room and -- more worryingly -- found evidence of other attacks originating in Iran, China and India. ""Within 48 hours of the system going live, we had gained near complete control of the election server. We successfully changed every vote and revealed almost every secret ballot. Election officials did not detect our intrusion for nearly two business days and might have remained unaware for far longer had we not deliberately left a prominent clue,"" they reported. A telltale clue . Oh, yes, that clue: The University of Michigan fight song played when a ballot was submitted. ""Nevertheless, it took two business days for officials to become aware of the infiltration,"" the paper noted. The Michigan crew shared its findings with D.C. election officials, who opted not to use the system in November 2010. While the D.C. officials acknowledged that, ""...we learned many valuable lessons"" they maintained: ""Even more, voters expect that there will be a day when online voting will be as simple as paying bills or paying taxes. While there will always be citizens who choose to file their taxes on paper and there will always be voters who wish to visit their local polling place on Election Day, election officials know that voters expect, one day, to cast their ballot from their laptop."" That day already is a reality in the North European nation of Estonia, ""the envy of the digital world"" and ""among the most wired and technologically advanced countries in the world,"" Estonia is the leader in Internet voting, CNN reported a year ago. Critics say that the challenges of secure Internet voting in Estonia, a nation of 1.34 million people, pale in comparison with those in the United States, where roughly 100 times that number of people voted in the 2008 presidential election. At the conference in Connecticut last year, Rivest estimated that mass online voting in the United States was at least two decades away from reality. West Virginia leads the way . One of those who had seen the dawning of that day is West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant. During the 2010 general election, 125 West Virginia voters, in the military and overseas, cast ballots online. In a paper published this year, Tennant wrote: ""To date, no significant deficiencies or concerns have been identified with the West Virginia online voting pilot. In short, what West Virginia did worked. It was a small program that helped an admittedly small group of voters cast their ballot more conveniently. There were 125 opportunities for something to go wrong, but to our knowledge, nothing did."" Tennant said that for members of the armed forces, particularly those stationed in war zones, being able to vote was meaningful. Tennant made this plea to skeptics: ""Instead of continuing to focus on the shortcomings of Internet voting, opponents could help strengthen it. Computer experts could lend their skills to developing encryption software that guarantees that each ballot is securely transmitted. Election officials could help voters better understand how the process works. ""Internet voting should be a safe, secure, accessible option for voters. It is time that we, as a society, agree that our voting is far too sacred to compromise -- and that at some point in time this sacred right and accessible technology must intersect. I believe the time to explore that is now,"" Tennant said. Companies touting online voting are confident they are the future. ""I believe everyone will have the option of voting online, certainly within our lifetime,"" Lori Steele, chief executive officer of Everyone Counts, a San Diego-based Internet voting company that provides services in several states, told The Wall Street Journal.","Expert says going to online voting now would be 'insane'

"(CNN) -- A college student was arrested Thursday for allegedly hijacking the webcams of young women -- among them reigning Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf -- taking nude images, then blackmailing his victims to send him more explicit material or else be exposed. Jared James Abrahams, a 19-year-old computer science student from Temecula, California, surrendered on Thursday to the FBI on federal extortion charges, the agency announced. Authorities say he victimized young women surreptitiously, by taking control of their computers then photographing them as they changed out of their clothes. Abrahams appeared in court later in the day, then was released ""on intensive pretrial supervision and home detention with electronic monitoring"" after his parents signed bond agreements totaling $50,000, FBI spokeswoman Lourdes Arocho said. U.S. District Judge Jean Rosenbluth ruled that he could use a single desktop computer at his parents' home for school only, albeit only after monitoring software is applied. When he admitted what he'd done in June, Abrahams said he had 30 to 40 ""slave computers"" -- or other people's electronic devices he controlled -- and has had as many as 150 total, according to a criminal complaint. His arrest came six months after a teenager identified in court documents as C.W. alerted authorities. She has since publicly identified herself as Cassidy Wolf, the recently crowned Miss Teen USA. She touted news reports of her alleged tormenter's arrest on her Twitter feed. At the time she contacted police, in March, Wolf was not a national figure -- even though she was Miss Teen California -- and lived in an apartment and attended Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. Wolf got a Facebook alert that someone had tried to change her password to the social networking site, then noticed other passwords had been changed and that her Twitter avatar was now a half-nude picture of herself. A short time later, she received what would be the first of many messages, this one featuring pictures of Wolf at her Riverside County address and others apparently taken months earlier when she lived in Orange County, says the criminal complaint. The message explained ""what's going to happen"" if Wolf didn't send pictures or videos or ""do what I tell you to do"" in a five-minute Skype videoconference, according to the criminal complaint. ""Either you do one of the things listed below or I upload these pics and a lot more (I have a LOT more and those are better quality) on all your accounts for everybody to see and your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar (sic),"" he wrote. Recalling that day, Wolf told NBC's ""Today"" show she started ""screaming (and) bawling my eyes out."" ""I wasn't sure what to do,"" she said in August, shortly after her Miss Teen USA win. ""So it was terrifying."" The messenger had taken great efforts to hide his online identity. But investigators were eventually able to find corresponding e-mails, IP addresses and other communications they linked to Abraham. They also tied him to online forums asking about malware, how to control webcams, and hacking into Facebook accounts. Investigators also linked him to at least eight other young women -- some of them, like Wolf, from Southern California, though others were from as far away as Moldova. The victims told authorities similar stories: of a person they did not know saying, and in some cases proving, he had nude images and making demands as a result. The stalker claimed to have 1,000 photographs of one woman, the complaint said. When she asked, ""Why are you doing this to me?"" the response was, ""I told you I'll answer any questions after you Skype."" As an FBI agent was speaking by phone to this young woman, she logged onto her Instagram account to find it populated by nude pictures of her, the complaint said. A few young women apparently complied with the demands for a Skype session. The man promised not to record the sessions and he made it look like he was erasing the nude pictures of them. One such session was found on the suspect's phone, police said. Foul-mouthed hacker hijacks baby monitor . Investigators examining e-mail exchanges found one in which an alleged victim wrote she was downloading Skype and pleading, ""Please remember im only 17. Have a heart."" ""I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart!!!"" he wrote back, per the complaint. ""However I do stick to my deals! Also age doesn't mean a thing to me."" Authorities executed a search warrant at Abrahams' home on June 4, at which time he ""voluntarily agreed to speak"" with a pair of FBI agents. Describing himself in that interview as a college freshman who was good with computers, the complaint said, he admitted using malware and his expertise to ""watch his victims change their clothes and ... use the photographs against them."" Abrahams further admitted the e-mail accounts, VPN, domain names or other pieces of the electronic puzzle that investigators used to build a case were his, according to the criminal complaint. Outside the court Thursday, Abrahams' lawyer Alan Eisner said that his client's family feels ""profound regret and remorse"" over what happened. He told CNN affiliate KTLA that Abrahams is autistic. ""The family wants to apologize for the consequences of his behavior to the families who were affected,"" Eisner said. As to the now 19-year-old Wolf, she is juggling her studies at the New York Film Academy with duties tied to being Miss Teen USA. A lifelong dancer and aspiring model, Wolf is using her platform to promote a number of initiatives -- including, given her personal experience, the issue of cyberstalking.

"(Health.com) -- Earlier this year, sociologist Jay Olshansky, Ph.D., watched President Barack Obama return to his hometown of Chicago to celebrate his 50th birthday. In the days that followed, Olshansky was struck by the amount of media coverage dedicated to a single question: When did Obama's hair get so gray? Being president is a demanding job -- especially in times like this -- and it seems plausible that the stress of juggling politics, the economy, and the military could literally take years off a person's life. Michael Roizen, M.D., a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, even suggested on Obama's birthday that presidents age twice as fast as normal while in office. But Olshansky, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois-Chicago, wasn't buying it. Wealth, access to healthcare, and education are all closely linked to longer lifespans, and presidents have all three resources in abundance, he reasoned; if anything, presidents should age slower than the average person. Health.com: 30 stay-healthy tips for men . To test his hunch, Olshansky collected the birth, death, and inauguration dates of every American president that died of natural causes. (He also included living presidents.) Then, based on their time in office, he estimated their projected lifespans under Dr. Roizen's ""accelerated aging"" theory. Two-thirds of presidents lived (or are living) longer than their projected lifespans, Olshansky found. What's more, two-thirds also made it past the average lifespan of men in their age group. ""The first eight presidents lived an average of 79.8 years during a time when life expectancy for men was under 40,"" says Olshansky, whose findings were published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ""It seems like most presidents live exceptionally long lives."" Health.com: How to live to 100 . If that's the case, what explains the rapidly graying hair and premature wrinkles that seem to beset presidents? (Obama isn't the only president whose visible aging has attracted attention: In years past, the media hasn't failed to note that Bill Clinton was white-haired by the time he left office, that Jimmy Carter had baggier eyes, and that George W. Bush developed new lines across his forehead.) The obvious answer is that U.S. presidents are simply older when they leave the White House as when they enter. They also take office in their mid-50s, on average -- a stage in life when the external signs of aging tend to become more pronounced in men. In addition, Olshansky suspects, high levels of stress may indeed contribute to superficial aging, even if they don't shorten lifespan. ""There is good, strong literature to suggest that stress can lead to accelerated graying of hair,"" he says. ""There's no question that stress has a powerful effect, but at least with regard to the presidents, it doesn't appear to be making them die sooner."" Health.com: Job killing you? 8 types of work-related stress . Olshanksy plans to study people in other high-stress jobs -- like CEOs of insurance companies -- to test whether stress really does influence how old they look. Either way, he says, Obama and other stressed-out workers shouldn't fret over their appearance. ""No one dies from gray hair and wrinkles,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a leading Kenyan presidential contender want the International Criminal Court to take a step backward in his trial for alleged human rights violations, saying a crucial prosecution witness lied.

The ICC has said Kenyatta and a co-perpetrator directed the outlawed sect to attack opposition members and rival tribes during the postelection unrest.

"(CNN) -- A man who was sexually abused by former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has settled his civil suit against the university -- the first to do so, his lawyer said. During Sandusky's trial last year, the man was known as Victim 5. Victim 5's lawyer, Tom Kline, said the settlement terms are bound by a confidentiality agreement with the school, but that ""the compensation was fair and adequate."" ""My client is relieved,"" Kline told CNN. ""This has been a long process. There has been for him a very public reliving of horror he experienced as a child."" Sandusky, 69, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. At the sentencing, Victim 5 told the court Sandusky's punishment ""will never erase what he did to me."" ""It will never make me whole,"" he said. ""He must pay for his crimes, take into account the tears, the pain, the private anguish."" 'Because of you, I trust no one' The university still faces 30 other suits. It has set aside $60 million for payouts. Kline said 25 or 26 of the suits are expected to be settled in the next week or two. Penn State sent a statement to CNN saying, ""The University continues to make progress on multiple settlements but does not have a comment at this time."" Kline called the settlement involving Victim 5 ""win, win."" Penn State, he said, has accepted ""responsibility"" and ""has earned a right to move forward."" Kline said Victim 5 has agreed to bring no further claims against the school as part of the deal. Matt Sandusky files motion to have name changed . The abuse . Sandusky sexually assaulted Victim 5 in August 2001, six months after then-graduate assistant Michael McQueary walked in on Sandusky raping a boy in a campus shower -- and reported it to college officials. Victim 5 was also assaulted in Penn State showers, Kline said. During Sandusky's sentencing, Victim 5 told the court he will never forget the image of Sandusky ""forcing himself on me and forcing my hand on him."" Sandusky's life in prison . At least three of Sandusky's known victims were abused after 2001, according to testimony at last year's trial of the former Nittany Lions defensive coordinator. The victims have sued the school, saying it knew about the abuse but didn't act on that knowledge. Opinion: Sandusky sentence doesn't bring instant justice . The fallout . The sex abuse scandal led to the 2011 firing of Penn State's head football coach, Joe Paterno, and the ouster of the university's longtime president Graham Spanier. Paterno died last year of lung cancer. Last month, a judge ruled that Spanier and two senior administrators will face trial on obstruction of justice and other charges related to the scandal. State prosecutors allege that Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Senior Vice President Gary Schultz all knew about two allegations made against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001, but lied about their knowledge when a grand jury convened several years later. Ex-university officials accused of 'conspiracy of silence' All three men have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Victim 5 might testify in their trials, his lawyer said. He was assaulted shortly after the incident McQueary witnessed in the same location -- an act that could have been prevented had proper reporting taken place, Kline said. ""The incident that involved my client could have and should have been stopped,"" Kline said. Attorneys for the three claim there is no evidence of a cover-up. Yet prosecutors characterized their actions as a conscious decision not to call police. ""There was a conspiracy of silence,"" prosecutor Bruce Beemer said during the July hearing.

"(CNN) -- Anyone who has struggled to be healthy is intimately familiar with the counting game. They've counted calories, carbs, Weight Watchers points, their heart rate, steps and miles. Now a new smart eating utensil called the HapiFork will help them count bites during meals, and maybe shame them into eating slower and potentially losing weight. Technology has made it easier to track the minutiae of everyday life, with smartphones, pedometers and small sensors that can fit in wearable devices such as wrist bands. The self-tracking hobby has blossomed into the quantified-self movement, which reaches far beyond the health conscious. People are tracking their sleep patterns, heart rate, mood, air quality and work habits, often in a bid to analyze enough data to correct problems with their health or lifestyle. ""Whatever we can measure, we can improve,"" said Fabrice Boutain, CEO and founder of HapiLabs. In the case of the HapiFork, what can be improved is how fast people eat. It takes 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full and that it's time to stop eating, putting speedy eaters at risk for being overeaters. The HapiFork team says there are many potential health benefits to eating slower, including decreasing acid reflux, obesity and diabetes. The $99 fork first gained attention during the Consumer Electronics Show in January and will be on the market by the end of the year. How it works . The fork can be used to passively track eating habits and automatically sync that information, including duration of meals and frequency of forkfuls, with a smartphone. The HapiFork mobile app will also include a coaching program and tools to connect with friends and family. The device can also be set up for behavior modification, vibrating any time the diner is eating too quickly as a gentle reminder to slow down. By default it is set to allow a bite every 10 seconds, though the exact time is customizable. When the metal tines of the HapiFork touch the mouth, a circuit is closed and a bite is tallied. The data is automatically transmitted to a smartphone over Bluetooth or can be uploaded using a micro USB port in the base. The fork, which can stay charged for 15 days, has a thick plastic handle that houses the electronics. The core pops out so the fork can be washed by hand or run through a dishwasher. You must hold down a button to turn it on before each meal, but it powers down automatically after you stop using it. A hands-on (and mouth-on) test . I tested the fork out this week on a lunch of seared-tuna salad. There are only 10 prototypes of the HapiFork, each thoroughly sanitized between the many test eaters (I hope). It was a pretty tasty salad, and soon slow, responsible bites turned into shoveling. When two bites happened in the same 10 second window, the fork vibrated -- a somewhat unsettling feeling especially if it's near your teeth. I'd slow down for a while, mostly out of embarrassment, but eventually I'd forget and the fork would buzz me again. It happened about five times during the length of the meal -- a fairly typical count for newbies, according to Boutain. HapiLabs subscribes to the theory that it takes 21 days to create a habit. If you use the fork consistently for 21 days, it should retrain you to automatically eat slower at all times. One meal wasn't enough time to cure me of my snarfing ways, but I was more aware of how fast I ate for the rest of the day. Origin of the smart fork . The fork was invented seven years ago by Jacques Lepine, who compares the retraining to techniques used by habitual nail biters to cut down on their nibbling. Such as coating nails with bitter-tasting polish, for example. Last year Lepine connected with 5-year-old health and fitness content company HapiLabs, which is based in Paris and Hong Kong. The two joined forces just in time to take the first prototypes to CES in Las Vegas, where it was an instant hit. HapiLabs has 120 employees, only 10 to 15 of whom are currently working on the HapiFork project. But that ratio could change soon if the fork takes off. When can you get one? On Wednesday, the HapiFork team launched a 45-day Kickstarter campaign to raise $100,000 and sign up the first 1,000 users. Those early adopters will be the company's first chance to collect a large amount of data and test how effective the fork's vibration is at changing eaters' behavior. HapiLabs plans to start shipping the first forks to early Kickstarter donors at the end of the summer, and roll the devices out to everyone by the end of the year. ""We want to cater to a community of people who like to eat mindfully,"" said Boutain. Data, data everywhere . Since it has started collecting data from test users, HapiLabs has found that people take about 70 fork bites per meal. They start eating fast but slow down after six minutes, and in an interesting bit of carb trivia, they tend to eat rice much faster than pasta (possibly due to the labor-intensive twirling process). This is just a sliver of the kind of insight the fork could give the company and medical researchers into how people eat. That potential is what makes the fork more than just a silly and fun novelty gadget. It represents an evolution in tracking technology. In the coming years sensors will pop up in more and more household objects tracking things like air quality, movement, vital signs and other stats. This potential flood of sensors could lead to a mess of data, with each piece of information tracked in its own app. Fitness trackers like the Nike Fuel Band and the Fitbit are already hugely popular. A new company, Estonian startup Jomi Interactive, recently announced it is working on tracking devices that fit onto water bottles and monitor how much water you drink. Ideally all the sensor companies will work together so that different data can be shared across apps and devices, allowing it to be analyzed for even more insightful conclusions. (Do you eat less on days you get more than 8 hours sleep? Does the air quality in your home effect your mood?)","The HapiFork tracks how quickly you eat, vibrating if your bites are less than 10 seconds apart .

"(Health.com) -- Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to an array of health problems, including bone fractures, heart disease, and depression. Efforts to prevent these and other ills by prescribing vitamin D supplements haven't always panned out, however. Now vitamin D seems to have struck out against the common cold. Although the nutrient is thought to play a key role in immune function, a new clinical trial suggests that even high doses of supplements are powerless to ward off upper respiratory tract infection -- an umbrella diagnosis that covers colds and flu, as well as sinus infections and other related problems. The study, which was published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, included 322 healthy adults in New Zealand and found that those who took large monthly doses of vitamin D developed just as many infections over an 18-month period as their counterparts who took a placebo. The people in the vitamin D group came down with an average of 3.7 bouts of cold or flu, compared to 3.8 in the placebo group -- a statistically negligible difference. Nor did vitamin D have any measurable impact on the severity of symptoms, their duration (about 12 days per episode in each group), or the number of workdays missed. Health.com: Superfoods that fight colds . The findings reinforce the uncertainty surrounding vitamin D and cold prevention. At least two previous clinical trials have produced similarly disappointing results, although some research has been more promising. A placebo-controlled study published in August, for instance, found that supplements halved the incidence of colds in vitamin-D deficient schoolchildren. But the new study is the first to examine the real-world effects of supplements in adults with healthy vitamin D levels. And the results suggest that raising vitamin D levels above average doesn't provide additional protection against colds, says Dr. Jeffrey Linder, an associate physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Vitamin D, he adds, should probably be placed alongside the many other popular cold-and-flu remedies -- such as vitamin C, zinc, echinacea, and garlic -- whose supposed benefits have not stood up to clinical trials. ""Colds are inevitable. We all get them, and they make us all miserable, and I don't think we're going to come up with a way around that,"" says Lister, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""Besides eating a balanced diet with lots of vitamins and minerals, and exercising, and generally living a healthy life, it's unlikely that we're going to find one single pill or cure that's going to prevent them or lessen their severity."" Health.com: How to stop a cold in its tracks . Dr. David Murdoch, the lead author of the study and a pathologist at the University of Otago, in New Zealand, says it's too soon to rule out vitamin D for cold prevention altogether. More research will be needed to confirm that supplements lack cold-fighting properties, he says, and to determine whether certain types of infections or certain populations respond to the added nutrient better than others. ""This study highlights the need for good quality studies to look at each potential health benefit before making broad recommendations,"" Murdoch says. ""The beneficial evidence for immunity (is) still being sorted out, so we still need to focus on the evidence."" Health.com: 12 ways to get your daily vitamin D . Vitamin D is not found naturally in most foods, but some products, like milk, are fortified to include it. Our bodies also make the vitamin when our skin is exposed to sunlight. Spending a few minutes outside each day is typically enough to maintain healthy vitamin D levels, but many people fall short -- especially in the wintertime -- and may want to ask their doctor about supplements. Supplements for run-of-the-mill vitamin-D deficiency are different from those used in the study. In order to ensure that everyone received a full dose, the researchers gave the participants 200,000 international units (IU) once a month for the first two months, and then 100,000 IU a month after that. That works out to about 3,300 IU per dayâ€”more than five times the recommended daily intake (600 IU) for most adults.

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Appearing very frail, boxing legend Muhammad Ali made a rare public appearance Thursday at an event in his hometown to pay homage to others for their humanitarian work. Former President Jimmy Carter, music artists and young leaders of groups helping the underprivileged were among those honored at the inaugural Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards in Louisville. Even though he was barely able to whisper a word, Ali posed for pictures and participated in presenting the awards. ""This is really about his legacy and extending that legacy to others and inspiring them and encouraging them to do the kinds of work that now he cannot always do himself,"" Ali's wife, Lonnie Ali, said at the gala. While Parkinson's disease has robbed the three-time world heavyweight champion of many of the traits he once treasured in the ring -- the speed, wit and charisma that made him one of the most famous sports figures in recent history -- he has never retreated from public life. 'His head is still there' ""People always feed bad when they see my dad, and I feel bad because he has Parkinson's disease and it's hard for him to get around, but he is happy,"" said his daughter Laila Ali, who retired undefeated as a super middle weight champion. ""His head is still there, and all we can do is keep loving him and supporting him even though it's never easy to watch."" Recipients of the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Awards included 22-year-old Tanvi Girotra of India, who leads a global youth organization that seeks to combat sex trafficking and empower women. Walking along the red carpet to greet Ali, 71, was 15-year-old Nick Lowinger of Rhode Island, who began outreach work with homeless people at the age of 5. Lowinger was recognized for his foundation, which provided shoes to more than 10,000 homeless and disadvantaged children in 21 states. ""Nobody had to asked them to do it, they recognized the need and they jumped to action just to recognize that somebody needed something,"" said Lonnie Ali. Carter, who turned 89 on Tuesday, was singled out for a lifetime achievement award. The 39th U.S. president was unable to attend, so his son James ""Chip"" Carter accepted the award. Pop stars recognized . Pop singer Christina Aguilera received the humanitarian of the year award for her work on global hunger relief, while her fellow recording artist Michael Bolton was honored for his work promoting gender equality. The awards were established in conjunction with Ali's core principles of conviction, dedication and giving, which are illustrated at the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum that also chronicles his epic boxing matches, the struggle for racial equality and his conscientious objection to the Vietnam War that eventually cost him his titles and millions of dollars in endorsements. Over the past four decades, Ali has visited more than 100 countries, providing humanitarian assistance and at times mediating in international disputes, notably in situations where U.S. citizens were held captive in Iran and Iraq. ""He has a body of work he has done traveling the globe, helping others by bringing assistance and aid to those who are in need,"" said Lonnie Ali. ""And he wants to extend that part of life to others by recognizing their support and serving as an encouragement."" While Parkinson's disease has taken a severe toll on Ali, his wife says his commitment to social justice has not wavered. ""Every day he gets up with a smile in his face and looks forward to whatever the day brings,"" she said. ""He doesn't let things stop him and he does as much as he can every day and he still finds meaning in life.""","Jimmy Carter and Christina Aguilera are among those recognized .

Bay played that part in Friday's ""Turtles,"" which earned $65 million at the weekend box office and debuted at No. 1. The live-action film wasn't adored by critics, but nearly everyone shrugged that it was at least better than Bay's ""Transformers."" In a statement, Paramount Film Group President Adam Goodman said that ""launching a new take on the 'Turtles' into the feature film world was a daunting task,"" but the enthusiastic response from moviegoers has left the studio feeling positive as they approach another installment. ""We felt a great responsibility to ensure audiences were going to experience everything they loved about the 'Turtles,' while also getting to see them brought to life in a way they had never been seen before,"" Goodman said in the statement, via Deadline Hollywood. ""The result exceeded our high expectations and the response to the film is beyond great, making it all the more fun to get started on the continuation of their story.""

"Manila (CNN) -- Crowded, gritty, and poor, Metro Manila can be a tough place to live for just about anyone; but when you stand three feet 10 inches the odds are seriously stacked against you. ""I come from the provinces so there was no work,"" says 35-year-old Alejandro Doron, looking at his hands. ""Farm work, using the heavy equipment, was just too hard for me."" Arriving in Manila as a 21-year-old, Alejandro - a dwarf or unano as they are called in the Philippines - tried his hand at several jobs, among them working as a show wrestler in a Manila bar. ""That was okay but it could be quite hard,"" he says. ""It was just a show, and just on Thursdays, but sometimes you could still get hurt and you were always slipping over in the oil."" Now safely ensconced in Manila's ""Hobbit House"" - a dwarf-themed blues bar in Manila's scruffy Ermita district - he is part of a group of dwarves who plan to build their own community for about 30 of the city's ""little people"" - the preferred term for people with dwarfism. Often isolated in the provinces, where they can be the only person in the town with dwarfism, in Manila they are less visible. Working and living together, however, makes the condition all but a normal state of affairs. The founder of the Hobbit House, 71-year-old Jim Turner, says dwarves in the Philippines suffer the same amount of prejudice as little people anywhere else in the world. ""I think anywhere ... anywhere in the world they'd have the same problems,"" says Turner sitting in his usual corner of the bar, a cigarette burning in his ashtray. ""People look and stare at them,"" he says, screwing up his face in imitation of someone who's just seen something weird. Far from exploiting the dwarves, Turner maintains the bar gives hope and employment to people who sometimes hail from the worst slums in Manila. ""It gives them a real sense of community,"" he says, taking a draw on his cigarette. A former Peace Corp volunteer who came to Manila in the 60s, Turner later worked in Filipino television in the 1970s when dwarves and transvestites were a staple fare of the film industry. The exploitation genre - a period during the 60s, 70s and 80s when sexism, racism and so-called ""carnival freaks"" were regarded as a surefire recipe for a box office smash - was recently documented in an Australian film released last year called Machete Maidens Unleashed! The B-movie genre was designed as drive-in fodder and involved risquÃ© scenes featuring gun-toting nuns, topless female revolutionaries or martial arts-performing dwarves. The low-budget films launched the career of Filipino actor and martial artist Ernesto de la Cruz - better known as Weng Weng - who stood just 2 feet, 9 inches tall. Starring in roles as diverse as the baby Moses in a Filipino biblical epic to a spoof on James Bond where he appeared as agent '00', Weng Weng was wildly popular in the Philippines in a genre that became know as 'dwarf TV'. Turner became friends with several people with dwarfism and, combined with his love of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the idea for the Hobbit House was born. It has since become so popular that he opened up a second Hobbit House in the beach resort of Boracay and the venues now attract a steady stream of little people looking for work. ""At first we were just taking anyone we could get, but now we're pretty much turning people away,"" he said. The bar general manager Pidoy Fetalino, who started at the Hobbit House as a cashier but now operates the bar, says they are now looking for dwarves who have good English and even college degrees. ""A few of the people we've hired haven't worked out,"" adds Turner. The Hobbit House is still the first stop for casting agents looking for little people to star as extras and most of the staff at the bar describe themselves as freelancers or businesspeople. Not only does the bar provide regular employment between gigs, it also gives the staff a chance to hone their skills - the Hobbit House has spawned a slew of diminutive Elvis impersonators, jugglers and fire eaters. One bar staff member even patrolled the premises dressed as a security guard with a Great Dane three times his size. ""I just landed a role as Santa Nino,"" says Alejandro, chuckling as he makes the shape of the headdress and cape of the saint. ""In all my life, I never thought I would be doing something like that."" While the dream of starting a live-in community for Manila's little people is still to attract any financial backers, Alejandro is hopeful the scheme will one day come together. ""So far we don't have the money to go much further,"" Doron says. The group has already sourced a 40-acre site outside Manila, but the cost of developing the site and building housing is daunting. ""What can I say except that dreams do come true,"" he says, laughing infectiously. ""There's always Santa Claus.""","Some of Manila's dwarves want to build their own community .

"(CNN) -- If you pressed Control-Alt-Delete to log on before reading this, Bill Gates says he's sorry. The Microsoft founder says the triple-key login should have been made easier, Ã  la Apple's Macs, but that a designer insisted on the more complicated step. ""We could have had a single button. But the guy who did the IBM keyboard design didn't want to give us our single button,"" Gates said Saturday during a question-and-answer session to launch a Harvard University fund-raising campaign. His comments have gained attention since a video of his Harvard Q&A was posted on YouTube on Tuesday. Smiling, Gates tried to follow through on the thought, noting it was a basic security feature. But he eventually surrendered to common sense. ""And so we had ... we programmed at a low level that you had to ... it was a mistake,"" he said, throwing up his hands to laughter and applause from the crowd. Gates defended innovation on the earliest Microsoft software though. ""We did some clever stuff,"" he said. ""We were able to experiment with a lot of stuff, but more on the software side than the hardware."" Long the first interface step for PC users, Control-Alt-Delete still exists in Windows 8 as a way of either locking the computer or accessing the control panel. While the system defaults to a log-in screen, users may tweak their settings to return to the old way of logging on to Windows. Sometimes informally called the ""three-fingered salute,"" the login required users to use both hands and was intended to avoid accidental keystrokes from rebooting a computer. Engineer David Bradley, a designer on early IBM computers, said he invented the combination as a shortcut during development. ""I originally intended for it to be what we would now call an Easter egg -- just something we were using in development and it wouldn't be available elsewhere,"" Bradley said while appearing on a 2011 panel that included Gates. ""But then (software publishers) found out about it. They were trying to figure out how to tell somebody to start up one of their programs, and they had the answer. Just put the diskette in, hit Control-Alt-Delete, and by magic your program starts."" He then tried to deflect what he perhaps wryly called ""credit"" for its continued use. ""It was like a five-minute job in doing it. I didn't realize that I was going to create a cultural icon when I did it,"" he said ""... I may have invented it, but I think Bill made it famous."" A tight-lipped Gates appears to force a smile in a video of the panel but does not respond. Gates attended Harvard until he left during his junior year to start Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975. While at Harvard, he lived down the hall from current Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates received an honorary degree in 2007. Gates remains Microsoft's chairman although he stopped full-time work at the company in 2008. During Saturday's session, Gates reflected on a variety of topics, from the philanthropy he's made his life's work since stepping back from an active role at Microsoft to his company's relationship with Apple in the early days. That included helping keep what would become Microsoft's fiercest rival afloat in the 1990s when it was foundering. ""In the Apple II era, we were kind of friendly competitors,"" he said. ""We actually put more people on the Mac than Apple had."" When co-founder Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, ""he sort of says, 'I want this, this and this and I'll give you this, this and this.' ... We did the deal in three days,"" Gates said. That included buying a 6% share of Apple, which lawyers convinced Gates that Microsoft shouldn't keep for antitrust reasons. ""It would have been nice if we had,"" he said.","Bill Gates: IBM designer insisted on triple-key login on PCs for security reasons .

"(CNN) -- It's hard for me to choose the greatest African films of the 21st century as the genres and styles of African cinema have evolved in a big way over the past 20 years or so. Movie makers are now showing a more vibrant Africa than the Francophone filmmakers did before them. I have chosen films that I loved watching and feel that they are a representative of what is out there in African cinema -- the rich mix and melting pot that is African cinema today. From a Whisper - dir. Wanuri Kahiu, Kenya, 2009 . This movie is very real and deals with the subject of terrorism -- based on the events surrounding the bomb attacks on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998. I liked Ken Ambani's realistic acting and I loved the music. Wanuri Kahiu is a good director who will go on to make greater films. The cinematography on this film was exceptional and although for me it had plot issues, I think in the end it all came together. Read this: Hollywood classics get African makeover . Viva Riva! -- dir. Djo Munga, DR Congo, 2010 . This is simply a sophisticated gangster movie. It has raw energy and puts a human face to all that is happening in the Congo. Sometimes just too real, it is gritty, fun and a must-watch thriller. Sinking Sands - dir. Leila Djansi, Ghana, 2011 . This film deals with domestic violence, but based on the personal journey of a man disfigured in an accident, which makes him turn against his wife. Ama K. Abebrese, who plays the wife, made this film for me and she won Best Actress at the African Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) for it, but I felt that director Leila Djansi made the film engage with the audience in an emotional way, showing not just the rawness of domestic violence, but taking us through a range of pain and forgiveness. The film also depicts how women can immerse themselves in guilt and force themselves to feel like the guilty party. Actors Jimmy Jean-Louis and Abebrese made this film a must watch and Djansi chose the right cast to make her directing look beautiful. The camera work on this film was excellent -- a bit dark and grainy, but one thing is for sure: you cannot watch ""Sinking Sands"" and not be affected. White Waters - dir. Izu Ojukwu, Nigeria, 2007 . ""White Waters"" was a very good movie. It tells the story of a disadvantaged boy who is discovered as gifted runner. I loved the feel, the music and the fact that it was about achieving something from nothing. I loved the cinematography. Izu Ojukwu, the director and my colleague, is going to shout as I say this, but I believe he is one of the best cinematographers Nigeria has and actor O.C. Ukeje was sensational and made this movie for me. Read more: Capetown takes on Tinseltown . Mwansa the Great - dir. Rungano Nyoni, Zambia 2011 . This is one of those films that makes Africa great. By showcasing the talents of the children who make up its cast, it shows off Africa's apparent talent. It's not just the cast that I enjoyed -- it has lovely directing too. Moolaade - dir. Ousmane Sembene, Senegal, 2004 . ""Moolaade"" dealt with a subject that most men would rather not deal with -- female genital mutilation. But director Ousmane Semebene was not afraid to tackle the subject and the manner of the film was artistic, yet detailed, and did not derail the issues that most people in Africa are afraid to confront. Coming from Sembene it was important, visual and professionally made -- and it pulls at the viewers' heart strings. Otelo Burning - dir. Sara Blecher, South Africa, 2011 . This is one movie I love, just because of the story line of young black South Africans in the 1980s excelling in surfing -- a sport that was reserved for the whites. The sound and picture quality was also excellent, as was the acting. ""Otelo Burning"" is one of the best African films I have ever seen and I feel it should have had a lot more accolades than it did. Read more: 'Netflix of Africa' brings continent to the small screen . Benda Bilili - dir. Renaud Barret, Florent de La Tullaye, DR Congo/France, 2010 . This is a great musical documentary telling the story of Staff Benda Bilili -- a group of disabled Congolese musicians. The band members start out making a living on the streets of Kinshasa, before becoming world-famous musicians. Irapada -- dir. Kunle Afolayan, Nigeria, 2007 . I love anything to deal with African myths and mysticism. This movie may not have the best sound quality but the storyline was interesting, and it was the first Nollywood film to make it to mainstream film festivals -- including the London Film Festival and Pan African Film festival in Los Angeles -- after winning an AMAA (Best Indigenous Film) in 2007. Ghett'a Life - dir. Chris Browne, Jamaica, 2011 . Not strictly an African movie, but ""Ghett'a Life"" is one of those films that I just love to watch. The music in this film is brilliant, and the cinematography too. It deals with the political violence in Jamaica in a realistic way, showing that people born in the ghetto can escape. ""Gett'a Life"" can be hard to deal with but when you watch the documentary ""Marley"" you begin to understand how politics, music and sports all merge in developing countries. For me, this movie is in the same league as ""Otelo Burning,"" with its message that you can get out of the corner if you really try. Story line: excellent, acting: brilliant.

"(CNN) -- A Colorado woman was arrested at the Denver airport in April and charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, according to court documents that were unsealed Wednesday. Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, allegedly told FBI agents before her arrest that she was going to be with a member of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, that she had met through the Internet. ""It's a difficult time for us,"" her mother, Ana Conley, told CNN on Wednesday. Conley's attorney, Robert William Pepin, said he had no comment. His client was arrested on a jetway while trying to board a flight to Germany on April 8, according to a criminal complaint. She told investigators she was going to Turkey to await word from her suitor. Conley, a certified nurse aide, had told FBI agents she was going to be the man's wife and a nurse in a ISIS camp near the Turkish border, documents showed. Conley first came to the attention of authorities after the pastor and the security director at a church in Arvada, Colorado, called police and said she was acting suspiciously. Authorities interviewed her seven times over the course of five months before arresting her at the airport. Jeff Dorschner, a Department of Justice spokesman, said there was a June 26 status hearing at which the judge ordered the documents in the case to be unsealed.

"(CNN) -- NASA's black-hole hunting telescope has captured a cosmic battle between dark and light. NuSTAR, formally known as the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, has observed a supermassive black hole's gravity tugging on X-ray light that's being emitted near that black hole. That light is getting stretched and blurred, and researchers are getting to see it all in unprecedented detail, said NASA in a news release issued today. In this instance, the corona -- a source of X-ray light that sits near a black hole -- recently collapsed in toward the black hole that's named Markarian 335. The NuSTAR telescope has been collecting X-rays from black holes and dying stars for the past two years. The craft completed its primary mission earlier this year, and it was redirected to investigate Markarian 335 once scientists noticed that the black hole had become dramatically brighter. NuSTAR observed that Markarian 335's gravity sucked the corona's light, an illuminating action that NASA likened to someone shining a flashlight for astronomers. Scientists can now see the corona ""lighting up material around the black hole,"" which allows them to study ""the most extreme light-bending effects"" of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, said NuSTAR's principal investigator, Fiona Harrison, in the news release. She is with the California Institute of Technology. As if NuSTAR's observations and Einstein's theories aren't mind-boggling enough, NASA says the black hole Markarian 335 ""spins so rapidly that space and time are dragged around with it."" The space agency says the new observations could help scientists better understand mysterious coronas and black holes, which are thought to be formed when massive stars collapse, creating such density that not even light can escape their intense gravitational pull. Scientists believe supermassive black holes reside in the centers of galaxies. Some are more massive and rotate faster than others.","NASA's NuSTAR searches the galaxy looking for black holes .

"(CNN) -- In Egypt's northern Delta, Sarah Parcak is on the hunt to unearth ancient settlements, pyramids and tombs lost in the sands of time. Rather than digging through the dirt in a dusty trench, trowel in hand, the Egyptologist has turned her eyes to the stars. Sarah Parcak is a space archaeologist who uses satellites, initially designed for use by the military, to identify potential sub-surface remains. ""When people initially think of the term ""space archaeologist"" they think 'oh it's someone who uses satellites to look for alien settlements on Mars or in outer space' but the opposite is true -- we're actually looking for evidence of past human life on planet earth,"" she says. The high-resolution satellites, with infrared and thermal capabilities, sit in orbit almost 500 kilometers above the Earth and can precisely pinpoint objects on terra firm less than a meter in diameter. The infrared light used by the satellites has longer wavelengths than visible light and thus can penetrate the earth's surface. The space archaeologist takes the satellite images and processes them to identify subtle anomalies on the earth's surface. ""All of these secrets are in the ground waiting for us to find them. The answers are there,"" says Parcak, who is also an assistant professor of archeology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). ""The most exciting part of my job (is) the idea that by mapping out archaeological sites, by using new technologies and trying to think very differently about how we see landscapes, we have a better chance of understanding who we are and what we are doing here."" Use of remote-sensing technology in search of ancient sites is revolutionizing the field of archeology. In 2011, Parcak and her team announced they located 17 pyramids in addition to 1,000 tombs and 3,100 ancient settlements in a documentary for the BBC. Then in a project last year, Parcak spent months trekking across the ancient Roman empire, traveling to Tunisia, Jordan, Romania and Italy, uncovering sites identified from space, finding an amphitheater and potential location for the famed Portus Lighthouse. ""I keep being surprised by the amount of archaeological sites and features that are left to find all over the world,"" says Parcak. Having spent the last 15 years working in Egypt alongside her husband and fellow archaeologist Greg Mumford on various surveys and excavations, the country holds a special place in Parcak's heart. And after the Arab Spring movement spread across the Middle East, rumors started circulating of locals looting ancient sites. Now the Egyptologist is developing new techniques so she can work with governments and international organizations to try to prevent the situation from getting worse. ""We've found that patterns of site looting have increased between 500 and 1000 percent since the start of the Arab Spring. Now this is a problem as old as human beings,"" she says. ""People were looting tombs 5,000 years ago in Egypt as soon as people were buried but the problem is only getting worse and worse."" In addition to her archaeological fieldwork, Parcak spends much of her time as an educator at UAB and lecturing around the world. ""If you really want to be a good archaeologist, you have to understand ancient DNA, you have to understand chemical analysis to figure out the composition of ancient pots. You have to be able to study human remains. You need to be able to do computer processing and in some cases, computer programing. ""It's not a bunch of old folks just digging in the dirt, which is fun, but there's this whole other world that we can study and the key is science so I try to speak to school groups, and I try to take a lot of time with young people after I present at conferences,"" she says. The Egyptologist isn't the only one using aerial technology to advance archeology . In June, the U.S.-based National Academy of Sciences released a report where a consortium of archaeologists used airborne lasers to survey Cambodia's Angkor Wat. The team also announced the remarkable existence of a medieval city hidden beneath the dense jungle. CNN's Becky Anderson and Sarah Chiplin contributed to this piece.","Sarah Parcak is an Egyptologist and professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .

"(CNN) -- Three white Mississippi men pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes Thursday in connection with the 2011 beating death of an African-American man in Jackson, the Justice Department announced. Deryl Dedmon, John Aaron Rice and Dylan Butler each admitted to conspiracy and violating the 2009 federal hate-crimes law in last June's killing of James Craig Anderson. They face sentences of up to life in prison and $250,000 in fines, federal prosecutors said. The 19-year-old Dedmon had already pleaded guilty to state murder and hate-crime charges Wednesday in a state court and was sentenced to life in prison. Rice, 19, and Butler, 20, made their initial appearances with Dedmon in federal court Thursday morning. The men are among the first defendants to be prosecuted under the federal hate-crime statute that President Barack Obama signed in 2009 and the first to be prosecuted in a fatal attack, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, said in a statement on Thursday's pleas. ""The Department of Justice will vigorously pursue those who commit racially motivated assaults and will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that those who commit such acts are brought to justice,"" Perez said. ""And I note that our investigation in this matter is ongoing."" Life sentence in Mississippi hate-crime case . In court Thursday, all three admitted to harassing and assaulting African-Americans on several occasions in the weeks before Anderson's death, hurling beer bottles, firing slingshots and driving at them with cars, prosecutors said. They targeted people they believed to be drunk or homeless, believing them less likely to report the attacks. They are also expected to testify against other teens implicated in Anderson's killing, two sources close to the proceedings told CNN. They admitted to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, named for the victims of two 1998 killings that shocked the country. Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming teenager, died after being kidnapped, beaten and left tied to a fence, while Byrd was a black man dragged to death in Texas by white supremacists. Anderson's death prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 537,000 people. At his state plea hearing, Dedmon told the court that his crimes were the result of being ""young and dumb, ignorant and full of hatred."" But Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill told him, ""Whatever excuse you offer, forget that. There is no excuse."" Anderson, 47, died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by Dedmon, who was part of a group of seven white youths from largely white Rankin County who decided to ""go f**k with some niggers"" after a night of partying and drinking, law enforcement officials have said, quoting some of the suspects in the case. Authorities have said they believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack. They said the youths climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove to the western edge of Jackson, where Anderson was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond a highway exit ramp. On a videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group pulls into the parking lot and stops where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the white youths yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" After the beating, Dedmon drove his Ford F-250 truck over him, leaving him to die, according to what some of the teens cooperating with police have told authorities. Rice initially faced state murder charges as well, but a judge reduced the charges to simple assault because he was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson. At Dedmon's sentencing Wednesday, Anderson's sister, Barbara Anderson Young, said her family was praying for ""racial conciliation."" ""These last months have been very difficult,"" Young said. ""We cried. We wept. We reminisced about our beloved brother, Craig, a loss I cannot even explain. Craig was a big-hearted person who loved his fellow man.""","NEW: The defendants admitted to previous assaults in the Jackson area, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- The cruise line Holland America says it was an ""aberration"" when inspectors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found multiple sanitation violations, including brown liquid dripping on clean dishes and a fly on the buffet, on the line's ms Veendam. Enough violations were cited that the CDC gave the Veendam a failing grade. ""While unacceptable for Holland America Line, the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration,"" Holland America's Sally Andrews told CNN. Inspectors don't tell cruise lines when they're going to show up, but they visit twice a year as part of the CDC's vessel sanitation inspection program. The CDC grades ships on a 100-point scale. An 85 or lower is considered a failing grade. The Veendam received a grade of 77. ""Since 1996, Veendam has received passing scores on 32 inspections,"" Andrews said. The Veendam is a 16-year-old ship, originally christened by actress Debbie Reynolds, that carries 1,930 passengers and crew, according to Holland America. Does traveling increase your chance of illness? According to the CDC report, during the August 19 surprise visit, inspectors found brown liquid dripping on clean dishes, refrigerators out of order, improper installation of anti-entrapment drain covers in pools posing a possible danger to swimmers, faulty dishwashers that managers allegedly failed to do anything about until inspectors arrived and water from a broken ice machine leaking onto the pool deck. The report did not specify what the brown liquid dripping on dishes was, or where it came from. ""One of the cooks doing active food preparation had a goatee and was not wearing a beard restraint,"" a CDC inspector noted. Later in the same report, ""A live large fly was near the buffet. This area was in use during the inspection,"" the CDC said. The Veedam's failing grade is uncommon in the cruise ship industry, an industry that has tried in recent years to keep on-board environments sanitary after illnesses like the Norwalk virus sickened passengers and caused a public relations nightmare. CDC's surprise cruise ship inspection (video) ""Very few ships have received a failing score over the last couple of years,"" the CDC's Jay Dempsey said. In fact, only five ships since 2007 have failed inspection during the CDC's bi-annual unannounced inspections. Ships are required to take corrective action after inspectors find violations. All cruise ships that dock at U.S. ports are inspected by the CDC. Reports are then posted on the CDC's website. It's the second time in as many months that Holland America ships have been targeted by officials. In August, a room tag from the line's Maasdam cruise ship and sewage washed ashore in Lynn, Massachusetts, leading town officials to suggest the debris may have come from the ship. But Holland America now says its investigation suggests the debris didn't come from their ship. ""A detailed letter outlining specifics related to the individual pieces of trash that washed up was sent to local authorities in mid-August and follow up was done with the Coast Guard as well. In general, the items found are not items carried onboard the ship. As for the luggage tag that was found, that particular color/style had not been used by Holland America Line for a year,"" Andrews said. From the archives: Queen Mary 2 fails sanitation inspection .","""Very few ships ... received a failing score over the last couple of years,"" CDC official says .

"(CNN) -- With no wreckage or flight recorders from Flight 370 to guide them, investigators in Malaysia are poring over information about the backgrounds of the pilots and passengers, radar data, and the transmissions from the cockpit. They also need to pay close attention to another important clue: the cargo manifest. The list of what ends up in the cargo hold of a passenger airplane goes beyond checked luggage. Freight shippers use passenger carriers as well as cargo lines to deliver goods and raw materials. Knowing what was in the cargo hold -- or at least what the official list says was in it -- is important in any accident investigation. It was never more important than it was in the case of the 1996 crash of ValuJet Flight 592. Opinion: Flight's resting place is best clue . The ValuJet plane, a DC-9, crashed into the Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami. Investigators found the pilots were unable to control the plane after a fire raced through the cargo hold, disabling some of the plane's systems. The source of the fire was traced to a shipment of oxygen canisters that had been mistakenly labeled and improperly packed. The accident led to a push by the National Transportation Safety Board to put smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems in the cargo bays of all passenger aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration responded and today, halon fire-suppression systems tucked into the cargo holds are an important safety feature on passenger planes. So far, so good. Since then, a new type of cargo has emerged: lithium batteries. There are two types of lithium batteries. One is the rechargeable batteries like those in your phone and laptop, also called lithium ion batteries. A second type, nonrechargeable batteries, also called lithium metal batteries, are used in everything from toys to medical devices. Lithium metal batteries deliver extremely high densities of energy, and if they are mishandled they can catch fire, a fire that can't be extinguished with halon, the most common kind of fire-suppression systems in passenger aircraft. That's one reason the FAA banned shipments of nonrechargeable lithium metal batteries on passenger planes in 2004. But that ban only applies in the United States; international authorities are still considering whether to enact such a rule. Cargo and passenger aircraft are free to carry lithium ion batteries, although they are subject to labeling and packing regulations. So what was on board Flight 370? Malaysian officials, after saying the cargo manifest would ""be released in due course,"" later got a little more specific and said the Boeing 777 was carrying 440 pounds of lithium ion batteries. What else? Nothing that would cause a problem, the Malaysians assure us. An Australian news media report said the Malaysian government refused to release the manifest to the Australian government, which would find such information helpful as it tries to map out a search. Let's assume little more than luggage and lithium ion batteries were in the plane's cargo hold. Although lithium ion fires are easier to suppress than lithium metal battery fires, both are susceptible to what's called ""thermal runaway"" when ignited. That's when one cell ignites the next cell, creating a fire that's more difficult to control with traditional fire suppression methods. It's worth noting that lithium ion batteries were the main suspect in the crash of a UPS Boeing 747 in Dubai in 2010, killing both pilots as they tried to make an emergency landing. Investigators in the United Arab Emirates studied the cargo records and found that shipments of lithium ion batteries that should have been declared hazardous cargo were not. The reinforced cargo liner was no match for the fire that quickly destroyed the aircraft's control systems and filled the cockpit with smoke, incapacitating the pilots. Presumably, the Malaysian government is paying close attention to anything on board the aircraft that might have caused a catastrophic fire. They need to be looking beyond the list of transported items, talking to freight shippers who might have had anything on board that was mislabeled, damaged or not handled correctly in transit. That's just as important as talking to the relatives of the pilots and investigating the flight simulator one had in his home -- which, by the way, is not a crime and in the case of a pilot, often only shows a passion for the job. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sylvia Adcock.","Sylvia Adcock: Investigators need to look closely at Flight 370's cargo manifest .

"(CNN) -- The number of journalists jailed around the world reached a record high in 2012, with Turkey the worst offender, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report published Tuesday. At the start of this month, 232 reporters, photographers and editors were in prisons in 27 countries on charges of ""terrorism"" and crimes against the state intended to ""silence critical voices,"" the New-York based group said. The figure is the highest since the organization, which promotes press freedom, began record-keeping in 1990 through an annual census. Until now, the record was 185, set in 1996. Read more: Press freedoms watchdog slams Turkish government . Turkey holds 49 journalists behind bars, according to the group, the largest total for an individual country. Dozens of Kurdish reporters and editors have been jailed on terrorism-related charges, it said, and several other journalists ""on charges of involvement in anti-government plots."" ""Broadly worded anti-terror and penal code statutes have allowed Turkish authorities to conflate the coverage of banned groups and the investigation of sensitive topics with outright terrorism or other anti-state activity,"" the committee said. Iran came a close second, with 45 jailed journalists, according to the report. Tehran has ""sustained a crackdown that began after the disputed 2009 presidential election,"" it said. Many of the 32 journalists behind bars in China, the third worst offender, are Tibetans or Uighurs who were imprisoned for covering ethnic unrest that flared up in 2008, according to the committee. Others are being held for expressing dissident political views, it said . In Eritrea, none of the 28 detained journalists have ""ever been publicly charged with a crime or brought before a court for trial,"" the report said, dubbing the country ""the worst abuser of due process."" Amid the civil war raging in Syria, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have seized at least 15 journalists, according to the committee. ""None of the detainees have been charged with a crime, and the authorities have been unwilling to account for the detainees' whereabouts or well-being,"" it said. On a more positive note, the committee noted that for the first time since 1996, Myanmar is not on its list of countries jailing journalists. The Myanmar government of President Thein Sein, whose recent political reforms have been welcomed by the United States and Europe, has released at least 12 journalists over the past year, the report said.","A total of 232 reporters, photographers and editors are behind bars, a group says .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- An Istanbul court slapped a world-renowned musician Monday with a 10-month suspended sentence for posting a series of tweets that poked fun at Islamic descriptions of heaven. Classical concert pianist Fazil Say, 43, was found guilty of ""openly insulting the religious values held by a portion of the public"" for the tweets, which were posted last year. ""Although I am innocent and have not committed any crime, this decision I received is more worrisome for the freedom of expression and belief in Turkey than it is to me as a person,"" Say wrote in a statement posted on his Facebook page. The sentence marks a ""very sad day for freedom of expression in Turkey,"" Say's lawyer Meltem Akyol told CNN. ""We were expecting an acquittal."" ""Freedom of expression does not entitle you to condescend or offend or insult people,"" countered plaintiff Ali Emre Bukagili. ""That's a crime."" Say's tweets included: ""You say the rivers will flow with wine, is heaven a tavern? You say each believer will receive two women, is heaven a brothel?"" according to the indictment. In another, Say joked about the short duration of a cleric's traditional Islamic call to prayer. The tweet asked a rhetorical question to the chanting cleric: ""What's the hurry? Lover waiting?"" the indictment said. Say also was convicted of retweeting allegedly offensive posts, such as, ""I am not sure if you have realized it, but where there is scum, a lowlife, a thief or a fool, s/he is always an Allahist. Is this a paradox?"" Faruk Logoglu, deputy international affairs chairman of the nation's main opposition party, CHP, called the sentence a ""new link in the long chain of assaults on the freedom of expression and freedom of conscience in Turkey."" ""This is shameful for Turkish democracy,"" he said. Say won't have to serve his sentence as long as he doesn't commit a similar crime within the next five years. ""The decision is a correct one,"" said Bukagili. ""In our laws, it is against the law to publicly insult a belief, and he did that."" The case was filed last June after three plaintiffs lodged formal complaints. Say has been a vocal critic of the Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party, which has governed Turkey since it first won parliamentary elections more than a decade ago. Critics linked the case to a recent string of freedom of expression prosecutions in Turkey. Last year, Say commented on the case for CNN Turk. ""... if I thought I was guilty, I would feel uncomfortable with myself and would enter the jail on my own,"" he said. ""It is difficult for them to send me to jail. It is that simple.""","NEW: ""This is shameful for Turkish democracy,"" says Turkey's main opposition party .

"(CNN) -- After a dust-up last week, Rihanna says she doesn't want her performance of the song ""Run This Town"" to air on ""Thursday Night Football"" this week. CBS is saying ""fine"" -- if you don't want the airtime, we won't give it. ""Beginning this Thursday, we will be moving in a different direction with some elements of our 'Thursday Night Football' open,"" CBS said in a statement. ""Run This Town"" will be replaced by theme music -- apparently for the rest of the season, not just for this week. The network's decision was announced Tuesday morning, a few hours after Rihanna criticized the network on Twitter. ""CBS you pulled my song last week, now you wanna slide it back in this Thursday? NO,"" she wrote, followed by an expletive. ""Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this,"" she added. After CBS weighed in, however, the company that owns the rights to the song, Roc Nation, said the change stemmed from its revocation of the rights. ""Due to the misuse and misrepresentation of Rihanna's name and participation in connection to CBS' TNF, CBS was not allowed to license and utilize the song 'Run This Town.' Roc Nation made the decision to not grant the song's usage,"" the company said in a statement. Rihanna recorded a special version of ""Run This Town"" for CBS' fall telecasts of ""Thursday Night Football."" The song was supposed to be part of the opening video for the weekly show in much the same way that a Carrie Underwood performance kicks off NBC's ""Sunday Night Football."" But CBS scrapped the opening video last week in light of its news coverage of the Ray Rice scandal that has engulfed the NFL. Holding off on the video gave CBS more time for somber discussion of domestic violence and the league's treatment of it. Rihanna, who was a victim of domestic violence during a 2009 incident with then-boyfriend and fellow music star Chris Brown, indicated in her tweets that she felt the network was punishing her.","CBS pulled Rihanna's song from ""Thursday Night Football"" last week .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. airstrike near Baghdad on Monday marked a new phase in the fight against ISIS. The airstrike southwest of the city appears to be the closest the U.S. airstrikes have come to the capital of Iraq since the start of the campaign against ISIS, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. And U.S. Central Command said in a statement that it was the first strike as part of ""expanded efforts"" to help Iraqi forces on the offensive against ISIS. Monday's airstrike destroyed an ISIS fighting position that had been firing at Iraqi forces, Central Command said. It occurred about 35 km (22 miles) southwest of Baghdad, another U.S. official said. The United States began targeted airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last month to protect American personnel and support humanitarian missions. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama said new airstrikes would aim to help Iraqi forces on the offensive against the Islamist militants. Obama also said airstrikes would include ISIS targets in Syria. And last week he also asked Congress for authorization to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels. The authority comes under Title 10 of the U.S. code, which deals with military powers, and Congress could vote on granting it this week. Approval also would allow the United States to accept money from other countries for backing the Syrian opposition forces. A senior administration official told reporters Monday that Obama has been making calls to Democratic and Republican members of Congress, asking them to pass the authorization. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry courted Middle Eastern leaders over the weekend to join a coalition in the fight against the Islamist militant group, which calls itself the Islamic State. More than two dozen nations, the Arab League, the European Union and United Nations met in the French capital Monday, calling ISIS a threat to the international community and agreeing to ""ensure that the culprits are brought to justice."" The United States has conducted more than 150 airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, and Kerry has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against the militants. But it remains unclear which countries are on that list and the precise roles they'll play. What should the world know about Muslims? CNN's Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta, Ashley Fantz and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The U.S. military says an airstrike near Baghdad is the first in ""expanded efforts""

"(CNN) -- When ""Orange is the New Black"" writer Lauren Morelli started working on the series, she didn't realize how much it would also script her future. As Morelli wrote in an essay for Mic.com in May, writing for the Netflix hit helped her realize that she was gay -- even though at the time, she was married to a man. When production began on ""OITNB,"" Morelli had been wed for five months. ""I realized I was gay in fall 2012, one of my first days on the set,"" Morelli wrote. ""It wasn't so much one thing, but the sum of many small details: how uncomfortable I felt around groups of lesbians or how I considered myself ... a 'not very sexual person.' When considered alone, these seemed like little quirks that made me me."" But on the set of ""OITNB,"" where she helped shape the story of main character Piper (Taylor Schilling) and her relationships, ""these small moments came into sharp relief,"" Morelli continued. ""I was finally forced to consider a question that had never, ever occurred to me before ... am I gay?"" That answer, she discovered, was yes. Watching a love scene that she'd written between Piper and Alex (Laura Prepon) unfold in front of the cameras, Morelli said she found her emotions paralleling the show. ""I'd found a mouthpiece for my own desires,"" she wrote in her essay, ""and a glimmer of what my future could look like."" According to TMZ, Morelli and her husband of two years, Steve Basilone, have now amicably split and have jointly filed for divorce. The OITNB writer is also reportedly dating one of the show's stars, Samira Wiley, the actress who plays Poussey and who sometimes pops up in Morelli's Instagram feed. ""I went through it all on set: I fell in love with a woman, and I watched my life play out on screen,"" Morelli wrote on Mic.com.

"(CNN) -- Russian carmaker Marussia Motors has bought a significant shareholding in the Formula One team Virgin Racing, meaning the team will be renamed ""Marussia Virgin Racing"" for the 2011 season. The rookie team -- who made their Formula One debut this season -- will continue their relationship with Richard Branson, the British businessman whose company created Virgin Racing by signing a sponsorship deal with Manor Motorsport in 2009. The rebranded outfit's car for the 2011 season will be unveiled in Moscow ahead  of next season, and Virgin's chief executive Graeme Lowdon hailed the deal as good news for his team and for the sport. ""This announcement cements our place on the Formula One grid and is testimony to the hard work and dedication of every single member of our team,"" Lowdon told the team's official website.

"(CNN) -- Last year, Dr. Kiran Sagar, a cardiologist in Wisconsin, was fired two months after presenting strong data showing that cardiologists in the hospital she worked at misread a substantial number of heart tests. Similarly, a nurse from Columbia Hospital Corp. of America (HCA) was let go after complaining that a doctor was performing unnecessary cardiac procedures, even after an internal investigation found the nurse's claim to be substantiated. And a few weeks ago, the CBS News program ""60 Minutes"" reported on ER doctors fired for not meeting quotas on the percentage of patients they admitted to the hospital. These recent patterns of firings send yet another strong message to every doctor and nurse who has ever considered speaking up about dangerous and fraudulent medical care: Speak up and risk destroying your career. The culture of health care needs to change. Medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths, yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in America. When we do, it is often behind closed doors. This is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance. Doctors and nurses increasingly feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals, some of which have transformed into giant corporations. Despite concerns from the Federal Trade Commission that costs will go up for consumers, hospital mega-mergers are on the rise. This past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care. While some hospital executives have commendably used a hospital chain's large size to standardize best practices, others have fallen into the age-old management trap of detaching themselves from the front lines and becoming dangerously out of touch with their own staff. I talk to doctors and nurses around the country every week. One trend that seems clear is that more doctors and nurses are feeling frustrated. A recent national study by Mayo Clinic researchers shows that doctor burnout rate is now up to a staggering 46%. A new phenomenon, quite different from when my father practiced medicine, is that doctors and nurses now say they feel like they are tenants working for their landlord: the hospital management. Often, doctors and nurses know how to make care better and safer but feel stripped of the power to make necessary changes. This worker-management disconnect (even antagonism) in any industry is dangerous. In medicine this workplace atmosphere, complicated by perverse economic incentives and weak systems of accountability, contributes to a hospital culture marked by a lack of a sense of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care. What results is a poorer quality of care, more overtreatment, more fraud, more medical mistakes, and more patients falling through the cracks. According to a 2009 CBS-New York Times poll, 77% of Americans say they are satisfied with the quality of their health care. But what makes people think the health care they're receiving is good? Very little. A Harvard study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported an alarming fact: 18% of patients were actually harmed by medical care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 30% of health care procedures, tests and other services do not improve health outcomes. For instance, if you had a medical condition, would you go to a hospital that has performed more than 1,000 unnecessary procedures? Probably not. As much as one-third of all health care expenditures may be going to waste, fraud and unnecessary medical care. This problem is high on the agenda for the American Board of Internal Medicine. Other physician groups have joined the ""Choosing Wisely"" Campaign to address unnecessary care in American medicine. The Institute of Medicine is calling attention to the problem, and many medical researchers are speaking openly about it. But more needs to be done. Rather than reinforce a closed-door culture in American medicine, hospitals should use their new large size to encourage external and independent peer reviews and create a culture of transparency. Patients should be encouraged to keep a copy of their medical records, not inconvenienced with burdensome processes and extra charges to obtain them. A hospital's front-line health care workers are their work engine, and these people should be encouraged to voice their safety concerns to their managers. Mega-hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into the large corporate pitfalls that can erode the standing of any business. A workplace culture that punishes those who speak up about problems by depriving them of their career livelihood is part of the problem itself. As a surgeon, I sometimes see patients after they have blindly walked into the hands of dangerous, expensive and avoidable care. If we are serious about improving health care quality and lowering costs, we need to address the issue of accountability. Our hospitals must be more accountable to patients and doctors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Makary.","Marty Makary: Doctors who talk about fraudulent medical care risk losing job .

"(MMN.com) -- Lulu and I have had our share of training issues, from mastering the down command to heeling during walks. Lulu may be 7 years old, but she's still learning new skills. Whether you have a puppy or an older dog, it's never too late to tackle basic commands. I asked professional dog trainers to share the most prevalent behavior issues, along with solutions. You may have read about the top five most common problems. Here are five more predictable issues and tips for overcoming them. Problem: The dog won't come when called . When you call your pooch, do you hear crickets rather than a tinkling collar? Dog trainer Sarah Wilson suggests that the whole family try an old-fashioned game of hide and seek. Be sure to offer plenty of praise when your pup finds each family member. ""Come is the command people practice the least,"" says Wilson, founder of an online training forum called My Smart Puppy. Hide and seek keeps dogs mentally stimulated while altering the dynamics of your relationship. ""It's the dog's job to keep up with you, not your job to keep up with the dog,"" she says. Use the ""come"" command before each meal, and make sure dogs sit before digging into that bowl of kibble. Wilson also likes to train pets using their favorite squeaky toy. Remove all other toys, say the ""come"" command, and then squeak the toy. Over time, your dog will understand that the command leads to wonderful treats. Just be sure to practice inside as well as outside, Wilson warns. MNN: How to find a reputable dog trainer . ""If they won't leave a biscuit on the ground, they won't leave a squirrel outside the house,"" she says. ""Start with a treat, then the ball and work your way up."" As you practice the ""come"" command, dog trainer Andrew Zbeeb of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta suggests adding focus exercises to the mix. He likes to use high-value treats when challenging dogs outside. Invest in a long leash and get your dog's attention before running backward while holding the treat. ""As we run backward, the dog follows,"" he says. ""Then we stop and say, 'come.' The dog learns it is running toward its handlers and being rewarded for doing so."" Increase the distance over time and slowly encourage your dog to sit and stay after it approaches. Remember, training involves trial and error so be patient. Zbeeb warns against repeating commands, even when you get frustrated. ""Stop asking your dog 30 times to come,"" he says. ""They don't know what it means and they don't want to follow you, so you are wasting your breath. Teach them what it means to come. When they know what that means, you can teach the dog."" Problem: Inappropriate interaction with kids. Kids between the ages of 5 and 9 have the highest rate of dog bite injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While injuries related to dog bites have been decreasing in recent years, Wilson says parents should exercise caution when assigning dog-related tasks to the kids. ""If you can't walk the dog easily and safely, don't ask the child to do it,"" she says. ""If you can't feed the dog safely, don't ask the child to do it."" MNN: Yes, your dog can peacefully coexist with people . Most trainers also encourage parents to bring kids to obedience classes. This reinforces everyone's role in caring for a family pet. Wilson also stresses that kids follow the Golden Rule.Â . ""Never allow the child to do to a dog what you wouldn't allow them to do to a younger child; no chasing or pulling,"" says Wilson. ""Teach kids that a dog's body language is quite a bit like ours. If they don't look at you, is that friendly? No."" She also tells kids to use caution when approaching dogs. If the dog ignores people, she says that means they are not interested in playing. Take it as a sign to leave them alone. Even with training, some pets simply do not interact well around strange people or pets. To address potential etiquette issues that may arise during walks, a group of frustrated dog owners created a Facebook page called DINOS: Dogs in Need of Space. One Facebook fan handles unwanted advances by saying, ""My dog just isn't that into you."" Problem: The dog is unruly around other pets. Pay close attention to pets and watch for signs that they aren't getting along. Wilson stresses that cats need plenty of escape routes so that they can move up and away from unruly dogs. It also helps to keep dogs on a leash when visiting a home with other pets. Sometimes young, four-legged guests can cause trouble. When an older dog growls at a puppy, Wilson corrects the puppy first.Â . MNN: How to jog with your dog . ""Usually the older dog is growling because it already said, 'Leave me alone,' and the pup didn't,"" she says. ""Everyone has a right to their own space. Also, limit hard, fast play. The faster everyone is going, the bigger chance for injury."" Problem: Separation anxiety . Dog trainer and police officer Michael Upshur of Dogma Dog Care says several pet owners call seeking help with separation anxiety. Many of the cases involve small dogs (aka purse pooches) that become destructive because they so rarely spend time alone. To correct the issue, he tells pet owners to leave dogs alone for five minutes, return and offer praise. Increase the duration until your dog learns that it will be fine alone. He also says owners should let dogs be dogs. Research the characteristics and temperament of your dog's breed. For guidance, check out the American Kennel Club website, which lists detailed information on more than 150 breeds. If you have a mutt, talk to your veterinarian for guidance or focus on the breeds your dog resembles most. Upshur adds that mental and physical stimulation also help deter destructive behavior.

When dogs pull on the leash, Upshur starts by correcting the owner. ""That dog is reading your body language,"" he says. ""If the owner pays attention to a stray dog, the dog will pay attention. The more tension you have, the more the dog goes into protection mode or flight mode."" Upshur tells owners to walk with confidence and move away from distractions such as stray dogs or children playing. To build a dog's confidence, he suggests exploring the entire neighborhood during walks. This helps your dog overcome any fear of car sounds and other distractions. ""The dog needs to know that the owner is not going to let anything happen,"" he says. ""Walk with confidence and don't slow down.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Calling her husband a coward and sobbing between pleas for leniency, the wife a Philadelphia abortion doctor was sentenced to jail time Wednesday for her role in late-term abortions at the medical facility. Pearl Gosnell, 52, was sentenced to 7 to 23 months in a county prison for performing a late-term abortion, corrupt organization and conspiracy. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. ""By choosing to take the cowardly course he did, my husband left me to make the apologies,"" Pearl Gosnell told Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Benjamin Lerner. ""My husband is in jail forever, which is where he should be."" ""I'm sorry for my part in this,"" she said, stopping to collect herself. ""It's my fault I wasn't more diligent."" Pearl Gosnell pleaded guilty in 2011 and has been under house arrest since. She will get credit for time served. Earlier this month, Kermit Gosnell was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for killing babies at his West Philadelphia abortion clinic by cutting their spinal cords with scissors after their mothers' gave birth. He was sentenced to life without parole in exchange for waiving his right to appeal the convictions. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty. Doctor found guilty of first-degree murder in Philadelphia abortion case . The 72-year-old physician was also found guilty of the involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion at his West Philadelphia clinic. Dr. Gosnell pleaded not guilty and refused to take a plea deal, opting instead -- much to his wife's chagrin -- for a jury trial. His defense called no witnesses and he did not take the stand. Defense attorney Michael Medway called five witnesses to testify on behalf of Pearl Gosnell. Among them were Gosnell's biological children, Alexandra Gosnell, 15, a Philadelphia high school student, and Barron Gosnell, 21, who is in college. ""Please don't take my mother, too,"" Alexandra Gosnell said before returning to her seat in the back of the courtroom, where she cried for the remainder of the hearing. Before Lerner rendered the sentencing, assistant district attorney Joanne Pescatore referenced prison calls between Pearl Gosnell and her husband, told the judge she ""saw a very different Pearl."" ""It makes me sick,"" Pescatore said. ""She was a major participant. She gained monetarily from these desperate women at the end of their rope."" Lerner explained how he viewed Gosnell before rendering his decision. ""You're not in the same position as these other women,"" he said, explaining how he was near tears after reading letters from the Gosnell children asking for leniency for their mother. ""You were his partner. You chose to be his partner in life, and sadly, you chose to be his partner in this foul organization masquerading as a medical clinic."" The medical clinic owned by Dr. Gosnell had been growing increasingly reckless, according to a 2011 grand jury report. Gosnell and nine other employees at the Women's Medical Center were charged with crimes for the illegal practices at the clinic. Eight people involved at the Gosnell's clinic have pleaded guilty to various charges, including four to murder. Among those who pleaded guilty was former Women's Medical Center employee Adrienne Moton, who was set free Wednesday. Mother shares regrets amid Pennsylvania abortion trial . ""You're going home today,"" Lerner said while her father, brother and sister erupted in cheer. Moton, who has been in jail since 2011, pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, conspiracy, corrupt organizations and conspiracy for snipping the neck of a baby that had been delivered into a toilet. She also took a cell phone photo of 'Baby A,' who was described as close to 28 weeks old and was placed in a shoebox-like container. Trial testimony revealed Dr. Gosnell joked the baby could ""walk to the bus stop."" ""I'm embarrassed and truly ashamed,"" Moton told the court between sobs. ""I wasn't arrested, I was rescued."" Former employee, Lynda Williams, 45, also appeared in court. However, her sentencing was postponed pending a federal case against the clinic. Williams was charged with and pleaded guilty to two third-degree murder charges in the death of a patient and a live infant, and other related offenses. Attorney Stephen Patrizio argued that Williams, a bipolar mother of three with only a sixth-grade education, needed psychiatric help, not more jail time. Gosnell's sister-in-law and former clinic employee Elizabeth Hampton, 55, was sentenced to a year's probation Tuesday for lying to the grand jury about how Mongar died. Hampton, who testified against Gosnell at trial, was the first among them to be sentenced. Opinion: Gosnell case shows why abortion rights need protection . Hampton worked at Gosnell's clinic with her common-law husband, Jimmy Johnson, who performed janitorial duties there. The couple, along with their daughter and four grandchildren, lived in a house owned by Gosnell. Hampton worked on and off at the clinic where she primarily cleaned instruments and answered phones. Johnson also testified at trial. He said that the toilets inside the clinic would be ""stopped up"" at least twice a week. ""When I plunged it once, particles came up,"" Johnson said. ""What kind of particles,"" assistant district attorney Edward Cameron asked. ""An arm came up,"" Johnson replied. Gosnell, a family practitioner who was never board-certified as an obstetrician or gynecologist, was also found guilty of 21 counts of performing abortions beyond 24 weeks. Gosnell's co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine. O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions. O'Neill is scheduled for sentencing July 15.

"(CNN) -- Andrea Jaime was a student in Georgetown University's School of Nursing and Health Sciences. Yet before she could graduate and help others, she became a patient herself. And on Tuesday, Jaime died from what the Washington school said was ""apparent meningitis."" Her loss rattled many in the Georgetown community. While stating ""proper medical precautions have been taken and members of the campus community do not need to take additional action at this time"" to guard against meningitis, the school advised students on how and where they could get medical help. It also offered counseling for those grieving the loss of a fellow student and friend. ""God gained an angel today I'm going to miss you so much,"" wrote one such friend on Jaime's Twitter page. That comment was underneath a message that appeared Friday on Jaime's Twitter feed: ""This is what dying must feel like."" Responding later that day to someone's question, Jaime wrote ""105 fever I think I'm dying."" School officials have not disclosed when, where or how Jaime got sick, including whether it might have had anything to do with her education at Georgetown. She was due to graduate in 2017 from the Nursing and Health Studies school, where she was a human science major, before she died Tuesday at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. ""Andrea died from apparent meningitis,"" Georgetown said in its lone, brief explanation. ""We are awaiting test results to confirm the exact cause (of death)."" In a statement earlier Tuesday, the school noted that ""vaccination prevents against most cases of bacterial meningitis,"" one of five types of meningitis identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The school added: ""Student Health Services are encouraging members of the university to pay increased attention to personal hygienic practices, including washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers regularly. To limit the spread of the illness, you should avoid sharing cups, cosmetics, toothbrushes, smoking materials or anything that comes in contact with the mouth.""

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, Scotland goes to the polls to consider leaving the United Kingdom. I'm praying they say no. For their sakes and for our sakes as fellow Britons. We need each other. Don't get me wrong: the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish are all very different people. You can tell it in the accents -- as an Englishman, I find it almost impossible to do a passable Scottish voice because I just can't sustain the requisite level of anger. And while the English are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed, the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the Scots' uncompromising desire to say what they're really thinking. You see those differences marked in the landscape. Journeying from London to Glasgow to observe the campaign, I was struck by the sudden shift in geography as our train crossed the border. Where England is small and crowded, Scotland is huge and empty. English fields give way to massive Caledonian hills covered in green trees with bald patches of purple flowers. The valleys look like God smashed a fist into the soil -- wild, deep and jagged. That righteous Scottish temper showing through again. But it's precisely these differences that have made the Union between our countries so remarkable -- and so important. For 300 years, we have sustained a political alliance between nations with distinct cultures that has produced one of the world's most successful experiments in getting along against the odds. It's a relationship of convenience, of course -- begun in part so that Scotland could share in our imperial ambitions. And, as such, Scotland's presence in the Union has been sustained hitherto largely by good will. We may all have different understandings of our identity, but we share a common understanding of our needs. This began to change in the years after World War II. As the empire vanished and industry declined, so the economic outlook of Scotland and England began to diverge. A turning point was the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 -- a right-wing leader who may have helped raise living standards in Scotland but whose faith in free markets became increasingly at odds with the Scottish preference for a well-financed public sector. Scotland could have rallied to the left-wing Labour Party, but Labour, too, moved drastically to the right and left many of its working-class constituents behind. The credit crunch challenged the idea that the Union was impervious to economic shock and discredited our political leadership in London. Many Scots turned toward independence as an alternative way of ordering their affairs (while many Englishmen drifted toward the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party). Hence, much of the campaign for independence has centered not around nationalist themes, but socialist ones instead. Its supporters imagine that if freed from the more right-wing English, they'd be able to spend more and invest in public services. In fact, the opposite is true. Such is the likely size of an independent Scotland's debt, and so uncertain is the future of its currency, that it would almost certainly have to raise taxes through the roof. That brings us back to the benefits of sticking together. They are both material and emotional. On the material side, Britain may have been through a tough period recently, but it is now growing mightily. We are predicted to overtake the perfidious French in the size of our economy by 2020 -- making us the fifth biggest in the world. Our accomplishments in the fields of constructing a welfare state or investing in high-tech sectors have been made possible by sharing resources and talent. Likewise, in a frighteningly insecure world, we all benefit from a united defense. OK, so Britain's army no longer patrols an empire. But it is still one of the most powerful in the world, boasts a nuclear deterrent (moored in Scotland) and is a lynchpin of the Atlantic alliance. The army is perhaps at the heart of the emotional case for the Union. Standing together, we've helped win two world wars and seen off the Argentine invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Soldiers have fought in defense of their constituent countries, but always under the banner of the United Kingdom. The ties that bind us, then, are historical and poetic. Every New Year, we Britons sing ""Auld Lang Syne"" -- written by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. It's a song about the importance of remembering old friendships: ""And there's a hand my trusty friend!/ And give me a hand o' thine!/ And we'll take a right good-will draught,/ For auld lang syne."" It might seem silly to reduce a decision about the future of a nation to a few lines of a song sung drunkenly and off-key at midnight, but friendship is a precious thing that men will give their lives for. Many, many British soldiers have done so in the past. I would save the Union out of respect for their memory alone. To the Union and the world, the Scots have brought poetry both sublime and hilariously bad. Schoolchildren across the UK still read the awful lines of William McGonagall that serve as a primer for how not to write. Scottish geniuses -- Adam Smith, David Hume, James Watt, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Braid, Kenneth Graham, Sir Walter Scott, Muriel Spark, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- have also given us all the invention of classical economics, a proud tradition of banking, color photography, the flushing toilet, golf, hypnotism, penicillin and the television set. The locals have also supplied Britain with its last hopeful myth: the rumored existence of the Loch Ness Monster. It's nonsense, of course, but a reminder -- again -- of how much mystery and wonder the Scottish countryside brings to the UK. We are hoping to reintroduce wolves there. If Scotland votes this week for independence, we will divorce with dignity (excepting a few rows about debt and nuclear weapons). But the United Kingdom will miss her dearly. We will be reduced and forced to think afresh about who we are and what we stand for. If I'm honest, the prospect of a Union dominated too heavily by the English worries me. We're simply not as loquacious or romantic as our Scottish cousins.","Historian Timothy Stanley wants Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom .

"(CNN) -- They quit their jobs, sold their cars, cashed in on their bikes and flogged their fridges -- but it was worth every penny to watch their team win the Club World Cup. The fans of Brazilian side Corinthians, one of the most devoted sets of supporters in world football, raised funds any way they could to ensure they made it to Japan to witness history as the Sao Paulo side defeated Chelsea in Yokohama. With an estimated 30,000 Corinithians fans packed into the stadium, Paulo Guerrero set off the Samba celebrations by netting a 69th minute winner. That strike unleashed a carnival atmosphere around the streets of Yokohama as Corinthians became the first team from South America to win the competition since 2006.

Each player performed their own role and were able to do well in their position. I'm very happy."" The South American side, who won the Copa Libertadores in July, rode their luck at times with goalkeeper Cassio making several important stops. The crucial moment came with 21 minutes of the contest remaining when Guerrero headed in from close range after Danilo's shot was blocked. Chelsea, which recently became the first ever defending holder to exit the Champions League at the Group Stage, had its chances to equalize but failed to hit the target. Spain international Fernando Torres missed three golden opportunities to score, while Juan Mata hit a post late on.

Their goalkeeper was man of the match (sic) and for me that means a lot."" The defeat left Chelsea's David Luiz, a boyhood supporter of Corinthians, in tears at the final whistle.

""It was so wrong but so right at the same time,"" she added. ""So Joan. So great."" For his part, Stern -- who described Rivers as a ""remarkable friend to (my) show"" -- said that Rivers' kindness always meant a lot to him.

"(CNN) -- Oh, Rickrolling. Even on Vine, Twitter's app that lets users shoot and share six-second videos, the Web is never gonna give you up. A Cleveland teen-ager hacked Vine on Monday, flouting the app's strict time limit and uploading all 3 minutes, 33 seconds of ""Never Gonna Give You Up,"" the '80s pop hit turned bait-and-switch Internet meme.

Based on his ability to share the joys of Rick Astley with Vine's 13 million users, it's an apt description. Vine became available for Google's Android operating system on Monday. Smidlein, who had experience developing for Android, translated the app's code into a readable format, then tinkered with parts of the program that lets users upload posts. In an interview with tech-news site The Verge, Smidlein declined to say exactly how he bypassed the 6-second video limit and said he never meant for his prank to go public. ""Honestly, it was just for my friends and the people who follow me on Twitter and Vine,"" he said. Smidlein said he was quickly messaged by a Twitter engineer who asked him to take the video down. He did, but by then its viral run had begun. ""Sorry, Twitter/Vine engineers,"" he wrote. ""I tried to keep it quiet, but the internet never forgets."" Twitter did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story. Smidlein has said he'll write more about what he did once the exploit is patched. He apologized on the site several times to ""the engineers whose day I ruined with my stupid messing around."" But it sounds like he was being harder on himself than anyone else. ""Vine, you're a bunch of bullies,"" one reader posted on a Mashable article. ""Your coding was weak and got exploited -- and you aren't thanking this kid for discovering that for you?? Kid, don't apologize. It's their job. They should be paying you."" Another agreed. ""What do I think?"" she wrote. ""I think Vine should hire him.""

"(CNN) -- Several surveillance videos show her walking and running alone. But police say new footage of a missing University of Virginia student appears to show someone following her the night she disappeared. Police in Charlottesville, Virginia, have been searching for 18-year-old Hannah Graham since Sunday. On Thursday afternoon, investigators said they were offering a $50,000 reward for ""information leading to the cause"" of her disappearance. Her parents say they're worried something happened to her after she left a gathering with friends Friday night. ""Hannah is beyond precious to us,"" John and Susan Graham said in a statement released by police Wednesday. ""We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It's totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play."" Business surveillance cameras captured video of a man following Graham downtown early Saturday, Charlottesville Police spokesman Lt. Ronnie Roberts told CNN. The man in the video later came to the police department and told officers he was following Graham because she looked distressed, authorities said. He told police he saw Graham with another man, and the two appeared to know each other. On Thursday afternoon, police released a description of that man, who does not appear in the videos, saying they wanted to speak with him. The teen's mysterious disappearance comes nearly five years after the unsolved killing of another student in the area, sparking fears from some that there could be a connection. Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her remains were found on a farm months later. Police have yet to track down her killer, and her family has long said they suspected there could be other victims. Could there be a link to the Harrington case? ""Certainly the question has arisen. It's certainly a legitimate question,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Wednesday. ""If there comes a time where we believe there is a substantive link to those two investigations, we'll share that with you,"" he said. So far, the police chief said, investigators haven't found anything to tie the two cases. And they haven't found any sign of foul play, despite the concerns the teen's parents have expressed. ""As a parent, I'd be very concerned, but we don't have any substantive evidence to confirm that,"" he said. ""But you know, they're speaking from their heart."" Surveillance videos offer clues . Police describe Graham, a sophomore, as a straight-A student, an accomplished athlete and a good friend. She's from Northern Virginia. She's about 5-foot-11 with blue eyes, light brown hair and freckles, the university said in a release asking for tips about the teen's disappearance. She left a dinner with a group of friends around 11 p.m. Friday. Around 1:20 a.m. Saturday, she sent a text to friends saying she was lost, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself. Investigators have tracked down several surveillance videos that show her that night outside a pub, near a gas station and in a downtown shopping mall, Longo said. But it's not clear where she's going or whether she's in trouble. One video shows her running along the road near a Shell station. That initially concerned investigators, Longo told reporters. But in later videos, he said ""it does not appear at least at that point that she's being pursued."" Investigators are looking for more surveillance videos that they believe could show Graham in downtown Charlottesville. They've interviewed 50 people and received more than 100 tips in the case, police said. And the search is far from over. As time passes, investigators say their search area grows. Search teams from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management are helping, CNN affiliate WVIR reported. ""This investigation has been aggressive and will continue to be aggressive,"" Longo said. CNN affiliate: Corridor has 'infamous reputation' Gil Harrington told CNN affiliate WTVR that it's too soon to draw a direct connection between her daughter's death and Graham's disappearance. ""Your mind goes there, but I think that's premature in a way,"" she told WTVR. ""We have the possibility of having a good outcome with Hannah. We need to keep that in mind."" Right now, Gil Harrington has a poster with pictures of the University of Virginia student on her fridge, beneath the word ""MISSING."" Through ""Help Save the Next Girl,"" an organization founded after her daughter's disappearance and death, she's pushing residents of Charlottesville to call in tips. On Wednesday, the organization tweeted that the Harringtons had left a message in large letters taped on Charlottesville bridge spelled out their support of the search: ""PLEASE FIND HANNAH."" ""Your mind just sickens,"" Gil Harrington told CNN affiliate WVIR. ""You think, how can it be, another girl taken."" This isn't the first time a woman has gone missing in the area. The disappearances of Harrington and Graham, along with several other past cases in the area known as the Route 29 corridor has given the area an ""infamous reputation,"" WTVR says. ""I don't know. Either there is a commonality or a crime spree,"" Harrington told WTVR. ""We have long passed a critical mass that needs looking at. If you look at the map of missing and abducted along Route 29 -- it's not a normal pattern."" Missing nursing student's remains found in Tennessee .

"(CNN) -- A previously unheard recording of Martin Luther King Jr. discussing John F. Kennedy will be played Monday in the place where the civil rights leader was assassinated. King's comments are on a 53-year-old reel-to-reel tape discovered in a Tennessee attic several years ago. But the last several minutes are only now being made public. The civil rights leader is heard discussing Kennedy's role in securing his release from a Georgia prison after he was sentenced to four months of hard labor for a traffic violation two weeks before the election that sent Kennedy to the White House. Then-Sen. Kennedy placed a call to Coretta Scott King against the advice of close advisers, expressing his concern to King's wife. His brother, Robert Kennedy also called the Georgia judge who had sentenced King to the chain gang and denied him bond. King was freed the next day. MLK Jr. interview found in Tennessee attic . The interviewer asked Dr. King if he thought Kennedy had any influence on his release. ""Well, I would say first that many forces worked together to bring about my release,"" King said. ""I don't think any one force brought it about, but you had a plurality of forces working together. I'm sure that the interest of the public, in general, all over America had something, a great deal to do with it."" In fact, Atlanta Mayor William Hartsfield was working to negotiate King's release from incarceration, which began with his arrest during a protest eight days earlier, according to Taylor Branch's historical account in his book, ""Parting the Waters."" ""Now, it is true that Sen. Kennedy did take a specific step,"" King said. ""He was in contact with officials in Georgia during my arrest and he called my wife, made a personal call and expressed his concern and said to her that he was working and trying to do something to make my release possible."" John F. Kennedy made the call to King's wife at the urging of his brother-in-law Sargent Shriver, but out of the presence of campaigns aides who were concerned it could cost him southern support in the election 13 days away, Branch wrote. A special class with MLK . Robert Kennedy, who was initially upset when he found out about the call, reversed himself later that day and placed his own call to the judge, Branch wrote. King told the interviewer he thought it had ""some part"" in his release. ""His brother, who at that time was his campaign manager, also made direct contact with officials and even a judge in Georgia, so the Kennedy family did have some part, at least they expressed a concern and they did have some part in the release, but I must make it clear that many other forces worked to bring it about also."" The Kennedys' intervention is credited with shifting support of Black voters in crucial northern states to the Kennedy side and away from Richard Nixon, whose campaign only offered a ""no comment"" when asked about the civil rights leader's imprisonment. The recording is from an interview conducted on December 21, 1960, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by a man who intended to write a book about the civil rights movement. He never finished the book and the tape was lost until the man's son rediscovered it five decades later while rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father. The first five minutes, in which King discusses his definition of nonviolence and its importance in the civil rights movement, was made public in 2012. ""I would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means,"" he said. ""And it grows out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent."" King continued, ""I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage,"" he said. ""It represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline."" In another part of the recording, King describes his visit to Nigeria and the importance of the civil rights movement in the United States and abroad. Kennedy White House had jitters ahead of 1963 March on Washington . ""There is quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa for the situation in the United States. African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place,"" he said, ""We must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two-thirds color."" Keya Morgan, a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts, brokered its sale to illusionist David Copperfield, who then donated the tape to the National Civil Rights Museum, which is housed in the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. King was shot to death standing on a balcony of the Memphis, Tennessee, motel on April 4, 1968. The entire recording will be played Monday in the last room where the civil rights leader slept. ""When I heard it, I got goose bumps all over,"" Morgan said, ""It feels like he's sitting in your living room and talking to you."" ""It gave me chills,"" Copperfield told CNN in September 2012, when he bought the tape for an undisclosed amount. It was striking because the recording revealed King in a relaxed mood, he said. ""We've heard Dr. King talk about peaceful change in the public forum, but this is an audio tape of him talking conversationally,"" he said. ""I'm certainly no expert, but it's the first time I've ever heard him in that context and I was very moved by it."" Copperfield said he gave the recording to the museum because it ""is just the right thing to do."" ""He's certainly one of the great inspirational figures in history,"" Copperfield said. ""So much of what I do, in my own little way, is making people dream, transporting them, making them think differently. That's what magic does. His dream was far greater than any entertainer can provide."" The greatest MLK speeches you never heard .","The civil rights leader discusses Kennedy's role in getting him freed from prison .

"(CNN) -- It all seemed like a Friday night prank in the beachfront paradise of Isla Vista, the off-campus housing quarter for students from University of California at Santa Barbara and the local community college. The pops sounded like firecrackers, a common mischief. And the gun looked fake, like one used for pellet games. But what seemed like a college joke at first became very real. Sienna Schwartz saw the gunman driving by her and thought he was a hoaxster -- until she felt the whoosh of a bullet passing her skin. ""He lifted up a little black pistol and ... I just thought it was an Airsoft gun or something, so I was like, hey, what up?"" she said, becoming tearful as she recounted the experience. ""And I turned around and I started walking the other way,"" she said. ""He shot ... I just felt the wind pass right by my face."" Schwartz broke down in retelling how the beauty of Isla Vista became a scene of mass death Friday night. In all, seven people were killed, including the gunman who fired into crowds while driving his black BMW. It was the second time that a mass killing has occurred in the unincorporated community in 13 years; the other one also involved a motorist. Friday night's violence couldn't have picked a more beautiful college setting. Beachfront beauty . UCSB is renowned as a school on the beach, and as such, it's one of the most scenic campuses in America, caressed by cool Pacific breezes. Just 100 miles from Los Angeles, Santa Barbara attracts weekend crowds seeking a getaway. Its main street features boutiques and eateries in stylish Spanish-mission architecture. Isla Vista is the adjacent residential quarter for students mostly enrolled in UCSB and others at Santa Barbara City College. The community sits on beachfront bluffs just west of UCSB and offers off-campus apartments where students commonly double up in one bedroom. In fact, Isla Vista holds legend status as the most densely populated square mile in California, though the county says its size is actually a half-square mile, or 320 acres. Officially, Isla Vista is an unincorporated community of 20,000 people -- 13,000 of them are students -- in Santa Barbara County, the county says. The streets prove the student presence: they're lined with bicycles. Friday night's mass shooting occurred on an weekend evening when Isla Vista is typically jammed with students moving shoulder-to-shoulder from one party to another. On Saturday morning, however, the community was a massive crime scene. Pizzerias, delis, cafes and convenience stores downtown were lined with yellow police tapes zigzagging everywhere -- because the drive-by gunman apparently fired upon several places while in motion. Bullet casings lay scattered on the street, and storefront windows were shattered. 2001 mass killing . As grisly as it was, the setting wasn't the first time that Isla Vista has known a mass killing, especially by a motorist. In 2001, David Attias, son of film director Daniel Attias, ran over five people in Isla Vista, killing four of them, and exclaimed he was the ""angel of death."" Attias was convicted of four murders in 2002, but a jury later ruled him not guilty by reason of insanity. Attias was then sent to a California mental hospital. In Friday night's deaths, witnesses -- largely of college-student age -- initially thought the unfolding events were student antics. Sounded like fireworks . Summer Young said she was walking down the street and heard what sounded like fireworks set off by students. ""People get stupid out here sometimes,"" she said. But the pops were gunfire, and the car passed her, she learned. ""He was just firing up shots,"" Young said. Another witness, Cayla Bergman, a UCSB student, also described the bangs as fireworks. ""We're used to loud noises around here,"" she said. But then the crowds went into a panic. ""A bunch of people from outside just started running into the store,"" Bergman said. Sorority bloodshed . Kyle Sullivan, 19, a student at Santa Barbara City College, came upon three young women -- all shot -- on a lawn in front of the Alpha Phi sorority, located in a cluster of Greek houses in Isla Vista. One woman appeared to be dead. Another was struggling and ""just barely able to move her eyes."" A third, wounded in the kidney and arm, was on the phone with her mother, telling her she probably wasn't going to make it and ""how much she loved her,"" Sullivan said. ""It was a huge shock last night,"" Sullivan told CNN in an interview on the sorority lawn, reconstructing events. ""I really wasn't able to sleep at all. It was heartbreaking, that something would happen in our community like this."" Nikolaus Becker, a graduating high school senior who was visiting Isla Vista, was eating a burger in a restaurant when he and friends heard pops, thinking they were fireworks. Other students were doing homework inside the eatery. ""We were actually joking around about it,"" he said of the popping. ""People were riding their bikes around outside, and parties were still going on."" Then Becker and friends heard two more sets of bangs -- with police running. They also saw a speeding car -- moving at 50 mph, screeching around a corner. ""Nobody knew what was going on, and everybody was kind of scared to go outside,"" Becker said. When he finally went outside a half hour later, Becker saw body bags on the street. Colleges ache . Both colleges expressed sympathies Saturday. They are now coordinating counseling and student support services. ""Our hearts are aching as we learn about the tragedy that unfolded in Isla Vista last night,"" a Santa Barbara City College statement said Saturday. ""We know our students co-mingle with UCSB students and Isla Vista residents as part of our greater community and we all, as an extended family, are impacted by this unimaginable event."" UCSB is providing temporary housing for displaced students. ""Our campus community is shocked and saddened by the events that occurred last night in the nearby community of Isla Vista,"" a university statement said. Who's the man behind the rampage?

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police are still searching for suspects in the killings of two British tourists on an idyllic resort island after DNA tests on more than a dozen men found no matches with evidence from the female victim's body. Provincial police chief Kiatthipong Khaosumarng said that experts carried out the tests on DNA samples from 11 migrants working on the island and two British brothers, one of whom had shared a room with the male victim. No one has been arrested yet over the killings on the island of Koh Tao, nor has anyone been officially named a suspect. Police had previously asked the two British brothers, Christopher and James Ware, not to leave Thailand, saying they were ""under watch."" Kiatthipong declined to comment on reports that the two brothers have now been allowed to leave Thailand. Police are now trying to find other people who were caught on surveillance video the night the two tourists -- Hannah Witheridge, 23 and David Miller, 24 -- were killed, he said. An autopsy revealed both victims had been hit by a hard object, according to Maj. Gen. Pornchai Suteerakhun, the head of the Police Hospital's Institute of Forensic Medicine. Miller was hit and had scratches on his back, in addition to having water in his lungs consistent with drowning, an autopsy showed. Witheridge was hit several times on her head and face and her body had evidence of sexual intercourse, according to her autopsy. Pornchai didn't confirm or deny that authorities believe Witheridge was raped. Kiatthipong said that two sets of DNA have been found on Witheridge's body, indicating at least two culprits in her death. Neither set matches that of Miller, he said. Family: 'A beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman' Police previously said they had ruled out robbery as a motive. Miller and Witheridge were last seen with friends at a bar in the early hours of Monday before leaving together, according to Kiatthipong. Police have released a grainy image from video outside that bar, adding that they wanted to interview a person -- who they described as an Asian man -- seen in it. The victims were discovered partially undressed with severe injuries to their heads, and a hoe with blood on it was found near the bodies, police said. The deaths have shaken residents on popular holiday island, which takes up only 21 square kilometers (8 square miles) amid bright blue waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Authorities said it was the first homicide case on the island -- known for its diving locations, white-sand beaches and vibrant nightlife -- in at least eight years. The confusion and heartache there, though, pales compared to that felt now half a world away in Briton, where two families are coming to grips with their loved ones' deaths. In a statement issued by the British Embassy in Bangkok, Witheridge's family said she was ""a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman who poured joy into the lives of all who knew her"" and they were ""utterly devastated and shocked by what has happened."" Miller's family described David Miller as ""an artist by temperament, so talented. ""He had a creative eye that he carried with him through life and in his degree. He was hard-working, bright and conscientious, with everything to look forward to.""

"(CNN) -- One of the world's best urban sunsets nearly happened in New York on May 29, 2014. Unfortunately, cloud cover spoiled the first ""Manhattanhenge"" event of the year, the term coined by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson to describe when the sun sets in perfect alignment with the city's street grid. He created the term based on Stone Henge in the UK, the ancient landmark that highlights the sun in similar fashion during the winter and summer solstices. Luckily, Manhattanhenge is happening again on May 30 and July 11-12. And if clouds spoil all all those chances to snap pics of a slowly setting sun beside the Empire State Building, console yourself with these other amazing sunset pics, taken around the world. We'd love to hear about your own favorite sunset spots too. Tell us about them in the comments section below. 1. U Bein Bridge, Mandalay, Myanmar .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian playmaker Kaka was officially presented as a Real Madrid player, after being handed the number eight jersey in front of thousands of supporters and a huge media contingent at the club's Bernabeu stadium on Tuesday evening. Kaka parades his new Real Madrid jersey after completing his $92 million transfer to the Spanish giants. An estimated 50,000-strong crowd, almost three times the anticipated number, turned up to watch the ceremony as Kaka was unveiled as Madrid's latest addition by club president Florentino Perez and honorary president Alfredo di Stefano. Latest transfer gossip and rumors . Kaka, who completed his medical earlier in the day having landed in the Spanish capital in the morning, has penned a six-year contract and has cost Madrid a reported $92 million. There had been speculation that Kaka would be handed the number five shirt that Zinedine Zidane had once worn for Madrid, but the new arrival will instead take up the number eight shirt formerly worn by Fernando Gago. The presentation took place on a stage erected on the Bernabeu pitch that also included Madrid's record nine European Cup trophies, a giant screen and with a backdrop of four huge images showing club legends Raul, Juanito, Di Stefano and Zidane. The 27-year-old Kaka, who was named player of the tournament after helping Brazil win the Confederations Cup in South Africa over the last few weeks, told supporters: ""Today is a very happy day for me. ""I'm very happy because this new stage of my career will be at Real Madrid. I hope to write my name into the history of this club with many victories and successes."" Kaka was the first signing confirmed by Madrid after Perez returned to the club presidency at the start of June. Soon after bringing in the Brazilian, Perez also agreed a world-record 80 million euros fee with Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo. That deal was finalized on Friday night and will come into effect from Wednesday, with Ronaldo, who like Kaka will be tied to the Spanish giants until 2015, being presented on July 6. Aside from Kaka and Ronaldo, Madrid also struck a deal to sign Valencia defender Raul Albiol last week for a fee believed to be around 13 million euros, while the likes of Franck Ribery, David Villa and Xabi Alonso are all being linked with moves to the Bernabeu as Perez relaunches the famous 'galacticos' policy that he presided over during his first tenure at the club. Then, while president from 2000-06, Perez sanctioned the big-money signings of superstars such as Zidane, David Beckham, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, a policy that reaped indifferent rewards with Madrid winning seven trophies under Perez in total but none in his final three years.","Kaka is unveiled as a Real Madrid player after completing his move from Milan .

"(CNN) -- Actress Jean Stapleton, best known for her role as Archie Bunker's wife in the groundbreaking 1970s sitcom ""All in the Family,"" has died, her son said Saturday. She was 90 years old. Her son John Putch told CNN about her passing and, along with his sister Pamela Putch, wrote an obituary saying that she ""passed away peacefully of natural causes"" on Friday at her New York City home ""surrounded by friends and her immediate family."" ""No one gave more profound 'how to be a human being' lessons than Jean Stapleton,"" said Norman Lear, who produced and directed ""All in the Family."" ""Goodbye Edith, darling."" The daughter of an opera singer and businessman, Stapleton grew up on Long Island and in New York City. It was there during the early 1940s, while working as a typist for the British War Ministry Office, that she began her career in theater. Share you memories . Stapleton made it to Broadway in the production ""In the Summer House"" in 1953, the same year of her television debut on the daytime drama ""Woman With a Past."" Other big stage roles followed, including in ""Bells Are Ringing"" and ""Damn Yankees."" She also did more and more television, including appearances on shows such as ""Philco TV Playhouse"" and ""Dr. Kildare."" Her breakout role was as Edith Bunker, the conscience of ""All in the Family"" as the kindhearted foil to husband Archie, played by the late Carroll O'Connor. ""All in the Family"" was one of television's most popular shows as it broke ground while tackling a host of social issues such as racism, sexuality, life and death. Edith Bunker, played by Stapleton, for instance revealed that she had breast cancer on the show, a rare occurrence at the time. ""I just loved doing it from the very beginning,"" Stapleton told CNN in 2001, shortly after O'Connor's death. She won three Emmy awards -- in 1971, 1972 and 1978, in addition to five other nominations in which he she fell short -- for her performance in that Lear-helmed show. Entertainers mourn Stapleton: 'A great actress and a wonderful lady' ""Jean was a brilliant comedienne with exquisite timing,"" said Rob Reiner, who played the Bunkers' son-in-law referred to as ""Meathead"" on the show. ""Working with her was one of the greatest experiences of my life."" Stapleton kept busy after the show went off in the air in 1979 and kept on racking up more accomplishments. Those include Emmy nominations in 1982 for playing Eleanor Roosevelt in the CBS miniseries ""Eleanor, First Lady of the World"" and in 1995 as Aunt Vivian in a guest spot on the ABC comedy ""Grace Under Fire."" ""RIP Jean Stapleton,"" tweeted fellow TV comedy veteran Roseanne Barr, ""a great actor whose range was unbelievable, deep and majestic."" In 2002 she was chosen for the Television Academy Hall of Fame, joining the likes of Tim Conway and Bob Mackie in that organization's 15th induction class. Her most recent on-screen credits, according to the IMDB website, are from 2001 when she appeared in the film ""Pursuit of Happiness"" and the TV movie ""Like Mother Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes"" along with Mary Tyler Moore. And after ""All in the Family,"" she continued working in theater, including a nationwide tour as Roosevelt in her one-woman show ""Eleanor: Her Secret Journey,"" the Broadway revival of ""Arsenic and Lace"" and Obie Award performances in Harold Pinter's ""Mountain Language"" and ""The Birthday Party."" Her final stage appearance was in ""The Carpetbagger's Children"" a few blocks from her home in New York, to which she returned permanently in 2002. Calling her ""our collective Mother, with a capital M,"" John and Pamela Putch -- Stapleton's two children with her husband William Putch, whom she married in 1957 and who died in 1983 -- said ""her devotion to her craft and her family taught us all great lessons."" ""In her own words, she was an 'actress,' not a celebrity,"" they wrote in her obituary. ""The play always came first."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- It may lie in Szepasszonyvolgy -- or what locals call the Valley of the Beautiful Women -- but the Golen Cellar isn't much to look at. Nevertheless, behind this simple cavern's red doors, stenciled with the image of Bacchus, lie barrels of the best wine to be found in one of Hungary's most beautiful vineyard destinations. Menoire is a half-sweet and fruity red wine, low in tannins. My Hungarian mother, whose family once owned vineyards in the area, would bring me here amid the musty aroma of oak barrels and the waft of red onions on zsiros kenyer -- bread topped with lard, onion and paprika. The wine would be decanted unceremoniously into a huge two-liter recycled Coke bottle. 'Not the rubbish you get in supermarkets' For her, the wine in the Szepasszonyvolgy recalled her student days in the city's college and her family's connection with the area. ""Your grandfather made white wine like this,"" she said when tasting a glass of Csersegi Fuszeres, another local favorite. ""This is proper cellar wine, not the rubbish you get in the supermarkets."" They take wine very seriously in this part of northeastern Hungary, close to the edge of the Bukk Mountains. At one time the local red ""bulls blood"" was supposed to give residents of the main town of Eger supernatural strength to ward off vampirism -- a legend born from its violent past as a trophy in battles with Ottoman invaders. Even when my mother's family lost its vineyards after World War II, my grandfather never gave up making his own wine. Today, wine is still the blood that flows through the town's culture. Eger is the ideal destination for wine fans looking for an informal tasting trip. The lack of pretension in the cellars is a big plus for those wanting an introduction to the local produce. 'Bull's blood' It's the topographical ingredients of the Eger region that make it ideal for winemaking. It has limestone and clay-based slopes along with a cool climate, not dissimilar to Burgundy in France. Eger's grape-growing country spreads out into 5,000 hectares of vineyards, and includes wines areas that carry a protected status. Among them is Debroi Harslevelu, a golden wine produced in Eger's Debro district that carries the aroma of linden flowers and a rich sweetness. Others include Egri Bikaver (better known as the anti-vampiric ""bull's blood""). Synonymous with Eger, Egri Bikaver is one of Hungary's most famous red wines, known for its ruby color and spicy notes. The wine comprises a blend of at least three of 17 red grape types from the Eger district. It varies between wineries, but the Kadarka grape, supposedly brought over during the Ottoman occupation, often anchors it. Szepasszonyvolgy and its more than 200 wine cellars are easily reached from the center of Eger via the miniature train that departs from Egeszseghaz Street. Each cellar has its own distinct flavor. The ones located at the base of the valley pulse at night from local activity and live gypsy music, while others are more spartan, pulling in the crowds with quality wine. The Hagymasi Cellar, at number 19, is by far the most spectacular, a cathedral to wine carved under the hill. It's worth visiting for the architecture alone, or for its pince lepeny, a buckwheat pancake filled with ham and cheese -- perfect to soak up the alcohol. And, of course, at the top of the hill, at number 28-29, there's the Golen Cellar. These days there's no need to bring your own recycled Coke bottle. Here are others to try: . St. Andrea . This is a fairly young cellar following traditional and classic methods, aiming to redefine Eger's wines for the 21st century.

"Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- Let's not pretend Queen Elizabeth doesn't have opinions. She's human and must have strong views on the potential break-up of the United Kingdom, which she represents. What matters is whether she expresses those views in public, which would compromise her constitutional role to remain impartial, and could undermine the position of the monarchy. The Queen has managed to ""stay above politics"" for more than 60 years -- and with Scotland voting on independence Thursday she's not about to upset things now. The closest Elizabeth II has come to commenting on the referendum was something she said to a well-wisher outside a Scottish church on Sunday, that she hopes people ""think very carefully about the future."" This is a rare moment of candor for someone who's well aware that anything she says to a member of the public has the potential to be picked up by reporters, who she also knows have the referendum at the forefront of their minds. This came amid UK newspaper reports that the Queen felt a great deal of concern over independence. Her grandson, Prince William, also appeared to step into the debate, according to some newspapers, when he was asked about his wife's second pregnancy on the day it was announced. Of course, he said, the couple were thrilled -- but then he added: ""It's important that we focus on the big news, the big international and domestic thing going on at the moment."" That comment was seen by parts of the UK media as a reference to the Scottish referendum. So what's the official line? A palace spokeswoman told me: ""Any suggestion that the Queen would wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong. Her Majesty is firmly of the view that this is a matter for the people of Scotland."" The Queen has come under pressure from some politicians to step into the debate but that idea was given short shrift. ""The Queen is above politics and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case,"" said the spokeswoman. One of the Queen's great achievements has been to retain cross-party support in parliament throughout her reign (remember, she came to the throne in 1952). She's done this by refusing to take sides, in public at least. Due to her popularity, she could sway opinion but royalty is about the long game. If she involves herself in policy then she risks alienating people and parliamentarians who could ultimately de-throne her and bring in a president. The Queen's role in Scotland isn't actually at any immediate risk. The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as ""Queen of Scots"" in an independent Scotland. That doesn't, however, do justice to the historic significance of the moment. The United Kingdom was born out of the merger of the English and Scottish royal families more than 400 years ago, which in turn led to the Treaty of Union of 1707 and the joining of parliaments. This new country went on to build an empire that spanned the globe, at various points taking in the United States, India, Australia, Canada and much of Africa. The managed decline of the empire after World War II is held up as one of Queen Elizabeth's great achievements. As territories broke away, she helped rebrand a Commonwealth of independent nations. But bringing Scotland into that fold has an entirely different significance. Scotland isn't some breakaway outpost of the British Empire; it's home turf which has remained uncontested since the Renaissance. Breaking up the United Kingdom now would prompt an identity crisis for Queen and country. Factor in that her mother was Scottish and it's intrinsically personal too. The last time Elizabeth II touched publicly on this idea was in 1977 during a speech to mark her Silver Jubilee. At the time, Scotland and Wales were voting on forming national assemblies. She said: ""I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Perhaps this Jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of the United Kingdom."" Empires may come and go, but the Queen's facing the break-up of her home country. It's personal and professional for her.","Scotland votes this week on whether to become an independent country .

"(CNN) -- Kanye West has fired back at those criticizing him for an awkward incident involving a wheelchair-bound concertgoer. The uncomfortable moment happened during West's Friday concert in Sydney, when the rapper stopped the event midshow and demanded that his audience stand. The Grammy winner didn't resume the show until he confirmed that a pair of audience members who weren't standing were unable to do so because they were handicapped. Kanye West's controversial concert demand . After that incident, the Twitterverse went into overdrive with anger at West -- and on Monday, the rapper and his wife, Kim Kardashian, offered a defense. During a performance in Brisbane on Monday, West took a moment to explain his side of the story and criticize the media for highlighting Friday's misunderstanding. He called out the likes of Matt Lauer, Michael Strahan, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Roberts and asked them to look at him from a new perspective before covering stories on his actions. ""They've got this thing where they want the masses, the people who've never even heard one of my albums, to somehow read a headline that reads negative and to think that I'm a bad person. But the thing is ... I'm a married Christian man with a family,"" West said during his five-minute speech. ""At my concerts, I make sure everybody has as good a time as possible. So all this demonizing me, it ain't going to work after a while. Pick a new target, because I'm not one of these dumba** artists that you're used to."" Kardashian turned to Instagram to show her support for her husband. Kim Kardashian's marriage milestone: 73 days with Kanye West . ""It's frustrating that something so awesome could be clouded by lies in the media,"" the reality star vented alongside a video of West's performance. ""Kanye never asked anyone in a wheel chair to stand up & the audience videos show that. He asked for everyone to stand up & dance UNLESS they were in a wheel chair."" As video from Friday's concert in Sydney shows, West did take his demand that all audience members stand seriously, but he didn't insist that disabled attendees get up. Regardless, fans will have to prepare themselves for more than music from a Kanye West concert. Monday's show marked the final date on West's current tour, but he finished his statement teasing the likelihood of more interruptions going forward. ""You come at me, I'm going to take my platform, and break this s*** down for real, intelligent people every night,"" West told his audience. ""And then we'll get back to the music.""","Kanye West has responded to criticism over handicapped concert-goers .
