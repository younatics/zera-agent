"(CNN) -- ""When the history is written of this era, this is how you'll be remembered: 'He was the first black president.' Okay, not a bad accomplishment, but that's it. That's it, Mr. Obama.""-- Michael Moore . We have become used to sky-is-falling rhetoric from filmmaker Michael Moore, but what isn't hyperbolic about the sentiment packed into that quote is the disappointment many supporters of Sen. Barack Obama have in President Barack Obama. Earlier this year, one in four Democrats and two in three Independents said this administration has let them down, according to a CBS News/New York Times Poll. It seems once the euphoria of 2008 wore off, voters were shocked to learn the country's first black president wasn't as radical as his election. He's shown himself to be idealistic but methodical. A compassionate figure with a thing for drones and kill lists. These days, he is thinking legacy. But what will history say about the man who was voted into office with a mandate to end the war in Iraq and now will likely leave that office with a new war in Iraq trailing behind? As the bombing in Syria by the United States, and to a lesser extent, a cadre of allies, was getting under way, Obama delivered a thoughtful address to the United Nations on Wednesday. He called out Arab nations that ""accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down."" He dared to challenge Muslims to reject those who rally around a bastardized version of the Islamic faith and then use that doctrine to justify chaos. He spoke of a crossroad between ""war and peace,"" ""disorder and integration,"" ""fear and hope."" Remember that word? Hope. It was the word Obama used to ignite the movement that would lift him from his position as a little-known junior senator from Illinois into the White House and onto the world stage. He promised to change the way things had always been. Now Moore and others are disappointed because they believed him. After winning the Iowa Democratic caucus in January 2008, Obama told the rabid crowd that the country was choosing unity over division and that ""this was the place, this was the moment where America remembered what it means to hope."" Six years later, a Gallup poll found fewer Iowans approve of the job Obama's doing than the national average -- 38% to 43%. What will history say about the man who encouraged immigrants to dream big and then left them hanging for the sake of the midterm election? Who has overseen 54 consecutive weeks of private-sector job growth, the longest stretch in history. Who pledged to close Guantanamo Bay. Who OK'd the mission that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden. Who promised to be transparent. In 2007, Oprah Winfrey gave a speech in support of Obama. She said, ""We need a new way of doing business in Washington, D.C. and in the world. ... I'm tired of politics as usual."" And yet here we are. George W. Bush left Afghanistan and Iraq for Obama to sort through, and now it is likely Obama will leave behind Iraq and Syria for his successor. Opinion: America's wartime president . At the U.N., Obama explained in detail why it was important to defeat ISIS. Instead of a soaring delivery, he spoke plainly about the choices that lie in front of us all, intelligently shifting the point of emphasis from destroying terrorist groups to derailing their instruments of recruitment, funding, and their very philosophy. ""No God condones this terror,"" he said. ""There can be no reasoning -- no negotiation -- with this brand of evil,"" he said. ""The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force."" And then he reiterated that he is prepared to lead in this force for the remainder of his presidency. It was the kind of rhetoric we were accustomed to hearing from his 2008 opponent, Sen. John McCain, who has yet to see a war he didn't want us to be a part of. It was the kind of rhetoric his 2012 opponent, Mitt Romney, said would make him the better leader. It was the kind of rhetoric that has become as much a part of Obama's complicated legacy as the Affordable Care Act, the rise in LGBT rights and the slow, but real, economic recovery. Syria now becomes the seventh predominantly Muslim country in which he has authorized military strikes. Perhaps his earlier persona contributed to his resistance to do so sooner, despite the advice of his inner circle. When one takes power under the guise of a peaceful change agent, one should pause before ordering airstrikes, if for no other reason than not wanting to contribute to the Earth's carnage. But for the next two years, he is committed to doing just that. He doesn't have much of a choice, really. Terrorists are reportedly developing articles of clothing that explode. I shudder to think what will be in store for airline passengers dealing with TSA screenings if such a thing comes to pass. How will history remember Obama? What will his legacy be? It appears a lot of that will depend on how many people the U.S. kills before he leaves office. That's not why many of us voted for him, but I guess the rest of the world didn't get the memo. We voted not to bomb people. To end the wars. To stop spying. I wonder if he's as disappointed in the way things have turned out as the rest of us.","LZ: Syria bombing a reminder that Obama is not the president his supporters expected .

"A retired Venezuelan military general was released from custody in Aruba Sunday, days after authorities arrested him there. Hugo Carvajal appeared beside Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at a political event in Caracas after he was flown back to his home country. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Dutch officials had admitted that Carvajal's detention violated his diplomatic immunity. Carvajal, who is wanted in the United States for alleged drug-trafficking ties, was Venezuela's head of military intelligence from 2004 to 2008 and was tapped as the country's consul to Aruba this year. He was arrested Wednesday night on his arrival in the Caribbean island. Peter Blanken, chief prosecutor in Aruba, told CNN en Español last week that a judge decided the arrest was ""legal and correct."" The arrest was based on a formal request from the United States. Blanken said Aruba was ""obliged to cooperate"" because of a treaty with the United States. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had said Carvajal was ""illegally kidnapped."" And Chris Lejuez, Carvajal's lawyer, argued that his client has diplomatic immunity, state media in Venezuela reported last week. ""No country can help another violate international treaties,"" he said, according to the state-run AVN news agency. Carvajal had a diplomatic passport and a regular passport. Venezuela's Foreign Ministry condemned what it called an unjust and unprecedented arrest and said officials were working through diplomatic channels to resolve the matter. Since 2008, Washington has accused Carvajal of ties with drug trafficking and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group. Carvajal has denied the accusations.","Hugo Carvajal returns to Venezuela after his detention in Aruba .

"The Supreme Court has ruled criminal suspects can be subjected to a police DNA test after arrest -- before trial and conviction -- a privacy-versus-public-safety dispute that could have wide-reaching implications in the rapidly evolving technology surrounding criminal procedure. At issue in the ruling Monday was whether taking genetic samples from someone held without a warrant in criminal custody for ""a serious offense"" is an unconstitutional ""search."" A 5-4 majority of the court concluded it is legitimate, and upheld a state law. ""When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee's DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,"" the majority wrote. Read the court's ruling . Law enforcement lauds genetic testing's potential as the ""gold standard"" of reliable evidence gathering, especially to solve ""cold cases"" involving violent offenders. But privacy rights groups counter the state's ""trust us"" promise not to abuse the technology does not ease their concerns that someone's biological makeup could soon be applied for a variety of non-criminal purposes. Twenty-six states and the federal government allow genetic swabs to be taken after a felony arrest and without a warrant. Each has different procedures, but in all cases, only a profile is created. About 13 individual markers out of some 3 billion are isolated from a suspect's DNA. That selective information does not reveal the full genetic makeup of a person and, officials stress, nothing is shared with any other public or private party, including any medical diagnostics. The Obama administration has signaled its support. Read a summary of major upcoming decisions . The case involves a Maryland man convicted of a 2003 rape in Wicomico County in the state's Eastern Shore region. Alonzo King Jr. had been arrested four years ago on an unrelated assault charge, and a biological sample was automatically obtained at that time. That sample was linked to the earlier sexual assault. King moved to suppress that evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds, but was ultimately convicted of the 2003 first-degree rape offense and was given a life sentence. The Fourth Amendment grants the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" Both King and his legal team turned down CNN's request for an interview. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals later agreed with King, saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon, outweighing the state's law enforcement interests. That court also said obtaining King's DNA immediately after arrest was not necessary in identifying him, and that the process was more personally invasive than standard fingerprinting. But the high court decided in favor of the state. Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito. The issue of citizen privacy has been particularly acute since the 9/11 attacks. Federal and state governments have stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists and their allies and of high-risk targets, like government buildings and shopping malls. The current conservative-majority court has generally been supportive of law enforcement in recent search and privacy disputes, but not always. The court last year ruled police could not place a GPS tracking device on a drug suspect's car for several weeks without first obtaining a search warrant. In a sharply worded dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority's reasoning established a ""terrifying principle."" ""The court's opinion barely mentions the crucial fact about this case: the search here was entirely suspicionless. The police had no reason to believe King's DNA would link him to any crime."" Scalia added the state law ""manages to burden uniquely the sole group for whom the Fourth Amendment's protections ought to be most jealously guarded: people who are innocent of the state's accusations,"" describing of the legal concept of innocent until proven guilty. He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Scalia's prior support of Fourth Amendment protections is well-documented, so his siding with three more liberal members of the court was not surprising. A 1994 federal law created a national database in which local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies can compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons, but courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed. In a brief filed by 49 states supporting Maryland, officials also said the information is secure, and retested when an initial ""hit"" is identified. After a warrant is issued for probable cause, another fresh DNA sample is taken and it is that test that is used to ultimately prosecute in court. Each initial test costs about $30. The Fourth Amendment requires the government to balance legitimate law enforcement interests with the privacy rights of individuals. A key area of concern in the high court was whether developing ""Rapid DNA"" technology would allow initial identification testing to be completed within about two hours. Currently it can take two weeks or more, depending on backlogs. Civil liberties groups worry inadequate testing by overwhelmed lab technicians can lead to errors, such as the one that sent Dwayne Jackson to prison for armed robbery. It was three years before a lab mistake was noticed, and the Nevada man was freed as an innocent man. DNA -- Deoxyribonucleic acid -- is a coded molecule providing a genetic map for the development of all known living organisms. By 2000, all 50 states and the federal government required DNA collection from convicted offenders, and that was soon expanded by many jurisdiction to criminal arrests. The number of offender profiles in federal Combined DNA Index System is now about 10 million, with more than a million arrestee profiles. Congress in December passed the Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act, a grant program to help states pay for the expanded system. The 22-year-old woman was murdered in 2003, but her killer was not identified until three years later, after his conviction for another crime, when his DNA matched cold-case evidence found under the victim's fingernails. Her mother, Jayann Sepich, personally lobbied lawmakers for months to ensure passage. President Obama signed the bill earlier this year. ""It's the right thing to do,"" he said in 2010, of expanding DNA swabs for arrestees. ""This is where the national registry becomes so important."" The case is Maryland v. King (12-207).

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Jet-setting spiritual gurus. Gilded temples. Sprawling ashrams. Tons of offerings. India's religious wealth belies the nation's dire poverty. An inventory under way of a hoard of jewels, gold, diamonds, gems, antique idols stashed for hundreds of years in a centuries-old Hindu shrine in southern India is generating comparisons with the economic costs of the country's mega programs and foreign investment plans running into billions of dollars. Under orders of India's Supreme Court, officials since last week have been auditing precious royal offerings kept in underground vaults of the famed Sree Padmnabha Swamy temple in the coastal state of Kerala. V.K. Hari Kumar, the shrine's executive officer, explained court-appointed observers were making records of the treasure. The stock-taking came after a legal petition over allegations of temple mismanagement. ""The find is quite surprising,"" Kumar told CNN. Experts have yet to evaluate the wealth uncovered in the ongoing exploration that has sparked a debate in India whether the haul can be put to public use in a country where a quarter of its billion-plus population still lives on less than a dollar a day. ""So how about dismantling what are essentially parallel economies by opening these vaults up and use the money to set up private schemes that can bring material comforts to the poor? Sure, many of these religious institutions have social schemes already running. But clearly, much more needs to be done,"" wrote the Hindustan Times Tuesday in an editorial headlined ""Tax the Temples."" Indian media suggest the worth of the new-found religious trove is more than the nation's expenditure on education. ""It can help meet the central (federal) government interest and debt payment liability for our four months and is equivalent to seven month's defense spending,"" wrote the Times of India in an article. Kumar, who is part of the team examining the temple's secret cellars, would neither confirm nor deny reported estimates. ""There is no official announcement on the evaluation as per the Supreme Court guidelines. The value is put out by the media only. But I will not say it is not correct,"" he joked. Hindu-majority India is home to almost all of the world's major religions. Many holy sites in the country are run by independent administrations. Spiritual leaders also command massive following. And religion, political analysts say, plays a major role in national and state elections. ""No doubt there is a strong school of thought that advocates state control of super-rich temples. But the ground reality is that the state machinery finds it impractical to step in as any such move could backfire because of deep sentiments involved,"" says political commentator K.G. Suresh. Economists agree. ""There a sort of equilibrium between religion and politics in India as it is a secular country. So, wealth, such as the one discovered from the Padmanabha Swami temple, remained a dead asset all these years. It will remain a dead asset in the future too,"" said Mohanan Pillai, a professor of economics at India's Centre for Development Studies. Meantime, authorities have declined taking control of the sacred findings. ""Sree Padmanabha Swami temple is the pride of Kerala. The wealth of the temple will rest with the temple itself,"" said Kerala Chief Minister Oomen Chandy in comments posted on his website.","An audit finds vast wealth at centuries-old Hindu shrine .

"Republicans already are steaming about President Barack Obama's expected executive action to potentially allow millions of undocumented workers to remain in the country. But another debate on immigration will refocus on internal GOP splits and raise questions about whether the party is taking any of its own advice about being more open to Hispanics. Pointing to inaction by Congress, Obama signaled last Wednesday that he's done waiting for Republicans to negotiate a compromise on any immigration measures. ""I promise you, the American people don't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done,"" he said. How far can the President go on executive actions? House Speaker John Boehner warned Obama that any move to expand earlier executive action would be ""a grievous mistake."" In an opinion piece in Politico last Friday, Boehner insisted any action to fix immigration ""must be done by Congress, and it must be done in a common-sense, step-by-step fashion so that the American people have a say in what we are doing."" Boehner was one of the first top Republicans after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to say that the party needed to deal with immigration. But a bipartisan Senate bill approved last year and backed by some prominent Republicans hit a wall in the GOP-led House. Because most House Republican districts are solidly red, most of the party's rank and file feared primary challenges from the right. The incentive was to stop immigration reform, not move it forward. Recent actions contradict efforts to be inclusive . With Congress divided, Obama to go his own way on immigration . Many Republican Party leaders and possible presidential candidates, however, say the GOP needs a more inclusive message to Hispanics if it hopes to win the White House in 2016. But the message they're hearing on immigration from many in the party could make it harder to build relationships with the Latino community. House bill . Right before leaving town for the August recess, the House passed a bill that would prevent the President from renewing deportation deferments — or granting new ones -- for the roughly 600,000 young people brought into the country illegally by undocumented immigrant parents. If the bill were to become law, it would mean those people could be deported. The vote was largely along party lines and Republicans pressing for broader reform said that ending the Obama administration's program easing such deportations sent the wrong message. ""Why are Republicans continuing to shoot themselves in the foot?"" Carlos Gutierrez, a Republican himself and a former commerce secretary for George W. Bush, asked in a CNN interview. A chief proponent of the House bill, Iowa Rep. Steve King, was confronted in his home state last week at an event with Sen. Rand Paul, a likely 2016 presidential candidate. With media present covering Paul, a woman claiming that she would be deported if the measure became law confronted King about the legislation. Paul was seen leaving before the matter turned into a heated debate. Paul has made broadening the Republican Party's appeal a cornerstone of his message. He helped open GOP offices in minority neighborhoods in his home state and appeared before numerous African-American groups, highlighting his support for reforming criminal sentencing guidelines. Former 2012 vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has also traveled to more than a dozen communities around the country to discuss poverty issues and promote his economic growth policies. But Democrats have pounced on King's Iowa dust-up as well as others trying to paint the GOP as more extreme on immigration. Rick Perry says youths crossing the border is a 'side issue' Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said in a recent interview that he believed some were waging a ""war on whites."" Brooks was responding to a reporter pointing out the GOP's own fears about its dwindling appeal among Hispanics. But he argued that Democrats are ""claiming that whites hate everybody else,"" which he insisted was ""not true."" Republicans nervous . Rep. Jeff Denham of California was one of 11 House Republicans to oppose the House bill and told CNN the decision by GOP leaders to allow a vote on it was ""disappointing."" Echoing the same sentiment expressed by Obama, Denham said the measure was ""a messaging bill"" and ""would never see the light of day"" over in the Senate. ""We've got kids who are going to high schools that know of no other country to call home and we've got to address all aspects of immigration reform,"" Denham said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has no plans to take it up in the Democratic-led Senate and Obama has said he would veto it anyway. Boehner didn't want to turn the discussion over addressing the crisis of Central American migrant youth streaming across the southern border into a broader debate over immigration. He agreed that Congress needed to work with the White House and Democrats to pass narrow legislation to deal with the issues that caused the surge of immigrants and provide resources to handle the tens of thousands who already arrived. Number of unaccompanied minors crossing into U.S. tops 60,000 . A political wedge . But Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party hero, insisted that halting Obama's ability to defer future deportations had to be part of the GOP's response to the border situation. As part of a deal to pass a $694 million border funding bill, Boehner and his top lieutenants agreed to allow a separate vote on a measure promoted by House conservatives that went even further than Cruz's proposal. The bill would end all deportation deferments because they worried Obama would use his executive authority to expand them. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart also voted against that bill and told CNN that the GOP proposal helps Democrats continue to use immigration as a political wedge. ""It gives them another bullet point in their narrative,"" Diaz-Balart said. Both Denham and Diaz-Balart criticized Obama's actions on immigration. They said it was appropriate for Congress to respond to when it believes he is overstepping his legal authority. ""If the message is perceived as strictly to protect the civil liberties and basic rights of our democracy, that is one thing. But if the message is perceived to be anti-immigrant, that is very, very negative,"" Diaz-Balart said. Party not taking its own advice . The recent actions show Republicans aren't taking their own advice on growing their party. Last spring, the Republican National Committee issued a report that examined its 2012 loss and called for the GOP to address immigration reform. The so-called ""autopsy report"" warned that ""if Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence."" Henry Barbour, a top party strategist and a report co-author, told CNN that ""tone is important."" He conceded that taking on immigration reform ""takes political courage.""  But he also warned against ""talking in a way that's not too hot and comes across as negative or exclusive."" Barbour added, ""We're a big, broad party -- we're not all going to agree on immigration -- not going to agree on everything, but we certainly have to have people in Washington on the Republican and Democratic side that want to get things done."" House Republicans also heard about it on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, which doesn't usually criticize Republicans. ""A party whose preoccupation is deporting children is going to alienate many conservatives, never mind minority voters. The episode is also sure to raise doubts among swing voters about whether Republicans would be prepared to govern if they do win control of the entire Congress,"" the Journal said. Advice on what to do . Even if Republicans can't enact immigration reform in a divided Congress, others advise  it has to look like it is at least trying to do something. ""Republican support among Hispanic voters does not hinge on immigration reform but inaction. Our inaction and poor optics can eviscerate any future we have right now,"" Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist and author of ""Los Republicanos -- Why Hispanics & Republicans Need Each Other,"" said. Gutierrez said that he saw a scenario for Republicans to be on the offense if the party is able to retake control of the Senate in November. He suggested the House and Senate could come together on a proposal that would both secure the border but also provide some path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented workers. Presenting a bill to Obama would put the onus on him to respond and make him the subject of blame if he rejected it. ""I think this is one of those 'Nixon goes to China' things -- it will be a Republican who reforms immigration. I don't believe that Democrats have the credibility,"" Gutierrez said. Expanding the wedge? Many Republicans interviewed by CNN said the challenge next year will be even greater because Democrats will want to use any divisions on the issue to further expand the wedge between the GOP and Latino voters going into the 2016 election. But they warned that the party can't use that as an excuse to not promote a message of positive reform. ""This is what people are elected to do,"" Barbour said. ""Just do your job -- I'm talking to Republicans and Democrats alike. This is a two-way street."" Campaign officials from both parties say immigration is not a top-tier issue for the midterms. There are only a handful of House Republicans in competitive races in districts with significant Latino populations. The GOP is well positioned to win control of the Senate in November, and immigration is expected to be a factor in just one key contest in Colorado, where there is a sizable number of Hispanic voters. But the 2016 vote is again expected to come down to a handful of key swing states where both parties will work hard to win over independents. And many Republicans agree that the party's record on immigration will be important in states like Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, which are home to expanding populations of Latino voters. Calling immigration reform the ""800-pound gorilla in the room,"" Diaz-Balart said if Latinos perceive that Republicans don't want to deal with immigration, then ""that is a major, major, major stumbling block to get over.""","GOP struggling internally on message they're sending to Hispanics .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie is visiting Iraq to boost what she sees as lagging efforts to deal with the problems of 2 million ""very very vulnerable"" internally displaced people in the wartorn country. Angelina Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq. ""There doesn't seem to be a real coherent plan to help them,"" said Jolie, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN's Arwa Damon Thursday. ""There's lots of goodwill. Lots of discussion, but there seems to be a lot of talk at the moment, and a lot of pieces that need to be put together. I'm trying to figure out what they are."" A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn Iraq.  Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Jolie » . Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the Middle East since the 1948 creation of Israel. More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes, around 2 million to neighboring states, mostly Syria and Jordan, and another 2.2 million displaced inside Iraq. The flight was aggravated by the February 2006 bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra, an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare. Many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor, crowded into camps and slums that often lack basic necessities, such as proper food, health care and shelter. ""How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East,"" said Jolie. ""It's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can lead to a lot of instability and aggression.""    Read transcript of interview . Jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the U.N.H.C.R. In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem. She heard stories from refugees about their plight.  Watch as Jolie lunches with troops » . This visit to Iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced, 58 percent of whom are under age 12. A top issue for the agency is getting better security. Jolie is talking with U.S. officials, including top U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, about that issue, and are willing to provide such security which she said ""needs to be addressed and solved."" The Iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced -- but that has not happened yet, she said. Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are ""occupied"" by others or ""bombed out."" She emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have ""broad implications"" in the region. Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States, which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by September. Only 375 have been admitted so far. ""I have to believe there are people working toward that goal,"" she said. International agencies, such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and many countries in the region and in Europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons' crisis, and money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people. Most of the refugees are in Syria and Jordan, and they reside in big cities like Damascus and Amman. The U.N.C.H.R. is trying to help governments in Syria and Jordan to cope with the influx, which has stretched the resources of institutions like schools and health systems. It is also attempting to help 41,000 non-Iraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians. Last month, the UNHCR announced a plan to seek $261 million this year for its work to help these refugees. It has almost 350 staffers ""directly engaged in operations for Iraq and the surrounding region."" Officials in Iraq and the coalition have been heartened by the fact that some refugees are starting to trickle back home. But they are returning to a country where mixed Shiite and Sunni neighborhoods have turned into Sunni or Shiite enclaves and that they might not be able to return to their homes.

"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new ""foundering"" website. A lawsuit filed Thursday by the celebrity couple blasts Chad Hurley, accusing him of secretly recording West's surprise proposal to Kardashian in the middle of San Francisco's AT&T Park on October 21. The video shows West kneeling near second base to ask Kardashian to marry him while a large orchestra plays in center field. The leak diminishes the value of the video of the event that Kardashian and West own, the suit said. Hurley ""finagled entry"" into the birthday party that West threw for his girlfriend, although only ""several dozen people"" were invited, the lawsuit said.  Although he tagged along with someone who was invited, he was permitted to stay ""only after giving his word -- including in writing -- that he would not publish any aspect of the event.""  The court filing includes a photo of Hurley purportedly holding the signed confidentiality agreement in his hand. ""Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event,"" Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said. The lawsuit slammed Hurley, 36, as a failed entrepreneur who leaked the video ""out of desperation."" ""Despite his extraordinary financial success in creating YouTube, which was sold in 2006, Hurley has ever since sought his 'second act,'"" the lawsuit said.  ""This has become exceedingly elusive to Hurley."" It cites his failed Formula One racing team and his ""Web service named Zeen, which also failed and has been slated for closure in 2013."" His newest venture -- MixBit -- ""also quickly ran into trouble"" after launching in August, the lawsuit contends.  ""Following a lackluster launch and unsuccessful ensuing debut, Hurley sought to salvage MixBit from its dour beginning,"" the suit said. ""An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian,"" it said. The video is titled ""PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!! Congrats Kim and Kanye!"" It is still posted on the website, and the counter indicates it has been viewed 1.6 million times. Hurley knows better, the lawsuit said.  The terms of service on his own website warn users against posting any video that would violate copyrights, it said. ""Undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed, Hurley opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event, in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture,"" the suit said. Hurley and his company did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the lawsuit.","Lawsuit accuses YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley of secretly recorded the proposal .

"(CNN) -- Israel's attack Monday on a boat traveling in international waters and carrying humanitarian supplies for Gaza killed at least nine people and sparked a series of recriminations around the world. Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, condemned the attack and called for an independent investigation ""to know who gave the orders from the Israeli side to open fire against civilians and to bring those people to face justice."" But Israeli officials described the boat's passengers as the aggressors and said the soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces were simply defending themselves. ""They are not peace activists. They were not messengers of goodwill,"" Daniel Carmon, Israel's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in New York. ""They cynically used the guise of humanitarian aid to send a message of hate and to implement violence."" Independent information was scant. The death toll and the account of what happened came from the Israelis, who did not release the names of any of the casualties. ""Free Gaza,"" one of the group's sponsors, said there were more casualties from the incident, though it didn't have an exact number. The surviving passengers were being held incommunicado by the Israelis, who detained them after escorting the six boats that had participated in the flotilla to the Israeli port city of Ashdod. Q&A on Israel's Gaza blockade . Three sailors who took part in the flotilla said Israeli troops stormed the Mavi Marmara, the largest ship, well into international waters. ""The commandos were coming down from the helicopter. No one on the ships had any weapons,"" one of the sailors told CNN Turk after being flown back to Istanbul. The Free Gaza organization, one of the organizers of the protest, posted on its Twitter page that the incident unfolded about 4:30 a.m., when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara by helicopter. The troops ""immediately opened fire on unarmed civilians,"" the group said. Video from the Israeli military showed soldiers rappelling onto the deck of the ship from a helicopter. The boarding of the ships took place in international waters more than 70 nautical miles (130 km) outside Israeli territorial waters, according to IHH, a humanitarian relief foundation and a sponsor of the flotilla. IHH is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, a hard-line Islamic political movement. Get the latest developments . But the Israel Defense Forces said its troops ""were met with premeditated violence, evident by the activists' use of clubs, metal rods, and knives, as well as the firing of two weapons stolen from the soldiers."" It said troops responded with ""defensive action on behalf of the forces who felt their lives were endangered,"" and seven were wounded. The IDF released a video shot from above the ship that it said showed soldiers being attacked, though the distance from which it was shot precluded immediate confirmation. A senior Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in an account cleared by military censors, displayed a box containing switchblade knives, slingshots and metal balls and bats he said had been confiscated from one of the boats. ""This was not spontaneous,"" he said. ""This was planned."" Israeli military gives version of flotilla incident . A senior Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in an account cleared by military censors, displayed a box containing switchblade knives, slingshots and metal balls and bats he said had been confiscated from one of the boats. ""This was not spontaneous,"" he said. ""This was planned."" Jonathan Peled, minister-counselor for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the soldiers were carrying paintball pistols when they boarded the flotilla, but switched to bullets when a naval commander was stabbed and others were attacked with knives and metal bars. Most of the dead were Turks, the Israeli senior military official said. Twenty other people were wounded. As many as nine Americans may have been aboard the boats, including Edward Peck, a former U.S. ambassador to Mauritania, according to Jonathan Slevin, a spokesman for the activist group Free Palestine Movement. One American who was being treated for minor injuries after the attack, a senior State Department official said late Monday. Israeli forces boarded the other ships in the flotilla without incident. The Turkish sailors said they were continuously shadowed by commandos aboard their own vessel, ""even when we needed to go to bathroom,"" one said. The flotilla had left European ports in a protest organized by two pro-Palestinian groups to deliver 10,000 tons of food, medicine, construction materials, wheelchairs and other aid to Gaza to break a blockade imposed by Israel in 2007. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who canceled his trip to Washington to return to Israel to manage the crisis, said Gaza has become a base for Hamas terrorists who have fired ""thousands of rockets"" into Israel. ""What we want to prevent coming into Gaza are rockets, missiles, explosives and war material that could be used to attack our civilians,"" he told reporters in Ottawa, Canada, with his Canadian counterpart. The attack sparked protests in several countries; caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Turkey, its closest Muslim ally; and brought condemnation worldwide. A number of nations recalled their ambassadors from Israel, while others called for a full investigation. The Palestinian Authority said in a statement its cabinet ""strongly condemned the Israeli crime against international supporters on board of the Freedom Flotilla."" Read more about world reaction . Turkey, Israel's closest Muslim ally in the region, recalled its ambassador, while Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said the operation ""will leave a bloody stain on the history of humanity."" Israel said Sunday that Western and Turkish authorities have accused IHH of having ""working relations"" with terrorist organizations. Of the hundreds of activists who were detained aboard the ships after they were escorted to the Israeli port of Ashdod, 15 were sent to Beer Sheva Prison, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prison authority. Another 25 were slated for deportation and 50 others who refused to identify themselves were being held separately. None was allowed to speak to the news media. A team from the Turkish Red Crescent will fly Tuesday to Tel Aviv to help coordinate the return of the dead and wounded, the organization said in a statement. Israel issued a ""serious travel warning"" for Israelis visiting Turkey. Those planning to travel to Turkey were asked to postpone their trips, while those already in Turkey were advised to stay indoors. A Turkish travel agent said more than 15,000 Israelis had canceled plans to visit Turkey. In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called for global support of the Palestinian cause. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of mourning in the Palestinian territories to honor the lives lost. ""We have consistently advised against attempting to access Gaza in this way, because of the risks involved,"" said British Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""But at the same time, there is a clear need for Israel to act with restraint and in line with international obligations."" In Washington, White House spokesman Bill Burton said, ""The United States deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained and is currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy."" Israel instituted a blockade on Gaza in January 2006, when Hamas won democratic elections in the Palestinian territories. It tightened that blockade in June 2007, when Hamas took over Gaza, but allows about 15,000 tons of humanitarian aid into the territories each week, Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. Since then, Israel has controlled entry of all manner of goods into Gaza, including instant coffee, chocolate and construction materials. Israel has said the latter could be used by Hamas to build bunkers. Since the summer of 2008, five flotillas have gotten through the blockade to deliver humanitarian goods to Gaza. Monday's flotilla was the largest such mission.

"Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In ""The Politician,"" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. ""The Politician"" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that ""the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms."" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. ""After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' "" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. ""Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?"" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. ""I am Quinn's father,"" Edwards said in a statement. ""I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace."" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. ""While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,"" his attorneys wrote. ""From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention."" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. ""Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,"" her publisher Random House said in a statement. ""It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. ""She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. ""Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say."" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. ""After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Young writes. ""A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. ""My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family."" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a ""naked pregnant woman"" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in ""a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks"" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured ""it was safe to assume it was Rielle."" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was ""irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'"" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a ""Made in the USA"" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he ""loved Cracker Barrel"" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry ""just wasn't all that smart."" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.","Andrew Young writes he arranged rendezvous for John Edwards, Rielle Hunter .

"Chris McDaniel on Monday officially contested results showing he lost a Republican primary to Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, revealing what his camp alleges is evidence of voter fraud and other irregularities. ""They asked us to put up or shut up. Here we are. Here we are with the evidence,"" McDaniel said at a news conference in Jackson. McDaniel, a state senator, has refused to concede the June 24 runoff result and filed a formal challenge with the Mississippi Republican Party's executive committee. The case could eventually wind up in court. The challenge outlined claims of more than 15,000 cases of illegal or questionable votes, of which 3,500 were crossover votes. The official state count puts Cochran ahead by more than 7,600 votes. McDaniel is asking to make the case publicly before the state GOP executive committee and he anticipates a ""hearing in a public forum."" Cochran's campaign said it had retained a lawyer to fight the allegations, which it dismissed out of hand. The election speaks to a struggle within the GOP between establishment figures, like Cochran, whose been in the Senate for more than 35 years, and McDaniel, who represents a new breed of arch conservatives backed by the tea party. Allegations included in more than 250 pages of affidavits claiming that 3,500 voters cast ballots for a Democrat in the first leg of the primary before crossing over in the Republican runoff election. If true, those votes cannot be counted in the runoff. McDaniel's lawyer, Mitch Tyner, called another 11,000 more votes questionable or ""improperly cast."" Many affidavits were signed by McDaniel-aligned volunteers and election observers. The documents detail claims that election materials were destroyed or improperly handled and that vote-buying occurred. Tyner said the committee will ""have no choice but to recognize Chris McDaniel as nominee of the Republican Party"" after it reviews the evidence. ""We're not asking for a new election, we're simply asking that the Republican Party actually recognize the person who won the runoff election,"" Tyner said. McDaniel, a career trial lawyer, addressed the crowd as he would a jury and laid out his case,  noting that ""we saw the dirty tricks. We saw the dirty money that was coming from Washington."" McDaniel announced plans to challenge election results in early July . He challenged the anger and frustration of his supporters and called out the ""despicable acts of race-baiting"" from people in his party and alleged that some of the ""mistakes"" during the runoff were ""very intentional."" But McDaniel affirmed that the challenge is not centered on those emotions. ""We have to be dispassionate about the facts,"" he said. ""The facts are on our side. The law is on our side."" The McDaniel campaign and its allies have spent the nearly six weeks since the runoff parsing county poll books, soliciting donations to fund an eventual legal challenge and offering $1,500 rewards to anyone who could provide evidence of voter fraud. Winning strategy likely to stay in Mississippi . Bobby Morgan, communications director for the Mississippi Republican Party, called the challenge to the results of a federal election unprecedented. Morgan said party officials are consulting with the organization's general counsel to determine how to handle the challenge. Cochran campaign lawyer Mark Garriga slammed the McDaniel campaign's claims as ""baseless"" and said he looks forward to holding it to the burden of proof that the law requires."" ""The filing of this challenge marks the point where this matter moves from an arena of press conferences and rhetoric into a setting where nothing matters but admissible evidence and the rule of law,"" Garriga said in the statement. As Cochran made a last-ditch appeal to African-American voters ahead of the runoff, conservative groups hired former Justice Department official Christian Adams to train and oversee election observers to monitor polls and note questionable voter activity. After 10 days of state party review, the campaign will likely shift its challenge to the courts, if necessary. Regardless of the state party's actions, McDaniel campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch said the candidate would ""in all likelihood, absolutely"" file a suit in court. The runoff winner will face Democrat Travis Childers in November. Mississippi is a reliably Republican state.

"(CNN) -- A school board district member in Arkansas who came under fire for an anti-gay post on a social networking site regrets the comments and will resign his seat, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""I'm sorry I've hurt people with my comments,"" Clint McCance, vice-president of the Midland School District in Pleasant Plains, Arkansas said. ""I'm sorry I made those ignorant comments and hurt people on a broad spectrum."" McCance wrote on his personal Facebook page that he wanted gay people to commit suicide, according to The Advocate, a newspaper focusing on gay news. McCance used the terms ""queer"" and ""fag"" repeatedly, promised to disown his own children if they are gay and stated that he enjoys ""the fact that [gay people] give each other AIDS and die."" On Thursday, he disowned the comments. ""I would never support suicide for any kids,"" he said. ""I don't support bullying of any kids."" ""I'd like to extend apologies to those families that have lost children, for all those children who feel that suicide is the only way out, especially for the five families who have already lost children,"" he said, referring to a rash of recent suicides by gay teens. ""I brought more hurt on them... they didn't deserve that and I do feel genuinely bad for them."" Though he disapproves of homosexuality, McCance said that ""I give everyone a chance and try to love everyone."" McCance said that he has received an outpouring of criticism over his comments, including ""thousands of phone calls, hate mails, people threatening to kill my family and me."" He said he has sent his wife and two kids out of the state because of fears for their safety and that he is installing a security system at his home. ""I'm reaping what I've sown,"" he told CNN. ""I've had a lot of hate speech thrown at me and my family on every level."" He said he would resign from the school board to spare the district the bad press and distractions of dealing with the fallout from his comments. ""If they decide after five or ten years to vote me back in, then I'll run again,"" he said. McCance's comments had drawn criticism from education officials in his district and at the state level. ""I strongly condemn the statements that appeared on Mr. Clint McCance's Facebook page,"" Tom Kimbrell, Arkansas commissioner of education, said in a statement Wednesday. ""... The statements attributed to Mr. McCance constitute a significant departure from statements we expect from our school leaders. The divisiveness and disruption of these comments cause me to seriously question the ability of Mr. McCance to remain as an effective member of the Midland School Board."" McCance was re-elected for a four-year term in September. He was initially elected to the leadership of the school district in 2007 for a three-year term. The terms are now four years long. The Midland School District had also denounced the posting. ""The district strives to foster an environment that discourages all forms of bullying,"" it said in a statement this week, ""and an environment that encourages a safe and productive educational climate [for] all of our students. The district is very diligent in pursuing and addressing bullying of any variety on our campuses."" The state Department of Education had said it was ""dismayed to see that a school board official would post something of this insensitive nature on a public forum like Facebook."" Because McCance's Facebook page is not accessible publicly, the Advocate said it learned about the posts after being provided with a screen shot. The posts were made, according to The Advocate, in response to a bullying awareness campaign sponsored by GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. The ""Spirit Day"" campaign aimed to foster recognition of bullying directed at gays and the effects it can have on young people through a series of events held on October 20. One aspect of the campaign encouraged people to wear purple to honor those who had committed suicide after experiencing anti-gay bullying, and to show solidarity with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered youth who face the same pressures. According to the screen grab obtained by The Advocate, McCance wrote the following about the event: ""Seriously they want me to wear purple because five queers committed suicide. The only way im wearin it for them is if they all commit suicide. I cant believe the people of this world have gotten this stupid. We are honoring the fact that they sinned and killed therselves because of their sin."" (sic) The post spurred a Facebook page encouraging the Midland School District to fire McCance. More than 60,000 people had ""liked"" the page as of Thursday evening. However, not everyone disagreed with McCance's comments, which he had defended on his page by citing his religious beliefs. Gays and lesbians are ""thinking they're all right, and [God is] going to let them think that and go to hell for believing what they're doing is right,"" pastor Harry Craig, of Pleasant Plains Full Gospel Church, told CNN Little Rock affiliate KARK. On Tuesday, the federal government warned that bullying and harassment in schools often includes violations of federally protected civil rights. Officials warned that school administrators who fail to properly deal with harassment risk being cited for civil rights violations. In extreme cases, such violations could lead to cuts in federal funding. A group of protesters had traveled Thursday to Pleasant Plains, where they held a demonstration to call for McCance's resignation. Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"New York (CNN) -- Imagine a vulnerable island, parts of it man-made, with towering buildings and lots of people crammed into small spaces. Now imagine a monster storm slamming into that island. Manhattan vs. Irene. It could happen Sunday, and hurricane experts are warning New Yorkers that even though Irene may not be a killer in the vein of Katrina, millions of people could be trapped in their homes for days. Without power, transportation, phones -- and experience. A hurricane warning was issued late Friday afternoon for the New York City area, as well as points eastward to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, stoking fears that Irene could be the most destructive hurricane to hit the metropolis since 1938. ""The basic issue is, first, New York City has world-class emergency planners. I mean, they're the best in the game. But the city is out of practice when it comes to hurricanes,"" said homeland security expert Stephen Flynn, author of ""The Edge of Disaster."" But it's not just New York that faces Hurricane Irene's wrath as it churns northward. A heavily populated urban corridor from the nation's capital to the New York metropolitan area stands a chance of a wet and windy lashing. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned that significant power outages are likely on the East Coast. ""This isn't a mammoth storm ... in terms of lots of death and destruction, but what it is going to do is be very disruptive, and people have to be in position to camp out in their house,"" Flynn said. ""Time is always your ally before a disaster. It's always your enemy after a disaster,"" he said. ""Using the time now to get prepared is key. When you have that many people packed in a little space, as dependent as they are on the transportation, everybody has to get informed and get better prepared."" But a survey released Friday indicated that the regions that are least likely to be prepared are urban areas in the Northeast, and many of them may be in the path of Hurricane Irene. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll, 45% of Americans say they have a stockpile of food and water in their homes in case of a terrorist attack or a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake. Those figures are highest in the South and the West -- where hurricanes and earthquakes are most frequent -- but only 36% of Northeasterners say they have emergency supplies of food and water. People who live in rural areas are also more prepared than people who live in big cities: Only 42% in urban areas have a stockpile of food and water, compared with 51% of rural residents. In recent days, though, public officials have made frequent media appearances and taken other steps to indicate that they are ready for the storm. That includes shutting down all public transportation in New York -- including subways, buses and commuter rails -- after noon Saturday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also ordered the National Guard to deploy up to 900 troops. And most bridges in and around the city will be closed to traffic if winds exceed 60 mph, as would be the case with hurricane winds in excess of 74 mph. ""The sun is shining, but don't be misled,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday afternoon. ""There is a very dangerous storm headed in our direction."" Mandatory evacuations have been issued for some low-lying areas in all five of the city's boroughs, including Coney Island in Brooklyn, Far Rockaway in Queens and Battery Park City on the southern tip of Manhattan. Some of those are patients in five hospitals, eight nursing homes and other medical facilities that had to be moved out by 8 p.m. Friday, per the mayor's orders. In addition, Bloomberg said that 91 emergency facilities -- which, among other purposes, will act as shelters -- opened across the city. It's not just Manhattan that will be tested. Flynn noted that Long Island, home of the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn and many other communities farther east, has 7.5 million people crammed together. If it were a state unto itself, it would be the nation's seventh largest -- and one that, likewise, is facing a hurricane warning. ""It's an island. The only way to get off and on to it is through the two boroughs and Queens and the Bronx, and what we know is, we're going to have a lot of outages,"" Flynn said. At 3 p.m. Friday, Suffolk County ordered mandatory evacuations of barrier beach communities, particularly those on the western end of Fire Island, county spokesman Mark Smith said. Further evacuations in low-lying, beachside communities -- including parts of the Hamptons and Montauk -- could be mandated Saturday morning, he added. ""We expect long, long delays as these roads start to get jammed,"" East Hampton town supervisor Bill Wilkinson said. ""We are sitting at 125 miles in the Atlantic, and there are -- from Southampton to the end of Long Island -- only two lanes. If you have to get somewhere and you want to get home, you better get on the road soon."" On Fire Island, nervous residents put away outdoor furniture, and the parking lot at Costco was filled as shoppers stuffed SUVs with bottled water and groceries. Transit systems in Philadelphia and New Jersey will also shut down Saturday, though the operators of Boston's subway system vowed on Friday to add extra resources and stay operational through the storm. And travelers planning to fly out of any of the busy airports in the Washington and New York areas are in for a headache. Thousands of weekend flights already have been canceled. Baltimore/Washington International is ""monitoring terminal and airfield drainage, checking generators and securing any equipment that may become airborne as a result of high winds,"" said Paul J. Wiedefeld, the airport's executive director. Carriers are monitoring the weather conditions carefully and taking action. Joe Rigby, president and CEO of the power company Pepco, said that close to a thousand line personnel were getting ready to handle outages just in the Washington area. ""We've been absolutely anticipating that this is going to hit us hard. It's going to hit us to varying degrees, probably less so here where we are but more as you move east of our service territory going over to Atlantic City,"" he said. ""But we're anticipating that with the kind of rain and sustained wind, we're very likely going to have some serious damage and actually multi-day outages."" The main event in Washington this weekend was supposed to be the much-awaited dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial. But as the district's homeland security department tweeted Friday: ""The District's focus has shifted to #Irene. That's what's happening in the city this weekend.""","NEW: A hurricane warning is in effect for New York and nearby locales .

"(CNN) -- Maybe the cash-strapped U.S. government should start selling iPads. According to the latest statement from the U.S. Treasury, the government had an operating cash balance Wednesday of $73.8 billion. That's still a lot of money, but it's less than what Steve Jobs has lying around. Tech juggernaut Apple had a whopping $76.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of June, according to its last earnings report. Unlike the U.S. government, which is scrambling to avoid defaulting on its debt, Apple takes in more money than it spends.

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev accused the government of imposing unduly harsh restrictions on their client in a motion filed Wednesday. Tsarnaev is ""in near total isolation,"" is banned from praying with other inmates and is allowed out of his cell only to meet with lawyers or spend short periods in an outdoor enclosure, court documents said. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz asked the attorney general for these special administrative measures after Tsarnaev had been in prison for four months. Ortiz said the restrictions are necessary as part of what prosecutors call Tsarnaev's ""continued desire to incite others to engage in violent jihad,"" according to the August memorandum included in the court filing. Tamerlan's in-laws answer questions from grand jury . As evidence, prosecutors cite the 1,000 ""unsolicited"" letters the 19-year-old Chechnya-born American has received during his five-month incarceration. His lawyers say he has not responded to any of them. Tsarnaev has been at the Fort Devens prison facility an hour outside Boston after a brief hospitalization for wounds incurred during his capture on April 19. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, spent days on a highly publicized run after the marathon bombing on April 15. His lawyers, Miriam Conrad and Judy Clarke, argue in court papers that the measures create ""obstacles"" that have a ""dramatic chilling effect on the defense team's ability to prepare a thorough and vigorous defense."" Three friends of Boston bombing suspect plead not guilty . In their motion, Conrad and Clarke argue the measures ""violate the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court therefore should declare that the SAMs are unlawful and order that they be vacated."" The restrictions are designed to limit the people with whom Tsarnaev is allowed to speak and what those people can then say to others. It also limits the kind of materials to which he has access. As an example, his lawyers said they were prevented from showing Tsarnaev family photos after prosecutors argued they were not specifically related to his defense. Prosecutors later relented. Tsarnaev's lawyers accuse the government of trying to limit attorney-client interaction: ""There is no basis whatsoever to suspect that appointed attorneys and those assisting them would intentionally pass dangerous communications to others."" Documents detail suspect's injuries . His lawyers also said Tsarnaev has done nothing during his incarceration to warrant such restrictions or to suggest he is dangerous, nor is there evidence the attack was ""directed by others still at large or that Mr. Tsarnaev ever had operational authority to direct the activities of others"" to whom he may want to communicate. Special administrative measures are typically used in terrorism cases and other high-profile cases when authorities contend ""there is a substantial risk that a prisoner's communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons,"" according to court documents. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack, during which three people were killed and more than 250 were injured after a pair of home-made bombs exploded moments apart near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer was killed three days later, triggering the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. His brother was shot and killed by police during the manhunt. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to all charges. 5 months after bombings: Sense of winning for survivor .","Lawyers say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is ""in near total isolation""

"Justin Bieber was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police saw the pop star street racing early Thursday morning,  Miami Beach police said. ""What the f*** did I do? Why did you stop me?"" Bieber asked the police officer who pulled him over just after 4 a.m., according to the arrest report. Bieber, 19,  was released from a Miami jail an hour after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a Miami judge, who set a ""standard"" $2,500 bond Thursday afternoon. He strutted out of the jail dressed in black, with a baggy hoodie covering his head. His pants appeared to be baggy leather. Bieber briefly sat on top of a black Cadillac Escalade, where he waved to screaming fans, before he was chauffeured away. At the bail hearing, the singer, dressed in an orange jail uniform, stood silently with his lips sometimes pursed as attorney Roy Black represented him in the hearing earlier. Black told Judge Joseph Farina that he had been retained by Bieber's manager. He said his partner had been denied access to Bieber in jail before the hearing. Bieber was booked into a Miami jail after failing a sobriety test, Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez told reporters Thursday. Bieber ""made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication,"" Martinez said. A Miami Beach officer saw Bieber driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area of Miami Beach, Martinez said. The cars were speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, he said. Police report details Bieber arrest . The officer pulled Bieber's car over, but the singer was ""was not cooperating with the officer's instructions,"" Martinez said. ""At first, he was a little belligerent, using some choice words questioning why he was being stopped and why the officer was even questioning him,"" he said. He allegedly ignored a police officer's request to keep his hands on the car while he did ""a cursory patdown for weapons,"" the report said. ""I ain't got no f***ing weapons,"" the arresting officer quoted Bieber as saying. ""Why do you have to search me? What the f*** is this about?"" The arrest report describes Bieber as having a ""flushed face, bloodshot eyes, and the odor of alcohol on his breath."" Bieber failed a field sobriety test, Miami Beach Police Sgt. Bobby Hernandez told CNN. Two black SUVs blocked the traffic at 26th and Pine Tree Drive, which ""facilitated an open road"" for the two cars to race on Pine Tree, the report said. The Ferrari's driver, identified as 19-year-old Def Jam recording artist Khalil Sharieff, was also arrested on a drunken driving charge, police said. Sharieff posted a photo on his Instagram account of Bieber in the yellow Lamborghini with a woman behind the wheel early Thursday. ""U know bizzle brought that lambo out,"" he wrote in the caption. Another posting showed a photo of a Ferrari steering wheel with the caption: ""Miami nights ridin thru yo city in that hot wheel."" A tweet posted Wednesday evening on Sharieff's verfied Twitter account linked to a video of him playing basketball with Bieber. Bieber flew to Miami on Monday. Other complaints . Another police department in the Miami area is investigating a report that some of its officers escorted Bieber's caravan between Miami strip clubs this week without authorization. Opa-Locka Assistant City Manager David Chiverton told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV that ""at some point, the escort took them at least to two locations that we know of."" ""The police administration had no knowledge of this escort, and it is not the norm for those things to occur without the chief and his administration authorizing such escorts,"" Chiverton told the TV station. Thursday's incident marks the first time the teen singer has been arrested, although he is under investigation on allegations of egging his California neighbor's home. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies used a felony search warrant last week to raid Bieber's mansion in the felony vandalism investigation. They seized Bieber's iPhone and the security camera system, which detectives have been examining for clues about who tossed eggs over a fence that splattered onto the next-door house, causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Bieber is having some issues . Deputies have also investigated reports by Bieber's neighbors that he raced his expensive sports car down the streets of the exclusive Oaks community of Calabasas, California, but no charges ever resulted. One neighbor accused Bieber of spitting in his face during a heated confrontation last March. Deputies have responded to complaints about loud parties at Bieber's place. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office concluded it couldn't prove the spitting or speeding cases in court, so it declined to prosecute. Prosecutors also rejected a misdemeanor battery complaint from a photographer who accused Bieber of attacking him in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, in May 2012. ""We didn't do this search warrant to send a message,"" Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said last week. ""That's not what we do, but we hope maybe that understanding the gravity of this will change some of the behavior."" Bieber's phone seized in egging probe .

"An e. You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right? Now imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed. OK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school. It all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school. Interested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink. Reducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts. ""Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,"" Suvir says with a chuckle. He's right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75. So Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid. Collecting random samples of teachers' handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r). First, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill® Ink Coverage Software. Next he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font. From this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually. Encouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics. Sarah Fankhauser, one of JEI's founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir's project was a real standout: . ""We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir's paper."" Fankhauser said Suvir's findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, ""How much potential savings is really out there?"" For the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government. With an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project. Suvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results -- change the font, save money. Will government printers embrace a change? Using the General Services Administration's estimated annual cost of ink -- $467 million -- Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% -- or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported. Gary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir's work as ""remarkable."" But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO's efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web. ""In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record. Twenty years later, we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day,"" he said. On top of this, the Congressional Register is printed on recycled paper, which GPO has been doing for five or six years, Somerset says. One federal initiative that focuses on minimizing ink-usage is called ""Printwise."" Implemented 18 months ago by the General Services Administration, it teaches government offices how to default their computer settings to Times New Roman, Garamond and Century Gothic to minimize printing waste. According to GSA's press secretary Dan Cruz, they hope this type of initiative could ultimately save the federal government up to $30 million annually. Suvir appreciates the government's efforts, but he sees his project as a means of making an even bigger impact nationwide. ""Consumers are still printing at home, they can make this change too,"" he says. Holding out hope . At 14, Suvir understands how difficult such a project might be to implement -- ""I recognize it's difficult to change someone's behavior. That's the most difficult part."" But he holds out hope: ""I definitely would love to see some actual changes and I'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible."" With decades ahead to lend a hand, Suvir and other young men and women like him may even be able to untangle some of the knotty political and technical issues that beset Washington, corporate suites and the world at large.

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles court Thursday in the alleged druggings and rapes of two women. Judge Renee Korn raised Sharper's bail to $1 million from $200,000 in response to a prosecution request to raise it to as high as $10 million. The judge also ordered Sharper not to frequent clubs, bars or any venue where alcohol is the primary item for sale. Korn also ordered Sharper ""not be alone with any women he does not have a previous relationship with (from) prior to October 30, 2013,"" the date of the first alleged rape in Los Angeles County. Sharper has already surrendered his passport, the judge noted. ""Mr. Sharper must stay in Los Angeles County,"" the judge said. Sharper, who had been free on bail, stood quietly in a gray pinstripe suit with a black shirt and no tie. One of his defense attorneys, Blair Berk, said that Sharper was pleading not guilty. Berk has said that she is ""hopeful that before the case is concluded that Mr. Sharper will be exonerated."" Leonard Levine, another of Sharper's attorneys, indicated his client would post his residence and his father's residence for the $1 million bail. The five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is charged with two counts of rape by use of drugs, four counts of furnishing a controlled substance and one count of possession of a controlled substance, all felonies, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors. The alleged rapes occurred in October and last month, authorities said. Sharper also is under investigation in Arizona, Louisiana and Nevada in connection with a total of five alleged rape cases in those states, according to Los Angeles authorities. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Stacy Okun-Wiese said in court that Sharper is also being investigated in sexual battery case in a fifth state, in Miami Beach, Florida. But in court, a Sharper lawyer disputed all the rape allegations. ""It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company,"" Levine said. In unsuccessfully seeking a $10 million bail, the prosecutor argued that ""Sharper is a danger to women."" ""He hangs out with them in clubs. Takes them back. It's the same story,"" Okun-Wiese told the court. ""He gives them a shot. They black out. ""The next day they have no idea of what happened the previous night,"" she said. In the Los Angeles cases, Sharper is accused of using morphine and zolpidem -- another name for the prescription sleep aid Ambien -- on his two alleged victims, who said they blacked after Sharper served them a shot of alcohol, according to authorities. Okun-Wiese said authorities took count of Sharper's Ambien pills. ""I counted it up and Mr. Sharper has gone through 70 pills in 65 days,"" the prosecutor said. When Los Angeles County authorities filed the rape charges last month, they weren't aware of the Nevada and Arizona investigations, Okun-Wiese said. ""The circumstances have changed tremendously since the January 17 arrest"" of Sharper in California, Okun-Wiese said. Defense attorney Levine, however, said ""there is no probable cause"" against Sharper in those other states' cases. In the latest accusation, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. The alleged victim filed the complaint shortly after an acquaintance told her last month that Sharper was arrested in California on rape charges, the Miami Beach police report says. The alleged Florida victim filed the report because ""she felt she needed to clear her conscious,"" the report said. According to the police report, in September or October 2012, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club when she met Sharper, and when she, her friends, and another person went to Sharper's condo, the woman was ""extremely intoxicated."" The woman's two friends later told her she went with Sharper into his bedroom, and the friends heard her telling Sharper, ""No, no, stop. I don't want to,"" the report said. The two friends knocked on the bedroom door, entered the room and tried to take the woman home, but because ""she was so intoxicated, she can't remember what she said to (the two friends) because her speech was slurred and she wanted to sleep,"" the report said. Everyone subsequently left Sharper's Miami Beach condo, except for Sharper and the woman, according to the report. The woman awoke the following morning, the report said, with Sharper allegedly sexually assaulting her without a condom. The woman was treated by a doctor a week after the incident, the report said. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said Thursday.","Sharper is now under investigation in a sex case in a fifth state, Florida .

"(CNN) -- The number of people killed from an earthquake in Costa Rica rose to 34 on Saturday, a government official said. Rigoberto Vargas weeps with his daughters for his missing son on Saturday in San Miguel di Sarapiqui. Another 64 people were listed as missing two days after the 6.1-magnitude earthquake shook north-central Costa Rica, the official said. Emergency personnel continued to search for victims affected by the quake, according to Ministry of Infrastructure spokeswoman Silvia Chaves. Rescuers reached 200 tourists who had been stranded in a hotel in Varablanca, and they were taken to safety, she said. Survivors described Thursday's quake, which was centered about 20 miles north-northwest of the capital city of San Jose, as sudden and brutal. Landslides, tumbling rocks and collapsed buildings caused widespread devastation. ""I saw how the Earth moved and how it took my family -- my aunt, my cousin and her babies,"" Miguel Angel Marin told CNN affiliate Teletica TV. ""It was very hard because I wanted to save them but I couldn't."" On Friday, the U.S. government dispatched a team of 34 U.S. military personnel and four helicopters from Honduras-based Joint Task Force-Bravo to Costa Rica to assist. More than 1,200 people were stranded, without a way to get out of towns or homes, Red Cross official Milton Chaverri said. Another 1,000 people were living in shelters, he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . The remote area near Alajuela, where the quake hit strongest, is difficult to reach, and officials said they were having to rely on helicopters for medical evacuations and to airlift supplies. Randall Picado, a government rescue official, said many residents were without water and other necessities. About 400 volunteers and Red Cross personnel were giving aid in 15 communities, Chaverri said. The temblor was felt throughout Costa Rica and in southern and central Nicaragua, the U.S. Geological Survey reported on its Web site. About 2,000 aftershocks have been felt in San Jose, the capital, and other cities throughout the nation, Red Cross spokeswoman Vilca said. The Geological Survey placed the earthquake's epicenter at 20 miles (32 kilometers) north-northwest of San Jose at a depth of 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers).

"At 107 years old, World War II veteran Richard Overton credits God for his longevity. ""If man had it, I'd have been dead, but God's got it, and he's keeping me well,"" said Overton, believed to be the oldest known American veteran of the war. And in his more than century of life, he's seen both the good and bad. ""He was there at Pearl Harbor when the battle ships were still smoldering.  He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said. 'I only got out of there by the grace of God,' "" President Obama said Monday during a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Ceremony honoring Overton. Overton volunteered for service in 1942, becoming a member of the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion, an all-black unit that served on various islands in the Pacific. He doesn't enjoy thinking or talking about it, telling CNN he ""forgot all that stuff."" ""When the war ended, Richard headed home to Texas, to a nation bitterly divided by race. And his service on the battlefield was not always matched by the respect that he deserved at home. But this veteran held his head high,"" Obama told the crowd of roughly 4,000 people. Overton visited Washington for the first time earlier this year. His first stop was the World War II Memorial. Then he saw the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. ""As Richard sat in a wheelchair beneath that great marble statue, he wept.  The crowd that gathered around him wept, too,"" Obama said Monday as he described the veteran's visit. ""To see one of the oldest living veterans of World War II bear witness to a day, to the progress of a nation that he thought might never come."" Monday's audience gave Overton two standing ovations for his service. At the end of the day, he spoke to CNN while taking in the World War II Memorial at night. Overton said he was happy to meet the President. ""I didn't think there (was) gonna ever be a black president,"" he said, ""but it finally did happen."" And, while giving credit to God for living well over 100, Overton says he doesn't take any medicine and enjoys his vices. ""I drink whisky in my coffee. Sometimes I drink it straight,"" he said.

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- There are over 15,000 Starbucks in the world but none like the one at 328 15th Avenue East in Seattle. Officially the coffee shop is called ""15th Ave Coffee and Tea"" but the store and a similar sister location have earned another name: ""the Stealth Starbucks."" At first glance the coffee shops in the mega-chain's hometown of Seattle do not even look like Starbucks. The ubiquitous smiling Mermaid logo has apparently swum away, there are no baristas in trademark green smocks either and not a tall, grande or venti sized beverage in sight. The only hint that the store is owned by the coffee giant and not a local java seller is the ""Inspired by Starbucks"" lettering across the front door . Inside, pages from Plato's dialogues decorate an entire wall, sweeteners sit on a bathtub converted into a table, beer and wine are for sale and employees dole out customized drip coffees along with advice on which are the best beans. At every turn, the message seems to be here ""it's about the coffee."" After first checking that her Starbucks rewards card would actually work at the location, customer Donna Godfrey said she liked the store precisely because it didn't seem like -- well -- such a Starbucks. ""I really liked the ambience, its not as loud as most of your Starbucks. It just feels more European,"" Godfrey said. ""You get to the point where you walk down the street and on every corner or on every other corner there's a Starbucks. So I think this is a way to have a presence without it being that thumb in your face presence."" If customers enjoy the ""stealth"" Starbucks experience without linking it immediately to the coffee giant that's fine with the creators of the concept, said Arthur Rubinfeld, Starbucks' president of global development. ""These are learning environments for us to be innovative and push the envelope, Starbucks customers worldwide have come to expect a certain amount of offerings and timing in our stores we wanted to change things up here but didn't want to disappoint any of our customers,"" Rubinfeld. Like many retailers, 2009 was not a great year for Starbucks. The company closed hundreds of their stores amidst the economic downturn and battled the perception that their business was based on what critics complained was overpriced coffee . According to Arthur Rubinfeld the ""stealth"" stores are not a departure from the brand but an effort to get back to the basics of the successful product that launched the company from a small single location coffee shop to a worldwide phenomenon. ""It's rooted at the very core of Starbucks, we are an innovative company,"" Rubinfeld said. ""We most continue to be that, and stay relevant as we continue to move forward and grow."" Rubinfeld said Starbucks is closely watching the ideas that come out of the new stores and may eventually adopt some of those innovations company-wide. Seattle-based blogger Melody Overton writes about all things Starbucks on her Web site Starbucks Melody and says the new stores are an attempt by the chain to go back to ""the early '90s where you went into the stores and Starbucks was about the coffee. You smelled the smell of coffee in the stores, there wasn't the sound of blenders going every two seconds."" But small coffee shop owner Sebastian Simsch says it's getting the small details right that's tricky, especially for a company like Starbucks that thinks on a global scale. At the one location of his store Seattle Coffee Works, Simsch roasts his own coffee, chats with customers and picks out furniture that he admits resembles a mismatched living room set. As simple as the coffeehouse is, Simsch says his place is genuine. ""It's an artificially created experience,"" Simsch says of Starbucks version of the personal coffee experience. ""A Disneyland with a nice façade. I love that they want to learn but on the other hand its like how do you learn to be a Buddhist monk? Its a way of life -- you can't.""","Not every Starbucks features a mermaid or baristas in green smocks .

"There is a saying that Mongolians are born on horses. ""That's how important these animals are to our culture,"" says Baocheng, as he smooths his leathery palms over a 200-year-old saddle. His collection of more than 400 Mongolian horse saddles has been a labor of love since he stopped riding. After more than 40 years of training and riding horses, the ethnic Mongolian says they're as much a part of him as the air he breathes. ""As a kid, everyone rode horses to herd sheep, but now we only see motorcycles"" the 68-year old says, as he lights a cigarette. He reveals a toothy smile that carves even deeper wrinkles into his weathered skin. ""We learned to ride when we could walk."" Baocheng, who like most Mongolians goes by one name, has witnessed many changes around the street where he runs an antiques shop. This was once a trading area for livestock in downtown Hohhot, capital of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous region. Unfortunately the most significant -- and damaging -- change is taking place on lands beyond the city that most Mongolians traditionally lived on. Overgrazing and drought have combined to threaten Inner Mongolia's grasslands. Desertification in the Mamugeng grasslands, some 120 miles from Hohhot, has forced the government to place restrictions on some herders. But ethnic Mongolians complain their nomadic lifestyle is being threatened. Though some have been handed government subsidies, others have reported being forced to move from grasslands into brick apartments in cities like Hohhot. The nomadic way of life dates back to the days of Genghis Khan, leader of one of the largest empires in history that stretched from the Great Wall of China to Europe. Grazing cattle, sheep and horses on the Mongolian steppe while living in circular white tents known as gers was the traditional way of life for many. Erden is one of a decreasing number of herders still living off his family's land, which has been passed down three generations. He says he's content doing what his father and their ancestors have passed down and has no plans to move. ""We Mongolians used to have a big population here, but now our numbers are getting smaller and smaller,"" the 41-year old says. He has 400 sheep and goats, and sells them for about 1,000 yuan (US$160) each, making a decent living for his family. But not all ethnic Mongolians in the region are as content. The threat to traditional Mongolian culture, which includes allegations of illegal land seizures, has led to an uptick in protests in recent years. According to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center, repeated appeals have been made to the government to protect the nomadic culture from activities such as mining in this resource-rich country. The group said at least 22 ethnic Mongolians were detained earlier this month after hundreds clashed with police during a protest against land seizures. The government says it has introduced initiatives to protect Mongolian culture, such as promoting folk music, encouraging Mongolian language in schools and building heritage centers. But critics argue that without a nomadic lifestyle, it is impossible for young Mongolians to learn about their ancestors' way of life. ""Mongolians have peacefully led a nomadic lifestyle for centuries so we need to ask why it's being threatened now?"" says Nars, the lead singer of Anda Union, a Mongolian throat-singing band. ""It's important to prevent desertification, but at what cost? Why is this happening now and what other solutions are there?"" Rapid development and the spread of China's dominant Han population to minority regions, has meant that ethnic Mongolians only make up about 17% of the region's 24 million population, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. Like Tibetans and Uighurs from the restive of Xinjiang region, experts say an underlying tension exists between ethnic Mongolians and Han people. Anda Union hopes to bridge that gap by educating the masses with their music. The Hohhot-based band consists of 10 band members who play around the world with indigenous Mongolian instruments such as the horse head fiddle, three-holed flute and mouth harp. In March, the group played at the international music festival WOMADelaide in Australia and WOMAD in New Zealand, with plans to tour Europe this summer. During a performance in their home town, the group demonstrated their music -- known for its rich blend of movement between hoomai, a deep guttural throat song, and the clear long notes of urtinduu, which uses the throat to create a whistle effect. But ownership over throat singing has struck a sensitive chord with ethnic Mongolians in recent years after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared it an art native to China. The UNESCO website states that Mongolian regions in Inner Mongolia, western Mongolia and Russia all practice the art, but the country of origin is stated as China. ""Personally, I think throat singing is part of our Mongolian culture, and it should belong to Mongolians,"" says Nars, who oversees a workshop that teaches students to make traditional Mongolian instruments.

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian human rights activist who posted videos about police abuse says YouTube has shut down his account because of complaints that the videos contain ""inappropriate material."" Egyptian human rights activist and blogger Wael Abbas says YouTube has suspended his account. Wael Abbas, an award-winning anti-torture watchdog, told CNN on Wednesday that there have been 100 videos posted on his account containing images of torture, police brutality, demonstrations, strikes, sit-ins and election irregularities. Now, material he had posted is no longer available on the popular video-sharing Web site, he said. Abbas said YouTube sent him an e-mail saying they had suspended his account. ""They didn't ask me to remove it. They said 'Your account isn't working,' "" he said.  Watch Abbas' complaints about YouTube » . When asked about Abbas, a YouTube spokesperson said, ""We take these matters very seriously, but we don't comment on individual videos."" YouTube regulations state that ""graphic or gratuitous violence"" is not allowed and violations of the Terms of Use could result in the ending of an account and deleting all of the videos in it. ""YouTube prohibits inappropriate content on the site, and our community effectively polices the site for inappropriate material,"" the spokesperson said. ""Users can flag content that they feel is inappropriate and once it is flagged it is reviewed by our staff and removed from the system within minutes if it violates our Community Guidelines or Terms of Use. We also disable the accounts of repeat offenders."" Abbas agreed that some of the videos were ""graphic,"" but said strong images underscore the issue of abuse and make an ""impact on public opinion."" He said the graphic images he posted had an impact like the photos and videos of Abu Ghraib prison that emerged in 2004 showing mistreatment of detainees by U.S. troops and stoking international outrage. ""We managed to direct the attention of the people to something that was taboo, something that was never discussed before, which is police brutality and torture inside police stations,"" said Abbas, referring to his videos. The 33-year-old Abbas also operates one of Egypt's best known blogs, misrdigital.com, which owes its popularity in part to its frequent postings about police abuse. In one prominent incident, Abbas posted a video on his blog of a police officer binding and sodomizing an Egyptian bus driver who intervened in a dispute between police and another driver. The video was one of the factors that led to the conviction of two police officers, who were sentenced to three years each in connection with the incident. ""It's the first time Egyptian people saw something like that,"" Abbas said, referring to beatings and torture. ""It was a shock to the Egyptian people."" The blogger, who said he's in a ""state of shock"" because he lost videos he's uploaded for years, said he might resort to campaigning against YouTube. ""We thought that YouTube was our ally,"" Abbas said. ""It helped show the truth in countries like Burma. ... With what they did now, it doesn't seem like that anymore,"" he said. Abbas said he has also had a problem with Yahoo! because it shut down two of his e-mail accounts, accusing him of being a spammer.

"The Italian Senate voted Wednesday to expel former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from parliament after his conviction for tax fraud. The vote was 192 to 113, with two abstentions. Analysts had predicted his ouster, with both the center-left Democratic Party and anti-establishment Five-Star Movement promising to vote against the 77-year-old billionaire media tycoon. The vote follows Berlusconi's conviction on charges related to a vast tax fraud conspiracy at his Mediaset television empire. Berlusconi was convicted of tax evasion last October, sentenced to four years in prison and barred from public office for two years. The prison time was later reduced to one year of community service. The former PM had called on his supporters to protest in Rome ahead of the vote. He even asked senators to delay the ballot, claiming to have new evidence proving he did not commit tax fraud. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, has dominated the lively Italian political scene for the past two decades. Despite his expulsion from parliament, he is unlikely to disappear. ""He is not out of politics, he is out of government,"" James Walston, chairman of the International Relations Department at the American University of Rome, told CNN.  ""He will cease being Sen. Berlusconi."" The former Prime Minister could face other headaches. The expulsion from parliament means losing a partial immunity senators hold from prosecution, and he could face charges in other cases.  For years, he has also been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached the Italian courts. At a news conference Tuesday, Berlusconi's lawyers dismissed as ""an absolutely unreal possibility"" that he could face further criminal charges for other cases. Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in October last year over deals involving Mediaset, and the verdict was upheld in August.

"An Australian airline's policy prohibiting male passengers from sitting next to kids traveling alone has fueled a social media firestorm and caused the company to review the rule. ""I am an emergency service worker when I'm off that plane, but as soon as I boarded it I was a presumed pedophile,"" firefighter Johnny McGirr told CNN Australian affiliate Network Ten. While on a Virgin Australia flight earlier this year, he was seated next to two young boys traveling alone until he says a flight attendant asked him to trade seats with a woman. TSA to investigate racial profiling claims . ""It was interesting, like I had done something wrong. Really embarrassed,"" said McGirr. He was on a flight from Brisbane to his home in Sydney. Virgin Australia said its long-standing policy, initially based on customer feedback, allowed for unaccompanied children to sit next to women or an empty seat. ""In light of recent feedback, we're now reviewing this policy,"" it said on its blog. ""Our intention is certainly not to discriminate in any way."" In the United States, no major airline prohibits men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors. ""Airlines are acting as custodians of unaccompanied minors, and therefore have the ability to move them to a different seat if they believe that is in their best interest,"" a U.S. Department of Transportation spokesman told CNN.  ""However, DOT has statutes prohibiting airlines from having discriminatory seating policies, including on the basis of gender or age. ... Therefore, airlines cannot have policies forcing a man to move if seated next to an unaccompanied minor, but they can, if they choose, have policies requiring an unaccompanied minor to be moved if he/she is originally seated next to an adult male."" Airlines CNN contacted said they take other steps to ensure the safety of children traveling alone. On United Airlines ""there is no specific seating policy,"" airline spokesman Joe Micucci told CNN. ""That said, United has an overlapping security approach designed to ensure the safety and security of unaccompanied minors."" On Southwest Airlines, which does not have assigned seats, unaccompanied minors are seated near the front of the cabin, according to Whitney Eichinger, Southwest Airlines spokeswoman. ""We do not restrict who sits next to an unaccompanied minor, but our flight attendants do check on them frequently in flight."" ""We defer to the expertise of our trained gate agents and crew members who are tasked with ensuring the safety and security of all of passengers."" US Airways spokesman Andrew Christie Jr. told CNN.  ""We also intentionally do not announce the boarding of unaccompanied minors so as not to draw unwanted attention to children traveling alone."" The time I lost my kid in public . British Airways updated its unaccompanied minor seating policy in 2010 after a lawsuit accusing the airline of discriminating against men. ""We have a specific seating department that follows guidelines to ensure that we place an unaccompanied minor in an appropriate seat, spokeswoman Caroline Titmuss said. ""On some services, this will be in a specially created unaccompanied minors zone within a short distance of the cabin crew in the galley."" Virgin Australia's policy to prevent men from sitting next to the unaccompanied minors has supporters, including John Shehan of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States. ""We're trying to prevent child victimization,"" he said. ""We know the overwhelming majority of sex offenders are male, so by removing that situation you're lowering the risk."" Australian airline Qantas also has come under fire for a similar policy prohibiting men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors. The airline declined to comment.

"New documents show appointees of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tried to stem other officials' anger and stonewall media queries about a hastily crafted plan to close access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, closures that wreaked traffic havoc on the New Jersey side of the nation's busiest bridge. In a terse e-mail, the executive director of the New York and New Jersey Port Authority expressed anger for not being told about the lane closures in New Jersey that led into the George Washington Bridge. He used his authority to override the decision four days after traffic logjams crippled commutes. He also expressed concern the lane closures may have resulted in critically slow emergency response time and may have violated the law. ""Reversing over 25 years of PA (Port Authority) GWB (George Washington Bridge) operations, the three lanes in Fort Lee eastbound to the GWB were reduced to one lane on Monday of this week without notifying Fort Lee, the commuting public we serve,"" wrote Patrick Foye, the executive director, on September 13 to other Port Authority officials. ""I am appalled by the lack of process, failure to inform our customers and Fort Lee and most of all by the dangers created to the public interest."" In his e-mail, which was sent to a number of high ranking officials on the Port Authority, Foye said, ""I pray that no life has been lost or trip of a hospital- or hospice-bound patient delayed."" He also wrote that he believes the ""hasty and ill-advised decision violates federal law and the laws of both states."" ""I will get to the bottom of this abusive decision which violated everything this agency stands for,"" he wrote. Read the documents . The revelations are part of more than 2,000 pages of documents released late Friday by a New Jersey State Assembly committee as part of its investigation of top Christie advisers, who are accused of closing down access lanes to the country's busiest bridge  as an act of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. The documents also show that Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak had dinner with David Wildstein, then-director of interstate capital projects for the Port Authority, two days before the transportation official resigned in December over questions around the now-notorious multiday traffic jam in Fort Lee. Wildstein thanked Drewniak for his ""sound advice"" and the two men later e-mailed back and forth about how to announce his departure from the Port Authority. In one e-mail, Drewniak said the governor approved the final statement. Foye was enraged by the decision to close the lanes and his e-mail resulted in many e-mails back and forth between Port Authority officials. Bill Baroni, a Christie-appointed Port Authority official who resigned in December over the controversy, replied to Foye, saying he was ""on way to office to discuss"" and that there ""can be no public discourse"" on the controversy. In response, Foye tersely wrote, ""Bill that's precisely the problem: there has been no public discourse on this."" After the Foye e-mail was leaked to the Wall Street Journal in September, David Samson, the Christie-appointed chairman of the authority, wrote to another official on September 17, ""I am told the ED (executive director) leaked to the WSJ his story about Fort Lee issues—very unfortunate for NY/NJ relations."" Samson, in an e-mail on September 18, wrote, ""This is yet another example of a story, we've seen it before, where he distances himself from an issue in the press and rides in on a white horse to save the day."" According to the documents released Friday, drivers began complaining about the traffic near the  bridge immediately after the lanes were reduced. An e-mail to George Washington Bridge General Manager Robert Durando from an associate described the types of complaints that came in. It describes one angry resident who wrote that her husband, who had been out of work for more than a year, was 40 minutes late to his new job. The Port Authority is ""playing God with people's jobs,"" she wrote. New Jersey officials realized early on that the lane closures had morphed from a traffic nightmare into a major safety concern. ""Specifically traffic conditions required Ft Lee officers to remain out on corners, managing traffic instead of attending to public safety issues,"" Durando wrote in an e-mail on September 9, as traffic continued to back up. Durando also expressed concerns about the ""inability of emergency response vehicles ... to traverse the borough while responding to emergencies."" ""Fort Lee is not happy,"" Durando said in another e-mail. In the e-mails it also appears Sokolich was initially blamed for the traffic debacle. Sokolich said that Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police were telling residents of his Fort Lee community that he was responsible for the closures. ""Many members of the public have indicated to me that the Port Authority Police officers are advising commuters in response to their complaints that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the mayor, recently made,"" Sokolich wrote in a September 12 letter to Baroni. Christie, who has denied involvement in the bridge scandal, apologized to Sokolich in a meeting on Thursday after a news conference in which the governor said he knew nothing about suggestions that top appointees orchestrated the gridlock to punish the mayor politically for not supporting Christie for re-election. Plenty in his own party happy to see Christie get comeuppance . The documents also suggest that Wildstein was aware that there might be political fallout from having helped orchestrate the traffic logjam. Before he resigned, Wildstein forwarded e-mails about the bridge lane closures in September from his official account to his personal Gmail. On one occasion, Wildstein forwarded the e-mails after a member of his staff told him a Wall Street Journal reporter was asking questions about the lane closures. He did the same when Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell sent a letter inquiring about traffic getting onto the bridge. The documents also include e-mail messages between top officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that reveal that another senior Christie aide, Regina Egea, director of the authorities unit and a member of his senior staff, was aware of concerns the lane closures were not part of an ongoing traffic study. Foye, the transportation agency's executive director, wrote a scathing e-mail that expressed concerns the lane closures did not follow protocol and created ""dangers to the public interest."" Baroni, the Christie-appointed Port Authority deputy director, forwarded the e-mail to Egea three hours after it was sent on September 9. Officials in New Jersey and New York were also angry and shocked that the lanes were shut during a Jewish holiday, according to the documents. Scott Rechler, vice chairman of the board of commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, e-mailed other representatives on the transportation authority that he was disturbed that traffic was snarled ""without regard to this being the Jewish high holiday weekend."" Rechler was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""This is terribly disturbing and incomprehensive to me,"" he wrote. ""How can a decision like this be made without it being discussed and considered at the highest levels?"" Legal woes lurk for Gov. Chris Christie over bridge scandal . The scandal forced an ""embarrassed and humiliated"" Christie to apologize over the alleged political retribution. The scandal has rocked Christie's administration and raised questions about how it might affect the popular Republican's potential presidential candidacy. Friday's documents follow explosive e-mails released on Wednesday that identified key players and the basic outlines of the alleged scheme. Christie denounced the effort as outrageous and not connected to him. He fired one of his top aides. Others identified as being involved have also left their jobs. In addition to the legislative investigation, the scandal has prompted a review by federal prosecutors and triggered at least one lawsuit against Christie and those at the center of the storm. Sokolich, the Democratic politician allegedly targeted because he didn't endorse Christie's re-election bid, said the tie-ups in September caused residents ""misery and agony"" in his town. He met with Christie on Thursday and told CNN that the governor was gracious and that he accepted his apology. But Sokolich believes the matter is far from finished. An uncharacteristically low-key Christie appeared chastened at a news conference before his meeting with Sokolich, and said he was stunned by the revelations. Christie and his staff originally blamed traffic snafus on a transportation study they said had been mishandled. Christie said he found out about the more troubling reason for the disruption on Wednesday when the e-mails surfaced publicly. Christie's political star hangs in the balance, with multiple investigations immediately clouding any future aspirations of a presidential run in 2016. Bridge firestorm could have bigger impact on Christie . The e-mail exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed, two months before Election Day. ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,""  Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to Wildstein. The transportation agency operates the George Washington Bridge, which connects New York and New Jersey. ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. Wildstein left his job in December and Kelly was fired this week.. The scheme unfolded from there, leading to traffic tie-ups from September 9-13. In one e-mail from early December, Drewniak, the governor's spokesman, and Wildstein made dinner plans. ""Can you do dinner in New Brunswick this evening?"" asked Drewniak on December 4. Twenty minutes later, Wildstein wrote, ""Sure, as long as short notice doesn't inconvenience you."" The next morning, Wildstein wrote Drewniak. ""Thanks again for all your sound advice last night, I always appreciate your friendship."" The e-mail did not detail the advice given to Wildstein. On Thursday, Wildstein obeyed a judge's order to appear before a state legislative committee. But he invoked his constitutional right to not testify. Assemblyman John Wisniewski, the state legislator leading the investigation, has accused Christie of still holding back. ""We intend to continue our investigation, but this would all be made easier if Gov. Christie did the right thing and voluntarily released all communications so everyone could find out with certainty what happened,"" Wisniewski said in a statement. ""If he's truly dedicated to transparency and the truth from here on out, he will take this step and cooperate fully with the committee's work."" The scandal threatens to imperil Christie's presidential ambitions but has not necessarily derailed them, Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com. ""He's a resourceful politician and it's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest,"" Stanley wrote. ""But now, his opponents have a stick to beat him with.""

"A week before Congress is expected to finally hear from CIA contractors on the ground in Libya during the deadly Benghazi attacks, a Republican member said it is long overdue the American public learn the truth of ""the murky events of September 11, 2012,"" that left a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead. ""We know what the senior people have said but we don't know what the people who were on the ground are going to say and we need to get those answers,"" Rep. Devin Nunes (R-California) told CNN by phone Wednesday. In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner sent Wednesday, Nunes said if questions remain unanswered or ""if some answers differ substantially from the established narrative and timeline of the attack, then it would be warranted to take new measures to complete the investigation and synthesize the information obtained by the Intelligence Committees and other committees investigating the Benghazi attack."" Nunes suggested if that occurs, Congress should consider appointing an independent investigator. Libyan lawmakers, top officials discuss Benghazi violence . Separately, another Republican, Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, has called for a special select committee to investigate Benghazi. While most of the House leadership has ignored Wolf's call, 178 fellow Republicans have signed his petition for the special committee. Not one Democrat has signed. Nunes sits on the powerful House Intelligence Committee which, as CNN first reported,  next week is expecting the behind closed-door testimony of three CIA contractors who worked for the intelligence agency when Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the three others were killed. To date, the only CIA operative on the ground during the attack to testify before the committee has been the No. 2 CIA manager in Libya. The lack of direct testimony from those on the ground has frustrated a number of congress members who have told CNN they are tired of the Benghazi affair being filtered through the memos prepared by staff and testimony of others who were not in Libya, or were there but have not had the opportunity to give firsthand accounts to elected members. Nunes outlined the questions he hopes the committee will finally get answers to from witnesses. Those questions range from why a special State Department-led counterterrorism team was not dispatched as the assault was ongoing to whether the terrorists responsible have been identified but administration officials have failed to authorize a capture/kill operation. '""We need to identify who -- at the level of presidential cabinet secretaries or at the National Security Council (NCS) -- signed off on the decision NOT to dispatch a FEST team to Benghazi and determine the basis of that decision,'' Nunes wrote. FEST stands for Foreign Emergency Support Teams, interagency response teams sent to provide assistance to ambassadors.  While Nunes writes that it is unlikely the ambassador could have been saved, ""the team could have advised, assisted, and coordinated security at the compound and the annex after the attack."" He also wrote it could have aided in the hunt for the perpetrators, noting that the FBI did not reach the area until three weeks after the assault. Letter raises a series of questions . The Nunes letter also asserts there still is information lacking or discrepancies on other fronts, including: . -- Communications during the attack between the Benghazi annex, the State Department compound where the ambassador and his aide and computer security expert Sean Smith were killed and with other U.S. based agencies; Nunes specifically wants to know whether there was chatter on a classified channel to which no committee would have access. -- Which terrorist groups had the sophistication to secure the coordinates for the deadly mortar hits on the CIA annex, one of which killed former Navy SEALs Glenn Doherty and Tyrone Woods. -- The need for a full accounting of purchases made in Benghazi ""by the State Department and other government agencies in the year prior to the attack."" While Nunes would not elaborate, it has been widely debated on whether the U.S. was involved in a gun-buying mission to be sent to Syrian rebels. A senior intelligence official last week told CNN there was no such operation. -- Similarly, Nunes said they need a full accounting of all foreigners who met with officials from the State Department and other agencies in the year prior to the attack. -- Finally, Nunes raises the issue of ""possible witness intimidation,"" saying the committee should investigate whether members of State Department or any government officials in the United States or on the ground in Benghazi were ""asked to sign non-disclosure agreements after the attack or asked to undergo polygraph tests? If so, why were those requests made?"" he wrote. CNN has reported some involved in the Benghazi operation have been regularly polygraphed by their employer, the CIA. The agency and its director, John Brennan, have vehemently denied those on the ground were subjected to retaliatory polygraphs and have said the director has encouraged operatives who wish to speak to Congress to come forward. The CIA says the CNN report is ""patently false."" In its statement to the network, the agency said ""not a single CIA officer who was on the ground in Benghazi during the attacks has been subjected to any CIA polygraph intended to discourage them from speaking to Congress or as a retaliation."" A spokesman added, ""To date, some of these officers have already spoken to the oversight committees on Benghazi."" Benghazi has remained a continuing thorn for the Obama administration as the Republican-led House has had five different committees investigating the conflicting stories of what triggered the terrorist attack and what some critics charge is an absence of a coherent explanation of what Stevens was doing the night he was killed; the military's failure to launch a rescue mission and the CIA's role in Benghazi for months prior to the attack. The administration initially and stubbornly for several days insisted the Benghazi attack and the first murder of an American ambassador in more than 30 years was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film. That was later proven wrong in testimony before the various committees.","California congressman raises questions for Benghazi hearing .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday after four hours of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Russia had reaffirmed its commitment to finding a diplomatic solution in Ukraine but had not agreed to move Russian troops from the Ukraine border. ""We both made suggestions as to how that will be achieved ... and I will return to Washington to consult with President Obama on his choices,"" Kerry said at a news conference in Paris. ""We are trying to find a way to defuse this."" In a later press briefing, Lavrov said, ""We expressed differing views about the cause of this crisis but nevertheless we agreed on the need to search for points of common ground to find a diplomatic settlement."" Kerry said Lavrov indicated Russia ""wants to support"" Ukraine in its move toward independence but said the massing of Russian troops has created ""a climate of fear and intimidation."" ""Is it smart at this moment in time to have that number of troops amassed on a border when you are sending a message that you want to de-escalate and move in the other direction?"" Kerry said. Kerry said Russia and the United States agreed to work with Ukraine on several issues: the rights of national minorities; language rights; the demobilization and disarmament of provocateurs; a constitutional reform process; and free and fair elections monitored by the international community. Lavrov said he hopes ""all political forces in Ukraine will have an equal voice and can agree on which kind of concrete political, economic, financial, social, religious traditions will be respected in different parts of the country."" Kerry stressed that no real progress can be made until the troops are pulled back. He added that Ukrainians must be part of any discussions going forward, saying, ""No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine."" Other nations support this stance, he said. Hours before the meeting, Lavrov called on Western powers to back a proposal for a ""federal"" structure in Ukraine. ""If our Western partners are prepared, Russia, the U.S. and the EU will be able to set up a group of support to Ukraine and to formulate general appeals to those who rule in Ukraine now,"" Lavrov told Russian state television, according to state news agency ITAR-Tass. This would lead to talks between ""all political forces without exception, naturally not armed radicals"" and would result in a new constitution allowing for a ""federal system of government,"" he said. ""If our partners are prepared for this, we are open for broadest cooperation,"" Lavrov added. Kerry said that subject was not discussed with Lavrov because it's a decision Ukraine's leaders must make. With millions of Russian speakers concentrated in Ukraine's eastern regions, Russia backs the idea of greater regional autonomy. This would ""protect the rights of those who live in Ukraine, primarily the Russian-speaking population, which is important to us,"" Lavrov said. Lavrov and Kerry met for four hours in Paris on Sunday, as both sides tried to ease tensions in the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War. The meeting ended about 5 p.m. ET. 'The hordes are coming': Ukrainians fear Russian invasion in northeast . Russian forces on border . The meeting follows a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday. ""What gives me a sense we may be able to solve the situation is that Putin did call our President and suggestions were made, and there will be a meeting (between Kerry and Lavrov),"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""And there may well be the ability to solve this."" On Saturday, Lavrov said Russia had no intention of sending troops into Ukraine -- responding to Western warnings over a military buildup on the border following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Crimeans voted March 16 to break away from Ukraine and join Russia. The United States and other Western governments called the referendum illegal, saying it violated Ukraine's constitution and amounted to an attempt by Russia to expand its borders to the Black Sea peninsula. Russia may have 40,000 troops near its border with eastern Ukraine and another 25,000 at locations inland who are on alert and prepared to go in, two U.S. officials have told CNN. The officials said that this estimate was largely based on satellite imagery and that a firm number is difficult to assess. Russia has said its troops are carrying out snap military exercises in the region. The United States and the European Union have targeted members of Putin's inner circle with two rounds of sanctions that include visa bans and asset freezes. The West has warned more sanctions are possible if Russia sends more forces into Ukraine. Russia responded with its own sanctions on the United States, banning several U.S. officials from entering the country. Opinion: Does Obama really understand Putin? U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered the top U.S. commander in Europe back to the continent because of the ""growing uncertainty in Ukraine,"" Pentagon press secretary Rear. Adm. John Kirby said Sunday. Gen. Phil Breedlove was in Washington, where he was supposed to give annual testimony before Congress later this week. ""More broadly, he felt it was important for General Breedlove to continue our efforts to consult with NATO allies, and to discuss specific ways to provide additional reassurance for our NATO allies in Eastern Europe,"" Kirby said of Hagel's decision to cut short Breedlove's stay in Washington. ""While it does not foreshadow imminent military action in Ukraine, the general's return will allow him more time to confer closely with his staff and our allies and partners, and to better advise senior leaders,"" Kirby said.

""Jim cared deeply about the people of Minnesota, devoting his 36 years of service to improving America's infrastructure, creating opportunity for hardworking Minnesotans, and building a strong economy for future generations of Americans,"" Obama said in a statement released by the White House. President Bill Clinton remembered Minnesota's longest-serving Congressman as a tireless public servant. ""Jim was a devoted friend and supporter of the Haitian people. I relied on him for advice on Haiti first as President and again after the terrible Haitian earthquake in 2010,"" Clinton said in a statement. Oberstar was the state's longest-serving member of Congress. He became chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in 2006. In a close race, he lost to Republican challenger Chip Cravaack in the Republican House takeover in 2010. ""Jim Oberstar knew everything there was to know about our nation's infrastructure, and fought tirelessly to rebuild and renew it,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. ""... His passing is heartbreaking news for his friends and former colleagues from both sides of the aisle. It was an honor and a privilege to work alongside him, and we only hope it is a comfort to his wife Jean, his children and his grandchildren that so many share in their loss at this sad time."" Minnesota officials are mourning Oberstar's loss. DFL Party Chairman Ken Martin said that the state lost a true Minnesota legend. Gov. Mark Dayton called him a ""true champion"" for Minnesota. Sen. Amy Klobuchar tweeted he was a ""man of true purpose and grit."" Oberstar is survived by his wife, four children and eight grandchildren.

"A gunman in an Afghan National Army uniform and another man shot dead two NATO soldiers at a combat outpost in southern Afghanistan Thursday, authorities said. The dead soldiers were Americans, according to Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi, the district chief in Kandahar province, where the shooting happened. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, however, did not immediately specify the service members' nationalities. Thursday's shooting was the third at a base or government building since news emerged that U.S. troops mistakenly burned Qurans and other religious materials early last week -- an incident that has sparked outrage, protests, and violence across Afghanistan. All three shootings were carried out by men in official clothing. Four Americans were killed in the earlier attacks. If the troops killed Thursday are indeed American, that would bring the death toll from the three attacks to six. A top U.S. lawmaker last month cited at least 42 attacks by Afghan security forces on their international allies in the past five years. Rep. Buck McKeon, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said 39 of the attacks were by members of the Afghan National Security Force and three were by contractors. ""Though less than 1% of Afghan forces and security guards have attacked coalition forces, this is 42 attacks too many and the new process must do better,"" he said at a congressional hearing. Most attackers were acting on their own, rather than being puppets of insurgent groups, defense officials testified. France suspended its operations in Afghanistan after four French soldiers were killed by Afghan counterparts in eastern Kapisa province in January. That shooting came after another Afghan soldier killed two French soldiers in December. ""The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the shootings. Coalition forces responding to Thursday's incident killed the two gunmen, said Capt. Justin Brockhoff, an ISAF spokesman. Sarhadi said one gunman was an Afghan National Army soldier and the other, dressed in civilian clothes, was a teacher who formerly ran literacy courses for Afghan army soldiers. Afghan civilians are sometimes used to teach Afghan soldiers English to improve their ability to work alongside ISAF. It appeared that the teacher had been planning the attack for at least a year, Sarhadi said, because officials found pictures and other documents related to the Taliban among his possessions. U.S. officials have called the Quran burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the Qurans and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions. U.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the burning. Still, gunmen have targeted U.S. troops in the days following the burning. A man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform killed two American soldiers at a base in eastern Nangarhar province early last week. Over the weekend, two senior U.S. officers were gunned down inside the heavily secure Afghan Interior Ministry when a junior intelligence officer turned his gun on them. The gunman, who had been fired by the ministry but recently rejoined as a driver, is still on the loose. The incident prompted the United States to pull military advisers and embedded civilians from Afghan ministries, and France announced it was temporarily withdrawing all of its public officials in Afghan institutions to ensure their safety. The unrest following the Quran burning has left at least 41 people dead, including the two deaths Thursday, and hundreds more wounded. At least nine people were killed and 12 wounded in an explosion Monday near the front gate of the ISAF base at Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan. There were no NATO casualties in the bombing. The Taliban insurgency said the attack was in retaliation for the Quran burning. In northern Kunduz province over the weekend, protesters attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, Afghan and U.S. authorities said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, and the resulting blasts wounded seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, they said. Demonstrations outside the United Nations office in Kunduz on Saturday left four civilians dead and prompted the U.N. mission there to say Monday that it is temporarily relocating its international staff. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday the unrest and targeting of Americans has gotten ""out of hand"" and needs to stop. The Obama administration feels the Afghans have not done enough to stem the violence, according to a senior U.S. official who has access to the latest intelligence and is involved in administration discussions, but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the situation. ""We are not going to settle for what has happened to our troops in recent days,"" the official said. The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, maintained Sunday that the Afghan security forces have given their lives to control the demonstrations and protect U.S. installations. Crocker said the Afghans ""are very much in this fight trying to protect us."" After the Interior Ministry shooting, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, said the United States would not let the incident divide the coalition.","Afghan official says the victims were Americans .

"Farnaz Seifi was arrested as she waited to fly out of a Tehran airport in 2007. Her crime? A blog calling for women's equality in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Originally on her way to a cyber-journalism workshop in India, Seifi, then in her mid-twenties, was transferred to Tehran's notorious Evin prison and at midnight, the interrogation began. According to the authorities, says Seifi, challenging the inequality and injustice that women face in Iran was ""acting against national security and being a spy for western countries."" Seifi is one of three women featured in a new documentary, ""Forbidden Voices,"" that follows the lives of female dissident bloggers across the globe. These women pay a high price for their blogs -- suffering violence, harassment and detainment by some of the world's most repressive regimes. ""They don't use political propaganda, they don't make speeches, they don't try to change things really aggressively -- they are trying to start a dialogue and I think this is why the world started noticing them,"" said Barbara Miller, director of ""Forbidden Voices,"" who was struck by the personal nature of blogging and how it allows ordinary people to talk about  the difficulties they face. ""I think this is a way that women tell stories and how women try to change the world."" Friday marks World Press Freedom Day, and this year the is emphasis is on securing freedom of expression in all media, including a free and open internet -- something Seifi can identify with. She told CNN: ""In countries like my country, you learn to censor yourself from a very early age and you become good at censoring yourself, unfortunately. The Islamic Republic of Iran makes each of us an example of it because we also censor each other."" ""It's sad when one day you figure out that you want freedom so badly but you are also part of the censoring system."" After a series of interrogations and heavy censorship of her blog by the Iranian authorities, Seifi left Iran in 2007 and now lives in Germany.  As a women's activist and blogger means it's unlikely she will return home while the current Iranian regime is in power. And for her family's safety she now blogs anonymously. Cuba's Yoani Sanchez, perhaps the most well-known of the three female bloggers featured in Miller's film, continues to speak out against the Castro government on her blog, ""Generación Y,"" which receives millions of hits each month. She was finally granted a passport by Cuban authorities in January after 20 failed applications, and her recent high profile trip to the U.S., where she visited the White House, has turned the media spotlight on the daily struggle of many in communist Cuba. But others remain trapped. Some of the film's most sinister scenes show Chinese blogger Zeng Jinyan under house arrest in Beijing, harassed by security officials outside her apartment as she tries to leave. When her husband, AIDS and environmental activist Hu Jia, is sentenced to over three years in prison in 2008, she was is left alone and isolated with their baby daughter and her blog, wondering if they will ever be free.   Since then, her blog has been censored in China. In countries where the state has a monopoly on information, blogging has come into its own as a tool for change and an outlet for sharing stories, according to Miller. ""The governments really fear these women. I mean, they are women, talking about their daily lives but the governments fear that they are so outspoken, that they are talking about what's really happening in their countries"". A refusal to be censored unites these women across cultures and continents, as they use their blogs to connect with the world outside of the regime. For Miller, the reaction of the authorities is perhaps the strongest indication of the strength of their individual voices. ""I think blogging is an extremely powerful tool, you can reach the whole world with one voice.""","""Forbidden Voices"" follows lives of female dissident bloggers around world .

"A judge in Georgia on Wednesday ordered the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Bible and Nobel Peace Prize to be stored in a safe deposit box that only the court will access until litigation over the items between the slain civil rights leader's children can be worked out. Fulton County Superior Judge Robert McBurney ordered King's daughter, Bernice, to turn over the items but did not set a timeline. The judge's order is the latest development in a feud between King's daughter and two sons -- Dexter King and Martin Luther King III -- over control of the Bible and Nobel prize. Bernice King alleges her brothers want to sell the objects. The slain civil rights icon's estate -- controlled by his sons -- sued King's daughter to force her to turn over the items. The judge ordered the items placed in a safe deposit box in the name of the King estate, but only the court would hold the keys. McBurney based his decision on ""the likelihood the estate will show the Bible and peace prize are possessions of the estate."" The items are ""in a safe deposit box in an unknown location,"" the judge said. Bernice King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated, is acting as ""the gatekeeper"" to her father's property, said attorney William Hill, who represents the King estate. He says she has no individual claim to the property that belongs to the estate controlled by her brothers. According to the complaint, King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but Bernice King has ""secreted and sequestered"" the items in question. The estate wants the civil rights leader's 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and his traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term. The Bible used to be on display at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. Bernice King has said her brothers told her on January 22 that they wanted the items so they could sell them. Her attorney, Eric Barnum, argued in court that the items in question should be left in the custody of the King Center. Barnum called the attempt to sell the items a ""money grab,"" saying there's a history of the King sons taking money made from possessions sold to line their own pockets. He said Bernice King wasn't interested in selling ""critical, sacred items,"" no matter the price. The judge compared Bernice King's stance against the sale of her father's possessions to Coca-Cola not wanting to sell its cola recipe. He later noted he was not trivializing the value of King's possessions with the comparison. This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy. Over the years, the siblings have sued and counter-sued one another. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use. They later agreed to a settlement and avoided a public trial.","A  judge has ordered Bernice King to turn over her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize .

"Despite Japanese deflation, a weaker yen and rising prices throughout the world, Tokyo has resumed its position as the world's most expensive city, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Tokyo took over from the Swiss city of Zurich, which dropped to seventh. Australian cities were among the biggest movers in the top 10 most expensive cities. A strong local currency powered Sydney (third) and Melbourne (equal fourth) up four places each from the previous year, while Singapore rose three places to sixth. Asian cities now make up 11 of the world's 20 most expensive cities. This compares to eight from Europe and highlights a trend of the cost of living increasing in the Asia-Pacific region. No U.S. city made the top 20. The Venezuelan city of Caracas rose 25 places to ninth, making it the most expensive city across the Americas. The EIU report linked the climb to price volatility (inflation has reached 20 percent) and fixed exchange rates to the U.S. dollar. According to the survey, the Canadian city of Vancouver is the most expensive location in North America, at position 21. Los Angeles and New York City tie at 27th as the most expensive U.S. cities. South Asian locations dominated the cheapest cities to live in.

"After Mukhtar Mai was gang raped on the orders of a tribal court in Pakistan in 2002, local tradition dictated she was expected to commit suicide. She defied her attackers and fought for justice. More than a decade on, she is still fighting for women's rights in Pakistan and inspiring many around the world. Mai's ""honor revenge"" was carried out on the orders of a jirga -- a tribal assembly -- because her 12-year-old brother was wrongly accused, according to a subsequent investigation ordered by the Punjab governor, of improper relations with a woman from another tribe. ""They decided I should be punished against my brother's crime,"" Mai, now 39, told CNN through an interpreter. ""They immediately acted upon that decision and dragged me out. That was the hardest moment of my life."" Read: The wisdom of women -- whose words inspire you? While the majority of rapes go unreported in Pakistan, according to Pakistani national newspaper The Express Tribune, Mai was determined not to stay silent. ""I was of the view that I must fight back to get my rights,"" said Mai. ""First of all, there was the rape, and afterwards when I tried to call the police, I received death threats that I would be killed if I went to a police station. ""I sat inside the four walls of my home, but I was encouraged by well-wishers. My local community gave me the courage to fight back and go to the court."" ""I decided that what happened to me should never happen to anyone else."" Initially, six men were sentenced to death for the rape or abetting the rape. However, in 2011, Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned all but one of the convictions and the men were freed. Mai grew up in a small village in the Punjab region of Pakistan, where she never went to school and was forced into marriage at the age 13. After only a few years, she was divorced and living back home with her parents. ""I came back to my parents' home and I started to make myself independent. I started working at home doing sewing and household work, low income work. ""I did that for 10 or 12 years and generated enough money to buy my own cattle."" At the age of 28, her life changed forever when she was gang raped as a result of her younger brother's alleged crime. Also on Leading Women: The woman powering Japan's nuclear hopes post-Fukushima . Far from destroying her, as her attackers would have expected, the incident made Mai determined to fight for women's rights and she set up the Mukhtar Mai Women's Organization. Convinced that lack of education contributed to the poor treatment of women, Mai established a girls' school, initially in a single room of her family home with a just one teacher and three students, including herself. ""The first school I attended was my own school,"" said Mai. For the first three years, she ran the school without any outside funding. ""Whatever I earned I used to pay the salary of the teacher. Sometimes I had to sell my own things,"" she said. Mai's school gained worldwide attention following a spate of articles in the international press in 2005 and donations began to pour in -- as well as some government money. Today the Mukhtar Mai Girl's Model School offers free education, books and uniforms to 550 girls from nursery to the beginning of high school. However Mai said the school has received no government funding for the last three years and is  struggling for income. In addition, she has set up a women's shelter and resource center for victims of violence, while her memoir, ""In the Name of Honor"", was published in 2006 and has been translated into 23 languages. In 2009, Mai married a police officer who acted as her bodyguard and they now have a one-year-old son. Late last year, the shooting of the young Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai brought women's rights back to worldwide attention. Malala, now 15, was shot by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' education in Swat Valley in October and is now recovering in hospital in the United Kingdom. ""I am praying for Malala's health and recovery,"" said Mai. ""She is a very little girl and the work she was doing and intends to do is great. ""More girls are now getting an education in her region due to Malala."" In the decade since her attack, Mai believes she has made a difference to women's rights in Pakistan, but still has a long way to go. ""Things have improved, but not as much as they should have done. There are laws, but the laws are not always implemented. ""It's an evolutionary process and it will take time. I hope I have given the courage to girls and women to speak about women's rights and to open new horizons."" Mai is the headline speaker at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on February 19.","Mukhtar Mai was gang raped at the age of 28 on the orders of a tribal council .

"Roma captain Francesco Totti set a new Serie A scoring record on Saturday as his side demolished Cesena 5-1. Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. ""It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,"" said Totti, AFP reported. ""I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,"" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. Totti's early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played. Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark. The win lifts Roma to sixth -- although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday -- and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season. Cesena, however, remain mired in trouble hovering just above the foot of the table in 18th place with 15 points. Juventus' 2-0 win over Atalanta sees them maintain their advantage at the top of Serie A over their nearest rivals AC Milan (who play Novara on Sunday) and Udinese (who host Catania). Stephan Lichtsteiner opened the scoring after 55 minutes before substitute Emanuele Giaccherini made sure of the three points nine minutes from the final whistle. Meanwhile in La Liga, Espanyol moved up to fifth place with a 3-0 win over struggling Granada on Saturday. Jose Baena headed home their first goal from a set piece in the 26th minute before Joan Verdu doubled the lead from the penalty spot moments before halftime. The home side didn't kill off a spirited Granada until ten minutes from time when Portuguese substitute Rui Fonte scored from close range to seal the three points. Getafe enjoyed a 2-1 away to Racing Santander with goals from Jaime Gavilan (26th minute) and Nicolas Miku (83rd minute) after Christian Stuani had given the home side the lead in the 14th minute. Atletico Madrid's long wait for an away win in the league is over after an emphatic 4-0 win at Real Sociedad. Radamel Falcao scored a hat-trick with Adrian netting Atletico's other goal. The Seville derby between Real Betis and Sevilla ended with honors even. A superb free kick from Benat gave the home side the lead in 26th minute, but Alvaro Negredo leveled the scores before half-time with a header. Sevilla had to play the final quarter of the match with 10-men after defender Federico Fazio was sent off, but clung on for the draw. In Sunday's fixtures, Barcelona travel to Malaga while Real Madrid host Athletic Bilbao. Third-place Valencia are away to Osasuna.

"Australia recovered from losing two key players inside the first 22 minutes to beat Wales 21-18 in Auckland Friday to secure third place at the Rugby World Cup. Two-time world champions Australia lost fullback Kurtley Beale to injury after eight minutes, but center Berrick Barnes crossed for a converted try for the Wallabies to open the scoring at Eden Park. The Australians then saw influential flyhalf Quade Cooper limp off with suspected cruciate ligament damage to his knee before James Hook got Wales on the score sheet with a penalty. Australia's James O'Connor, with a penalty that struck the upright, and Leigh Halfpenny missed kicking chances for their respective sides to leave it 7-3 at halftime. Hook, once again struggling with the boot, should have slotted over a three-point attempt early in the second half but it was quickly forgotten as veteran wing Shane Williams, playing in the final World Cup match of his career, produced a moment of magic in the 49th minute. He controlled a loose ball before gathering to go over in the corner and put Warren Gatland's men in front for the first time in the playoff. New Zealand to end 24 years of hurt? But Hook missed the conversion and the Wallabies responded with two penalties from 21-year-old O'Connor to take a 13-8 lead after 65 minutes. Barnes, 25, extended Australia's advantage with a drop goal, before flanker Ben McCalman touched down for the decisive try with 76 minutes on the clock. Wales, who have enjoyed their most successful World Cup campaign since the tournament was last held in New Zealand 24 years ago, finished with a flourish, wing Halfpenny grabbing a try on the 80-minute mark. New Zealander Gatland said there were plenty of positives his team could take from their performance in the tournament, but lamented the poor kicking which ultimately cost Wales the bronze medal. ""We've got to look at the disappointment of not finishing third or reaching the final,"" Gatland said. ""But there are a lot of positives to take out of this tournament. We've brought a lot of young players through. ""We've just got to keep looking to improve. We only lost 21-18 to one of the best sides in the world. So there are a lot of positives in that.  We missed one or two easy ones and James O'Connor has kicked pretty well. That's probably been the difference."" It is the first time Australia have finished third at the four-yearly tournament, having been crowned champions in 1991 and 1999, runners-up in 2003 and fourth in 1987.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Some plutonium found in soil on the grounds of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant may have come from its earthquake-damaged reactors, but it poses no human health risk, the plant's owners reported Monday. The element was found in soil samples taken March 21-22 from five locations around the plant, the Tokyo Electric Power Company told CNN late Monday. The company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on Japan following aboveground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades. ""It is not a health risk to humans,"" the company said. But it added, ""Just in case, TEPCO will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment."" Plutonium is a byproduct of nuclear reactions that is also part of the fuel mix at the plant's No. 3 reactor. It can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested, but external exposure poses little health risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Three plutonium isotopes -- Pu-238, -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds, Tokyo Electric reported. It said that plutonium found in two of the samples could have come out of the reactors that were damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan. All three isotopes have long half-lives, with plutonium-239 taking 24,000 years to lose half its radioactivity. Plutonium-238 has an 87-year half-life, while plutonium-240's is more than 6,500 years. The company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant, where three of the six reactors are believed to have suffered damage to their radioactive cores.

"(CNN) -- ""Sorry -- the sun is shining so I've gone to sleep on a hill."" When Alastair Humphreys leaves an ""out of office"" note, it's for real. But these days, the Briton -- who once left his parents' house and came back four years later after cycling around the world -- is finding adventure closer to home. ""Originally I wanted to test myself, to see what I was capable of physically and mentally, and I suppose I wanted to try to make my mark for myself and on the world,"" he tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""Now it's just more the curiosity of going to new places and the simplicity of life when you're out on an expedition, and the contrast of the life out in the wild to the real world back home -- the urban, busy, hectic life which I also enjoy."" So instead of trekking across India, running 150 miles through the Sahara in a week, rowing the Atlantic Ocean, or sledding through the freezing Arctic vistas of Greenland, now the 37-year-old is more likely to be leading a group of city slickers into the British wilderness -- and back in time for work on Monday morning. ""To be able to leave London on the train, travel just for 40 minutes, climb up a big hill to a beautiful woodland, be surrounded by birdsong and fresh air and silence and just enjoy being out here,"" he says. ""To cook on an open fire, sleep out underneath the stars, then wake up, smelling of smoke a little bit, a little disheveled perhaps, jump on the train, back into London, ready for another day at work, having had a real adventurous experience."" Humphreys, who grew up near the natural splendor of the Yorkshire Dales in northern England, was a latecomer to adventuring. It wasn't until he got to university that the travel bug bit. ""I wasn't particularly an athletic or sporty child and I started to get into running up mountains, marathons, pushing myself harder,"" he says. ""That's when I came up with the idea of trying to cycle around the world. Just after I finished university, I jumped on my bike with very little experience, no sponsors and no real likelihood of success and I waved goodbye to all my friends and family."" Four years later, he'd cycled 46,000 miles through 60 countries and five continents -- on a budget of just $10,000. Since then he's tackled more specific challenges on sand, snow and sea, all the while seeking to push his boundaries. ""I deliberately choose projects that I'm not an expert at and so everything I do, I begin quite intimidated, quite daunted, quite worried -- worried about failing, total disaster,"" Humphreys says. ""I don't really like finishing expeditions. Once I finish something and I know I can do it, I lose interest really and I start to think about what might be next."" Although his trips are physically grueling -- he was cycling 120 miles a day by the end of his global journey -- Humphreys says the main challenges are mental. ""Most trips I do, there's usually some point during it when I just sit down, often just burst into tears and just think, 'I can't do this.' If I just persuade myself to get up and keep going for a little bit longer, then I do it -- and I think that's the real appeal of adventure and certainly one of the addictive sides to it,"" he says. ""It's the realization that you're capable of more than you ever imagined. It's also a bit of a Pandora's Box -- you open up and think, ""Wow, if I did that, what can I do next?"" I'm not sure there's an end point."" While he loves the solitude of being alone in the great outdoors, Humphreys also appreciates being able to share the experience -- as he did with two friends when they went to Greenland in 2012. ""It's an amazing moment to stand there and watch the plane fly away and be left in total silence, no-one around for hundreds of hundreds of miles,"" he recalls. ""It's very cold, you're trying to operate camera equipment, temperatures minus 20, minus 30 -- really hard fiddly work, freezing cold fingers. We were putting in long days, pulling the sledge for long, long days. ""We were trying to push ourselves as hard as we could and also you're trying to build up a relationship -- you know the guys are mentally worrying, 'Am I slowing them down? Are they slowing me down?' ""The physical exhaustion of trying to do it -- it takes hours to try to melt enough water to drink for the day, so it's a grinding daily routine."" While early 20th century explorers such as Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott were discovering uncharted territories, Humphreys concedes that modern adventures mostly provide more personal achievements. ""The phrase 'pointless but meaningful' is one that I really like to view my adventures through because in one sense, cycling around the world, or walking across a desert or skiing in some ice cap in Greenland is pointless these days -- we have technology and vehicles that do it far more efficiently,"" he says. ""We're not actually doing anything of 'use' in the most literal sense and yet there's definitely something that to me feels meaningful. Adventure has added so much to my life -- knowledge of the world, knowledge of myself, perspective and balance about the modern world that I live in back home."" In 2012, he was named National Geographic's Adventurer of the Year after a series of mini-expeditions around Britain, and has written extensively about his experiences. And it's this understanding of how we fit into the world that he hopes his microadventures will give to people weary of the city rat race. ""Microadventures are my attempt to try to help normal people in the real world get the enjoyment out of adventures that I've had over many years,"" Humphreys explains. ""I wanted to get the essence of adventure, the wilderness, the challenge, the escape from urban life, all these things that are really important to me, and condense them down into something small and achievable for normal people with real lives. ""You can escape -- if only for one night -- and find nature, wilderness, a bit of peace and then go back to your normal life with a slightly shifted perspective.""

"NASA is asking for your help. No, you do not get to go to space. You do, however, get to view hundreds of thousands of images taken from space. Via The Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth, NASA is making available images ranging from the Mercury missions of the 1960s to photos recently snapped from the International Space Station. The hope, NASA says, is that the images ""could help save energy, contribute to better human health and safety and improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. But scientists need your help to make that happen."" The catalog contains more than 1.8 million photos, about 1.3 million of them from the space station and roughly 30% of them taken at night. Before 2003, night images from the space station could be blurry, even with high-speed film and manual tracking, because the station moves at about 17,500 mph. In 2003, enterprising astronaut Don Pettit used a drill and assorted parts he found on the station to cobble together a ""barn-door tracker,"" a lower-tech predecessor to the European Space Agency's NightPod, which was installed at the space station nine years later. NightPod's motorized tripod compensates for the space station's speed, providing what NASA scientist William Stefanov says are the highest-resolution night images from orbit. Satellites collect data more regularly, but the photos tend to be lower resolution. ""Now the pictures are clear, but their location may not be, which limits their usefulness. That's where citizen science comes in,"" the NASA news release says. The Complutense University of Madrid is spearheading efforts to catalog the photos and corral citizen input. It's broken the images into three components requiring different levels of participation: . 1. Dark skies. This is the easiest project, as it requires no scientific expertise. ""Anyone can help"" by sorting the images into the categories: cities, stars or other objects, said Alejandro Sanchez, doctoral student at Complutense. ""Without the help of citizens, it is almost impossible to use these images scientifically. Algorithms cannot distinguish between stars, cities and other objects, such as the moon. Humans are much more efficient for complex image analysis,"" he said. 2. Night cities. Looking at night images, citizen scientists can tap their knowledge of local geography to match photos with positions on maps. Residents of a city can more easily identify a city's features than those who don't live there, Sanchez said. The data will be used to generate light maps of cities. 3. Lost at night. This is the trickiest, as it aims to identify cities in photos with 310-mile circumferences. ""We don't know which direction the astronaut pointed the camera, only where the station was at the time the image was taken,"" Sanchez said. ""Some images are bright cities, but others are small towns. It is like a puzzle with 300,000 pieces."" Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up so far, classifying almost 20,000 photos, but NASA says multiple individuals should review each image to ensure accuracy. The ""open atlas of nighttime images"" can be used to assess economic conditions, Sanchez said. One photo of the Korean Peninsula shows how North Korea is a barely lit swath of land between the heavily illuminated nations of South Korea and China. Sanchez also cited the examples of Madrid and Berlin. ""Madrid is the capital of Spain, a country facing a major economic crisis. It is much brighter in astronaut images than Berlin, the capital of Germany, the country with the healthiest economy in Europe. Perhaps that is an indication that Germany more efficiently manages its resources. The images can provide evidence and data to verify that."" Other aims of the project include evaluating street lighting for safety purposes as well as to analyze light pollution and its effects on human health.","Until recently, night images taken from 17,500-mph space station could be blurry .

"(CNN)  -- Students and teachers from a Maryland private school who were quarantined in China because of swine flu concerns have been released, the mother of one of the students told CNN's ""American Morning."" Chinese health authorities prepare to take temperatures of passengers on a plane from Germany this week. ""I've heard both from my daughter and from one of the teacher chaperones. They are quite excited,"" said Alesia Peterson, whose 15-year-old daughter Erica is one of the 21 students on the trip. ""They had their temperatures taken. They were all normal. So they were allowed to leave. They boarded a bus which was filled with flowers and gifts and they're heading on to their next destination."" The Chinese government quarantined the students from Barrie School and their three teacher chaperones at their hotel because a passenger on their plane to China was suspected of having swine flu, said Vicky Temple, the director of communications for the school. Mike Kennedy, the head of Barrie School, said U.S. consular officials have since told the school that the plane passenger does not have swine flu, or H1N1. Kennedy said the students were kept in their hotel rooms -- on two floors of a four-star hotel in Kaili, part of Guizhou province in southern China -- since about noon Monday. The students are scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday. ""They've missed the lion's share of the itinerary,"" Kennedy said Thursday. ""It's very frustrating,"" he said, but added, ""I understand, and I'd like to say that the Chinese officials have been as kind and friendly to our kids and chaperones as they can be."" China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that the Guizhou Province's health bureau announced earlier this week that it had discovered two dozen Americans who had been within four rows of the suspected swine flu, or H1N1, case on the plane. The plane had departed from San Francisco, California, on Friday. While in quarantine, some of the students had roommates, others did not, said Peterson, who told CNN she got information from the teacher chaperones. The kids were allowed to have their doors open and speak across the hall. They were also allowed to use the phones and had e-mail access. Chinese authorities delivered three meals a day in baskets. To try to stay entertained, some kids used those as makeshift bowling balls. Asked whether she was upset about what happened to her daughter's trip, Peterson responded, ""I'd have to say they're visitors in a foreign country. And as such, we have to adhere to whatever the rules of the foreign country are."" She added, ""I actually had just some concerns as a parent would have. But I have absolute confidence with the teacher chaperones that were there and had been monitoring and keeping us informed the whole time."" Peterson has offered her daughter a future trip overseas to help make up for this one. ""I think we might have to wait a few years. If she would like to go back to China, I would love for her to do so."" State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said in an afternoon briefing that he was aware of the report but said he didn't have details on the circumstances or what the U.S. officials might be doing about it. CNN's Brian Todd and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","NEW: Group from Maryland private school allowed to resume trip, mother says .

"Six people died after a train slammed into a vehicle early Saturday evening in southern Italy, the nation's official news agency reported, citing investigative and other sources. Photos taken in Rossano showed the Fiat Multipla impaled against the front of the train -- mangled and largely unrecognizable -- as firefighters walked along the track. A rescuer described the scene as ""appalling,"" according to the official ANSA news agency. The crash occurred around 5:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. ET) near Rossano, which is about 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Naples and 280 kilometers northeast of Reggio Calabria. The Fiat was struck and dragged 600 meters before it and the train finally came to a stop, ANSA reported. All those killed had been inside the vehicle, with ANSA citing reports that at least some of them were Romanian migrant workers who had been picking clementine oranges in the region. The area near the crash scene has been cordoned off, as the investigation continues to determine what happened.","The train hit a Fiat Multipla near Rossano, the official ANSA news agency reports .

"He's known as ""Asian golf's John Daly"" but Kiradech Aphibarnrat made a name for himself with his first European Tour victory on Sunday. The 23-year-old won the rain-shortened Malaysian Open by one shot from former European Ryder Cup star Edoardo Molinari to become only the fourth Thai player to win on the circuit. A burly big hitter, he is said to resemble Daly, who twice won major titles before his career went off the rails due to his various addictions. Aphibarnrat, however, has no such off-course issues, though he has been struggling with a thyroid problem according to the Asian Tour website. ""I'm so happy this week. I'm proud of myself and for my family. I almost won here a few years ago (he tied for third in 2010) and finally I made it. I'm so happy,"" he said. The co-sanctioned  tournament was reduced to three rounds due to bad weather, and the final day was also disrupted by storms. Aphibarnrat had a one-shot lead after 15 holes when play was halted for two hours, but held his nerve after the resumption as he narrowly avoided a water hazard on 17 and and had to sink a 15-foot putt to par. He was able to drop a shot at the last for the biggest victory of his career and a $458,330 first prize that put him top of the Asian Tour money list, with a 54-hole total of 13-under-par 203. ""During the suspension, I couldn't eat anything. I was so excited,"" said Aphibarnrat, who completed a second round of four-under 68 before closing with a 70. ""When I walked out, everything was shaking, even my voice. My caddy told me to just concentrate, just two more holes. I'm lucky that I played only 54 holes. Otherwise, I am so tired due to the weather and the golf course."" Molinari watched on, knowing that if he had earlier done better than par at 18 he would have been in a playoff. The Italian had made the halfway cut for the first time in six starts this year since returning from a worrying wrist injury, and was pleased with the improvements he has made under new swing coach Sean Foley -- who also works with Tiger Woods. ""It's mixed emotions because I'm very happy to have a good week for the first time in a long time. The swing changes are starting to pay off, which is surprising because I thought it would take a lot longer,"" said the 32-year-old, who played on the 2010 Ryder Cup-winning team but has not claimed a European Tour title since earlier that season, when he triumphed twice. ""But I'm disappointed because I had a lot of chances on the back nine,"" he added, having carded 67. ""The 18th is only the second fairway I missed all day which is very disappointing."" Former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel had been one shot behind Aphibarnrat at the start of the day, but finished tied for fourth with France's Victor Dubuisson after a 71. ""It's a hard week with being on and off the course the whole time,"" said Schwartzel, whose fellow South African Louis Oosthuizen won the tournament last year. ""It's difficult to find any rhythm. I feel like I swung the club pretty well, but I didn't play that well today."" Schwartzel was a runaway 11-shot winner at the Thai Golf Championship in December, where Aphibarnrat tied for sixth and Daly missed the cut, but this time he had to settle for a minor placing as Denmark's Anders Hansen fired 66 to claim third.. ""For some reason I was hitting short irons all over the shop,"" Schwartzel said. ""Kiradech did well. I would've liked to have applied a bit more pressure on him.""","Kiradech Aphibarnrat wins shortened Malaysian Open by one shot on Sunday .

"Few things are more ethereal than hope. It isn't tangible, easily measurable or available in pill form. That's likely why the idea that hope may wield a significant influence on healing -- and even survival -- may be tough to take for our bean-counter brains, hardwired by evolution to seek certainty at any cost. Shane Lopez, author of the new book ""Making Hope Happen,"" is unfazed by any such ambivalence. ""I began my career by studying intelligence and how that relates to good health,"" he says. ""Sometimes I found it easier to just tell people I was an intelligence researcher. They reacted like that research was somehow important and fancy."" When he talks about hope, people's eyes glaze over more often than not. Nonetheless, Lopez believes hope is the stuff of change, recovery and healing. Using downward dogs to treat depression . The positive physiological effects of hope are well-documented, most eloquently in Jerome Groopman's ""The Anatomy of Hope,"" where he writes: ""Researchers are learning that a change in mind-set has the power to alter neurochemistry. ""Belief and expectation -- the key elements of hope -- can block pain by releasing the brain's endorphins and enkephalins, mimicking the effects of morphine. In some cases, hope can also have important effects on fundamental physiological processes like respiration, circulation and motor function."" Groopman's research showed that during the course of illness, belief and expectation -- two mental states associated with hope -- have an impact on the nervous system which, in turn, sets off a chain reaction that makes improvement and recovery more likely. This process, he points out, is fundamental to the widely accepted ""placebo effect,"" which is created by a hopeful outlook. It is less of a stretch to contemplate the link between hope and emotional well-being. ""Have you ever met a happy hopeless person?"" Lopez asks simply. Groopman observed that hope does not just involve a mind-to-body connection, but also a body-to-mind connection, where neural input about one's physical condition serves as a moderator of positive and negative emotions. Training the brain to stress less . Hope, Lopez says, may buffer us from stress, anxiety and the effects of negative life events. Studies of workers over time suggest that hopeful employees experience more well-being. And it comes as no surprise that in a Gallup poll of 1 million people, the hopeful said they laughed and smiled much more often than the hopeless, Lopez writes, citing an ""unpublished analysis of data from the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index and the Gallup Student Poll."" According to Lopez, studies also show that hope promotes healthy behaviors, including fruit and vegetable consumption, regular exercise, safe sex practices and quitting smoking. ""In each case,"" writes Lopez, ""hope for the future is clearly linked with daily habits that support health and prevent disease."" That's because hope triggers a virtuous cycle. Hopeful people conjure a vision that sustains them, that causes them to show up for the hard work and accept setbacks, Lopez says. They make an investment in the future that pays off in the present: in the way they eat, exercise, conserve energy, take care of themselves and stick to their treatment plan. The pathways of hope . In 2008, Duane Bidwell, an associate professor of practical theology at Claremont School of Theology in California, set out to study hope among children suffering from chronic illness. ""We felt there was insufficient theory about hope from children's perspectives,"" he says. ""Most of the research was based on and extrapolated from adult experiences and then applied to kids."" Bidwell and his colleague Dr. Donald Batisky, a pediatric nephrologist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, analyzed vast amounts of data from a diverse group of children suffering from end-stage renal failure. The researchers identified five main pathways to hope. They are: . • Maintaining identity by continuing to participate in activities and relationships that help patients retain a sense of self outside diagnosis and treatment. • Realizing community through formal and informal connections that help patients understand they are not alone in living with disease. This community is made real through conversation, visitation, consultation and participation in daily activities. • Claiming power by taking an active role in treatment by setting goals, self-advocating, monitoring and maintaining one's own health. • Attending to spirituality, activated through religious, spiritual and other contemplative practices. • Developing wisdom, which involves both gaining pragmatic, medical wisdom derived from one's own experience and finding ways to ""give back."" ""The pathways are not hierarchical in any way,"" Bidwell says. ""You can access hope through any of these pathways and all of them. The more of them you can access, the better."" Literature tends to treat hope as an existential experience, virtue or emotion, Bidwell says. But the children Bidwell studied revealed that hope is a social resource. It emerges through interactions with the people who surround us and is then internalized. What's important, says Bidwell, is for the patient's ""team members"" -- family members, doctors, nurses, social workers, friends and chaplains, among others -- to do things that help create and activate hope pathways for the patient. Hope is present, ordinary and 'normal' When asked what he found most compelling or surprising about his findings, Bidwell says his team asked the children to talk about a time when hope became real during their disease treatment. ""More often than not,"" he recalled, ""they told us about ordinary moments with family and friends -- saying grace around the dinner table, times when they were aware of the abundance they had in their lives, even though ... they build their lives around dialysis and medication."" We so often discount these ordinary daily moments, Bidwell says. But those who are more intentional about the practices that bring hope right now are better able to take care of themselves. The children in Bidwell's study experienced mostly psychosocial suffering, he says. ""Things like being different from their peers because they were stuck to a dialysis machine or always on medication."" Hope enabled the children to claim power -- to say: ""Here's where the disease gets to influence my life and here's where it doesn't get to influence my life."" ""I'm normal,"" Bidwell recalls a young girl telling him. ""Hope helps me be more normal."" Stress, depression may affect cancer survival . What hope is -- and isn't . There is a thin line between hope and denial, and that line is an unwavering commitment to truth and reality. Groopman writes: ""False hope does not recognize the risks and dangers that true hope does. False hope can lead to intemperate choices and flawed decision making. True hope takes into account the real threats that exist and seeks to navigate the best path around them."" Both Lopez and Bidwell emphasize that hope is not about positive thinking. Hope is half optimism, Lopez explains. The other half is the belief in the power that you can make it so. There is a profound difference between hoping and wishing, he continues. Wishing encourages passivity, whereas hope represents an active stance. ""Wishing is the fantasy that everything is going to turn out OK. Hoping is actually showing up for the hard work.""

Hope may buffer us from stress, anxiety and the effects of negative life events .

"(CNN)Daniel Ndambuki might today be one of Kenya's top comedians, having the crowd in stitches every time he performs, but things were quite different when he first took to the stage. In fact, Ndambuki's debut performance was so bad that he had to be stopped straight away. ""My first joke ... they switched off the mic,"" recalls Ndambuki, who is better known by his stage name ""Churchill"". ""It was too boring,"" he admits laughingly, ""even [to] myself. ""We left the stage and we promised ourselves never to do comedy again, but I went back and with practice and a lot of encouragement, we just found ourselves getting addicted to the stage and that's exactly what we are doing up until now.""

And to Churchill's credit, he did and today, thanks to his hard work and determination, he is at the helm of two of Kenya's biggest comedy shows: Churchill Live and Churchill Raw. The first one is more of a magazine show, with several high-profile guests, whilst the latter serves as a platform for up-and-coming performers to showcase their talents. To find the best entertainers, Churchill auditions a group of comedians, and the cream of the crop goes on to perform before a live audience later that day. ""There is nothing as exciting as being a pioneer for a big dream, not only for one country, but the whole continent and creating history and influencers -- it's the most amazing thing,"" says Churchill.

""Humor is based on current issues and observation and just characters,"" continues the seasoned comic, ""so it's a whole journey seven days a week; you have to keep on doing it, again and again. ""Comedy is not easy, it's really more like a calling. If someone has that talent, the best you can do as a parent is to encourage that person.""

"A small but growing group of House Republicans is increasingly worried about the fallout from the government shutdown and say it's time for Speaker John Boehner to allow a simple vote on a spending bill. Defunding Obamacare can wait for now, they say. ""I'm trying to be optimistic but at the same time I have a really, really tough time when people are out of work and they can't pay their bills,"" Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told reporters Wednesday.  ""Though it might be a political loss for us ... this is an untenable situation."" Rep. Scott Rigell, whose Virginia district is home to a significant number of military members and civilian contractors, was one of the first to publicly break away. ""We fought the good fight,"" he said in a tweet on Tuesday, but acknowledged it was time to move on. Boehner hosted small groups of concerned members on Wednesday.  A spokesman for Boehner declined to talk about the sessions. A Republican source familiar with one of Wednesday's meetings said Boehner listened, but didn't signal he was willing to allow a vote on a clean bill. ""They weren't strong-armed, and they weren't asked to step back,"" the source said of the moderates in the meeting. It was taken as a positive sign that Boehner wasn't trying to muzzle the effort. Another House Republican source acknowledged that the group doesn't yet have the numbers, muscle or will to force Boehner's hand. To do so, they would need to stick together and vote with Democrats to block any piecemeal spending bills from coming up. The only Republican to do that so far is Rep. Peter King of New York. One of the Republicans who met with Boehner Wednesday told CNN they are giving him a bit more time to let things play out, but could decide to rebel by the end of the week. The shutdown: Americans on the edge . White House meeting . There were no apparent breakthroughs during a midweek meeting at the White House between congressional leaders and President Barack Obama. Descriptions of the meeting ran the gamut. Obama called the session ""useful;"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""worthwhile"" and Boehner cast it as a ""polite conversation.""  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, called it ""unproductive."" But the major players were all in the same room at the same time, talking to each other -- something that hasn't happened much in recent weeks. Following Cruz's playbook . As the shutdown lingers, some Republican moderates are openly frustrated that tea party darling Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas appears to be calling the shots on what House Republicans do next.  Cruz was one of the first to suggest passing narrow bills that fund those government agencies or functions that generate any public backlash. ""I think the leadership is committed to play the Cruz strategy all the way out,"" California Rep. Devin Nunes told reporters, before adding ""if you can call it a strategy."" For two days, GOP leaders have pushed through a series of piecemeal spending bills for floor votes that would fund things like veterans affairs, national parks and medical research. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said Wednesday they plan to continue doing this. ""We've got ways to ease the pain on people,"" Cantor said. ""We agree on a lot around here. We ought to fund that, and then we ought to sit down and talk about that which we don't."" Still, the spending measures have no hope of passing, because the Democratic-led Senate won't approve the bills and, even if they did, the White House has promised a veto. Shutdown: Navy-Air Force football game on; others in limbo . Moderates meet . King hosted a group of mostly moderate GOP members in his office early Wednesday that want Boehner to allow a vote on a clean spending bill.  He told reporters about 10 members attended, but said he believes there are about two dozen who would publicly back a clean spending plan -- one that doesn't try to strip the funding from President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program. ""I could be wrong, but I think if you had a secret ballot, 180 would vote for a clean CR,"" King said. But it's more likely that a shift in House GOP strategy won't come in public defiance on the House floor, King said, but in quiet talks behind closed doors. ""Maybe it's because I come from New York. I rely on back room meetings to get things done,"" he said. ""I'm hoping someone's going to meet behind the scenes somewhere and we're going to make a deal."" One senior Republican familiar with the talks argued that the effort may be small now, but it is expanding, and will grow as more Republicans hear from constituents back home that are hurting from the shutdown. ""It's Day 2 of the shutdown -- we went from six or seven (members) to over 20 today,"" the senior Republican told CNN. Another GOP member familiar with the discussions told CNN they would only get serious if they stood together as a group to block a vote. ""The only way we're going to get Boehner and Cantor to change course is if we can bring things to a halt,"" said the source, who asked to speak anonymously while talks continue. A perilous strategy . But it could be risky for these House Republicans to take a stand against the tea party faction of the GOP. At the weekly lunch of the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives, the rumblings of the moderate GOP members came up. Some in the room said they should ""go after"" those fellow Republicans and put pressure on them to fall in line, according to a GOP source familiar with the discussions. But another Republican congressional source in the meeting said the message was softer. Members of the committee were encouraged to have ""one-one-one converstations"" with moderates to convince them to stick with the current GOP leadership strategy. Nunes told reporters he expected the shutdown to go through the weekend and possibly through mid-October when Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling. He doesn't think the current House Republican plan, which he repeatedly said is being dictated by Cruz, is helping the GOP cause of defunding or delaying Obamacare. But he said he will vote for the smaller spending bills out of loyalty to Boehner, even as he criticized the group behind Cruz as ""lemmings."" ""I'm going to continue to support our leadership. Even if we have entered the valley of death, when you enter the valley of death you have to keep running and the whole team has to stick together,"" a frustrated Nunes told reporters outside the House floor. King acknowledged the effort to get more Republicans to push for a clean spending bill could take some time and probably wouldn't result in a new strategy until ""the tea party has had enough.""

"Actress Lauren Bacall, the husky-voiced Hollywood icon known for her sultry sensuality, died Tuesday. She was 89. Robbert de Klerk, co-managing partner of the Humphrey Bogart Estate, said Bacall died in New York. She was anointed a legend during her lifetime by the American Film Institute, but she wasn't fond of that, she told CNN's Larry King in an interview in 2005. ""I don't like the category. And to begin with, to me, a legend is something that is not on the Earth, that is dead,"" she said. Legends were part of the past, and Bacall preferred the present. But her international fame began before the backdrop of World War II, in 1944 with her first film, ""To Have and Have Not,"" which she made with future husband Humphrey Bogart. They married in 1945, had two children and went on to make more films together, including ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), ""Dark Passage"" (1947) and ""Key Largo"" (1948).  Bogart died in 1957. Her memorable quotes . ""He was an extraordinary, extraordinary man. I mean, I've been extremely lucky. God, I have no complaints at all,"" Bacall said of her late husband during a 2005 interview with CNN's Larry King. Bacall's grandson said he got a call early Tuesday from his father. ""She apparently had a stroke.  A pretty massive stroke.  That's what happened,"" said Jamie Bogart, who last saw Bacall over the holidays. ""She was, you can say she was a tough personality.  She wanted the best and if you weren't doing the best she let you know about it.  She was a great person.  Catch her on a bad day it could be interesting.  She was a good grandma. She was lucky to have a pretty unique life,"" he said. A marriage to Jason Robards, which produced another child, actor Sam Robards, ended in divorce. Bacall was engaged to Frank Sinatra, briefly, between marriages. Friend Dick Cavett, a former TV talk show host, said he and his wife were in a cab just 36 hours before the death was announced, driving by where Bacall lived and wondering aloud how she was doing. ""Her presence was tangible,"" Cavett said. ""There was no nonsense, no affectation. She wasn't tough. But she could play tough."" Cavett added: ""She just was what a lot of young women would like to be. Someone that can't be pushed around. Someone that could tell you where to head in ... with a colorful, vile vocabulary if she needed to fall back on it."" Bacall's confident, smoldering expression -- the down-turned face and up-turned eyes -- earned her the nickname: The Look. Ironically, the young woman originally struck the pose because she felt insecure. Hollywood recalls screen legend Lauren Bacall . ""I mean, that was what started the look -- was nerves -- just trying to keep my head steady,"" Bacall once said. Bacall won two Tony Awards and an honorary Oscar; she was nominated for three Emmy Awards. During the interview with King, Bacall said working on stage was her original dream. ""When the curtain goes up, [the stage is] ours. It's ours to project what the playwright wants to say to an audience, what to convey and to get a response from the audience immediately. ""Movies are great fun and wonderful when they're good. But you never get to see them till six months after they're finished. ""So you never get a sense of whether they're really well liked or how good they are. And you don't really know what the finished product is going to be like, because it's a director's medium."" Opinion: Bacall, the last existential heroine . Bacall was discovered by the wife of American film director Howard Hawks after she appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar. As a lanky teen, she modeled to earn extra money. Hawks later gave Bacall, who was born Betty Joan Perske, the name Lauren. Her last name, Bacall, came from her mother's maiden name. Her first autobiography, ""Lauren Bacall: By Myself,"" won the National Book Award in 1980. ""By Myself and Then Some,"" her updated autobiography, was published in 2005.

"The amazing escape of three Cleveland women -- Amanda Berry, Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, and Michelle Knight -- exploded into the media amid sordid back stories of their captivity and gave life yet again to my own dark memories of captivity and despair. At age 13, I, too, became the helpless victim of a sexually depraved monster, a vicious Internet predator who actively groomed me. Luring me from my home, he abducted me to Virginia where I was held captive in his basement dungeon. For days, I was raped, beaten and tortured, and like an animal, chained to the floor by a locking dog collar. My abductor shared my degradation via streaming video, boasting online about the young girl he had taken to be his sex slave. It was this very brazenness that would lead to my rescue, as one recipient of the live broadcast, afraid of his own involvement in the crime, scoured the newspaper and found my National Center for Missing and Exploited Children missing person flier. Seeing that my family and the FBI were searching for me, he used a pay phone to contact authorities. This led the FBI to where I was being imprisoned. The chain was cut from my neck; I was set free and gifted with a second chance at life. Had that call not been made, or had the investigation taken only a bit longer, the monster would have most likely murdered me. Sadly, 74% of stranger-abducted children will be killed within the first three hours. Abused but alive: Lessons from survivors . Though my rescue was miraculous, recovery and re-assimilation has been difficult. Despite this, at 14, after an all-too-brief period of healing, I began to speak out and share my story with students, parents, teachers, law enforcement -- anybody who would listen. I came to realize that other children need not suffer my traumatic experience, and so the ""Alicia Project"" was born. Continuing my mission, I've joined Discovery ID to raise awareness of, and effect change for, issues such as Internet safety, missing persons, human trafficking and child safety awareness education. I was attending an Amber Alert roundtable in Florida when news broke of the Cleveland rescue. Few have had positive outcomes; their loved ones have been recovered deceased or not at all. Those whose children have yet to be recovered are searching tirelessly, proclaiming that they will never give up. I watched their faces light up as they heard the news. You could almost hear each of them say, ""That could be my child!"" These women are unbelievably lucky to have been pulled from the hell they were suffering and given another chance. They are excited to be back with their families and/or loved ones and everything is moving so quickly that their pain and trauma may be eclipsed by their joy. Unfortunately, this is likely to be short-lived. The vast majority of those who have survived a traumatic experience suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Nightmares, flashbacks, an inability to be in large crowds, hypervigilance, etc., may become a part of their daily lives. It's important for those around them to be sensitive and to allow them to express their pain. Letter from a kidnapping survivor . Additionally, people must also temper their questioning of the events that unfolded while the girls were missing. It is their story and their choice whether to share it. They do not owe that to the world. Privacy is essential. Survivors, aware of the agonies their families have endured, may feel the need to appear to be ""fine"" because they do not want to add to their loved ones' grief. This is one of the many reasons counseling is vital for healthy mental well-being, as it provides a forum in which to speak freely without concern for the reaction of others. Healing, for each of us, is an ongoing process. I still have days where I suffer from PTSD, but they are becoming less frequent. Traumas don't simply vanish, but we can definitely choose to fill our lives with positive experiences as time goes on. What people should take from this story is a message of hope. We must never give up hope that any child, whatever the circumstances, will be rescued and returned safely home. Amanda, Michelle and Georgina, you have so many wonderful things in store for you. Only those of us who have experienced the terror of threatened captivity may truly appreciate the hero you became as you seized that chance of escape, Amanda. Together, you survived. Welcome home, heroes.","Alicia Kozakiewicz was abducted at age 13 and taken to Virginia .

"A Navy F-18 fighter jet that crashed into a Virginia Beach neighborhood in April experienced dual engine failure, marking the first time an F-18 has had two unrelated catastrophic engine failures at the same time, according to a report released on the investigation. In the first five seconds of flight, the jet's right engine stalled from a fuel leak, the investigators said. The pilot tried to compensate with extra thrust from the left engine but it also failed due to an unrelated problem with the afterburner. ""It was not a single failure but an extremely unusual and complex multisystem emergency,"" Rear Adm. Ted Branch said at a press conference Monday. Related: Navy jet experiences ""catastrophic"" malfunction, crashes in Virginia . With a failed right engine and a malfunctioning left engine that was not generating sufficient thrust, the aircraft quickly lost altitude. When the F-18 dropped to 50 feet the crew ejected. One second later the jet crashed into an apartment complex, but no one was killed. The whole ordeal, from takeoff to crash, lasted only 70 seconds. If the right engine alone had failed, it is highly unlikely the aircraft would have crashed, Branch said. ""We have never had this kind of unrelated dual engine mishap in the F-18,"" he said. ""It's the first time its ever happened with this aircraft."" Emergency procedures will be revised to take this rare occurrence into account, he said.

"(CNN)  -- Chelsea's Didier Drogba has been crowned African Footballer of the Year for the second time. The Ivory Coast striker, who also claimed the honor in 2006, fought off tough opposition from Inter Milan's Cameroon ace Samuel Eto;o and his club teammate Michael Essien, who plays for Ghana. The result was announced at a ceremony in Accra, Ghana, with Drogba succeeding Manchester City's Togo star Emmanuel Adebayor. The award was judged by national coaches from countries affiliated to the Confederations of African Football (CAF). Drogba, who was not at the ceremony as he prepares for English Premier League action with Chelsea this weekend, will receive $20,000. The 32-year-old played a leading role as the Elephants qualified for this summer's World Cup finals, but the Ivory Coast disappointed in the recent Africa Cup of Nations where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. But Drogba's form this season for Chelsea in their bid to win the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League has been outstanding with 25 goals in all competitions. Africa Cup of Nations runners-up Ghana were the other big winners on the night with striker Dominic Adiyiah claiming the Young Player of the Year award. Sellas Tetteh was named Coach of the Year having led the Black Stars to success in the under-20 World Cup. Africa Champions League winners TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo were named Africa Club of the year. The Best Player on the Continent also went to their captain Tresor Mputu Mabi. Algeria, who upset Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt to qualify for the World Cup where they are in the same group as England and also reached the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations, were named National Team of the Year.","Didier Drogba claims African Footballer of the Year award for the second time .

"Under the watchful gaze of one monarch, a new king was crowned at Epsom Downs Saturday as the Aidan O'Brien-trained Ruler of the World dominated rivals to claim England's most prestigious race, the Epsom Derby. But it was a day of disappointment for the pre-race favorite, Godolphin-owned Dawn Approach, who failed in his quest to add the Derby to his 2,000 Guineas triumph last month. Queen Elizabeth, a regular Derby attendee, was among those who had gathered to see Dawn Approach attempt to become the 38th horse to win the first two legs of English racing's Triple Crown. But his race was over within the first furlong as the Jim Bolger-trained colt appeared to crack under the pressure of a tactical early pace, pulling fiercely from the start and refusing to settle for jockey Kevin Manning. After briefly hitting the front at the mile marker, the son of 2008 Epsom Derby winner New Approach faded badly and eventually finished second from last.  His connections conceded it would probably be his last outing over a mile and a half. But it was a different story for Ruler of the World, rated at 7/1 odds to win. Joseph O'Brien, Ballydoyle's stable jockey and son of the trainer, had opted to ride the equally immodestly named Battle of Marengo, leaving the way clear for Ryan Moore to claim the ride on Ruler of the World. Moore's faith in the chestnut colt paid off as he blasted home by one and a half lengths from a strong-finishing Libertarian, winner of last month's Dante Stakes.  Galileo Rock was just a short head behind in third, with Battle of Marengo next to finish. Acknowledging the first part of the race had been ""messy,"" Moore said that Ruler of the World had quickened well rounding Tattenham Corner, adding that he thought the horse could get an even further trip in the future. ""He has got a real, likeable attitude,"" Moore said. ""You have got to give credit to the horse.  He really toughed it out and showed a very good attitude."" O'Brien thanked the horse's owners, John and Sue Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith. ""We are so lucky to be in the position that we are in, to get such horses,"" he said. ""They are incredibly bred horses and, even before they are mated, the dream is for this to happen."" Ruler of the World's triumph gave the Irish trainer a second consecutive win in this race and a fourth in total, while Moore has previously won on Workforce in 2010. A son of super sire Galileo, Ruler of the World was, unusually, not raced at two years old.  He is the first horse in such a position to win the Derby since 1993, and has enjoyed an undefeated three-year-old campaign over distances from 10 furlongs to a mile and a half. His performance over the demanding Epsom course on just his third start suggests there could be plenty more to come from a horse whose very name seems to betoken greatness.","Ruler of the World ends Dawn Approach's hopes of English Triple Crown .

"The boy's stories are heartbreaking: ""My dad drinks and hits me ... my mom chose drugs over me ... my home on the reservation isn't a safe place for me to be,"" wrote Josh Little Bear. His request seems reasonable -- send a few dollars to help St. Joseph's Indian School to keep ""kids like me safe ... so we don't have to live this way anymore."" The story, begging for help, is part of massive national marketing campaign involving 30 million pieces of a mail a year. And it's a successful one, raising more than $50 million last year. But Josh Little Bear doesn't exist. It's not just a pseudonym to protect a child. The story is a fabrication, a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that Native American leaders say does not exist. Officials at St. Joseph's Indian School -- a 200-person boarding school in Chamberlain, South Dakota, that's affiliated with a Roman Catholic charity based in Wisconsin -- say they send out waves of mailings three or four times a year. The latest, a Christmas-oriented mailer, was sent in early November, according to the school's director of communications. The packets include calendars, personalized return address stickers, notepads, elaborate stickers and a so-called ""Dreamcatcher,"" a Native American handicraft that by tradition gives its owners good dreams. The Christmas appeal introduced ""Emily High Elk."" A year ago when her family brought her to the school, the letter says, ""(y)ou could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes."" Now, the letter goes on, ""her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed."" But again, ""Emily High Elk,"" is more than a pseudonym. The girl whose life is described in the letter does not exist. According to its financial statements, St. Joseph's Indian School raised more than $51 million last year from millions of Americans who donated because of those mailings. CNN began receiving complaints about mailings like this more than two years ago.   When asked about Josh Little Bear's letter, Kory Christianson, the director of development, wrote us that there was no such student. ""The name 'Josh Little Bear' is fictitious,"" he wrote, ""but unfortunately, his story is not."" The letter, he added, ""is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society.""   He said it wasn't the ""intention to disparage in any way the Native American community."" But some Native Americans say there is deliberate disparagement and that it's a marketing technique. A half-hour drive away from St. Joseph's is the Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, where its vice chairman, Leonard Pease, scoffed at the fundraising letter. ""That's how they get their money,"" he told CNN.  ""To me, they make the Indians look bad."" Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute that aims to strengthen and support Native communities, went further. He termed the fundraising letter and the admission that the child is nonexistent as ""poverty porn."" ""They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills,"" said Roberts, whose Colorado-based group represents six Native American nonprofit organizations. It seems that the money being raised is being used for the right reasons, as far as CNN could see. We were given a tour of the school but were not allowed to film. The complex, on the banks of the Missouri River, looks like a nice place and the children seemed happy, well-fed and well-housed. We tried unsuccessfully to interview the leadership of St. Joseph's.  The communications director, Jona Ohm, first invited us to meet the school president at the small museum operated by the school. The president, Mike Tyrell, acknowledged that the mailings ""push the edge"" of marketing and asking about them ""is a legitimate question.""  But Ohm told us to stop. ""You don't have permission to record in any way, shape or form,"" she said. According to its own financial statement for 2013, St. Joseph's has abundant assets. Cash on hand was listed at more than $122 million in June 2013, an increase of more than $18.5 million over the previous year.","St. Joseph's Indian School raises over $50 million annually from donations .

"Born in Brooklyn, Zachary Fisher got into the construction business at age 16. And he kept on building -- not just a business, but a reputation as one of America's most generous donors to troops and veterans. Fisher died in June 1999, but he and his family continue to have an impact through the Fisher House Foundation. This organization has stepped up, time and again, to help those who are serving or have served in the military. And it's doing so again -- for the family members of those who die while serving. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Wednesday that, sometime the day before, the Fisher House Foundation offered to make payments to relatives of fallen service members that have not been given out due to the partial government shutdown. The announcement came just after the U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously to resume paying survivor benefits, which includes a $100,000 payment. Until a congressional agreement is finalized, the foundation will guarantee survivors ""the full set of benefits they have been promised, including a $100,000 death gratuity payment,"" according to Hagel. Pentagon strikes deal with charity to pay military death benefits . Whenever the government fully reopens -- or if the governments acts, in some other way before then -- the foundation will be reimbursed. The nonprofit groups relies heavily on donations. It's offer to fill a breach is consistent with the organization's efforts for decades to do right by U.S. military families. Zachary Fisher never served in the military; a leg injury prevented him from enlisting in World War II, according to his official biography. Yet he helped the effort in other ways, including helping to build coastal fortifications. In the 1970s, he took his military-minded philanthropy to a new level. That includes, in 1978, helping save the Intrepid aircraft carrier and making it the focal point of a floating military museum off Manhattan along the Hudson River. Four years later, the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Armed Services Foundation was born. This group did what its modern-day incarnation is doing now: giving to those hurt in the line of duty, including victims of the 1983 bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut. The Fisher House program started in 1990, at which time its founder was 80 years old. It quickly grew into the Fisher family's biggest philanthropic effort yet, providing homes at bases and veterans affairs facilities around the United States and in Germany. According to its website, the organization has served more than 180,000 current and former military families since its inception -- including about 19,000 last year. Hospitals or military commanders decide who stay at the 62 Fisher Houses, which typically contain eight to 21 suites and can house 16 to 42 people at a time. Tenants remain for 10 days on average, though those injured in combat might stay for months. Wherever they're staying, for however long, the cost is the same: $0. The organization pays for all of it, estimating it has saved families (and the military) more than $200 million in lodging and transportation costs in the process. This and other efforts haven't gone unrecognized. Fisher also helped set up a child development center at Camp Pendleton, partnered with David Rockefeller to create the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research and supported other causes such as the Metropolitan Opera, United Jewish Appeal and George C. Marshall Foundation. Five presidents honored Fisher for his philanthropy, including Bill Clinton who awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998. Said then-Defense Secretary of Defense William Cohen one year later, after Fisher's death: ""His contributions will live on, and his legacy will be generations of gratitude from America's military community.""","New York developer Zachary Fisher was a prominent philanthropist .

"It's Friday the 13th, and a full moon is in the offing. Those might be dandy reasons to explain why a man drove his soft-top Mercedes coupe into CNN Center in downtown Atlanta early Friday, but police have a better reason: The driver was allegedly high. There were no injuries, Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee said in an e-mail. The driver, Gerlmy Javon Todd, 22, was traveling near the intersection where CNN's world headquarters is located ""when he left the roadway and struck the building"" at about 4:15 a.m. ET, Chafee said. It's tough to discern how. There are barricade poles and large, stone planters at the corner of the intersection. Marietta Street, which CNN Center faces, is lined with lightposts and shin-high metal barriers protecting the trees and plants along the sidewalk. Those barriers are unscathed. Even if Todd had driven down the sidewalk from the opposite side of the building, the sidewalk bottlenecks right before CNN Center. It's about 5½-feet wide at that point, so it's difficult to imagine how a car could have traversed it. Pressed on these details, Atlanta police said it had little information, not even the direction in which the car was traveling. ""While I don't have additional info at the moment I feel it is safe to say that the car was on the road at some point and then left it,"" Chafee wrote in a later e-mail. CNN's corporate security office declined to comment, and CNN's corporate communications office referred a reporter to Atlanta police, saying it had no information except that the driver traveled down the sidewalk before crashing into the building. Corporate security later said it was working on a statement. Chafee said police noticed the odor of marijuana in the car. Todd had marijuana in his possession and told police he had been smoking while driving, Chafee said. Todd also told police he had been driving all night and had fallen asleep at the wheel. Photographs from local media outlets showed a woman, described as an occupant of the vehicle, collecting boxes and other items, including a duffel bag, several shoeboxes and a flat-screen television, from the cabin and trunk of the moderately damaged car before it was towed away. The Benz has a Florida license plate. A reporter for CNN affiliate WGCL-TV in Atlanta asked the woman to provide details, to which she replied, ""Give me some money, I will,"" before insulting the reporter, turning her back to her and saying, ""Get out of my face."" The driver was taken into custody and is charged with driving under the influence ""less safe,"" reckless driving and possession of marijuana, Chafee said. A city jail official said Friday morning that Todd was being held at the Grady Memorial Hospital detention facility, though Chafee said in an e-mail both Todd and his passenger declined medical treatment. It was not immediately clear if Todd had retained a lawyer. By early afternoon, the area was cordoned off with yellow tape. A white wall stood in the gap between two revolving doors, where the roughly 10-foot-high, plate-glass window had been situated. Solar storms!  Full moon!  Must be Friday the 13th .","Police allege driver was high when he drove into CNN Center in downtown Atlanta .

"It's no secret that more and more people are speaking español in the United States, but what you probably didn't know is that in the future more of those Spanish speakers will not be Hispanic. That's right -- as immigrant families become more established here, future generations will follow the pattern of previous immigrants from Europe and Asia and stop using their native language. But at the same time, non-Latinos will be learning Spanish and helping their kids to grow up bilingual because they want to pass on what they learned in school, take advantage of business opportunities or even because they have a Spanish-speaking spouse. ""On the one hand, the number of Spanish speakers is projected to grow to about 40 million by 2020 (from 37 million in 2011.) This reflects Hispanic population growth and a large number of non-Hispanics who will also speak Spanish,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center. ""But, even though the number of Spanish speakers is projected to grow, among Hispanics, the share that speak Spanish is projected to fall from about 75% now to 66% in 2020,"" Lopez said. In a previous study, Pew found that third-generation Hispanics are more likely than immigrant Hispanics to be English-dominant. They say they watch television mostly in English and the same was true about music and thinking. 'Mama, would you please speak English!' In other words, third-generation Hispanics are not likely to speak Spanish at home, if at all. They are growing up in a world where speaking Spanish is not vital. Which is exactly the case for Darlene Freire-Geller's two youngest daughters, Emily, 9, and Hailey, 5, who live in New Jersey. ""When I had my first daughter, Ashley, my mother helped me take care of her and only spoke to her in Spanish so she's fluent,"" said the Cuban-American mom. ""But when I married my husband, who is white and only speaks English, teaching Emily and Hailey Spanish just didn't happen, it didn't seem necessary, plus, they didn't spend as much time with my mother like Ashley,"" she said. Freire-Geller, who is a second-generation American, knows Spanish but speaks English at work and at home. Her husband, Ira, only speaks English. Her daughters are part of the phenomenon that people born in the United States will make up more of the Hispanic population growth than new immigrants, with the rate of arrival of Spanish-speakers slowing significantly in recent years. Hispanics in the U.S. It's not just the attitude of parents that will affect who speaks Spanish, but also schools, argues Florida International University assistant professor of linguistics Phillip M. Carter. He said schools nationwide are set up to bring immigrant children and children of immigrants into ""the mainstream,"" which means turning them into monolingual English speakers. The attitude of most schools is that children will learn their heritage language at home and they cultivate identities that are rooted in speaking English. There are few schools that offer compressive bilingual education programs, such as two-way immersion programs, where students receive half of their education in each language, and that can create a loss, Carter said. ""Language is just as much about value, culture, identity, context, emotion, behavior and usage. Children learn in their school setting that the only language that really matters in this society is English,"" Carter explained. ""They therefore cultivate identities that are rooted in English speaking."" The changing face of America's youth . Carter conducted research in North Carolina, where the Latino population has grown 394%, from 76,726 in 1990 to 378,963 in 2000, according to the census, making it the state with the fastest growing Latino population in the country. ""In North Carolina right now, Spanish is a 'new' language where immigrant children experience shame for speaking Spanish, and many children pretend not to speak or even understand the language,"" said Carter, ""This is not in the third generation, but in what we call generation 1.5, the young children who come with their parents from abroad."" Carter said it is unlikely that these children will transmit Spanish to their own children, adding to the trend already being seen among more established immigrants. He adds that unless politicians stop linking Spanish to ""the ghetto,"" claiming that Mexicans don't ""assimilate,"" arguing the national anthem should not be sung in Spanish and that English is the ""language of the future,"" then Spanish will not have a future in the United States. But speaking Spanish appears to be thriving in new communities, with parents seeking out resources for their children to learn from. A guide to raising bilingual children . Roxana Soto, author of ""Bilingual is Better"" and co-founder of Spanglishbaby.com, says many of her readers are non-Latino parents who want their children to grow up bilingual. ""They are pushing for more dual language immersion schools where kids are immersed in Spanish from day one, ensuring they become bilingual and biliterate."" And, it's not only in children. Non-Latino professionals who work with Hispanics are also jumping on the Spanish-language wagon. ""I work in a high school where the majority of the kids are Hispanic; it only makes sense for me to learn Spanish. I don't need Italian; I need to learn Spanish,"" said guidance counselor Frank Gioia at Memorial High School in West New York, New Jersey. ""Spanish is the second-most popular language in the country. It's important that non-Latinos learn it as well as their kids,"" he said. Gioia's parents are second-generation Italians but only spoke English at home. ""And, with the way the country is changing, we will need Spanish to communicate with newcomers, business if involved with Latin America and even job opportunities. I know I want my kids to be multilingual,"" he said. Carter, the language researcher, sums it up: ""What is happening is simply a function of immigration, related as it is to the globalized economy, etc. ""As a linguist, the big story is that Spanish is being lost at the same time that new immigration continues to make the language a viable, visible and important language in the U.S."" Will Spanish in the U.S. thrive or decline? Share your thoughts in the comments.","Non-Latino Spanish speakers in the United States are on the rise, Pew finds .

"(CNN) -- NATO has released satellite photos that show the extent of Russia's military mobilization on its border with Ukraine -- including fighter jets, tanks, artillery and thousands of soldiers who are prepared to invade within 12 hours if called upon, say officials. The photos appear to confirm Western leaders' fears that Russia may be preparing for a ground invasion of eastern Ukraine, despite NATO's call for Russia to withdraw its forces from the border. What do the photos show? The photos, which private satellite imaging firm DigitalGlobe says it took between March 22 and April 2, purportedly reveal dozens of Russian ""fast jets,"" helicopters and infantry units that were not spotted in photos of the same areas last year. NATO estimates there are up to 40,000 troops massed at various locations along the Ukrainian border, and says it has spotted Russian forces at more than 100 different sites. The photos of military equipment and infantry personnel should be greater cause for concern than the ones of the fighter jets, according to experts who have examined the photos for CNN. The photos of tanks, artillery battalions, and infantry brigades near Novocherkassk -- just 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border -- show Russia's preparation for a potential invasion, says Igor Sutyagin, a research fellow for Russian studies at RUSI, a defense and security think tank. Another photo shows more than a dozen MI8 Hips or MI24 Hinds attack helicopters sitting in a sparse air field at Belgorod, a Russian facility just 40 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. ""Moving these helicopters closer to the operational area would make sense in the event of an invasion,"" Sutyagin says. Another photo purportedly shows a build-up of Russian Su-27 Flanker, Su-24 Fencer, and MiG-31 Foxhound fighter jets at the formerly vacant Buturlinovka air base, 150 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Sutyagin says the recent build-up of these jets in what appear to be sparsely resourced air fields doesn't make much sense from a strategic standpoint. ""The planes seem to be more about parade than about preparation,"" he says. ""Firstly, they're designed to fly hundreds of kilometers anyway, so moving them another 90 kilometers closer to the border won't make much difference."" He added: ""If the Russians do not have installations to service the planes, or utilize weapons storages, and if they're far from their permanent bases where their rear-support units are concentrated, they cannot be operationally effective for an invasion."" Why has NATO released the photos now? Are they exaggerating the threat? Keir Giles, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank, says there must be serious cause for alarm for NATO to have released the photos. ""You have to assume that there have been behind the scenes consultations between Russian and NATO, but obviously those have been limited in effectiveness for NATO to release this kind of imagery, which it would not normally do,"" Giles says. ""Should we trust NATO on this? Yes, because it has no interest whatsoever in exacerbating the situation. This is a crisis which they're trying to play down wherever possible and make it clear it's not involved."" Giles also says that the Russian military officers he regularly speaks with have suddenly gone silent. ""One possible explanation is that they've been told to curtail contact with foreigners,"" he says. ""And if that is the reason, whenever that's happened in the past, it has not been a good sign."" What is Russia saying about the photos? A Russian military official told Russia Today that the photos were taken in August of last year during military drills -- a claim NATO called ""categorically false"" in a statement Friday. ""This is a force that's very capable at high readiness,"" British Army Brigadier Gary Deakin said at a briefing at NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium on Thursday. ""And as we've illustrated through the imagery, it's close to routes and lines of communications and it has the resources to be able to move quickly into Ukraine if it was ordered to do so."" Could Russia really invade Ukraine in 12 hours? While many of the Russian troops are 50 kilometers or more from Ukraine's border, some are just 6-7 kilometers away, according to RUSI's Sutyagin. ""In one hour some of these troops could be on the Ukrainian side, though for others it will take longer,"" he says. One of key aims of the Russian military transformation effort since 2008, according to Chatham House's Keir Giles, was to create ""permanent readiness units"" that need just an hour to move if required. ""What we're seeing on the border doesn't necessarily mean Russia is preparing to invade,"" he says, ""but it would seem to mean that Russia wishes to be fully prepared to launch an invasion if Vladimir Putin sees that it's necessary."" What is NATO saying by releasing the photos? Sutyagin says NATO is trying to show the Kremlin that even the slightest move now will provoke a disproportionally severe reaction. ""NATO is telling Russia: 'Look, we are serious and we mean business. We're not going to keep silent over any of your moves, so you better just pull back.'""","NATO releases satellite photos purportedly showing Russian military buildup near Ukraine .

"(CNN)At the Church of the Corvette, it's the Day After. The doors of the National Corvette Museum opened as usual Thursday morning in Bowling Green, Kentucky, but this day is not going to be typical. When a historically giant sinkhole suddenly appears inside one of the world's sanctuaries of uber-cool cars as it did Wednesday, it changes the mental landscape a bit. A 40-foot-wide, 20-to-30-foot deep chasm tends to shake you up, say folks who've seen the hole with their own eyes. No one was hurt, but the mood in the museum is somber. They're a bit less shaken than they were Wednesday, when the sinkhole swallowed eight priceless Corvettes inside a part of the museum called the Sky Dome. ""We've been given an OK and everything is safe,"" said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. About a dozen visitors were exploring the place Thursday morning, she said, but the Sky Dome remains closed indefinitely. Nature's disturbance of this holy site started a wave of concern across the Corvette Nation that continued to ripple around the web Thursday. ""Who could fathom such a thing?"" asked CNN commenter 440sixpack.  ""I don't live anywhere near this sort of geological risk, but still I'm tempted to arrange for a sub-surface analysis under my own garage just so I can still sleep good."" Fans at Supercompressor.com asked the question: Why couldn't this ""have happened to a Yugo museum instead?"" 'Vette fans have been stepping forward to help. Auto parts store owner Chuck Tamraz told reporters he's volunteering to find any replacement parts to restore the cars. SWALLOWED BY THE SINKHOLE . -- a 1962 ""Black Corvette"" -- a 1984 PPG pace car . -- a 2009 ZR1 ""Blue Devil"" -- the 1992 white ""1 Millionth Corvette"" -- a 1993 ruby red ""40th Anniversary Corvette"" -- a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette . -- the 2009 white ""1.5 Millionth Corvette"" -- a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder . Source: National Corvette Museum . So, what the hell happened? How could a gaping hole just appear in such a wrong place? Keep in mind that this is cave country. Western Kentucky is the home of Mammoth Cave National Park, the largest known cave system in the world. Sinkholes pop up constantly in these parts, usually caused by ground water eroding underground limestone over many years, forming a void underneath the surface of the earth. Eventually, the soil that was above the dissolving limestone has nothing to support it anymore, and it collapses. ""Right now, the ground at the museum seems like it's pretty stable,"" said Western Kentucky University geologist Jason Polk. Experts have assessed and inspected the entire building using ground monitoring equipment. Engineer Matthew Dettman, a 22-year professor at WKU, said sinkholes rarely form in clusters. ""The likelihood that another is going to drop out is possible, but unlikely."" ""The contractor in charge will certainly want to do some investigation to verify that we don't have any other issues in the building that we know of,"" Dettman said. That contractor, Mike Murphy of Scott, Murphy and Daniel Construction, acknowledged that his business runs across at least one of these sinkhole situations every month. ""The only difference is this one swallowed eight collector Corvettes,"" he said. ""But it is repairable."" He assured reporters Thursday the building was ""in good condition, and the foundation and structure is in good condition."" But the cars. Those sweet cars. Oh, the humanity! Some of them, Dettman said, are buried so deep in the hole that they can't be seen from the surface. ""It's fascinating, and sad,"" he said Thursday morning on the phone. But ""the timing could have been a lot worse,"" Dettman said. Amazing closed circuit security video shows the hole opening up early Wednesday morning before the museum was scheduled to open. ""There are times where there are so many people in that room, you can't even move around."" Some of the museum workers were busy washing the cars that survived the sinkhole. ""I can't say we've ever had to clear concrete dust off of our cars before,"" Frassinelli said. ""They have to be really careful."" Polk, who spent most of Wednesday at the sinkhole site, said ""the whole experience was surreal,"" adding that ""it was definitely lucky for the people -- not so much for the Corvettes."" By the way, for the record, he says he's a 'Vette fan -- but he drives a Toyota. For right now, Dettman says the risk is extremely minimal. The Sky Dome has been closed to the public, while visitors will be able to tour the rest of the facility.  Another stroke of luck: the dome's round shape makes it less likely to collapse on itself, Dettman said. But about 10% of the concrete footing supporting the structure's signature red spire, which shoots high over the museum, has been ""undermined"" somewhat. ""We do have to shore it up even though part of it is bearing on bedrock,"" he explained. The Sky Dome has a long road to recovery. It will take at least four to six days to pull the Corvettes out of the chasm, and then construction crews will begin filling in the hole, Murphy said. Timing may have been good for the Sky Dome, but it was bad on another level. The sinkhole comes as the museum prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary this August. Big doings are in the works, including the grand opening of a new nearby MotorSports Park, where sinkholes were found and dealt with during construction. ""Sinkholes are so common here that I would have been shocked if they hadn't found any,"" Dettman said. But museum executive director Wendell Strode said the Sky Dome will reopen in time for the festivities. ""August is our target date,"" he said. How do you fix a sinkhole? You can fill it in with dirt or other types of material. Or sometimes, it's impossible to fix, and the location has to be abandoned. It depends on the situation, said Polk. Discussions about how to proceed with the museum sinkhole are expected to continue Thursday, and there's no firm plan yet. No one really knows how long it will be before we know if the Sky Dome will survive this attack by Mother Nature. Hopefully, said Polk, ""the sooner the better."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","It will take up to six days to pull the Corvettes out of the chasm, an expert says .

"(CNN) -- The head of the U.S. Coast Guard and a congressman planned to travel to the Coast Guard Academy on Thursday to speak to cadets about the discovery this summer of two small hangman's nooses on Coast Guard properties. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen, seen in a file photo, planned to address cadets on Thursday. ""These are going to be our future leaders. The last thing you want are your leaders not being tolerant,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told CNN before heading for the academy with Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen. A 6-inch string tied as a noose was found in an African-American cadet's sea bag in July while he was serving aboard the historic tall ship Eagle. And during race-relations training in August -- set up in response to the first incident -- a white female civil rights instructor found a small noose in her office at the academy in New London, Connecticut. Initial investigations failed to discover who was responsible. Last week, after the incidents became public, academy superintendent Rear Adm. J. Scott Burhoe ordered the Coast Guard Investigative Service to investigate further. People found to be involved could be prosecuted under military law, he said in a written statement. An academy spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer David French, said Burhoe is expanding race relations training to all staff members at the academy, and has contacted the community and the NAACP for assistance. Cummings said he would have a message for the cadets when he addressed them on Thursday. ""I want to say to them that they should not tolerate it amongst themselves, because they will be judged by their weakest link,"" he said.  ""So far we haven't found out who did this, but I think they can help us find this person."" The noose incidents were first reported last week in The Day newspaper in New London. The reports came amid a rash of incidents around the country involving nooses and their grim symbolism. The so-called ""Jena 6"" case began about a year ago when white students in a small Louisiana town hung nooses from a schoolyard tree after black students sat under it. Last month, two teenagers were arrested in nearby Alexandria, Louisiana, after driving through town with nooses hanging from their pickup truck, the night after a protest march brought thousands of demonstrators to Jena. In Hempstead, Long Island, a suburb of New York, a noose was found Friday hanging in the locker room at a police station.  Community leaders called for an investigation into that incident. ""The noose, to African Americans, is a symbol of hatred and it takes us back to the times when African-American people were being hung from trees for no reason at all,"" Cummings said.  ""And so it's a very offensive kind of thing."" The Coast Guard Academy has about 980 cadets, about 14 percent of whom are minorities. African Americans make up about 4 percent of the corps.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- Jon Petrovich greenlighted funding for CNN.com in 1994 and became known as its ""Godfather,"" a title he relished as the site became the most-read news site in the world. Petrovich, a former CNN executive, died Thursday in New York after a battle with cancer and diabetes. He would have turned 64 at the end of this month. ""Jon was a big presence at our company and in the media industry,"" Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide, said in an e-mail sent to CNN staff. ""He was a builder, an innovator and a journalist, first and last."" Petrovich was known for his impeccable tailored suits, his optimistic outlook on life and solid news judgment. He hobnobbed with the likes of Ted Turner. He just as easily struck up conversations with interns, entry-level staffers and the rank-and-file. ""He was just a good boss. He didn't interfere when you wanted to do something that hadn't been tried before,"" said Al Schrack, a Headline News producer in the late 1980s and who remains a producer at HLN. ""He had confidence in his team enough to allow the producers in the newsroom to be creative and come up with innovative shows. He was always open to new ideas."" Scott Woelfel, the original editor-in-chief of CNN Interactive, said he was in need of funding for the online division after a business plan was drawn up in 1994. At the time, CNN.com had yet to launch. ""We didn't think we could set it up as an independent division of CNN then,"" Woelfel said in an e-mail message. ""So we went to Jon to see if we could get it funded under Headline News. ""Even though this clearly was not an area he was familiar with, he had confidence in us and took on the big responsibility of being financially responsible for us in the early years. Who would have thought an 'old news' guy like him would have stepped up like that? We all owe him a lot."" It was Woelfel who gave Petrovich his nickname. ""I have called him the Godfather many times, and he always liked that."" Petrovich was brought in by Turner in the mid-1980s to run Headline News, said former CNN President Tom Johnson. Along the way, he helped create niche channels like the Airport Network and CNN en Español. ""In so many ways, Jon Petrovich was the chief innovation executive at CNN,""  Johnson said. ""With a terrific staff, he helped to create so many of the new services of the news group. CNN.com was only one of his historic innovations."" He spent 15 years at CNN, where he became an executive vice president. Before joining the network, he worked his way through the ranks of local stations. He was a reporter in Louisville, Kentucky, earned his stripes on an assignment desk in Detroit and got his taste of news directing in Baltimore. After leaving CNN in 2000, he continued to excel. He oversaw international networks for Sony Television and became the head of U.S. broadcast operations for The Associated Press in 2007. He also was a professor for the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. A man of humble roots in Gary, Indiana, Petrovich loved food and fine dining. Most of all, he was a family man known to boast about his two children around his colleagues -- and more recently, dote on his grandchildren. He leaves behind his wife, Karen, who was his high school sweetheart; and two grown children, Kristin and Jonathan. ""He once told me, 'If I die tomorrow, I'm OK with that. I've been blessed. I've seen the world and have a great family,' "" his nephew Ron Petrovich said in an online message. CNN's Walton added, ""Jon helped lay CNN's foundation and he leaves a great many friends here.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday signed a law extending the presidential term, the Kremlin said, in a move many observers believe is designed to bring former president Vladimir Putin back to the nation's top office. Some experts believe Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remains Russia's real leader. Medvedev, Putin's hand-picked successor, proposed the changes in November, starting with the next president. The new law extends the term of the president from four years to six. Medvedev also signed a law extending the term of members of the lower house of parliament, the Duma, from four years to five. Putin stepped down as president in May after two terms and is now prime minister. Earlier this month, Putin shrugged off the suggestion that Medvedev would step down to make way for his return when the law passes. ""The next election is in 2012,"" he said December 4, according to the Interfax news agency. But his comments came after a three-hour televised question-and-answer session with the Russian public which reinforced some experts' view he remained the country's real leader. Putin has done call-in programs each year since 2001, but this was his first one as prime minister, rather than president. Putin remaining in the chair this year, rather than yielding it to Medvedev, showed he still runs Russia, said analyst Yevgeny Volk, the director of the Moscow office of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative U.S.-based think tank. Tuesday, Medvedev also signed a law giving the Duma more powers over the Russian government. The Duma may now consider annual performance reports issued by the government. CNN's Mike Sefanov contributed to this report.","Many believe change is designed to bring former President Vladimir Putin back .

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization raised the swine flu alert Thursday to its highest level, saying the H1N1 virus has spread to enough countries to be considered a global pandemic. Kindergarten students, some wearing masks, attend school in a residential estate in Hong Kong on Thursday. Increasing the alert to Phase 6 does not mean that the disease is deadlier or more dangerous than before, just that it has spread to more countries, the WHO said. ""This is an important and challenging day for all of us,"" WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a briefing with reporters. ""We are moving into the early days of the first flu pandemic of the 21st century."" The last previous pandemic occurred in 1968. As of Thursday, the virus had spread to 74 countries, the health agency said. There were 28,774 confirmed cases and 144 deaths. The United States had 13,217 cases and 27 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said June 5 in its weekly update. Cases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  See where H1N1 flu cases are in the U.S. » . The U.S. death toll is expected be higher when the CDC releases its latest figures Friday, said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. New England -- particularly Massachusetts -- and the New York and New Jersey areas have been hit the hardest, Schuchat said Thursday at a CDC news conference. The Phase 6 pandemic designation had been widely expected for weeks. ""Further spread is considered inevitable,"" Chan said at a news conference at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. ""The scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met."" The announcement came after a meeting of the WHO's Emergency Committee, which has debated since April whether the spread of a novel H1N1 flu virus was fast and widespread enough to warrant a Phase 6 designation. Phase 6, Chan said, is meant as a signal to countries to recalibrate their strategies to minimize the harm from swine flu. In countries where the virus and the response to it are already widespread, it is not likely to mean significant changes, but Chan urged countries that have not seen cases, or seen only limited cases, to get ready. ""The virus is not stoppable,"" she said. ""I would advise them to maintain vigilance, enhance surveillance and be prepared for the arrival of the novel H1N1 in their country."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security said those agencies have been acting for weeks as if Phase 6 were already in effect and no additional measures would be put into effect. The United States declared a public health emergency April 26. ""WHO continues to recommend no restriction on travel and on border closures,"" Chan said. Discussions about shifting to Phase 6 have been under way for weeks. Chan indicated that a major factor in the decision was surveillance from countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way. In Chile and Australia, two countries with many flu cases, she said H1N1 appears to be the dominant strain, ""crowding out"" the seasonal influenza virus. Chan said she would recommend that vaccine manufacturers proceed with mass production of an inoculation against the new swine flu strain as soon as they finish production of seasonal vaccine, which she estimated would be complete in about two weeks. HHS spokesman Bill Hall said Thursday that no decision has been made on full-scale production because there is no need yet to make that decision. It is a step-by-step process that is moving forward. ""We're doing as much as we can now,"" he said. The agency awarded a contract several weeks ago to five manufacturers to develop an H1N1 antigen. The companies are producing pilot lots. Clinical testing will take place over the summer, Hall said. At the end of the summer, HHS will decide whether to go into production. ""There's no specific date on the calendar,"" Hall said. If officials decide to produce a vaccine, the first doses would be ready early in the fall. Hall noted that even full-scale production doesn't mean there will be an immunization campaign. Federal officials may have a vaccine and decide not to use it, he said. Also Thursday, authorities in Hong Kong ordered the closure of all elementary schools, kindergartens and day care centers in the city after 12 students were found to be infected with the virus. Authorities have not determined the source of the infection, said Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang. This makes it the first cluster of swine flu cases in the city without a link to someone who had traveled overseas. The schools and day care centers were told to close for 14 days as investigators tried to identify the source of the infection, said Tsang, the chief executive. The health department will decide after two weeks whether to continue the shutdown. Also on Thursday, Israel's health ministry announced that the number of people diagnosed with swine flu there was 68. Health officials use the virus' clinical name -- H1N1 -- to reflect that it's actually a combination of several different types of flu and to reduce confusion about whether eating pork can spread the virus. It cannot. CNN's David S. Martin, Roya Shadravan in Hong Kong, and Michal Zippori in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","Further spread of swine flu inevitable, World Health Organization says .

"By sheer volume, one might assume that letters for Santa Claus were accidentally rerouted to P.O. Box 162 in Fountain Green, Utah. But all the letters, notes and cards coming in are addressed to 6-year-old  Addie Fausett. ""Thank you for my cards,"" Addie told a postal worker on a recent trip to pick up her bounty of seasons greetings. In the small town of just more than 1,000 residents, her letters have outnumbered the population. Addie made the mailing lists of thousands of strangers around the world after her family asked the public to give her a lifetime of Christmas cards after a gloomy prognosis: A mysterious condition will probably cut her young life short, doctors have told the family. This year, the Fausetts were told this would probably be Addie's last Christmas. Although her condition remains undiagnosed, she suffers from cerebral atrophy, which has severely affected her speech and motor skills.  According to her mother, at age 3, Addie just stopped growing; at 6, she weighs only 23 pounds. ""She likes to laugh and have a good time and hear stories, but lately she has had a lot of days she will just cry all day long,"" Tami Fausett, Addie's mother, told CNN affiliate KSL. As the handwritten letters pour in, Addie's family hopes they will spark a little Christmas cheer during the tough times. They've created the Facebook page for ""Little Addie"" to update followers with pictures of Addie opening letters and celebrating Christmas. ""She doesn't get to play with kids, so we thought if everyone sent her a card, we could tell all her they were all her friends, and it would just help make her Christmas a little bit better,"" Fausett said. Amber Brosig, managing trustee of the charity Children and the Earth, said Addie's family never fathomed such an amazing response with the letters. The charity has been helping the family with medical costs. Addie is appreciative of the kind words that have been flooding in, and she had a message for KSL's camera: ""Merry Christmas."" ""There's no other way to describe her other than she's an absolute sweet soul,"" Brosig told CNN.","Strangers from around the world are sending holiday cards to 6-year-old Addie Fausett .

"Let's start with a touch of perspective. It's not only Russia where sexual minorities suffer discrimination. In the United States, that beacon of tolerance, there's still a huge amount of bigotry. Some U.S. states still refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. And hate crimes and violence towards LGBT individuals remain a significant problem. Russia does not have a monopoly on intolerance. However, there is a key difference. In the U.S., officials go to great lengths to espouse tolerant views and behavior. Laws have been passed, and are enforced, protecting LGBT rights. Hate crimes are prosecuted. In Russia, that is rarely the case. That's not just my view, it's the opinion of Human Rights' Watch, a New York-based rights group. In their latest report on Russia, titled License to Harm, HRW finds the Russian authorities have not only ""failed in their obligation to prevent and prosecute homophobic violence,"" but have also ""effectively legalized discrimination against LGBT people and cast them as second class citizens."" The controversial measure the report singles out is, of course, Russia's ""anti-gay propaganda"" legislation. The law bans ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors"" and was, according to HRW, one of several anti-LGBT measures adopted or proposed in 2013. In their report, HRW says the law doesn't actually protect anyone, but does give homophobes a reason to believe LGBT lives matter less to the Russian government. The report goes on to document various horrific instances of violence and abuse against Russia's LGBT community, including by radical nationalist groups luring gay men on the pretext of a fake date. It makes grim reading. During the Soviet Union, homosexuality was a crime punishable by prison and hard labor. Homosexuals were regarded as pedophiles or fascists, outside normal society. Laws explicitly banning homosexuality were lifted in 1993, after the Soviet collapse -- though there was no amnesty for those jailed for sodomy -- but the attitude appears to have stuck. Even today, LGBT activists in Russia  -- like the couple I met in St. Petersburg recently -- are regarded as outsiders, sometimes agents of the liberal West, to be distrusted. The Saint Petersburg lawmaker behind the controversial ""propaganda"" law, Vitaly Milonov, underlined this when he told me that any Russians who want a same-sex marriage should move to the West ""where they belong."" That's a potent connection in these times of growing tensions between Russia and the West. Linking Russia's LGBT community with the enemy taps into old fears of corrupt outsiders polluting Russian purity, and bodes extremely badly for hopes that discrimination in Russia will be tackled.","CNN's Matthew Chance: It's not only Russia where sexual minorities suffer discrimination .

"It's been a long journey for Richard III, the 15th century king whose skeleton was found under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester. But on Friday, his final destination became clear. The medieval monarch will be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, just a stone's throw away from where his remains were uncovered. The discovery of his remains, complete with curved spine and staved-in skull, in the summer of 2012 sparked global headlines and a new battle -- over which city would host his remains in perpetuity. Archaeologists had been searching the site for Leicester's long-lost Greyfriars Friaryhad and always planned for any bodies they uncovered to be reburied at the city's cathedral. That was challenged in the courts by a group calling itself the Plantagenet Alliance, which argued it was the medieval king's wish to be buried in the historic northern city of York -- the city they claim was closest to his heart. But judges at the Royal Courts of Justice ruled Friday that his funeral should be held in Leicester as originally planned. Their ruling notes that since Richard's exhumation, ""passions have been roused and much ink has been spilt"" as rival camps fought to stake their claim. Now, they say, ""We agree that it is time for Richard III to be given a dignified reburial, and finally laid to rest."" The University of Leicester, which was behind the excavation project, celebrated the outcome on Twitter. ""Richard III will be reinterred in Leicester. Great news for the University, our city and everybody involved in the discovery,"" it said. 'Horrific death' In bringing its case, the Alliance objected to the lack of consultation over where the newly-rediscovered monarch's bones should be laid to rest, saying more thought should have been given to the question. On its website, the Alliance -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to Richard III, and headed by Stephen Nicolay, his 16th great nephew -- set out its argument to have him reburied in York. ""We believe that the proposed location of Leicester is wholly inappropriate for the burial of King Richard III, who had no connections with the town beyond his horrific death, bodily despoliation and appalling burial in a foreshortened grave,"" it said. ""As people who have died in a foreign place are 'brought home,' so too King Richard should be brought to a place with which he had every possible connection and affection."" Richard III lost his life in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- the last king of England to die on the battlefield and the last monarch from the House of York. Until his remains were found, the monarch was best known to modern Britons as the hunchbacked Shakespearean villain accused of murdering his nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower,"" to usurp the throne. That notorious history may make the battle over his reburial site appear all the more unlikely. But both sides insisted they have a strong claim to his remains. Now Leicester could see a significant commercial benefit, if tourists flock to see his final resting place. The city already has plans for a new tomb in the cathedral, where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last Plantagenet king, and for a visitor center on the site of the Greyfriars car park, telling the story of Richard's life, his death, and his rediscovery. In a statement, Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby said: ""I am delighted that Leicester Cathedral can now proceed with its plans to give King Richard lll a dignified reburial here in the city. ""With the support of the city council and the University of Leicester, the cathedral is now planning for the king's reinterment to take place in the spring of next year.""

"Real Madrid's Spanish title defense lurched to a new low on Saturday, as Kaka was sent off in a 0-0 draw at bottom club Osasuna. The result means Jose Mourinho's third-placed team could fall 18 points behind Barcelona if the La Liga leaders win at Malaga on Sunday, while city rivals Atletico Madrid can move seven clear of Real by beating Zaragoza. With top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo ending a run of 60 consecutive league appearances due to suspension, Real looked woefully short of attacking ideas despite the return of striker Gonzalo Higuain. Kaka came on for winger Angel Di Maria just before an hour was played, but the 2007 world player of the year was booked twice within 18 minutes to leave his side a man short. The Brazilian's first yellow card came for jumping with an arm raised and the second was for stopping the home players taking a quick free-kick, resulting in his first red for Real since signing from AC Milan for a reported $100 million in 2009. Mourinho also brought on striker Karim Benzema and Mesut Ozil for Higuain and Luka Modric, but Real's best chance was ruled out for offside. Los Blancos have now won only six of the last 12 matches in all competitions, and Mourinho's future at the nine-time European titleholders may hinge on next month's Champions League last-16 clash with Ronaldo's former club Manchester United. His team have already lost seven times this season -- two more defeats than the whole of the 2011-12 campaign -- and all of them have been away from home. ""I liked the team's attitude, I have no criticism. Lots of players had great matches, like Albiol and Coentrao, who haven't played for a while and they performed very well in a very demanding match,"" said Mourinho, who was also without suspended defender Sergio Ramos. ""I never talk about the missing players. We have had players injured for a month or two and I've never talked about them. We also have players suspended and I have not used that as an excuse."" However, he hinted that his players were struggling to deal with the big points deficit they face in the title race. ""The explanation begins on the first match day and since then things have happened that I do not want to talk about,"" said Mourinho. ""After that, when the gap is big, one team plays without pressure and the other one feels like that they can't close the gap and there are motivational issues."" Iker Casillas retained his place in goal, having been handed a second chance alter an injury to his replacement Adan, but Mourinho would not guarantee that the Spain captain would stay in the team for Tuesday's Spanish Cup quarterfinal first leg against Valencia. ""He hardly touched the ball against Osasuna, but it can be said that in these two matches the team has been good defensively and he has been part of the team's defensive play. It is too early to say whether he will play against Valencia."" Valencia moved up to seventh in the table after beating Sevilla 2-0, with both goals coming from Spain striker Roberto Soldado. Soldado netted twice from corners to take his tally to 11 in La Liga this season to put his team above Levante on goal difference, while Sevilla stayed 12th. Earlier, Espanyol moved out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at home to Celta Vigo, as Sergio Garcia scored a first-half winner. Real Mallorca stayed just above the bottom three after a 3-1 defeat at mid-table Valladolid, whose German winger Patrick Ebert celebrated his return from injury with two goals. In Italy, Inter Milan moved up to third place with a 2-0 win at home to lowly Pescara. Argentine forward Rodrigo Palacio scored in the first half and then set up Colombian Freddy Guarin nine minutes after halftime to leave Inter six points behind leaders Juventus, who host mid-table Atalanta on Sunday. Bologna moved five points clear of the relegation zone with a 4-0 win at home to Chievo, as former Italy striker Alberto Gilardino scored twice.","Brazil midfielder Kaka sent off in Real Madrid's 0-0 draw with bottom Spanish club Osasuna .

"(CNN) -- They have barely met, lead lives a world apart and did not speak for two years. But Emma Lundell has made Mikaela Shiffrin cry, and Shiffrin has given Lundell hope. Lundell is a 13-year-old Swedish girl. Shiffrin is an Olympic champion ski racer, one of the finest the United States has ever produced. The story begins in Ã…re, Sweden, in December 2012. A night slalom, under the lights, five days before Christmas. Shiffrin, then 17 years old, raced to her first-ever World Cup victory that night. In the whirlwind of celebrations, interviews and emotion that followed, she would have every reason to forget the details. Lundell was also having the night of her life in Ã…re. Profoundly sick with leukemia, the 11-year-old had been brought to the race by a charity looking to give her a break from chemotherapy. At the end of the night, Lundell had the chance to attend Shiffrin's post-race press conference. ""I remember it really well,"" says Shiffrin, two years on. ""My first World Cup win was such a special time for me. I remember doing the press conference, doing the award ceremony, and then immediately meeting Emma. ""I remember seeing her in her cute little hat. She was so small. Every little detail of that meeting is so clear."" A seriously ill, young skiing fan thrust into the heart of the action, Lundell gingerly waited until most people had left before summoning the courage to ask Shiffrin for a picture. ""Her mother offered to take the photo so my whole family could be in the picture. I told Mikaela that I had cancer, and she was interested and understanding. She was so humble,"" says Lundell. Shiffrin's mother, Eileen, had just seen Mikaela become the second-youngest American woman ever to win a World Cup. Her teenage daughter was now a bona fide skiing sensation. ""There was so much commotion going on,"" says Eileen. ""But this was one of those things that just stops you in your tracks. This poor mom, she had tears in her eyes. And when she told me that Emma was going to be undergoing treatment for cancer, I just-about died. ""We were walking away when Mikaela said, 'Oh, I should give my winners' bouquet to Emma.' So she ran back to find her and that was when the mom just broke down and started crying. I can't even imagine being in that boat."" ""My heart melted and I couldn't stop the tears,"" Emma's mother, Annika, says now. ""I looked at Mikaela and I looked at her mother, and I was just happy. So happy. And proud."" 'Thinking the worst' On January 24, 2011, Annika had received unthinkable news: both her husband and her daughter had cancer. The diagnoses came on the same morning. Emma had leukemia and her father, Mikael, had a brain tumor that was growing again. He had been fighting it since 2003. ""It was horrible. The two people you love most in the world,"" says Annika, 40. Mikael's tumor is now inoperable. The 41-year-old, a former Alpine skier, had been the initial inspiration for daughter Emma's love of the sport. When she met Shiffrin, she came away with a new hero. ""It meant the world to me,"" says Emma, speaking perfect English. ""It meant so much. It was so generous of her, and she was so good-hearted. It was a short meeting but it will stay in my mind and my heart forever."" ""Meeting Emma really resonated with me,"" says Shiffrin. ""But as time went by, both my mom and I were honestly thinking -- you know -- what's the worst that can happen, essentially. Maybe she's not around any more. ""Which is obviously pretty morbid. You're thinking of the worst."" Almost two years later, Shiffrin has become an Olympic champion and one of the most recognizable faces in skiing. In October 2014, Shiffrin is nearing the end of a punishing interview schedule -- fighting back jet-lag in the Austrian Alps -- when a journalist from Expressen, a Swedish newspaper, asks her to watch a video on his laptop. There is Emma. Healthy, happy Emma, with a video message for her idol (it had been the newspaper's idea). Shiffrin gasps as the teenager begins to talk. ""You gave me the energy to carry on,"" Emma tells her in the message, ""to keep fighting to beat the cancer. ""Today, I'm not on chemotherapy any more. I'm much better. I got my hair back and I'm feeling stronger, day by day."" Eye-opening experience . Shiffrin is wiping away tears as the video finishes. Eileen Shiffrin, who was in the room when Mikaela saw the message, could not believe the transformation in the girl they had met two years earlier. ""She looked amazing,"" says Eileen. ""She looked so different. She had no hair when we saw her. She was definitely smaller and younger, paler and thinner -- much thinner. ""So to see her looking so filled-out and rosy-cheeked, with gorgeous, long blonde hair... I mean, she was beautiful. And well-spoken, unbelievable."" A month after seeing that message, Mikaela Shiffrin tells CNN: ""That video brought so many emotions to the surface that I didn't even know I was feeling up until that point. ""One of my very best friends, growing up, was diagnosed with cancer when we were both 14. ""It was two years of harsh treatments, complications from the treatments, and then the past couple years he's been healthy -- but you would never wish that on anybody, especially not as young as Emma or my friend. ""That young, there's a certain innocence that is immediately taken away when you're diagnosed with something like cancer. That innocence is supposed to be there a little while longer."" Shiffrin acknowledges she has an important role to play in how she, as a prominent athlete, addresses cancer and supports victims. It is not something she had considered, growing up with only ski racing on her mind. Yet since that first World Cup win in 2012, she has met and reached out to a number of other children with cancer. ""I wanted to race the World Cup, I loved ski racing and I wanted to be the best in the world. And that was it,"" she says. ""I didn't even think about the media, and TV, and interviews. That you have to have that side of the sport, in order for it to be a sport. ""In order for me to actually see World Cup racing when I was five, my favorite athletes had to go through the whole media round that I'm doing now. ""Especially in the past couple years, I've gotten more used to this side of things -- having fans, having young kids out there who think I'm their idol. ""Sometimes it feels like an obligation, more like a burden, and then I get these eye-opening experiences like meeting Emma -- then more than two years later, getting that message. I'm very lucky. ""It seems like every year or two, something happens to me that brings me back down to earth, and I shouldn't be the girl that doesn't have time for this."" Emma Lundell's battle goes on: the chemotherapy is over but she will not get the all-clear for four more years. Doctors say her father will never be healthy again. ""The chemo was hard and I have lost friends I left in hospital,"" says the 13-year-old. ""I have seen friends die. ""Today, I feel much better. I'm getting stronger. I'm happy to have my hair back, and I'm training my fitness to return to normal life and the ski tracks again. ""Mikaela means so much to me. She cared about me, a little girl from a small town in Sweden, and my fight."" Her mother, Annika, says: ""For us, a superstar saw our little daughter and even remembered her, two years later. It's incredible.""","Olympic ski champion Mikaela Shiffrin forms bond with Swedish girl .

"What a week it's been for Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman who initially faced a death sentence after refusing to renounce her faith. She thought she was finally free Monday after a higher court ordered her release. A day later, she was back in police custody. Now she faces a new charge, accused of falsifying travel documents, and has taken refuge in a safe house in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, amid concerns for her security. In a phone interview with CNN, Ibrahim spoke of the ordeal of giving birth while in prison, her fears for her family and how she is facing a future full of unknowns. Asked how she felt in prison, refused access to a hospital as the birth of her child neared, Ibrahim said, ""I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was mostly scared of giving birth in prison."" The 27-year-old had reason to be alarmed. ""I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn't open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn't attached to the table,"" she said. Doctors fear that the circumstances of the baby's birth may have lasting consequences. ""I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not,"" said Ibrahim. She her husband, American Daniel Wani, were freed from custody Thursday after having been detained two days earlier upon arriving at the airport in Khartoum. They were trying to fly with their baby and toddler son to the United States. Now they are waiting to see what happens in light of the latest allegations against Ibrahim, of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information. ""I'm currently in a safe place. It's definitely safe but not comfortable,"" Ibrahim said. Sudanese Christian woman is in U.S. Embassy in Sudan . Persecuted as a 'nonbeliever' Ibrahim's ordeal started when one of her relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. She was also charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. Convicted while about eight months pregnant, she gave birth about two weeks later in a women's hospital in Khartoum. She insists she has never been a Muslim -- and says she was persecuted as a Christian while in prison. ""I've always been Christian. I couldn't have been Muslim with the things they say and the way they treat me -- with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things, like 'don't eat the nonbeliever's food' and calling me a Christian,"" she said. ""There was all this talk and even the officers in the prison would join (in)."" A string of people, from politicians to humanitarian workers to lawmakers, came to visit while she was locked up with promises to help, she said, but none offered any real assistance. Eventually, following weeks of international controversy over her conviction for apostasy and adultery, it was overturned. Ibrahim: My paperwork was '100% correct' Now, the Sudanese authorities have accused Ibrahim of trying to leave without the correct paperwork. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. But she is adamant that she ""never forged any papers"" and was entitled to travel on the documents she had. ""How can my paperwork be wrong? My paperwork came from the embassy. It's 100% correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador,"" she said. ""The South Sudanese embassy took responsibility and released the papers. It's in my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen. He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport."" Ibrahim had also been given a U.S. visa. She described as ""terrorizing"" the way that Sudanese police officers took her and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, from the VIP departures hall as they waited to check in for their flight. ""We were scared and wondering what was wrong. They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was,"" she said. She claims that the charges were filed in court before the police even investigated the claims against her and her husband. When they finally figured out what the alleged offense was, she was shocked, Ibrahim said. ""I can't even decide what I should do right now. I want to travel but at the same time I don't want to travel. But the state I'm in right now means that I'm forced to. There's a new problem every day about me leaving."" Asked if the authorities were trying to make life difficult for her, Ibrahim replied, ""I don't know what their problem is."" Faith in her husband . Ibrahim simply hopes that she can leave, together with her husband and their children. ""That's exactly what I want. Not anything more,"" she said. But despite her experiences so far, she insists that she is not scared. She will put her faith in her husband, Ibrahim said, and count on him to protect the family. ""If anything happens to us, he's responsible for us in the face of everyone else. This is protection and better for us. I'll go wherever he takes us, it's not a problem.""

"A death row inmate told relatives and a criminal profiler he killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman while O.J. Simpson waited nearby, a new documentary claims. O.J. Simpson was tried and acquitted in the June 12, 1994, stabbing deaths of his ex-wife and her friend, although the actor and football legend was found liable in a civil wrongful death trial. Glen Rogers, who has been sentenced to death for murdering women in Florida and California, was arrested in November 1995 -- a month after Simpson's murder trial ended -- and charged with killing five women in several states.  He told investigators at the time that he had killed at least 70 women, police said. ""I'm absolutely certain that my brother Glen killed Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman,"" said Clay Rogers, who narrated the film ""My Brother The Serial Killer,"" which will debut on the Investigation Discovery channel Wednesday. ""I know my brother did it because I've seen proof that he was there."" Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, immediately rejected the film's contention. ""The overwhelming evidence at the criminal trial proved that one, and only one, person murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman,"" Goldman said in a statement to CNN.  ""That person is O.J. Simpson and not Glen Rogers."" ""The fact that O.J. Simpson was acquitted was a travesty of justice that tarnished the criminal justice system,"" he said. ""Now every guilty person prays to the altar of O.J. Simpson for deliverance from their crimes. A [hundred thousand] screaming Glen Rogers, packed in the Los Angeles Coliseum, all confessing in unison, would not absolve O.J. Simpson of the murders he committed."" Simpson prosecutor now a novelist . Ronald Goldman's sister lashed out at the Investigation Discovery channel and film producers. ""I am appalled at the level of irresponsibility demonstrated by the network and the producers of this so-called documentary,"" Kim Goldman told CNN. ""I'm disappointed at the way this story was handled. Is this a confession?"" David Monaghan, the film's producer, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on Goldman's criticism. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department said the department would investigate Rogers' claims but does not believe he was involved in Simpson and Goldman's killings. ""The LAPD is quite confident that we know who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.  We have no reason to believe that Mr. Rogers was involved,"" Commander Andrew Smith said.  ""Nevertheless, in the interest of being thorough in this case, our robbery homicide detectives will investigate his claims."" Much of the documentary's support for the claim that Rogers killed Simpson and Goldman came from statements he purportedly made to his brother. Glen Rogers was a drifter in 1994 when he arrived in Los Angeles after the Northridge earthquake to work on a repair crew, according to the film.  One job took him to Simpson's house as a painter, it said. ""Glen told me, when he called, 'Guess who I'm partying with? Nicole Simpson,'"" Rogers said, describing a call he said happened just a few days before the killings.  ""Actually, what he told me, he says, 'They got money, they're well off and I'm taking her down.'"" The brother also claims that Glen Rogers took a gold angel pin off of Simpson's lifeless body and mailed it  to his mother in Ohio the next day.  Their mother wore the pin, at her son's request, at one of his murder trials, Rogers said. Criminal profiler Anthony Meoli, who exchanged dozens of letters with Glen Rogers and visited him on death row, said Rogers explained to him that O.J. Simpson had hired him to break into his ex-wife's condo to steal diamond earrings he had given her. ""Glen told me that O.J.'s instructions were that 'You may have to kill the bitch,'"" Meoli said. ""Those were his exact words."" Simpson told him about a spare key to the condo hidden outside the door, according to Meoli's description of Rogers' account.  The attack happened on steps outside, though, when Goldman unexpectedly arrived, he said. The documentary includes a graphic re-creation of how Rogers described the attack to Meoli. Simpson, who was waiting in his car nearby, walked onto the bloody sidewalk to check Rogers' work, thus leaving his footprints at the crime scene, Meoli said. Los Angeles prosecutors matched a shoe print taken from the scene to the sole of an expensive Italian shoe they contended O.J. Simpson owned. Rogers began a cross-country killing spree that included about 70 female victims after the Simpson and Goldman murders, the film said.  He was captured in Ohio in November 1995, weeks after O.J. Simpson was freed from jail. Rogers was sentenced to death in Florida after a jury convicted him of killing a woman in a Tampa motel.  He was later convicted of murdering a California woman, which resulted in a second death sentence.  No other states have tried him. He is awaiting execution in Florida and has no more appeals, according to the film. Assistant District Attorney Pat Dixon, who prosecuted Rogers in the 1990s, said Glen Rogers may have an ulterior motive for claiming to have killed Simpson and Goldman. ""Rogers is on death row in Florida and California. If he's close to execution in Florida, he may be hoping that California will bring him back here which would postpone the execution,"" Dixon said. The Simpson and Goldman killings did not match Rogers' other killings, Dixon added. ""Rogers and O.J. Simpson's cases don't match except that all the victims were stabbed. Rogers was a good-looking guy. He would go to bars, pick up women, court them, sometimes live with them a while, then kill them. The one victim he murdered in L.A., he killed the night he met her. I'm not aware of any instance of violence outside that pattern. What happened to Nicole Brown was totally different."" O.J. Simpson is serving a 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after nine years after being convicted of 10 charges related to an armed confrontation over sports memorabilia in a Las Vegas hotel room.  He was convicted in 2008. CNN was unable to immediately reach Simpson or his lawyer for a response.","""I'm absolutely certain that my brother Glen killed Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman,"" Clay Rogers says .

"International broadcaster Al Jazeera says it has closed its English-language bureau in Beijing after Chinese authorities refused to renew the press credentials of correspondent Melissa Chan. The broadcaster expressed disappointment with China's decision, which it said came after repeated attempts to apply for a visa through the normal procedures. It said it had no choice but to close the bureau because China had also denied its requests for a correspondent to replace Chan. ""We are committed to our coverage of China,"" Salah Negm, director of news at Al Jazeera English, said in an article on the broadcaster's website. ""Al Jazeera Media Network will continue to work with the Chinese authorities in order to reopen our Beijing bureau."" Al Jazeera's Arabic-language bureau in Beijing will continue to operate normally, said Ezzat Sabe Shahour, the bureau chief. At a Ministry of Foreign Affairs news conference Tuesday, spokesman Hong Lei said China welcomes objective reporting from foreign journalists, describing the reporting environment as ""very open and free."" ""At the same time,"" he said, ""foreign journalists should abide by Chinese laws and regulations while reporting in China and follow the professional ethics."" He added: ""We have been dealing with relevant media and foreign journalists in accordance with relevant laws and regulations as well as the actual performance of the journalist."" Chan, a U.S. citizen, is thought to be the first accredited foreign correspondent to lose the right to report in China since the expulsion of Yukihisa Nakatsu, a reporter for Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, in October 1998. Chinese authorities have yet to comment on the reasons for Chan's visa denial. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) suggested the ban was related to the airing of an Al Jazeera documentary in November on forced labor camps in China. In a statement on its website Tuesday, the FCCC -- of which Chan is a board member -- referred to Chinese ""anger"" over the report, which it said Chan ""didn't even play a part in making."" The report was part of a documentary series called ""Slavery: A 21st Century Evil,"" which accused China of ""state-sponsored"" slavery by forcing prison inmates to work. The Chinese authorities ""have also expressed unhappiness with the general editorial content on Al Jazeera English and accused Ms. Chan of violating rules and regulations that they have not specified,"" the FCCC said. The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that it has been closely following Chan's case. ""We're disappointed in the Chinese government and how the Chinese government decided not to renew her accreditation,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters. ""To our knowledge, she operated and reported in accordance with Chinese law, including regulations that permit foreign journalists to operate freely in China."" During her five years at Al Jazeera's Beijing bureau, Chan has filed nearly 400 reports on a variety of subjects including the economy, domestic politics, foreign policy, the environment, social justice, labor rights and human rights, the broadcaster said. In one report in 2010, Chan was blocked by authorities as she tried to visit the wife of jailed Chinese Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo. The following year, she profiled artist Zhang Bingjian, who was painting thousands of portraits of corrupt Chinese officials. And as recently as March this year, Chan accompanied an angry family as they tried to find relatives they claimed had been ""disappeared"" and detained at China's so-called ""black jails."" The FCCC said it was ""appalled"" by the decision to block Chan's visa application, which it called ""the most extreme example of a recent pattern of using journalist visas in an attempt to censor and intimidate foreign correspondents in China."" There is no suggestion the decision to deny Chan a visa is related to recent reporting on the scandal engulfing former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai or the attempts by the blind activist Chen Guangcheng to leave the country. Video: China blocks Anderson Cooper report on Chen . Chan confirmed on Twitter that she no longer has reporting rights in China, saying, ""Yes my press credentials have been revoked and I will no longer report f/ China."" Chan declined to comment further when phoned by CNN. Al Jazeera's China bureau is one of 60 operating worldwide as part of its English-language network, which opened in 2006, according to the broadcaster's website. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) urged China to ""immediately grant"" a visa to Al Jazeera English correspondents, adding that the refusal to approve Chan's application ""marks a real deterioration in China's media environment."" ""Surveillance and harassment are the norm for reporters on the China beat, and authorities will often delay visa approval or threaten to revoke it as part of an overall strategy of intimidation. But effectively shuttering an international news outlet is a disturbing development,"" Bob Dietz, CPJ Asia program coordinator, says in a statement on the organization's website. According to the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry, 649 accredited journalists were working in China as of February 2012. Most were based in Beijing, filing reports for 423 news organization from 58 countries. Citing its own survey and additional research, the FCCC said that in the past two years, 27 foreign reporters were made to wait for more than four months for visa approvals, with 13 of those of waiting six months or more. It claimed that 28 permanent postings or reporting trips had been canceled since 2009 because the Chinese authorities had rejected or ignored applications for the relevant visas. A recent report from the International Federation of Journalists detailed what the nonprofit called a ""clampdown on media in China in 2011,"" describing harassment of reporters and a growing push toward Internet censorship. ""The online media is still the main target for government crackdowns, with a new body established to oversight the online media environment,"" the report said. ""For foreign journalists, delaying of visa applications became a tool used by the authorities to threaten and restrain journalists.""","The U.S. State Department says it is ""disappointed"" by China's decision .

"In late 1989 the carefully constructed edifice of communism in Eastern Europe started crumbling in a wave of popular upheavals with a speed that took everyone by surprise. Nowhere was this process bolder and bloodier that in the final act of the revolutionary domino: the downfall of Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator who ran his country for the benefit of himself and his family like a feudal master. Today, the country is still trying to cope with a legacy that defiled the face of Bucharest, bankrupted the state and traumatized generations of Romanians. For some, one way of overcoming their psychological damage is to tell their story to tourists. It's now possible to join a tour in Bucharest that awakens the memories from a despised era to recount the story of the last days of Romanian communism. Monument to megalomania . The tour starts at the grandiose Parliamentary Palace, a permanent reminder of the communist leader's megalomania. Irene, 30, a chic parliamentary aide, gives us the figures and numbers. The building, she says, is the world's third largest by volume after the Aztec pyramid of Teotihuacan and the Cape Canaveral rocket assembly hangar. It uses 220,000 square meters of carpet, 3,500 tons of crystal and one million cubic meters of marble. The carpet in the main Union Hall alone weighs 1.5 tons. How did this monster come to be? Irene tells us how Ceausescu took advantage of a 1977 earthquake to raze most of the lower city center of Bucharest, flattening a hill and changing the course of the Dambovita river. Forty thousand people were forcibly displaced. ""Everything within an area of four square miles was rebuilt from scratch to match the style of the People's Palace. A stadium, several hospitals and two dozen churches or synagogues were demolished,"" says Irene. ""Only three historic Orthodox churches were saved by moving them, foundations and all, behind large apartment blocks so that they would remain invisible and not spoil his view."" Perfect echo . Construction involved 700 architects and 20,000 building workers doing three shifts a day, plus 5,000 army personnel, 1.5 million factory workers and an army of so-called volunteers. The palace's Union Hall features two large spiral staircases that descend to the main entrance to allow Ceausescu and his wife Elena to make grand, synchronized entrances. ""He was short and touchy about his height"", says Irene, ""so he had the staircases rebuilt twice in order to match his step."" Irene claps her hands. The sound travels crisply. ""Every chamber has a perfect echo, because when Ceausescu wanted something, he clapped. And he wanted everyone to know he'd clapped."" Ceausescu never got to see the building finished. By the time of the revolution, in December 1989, the building was only two-thirds complete. The incoming administration didn't know what to do with it, but the Romanian economy was so entangled with the palace that it had to be finished. The building was completed in 1994 and, since 1996, it has housed the Romanian Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The ground floor is home to a modern art museum. Nevertheless, the building, which costs a dizzying $6 million a year to run, is still 70% empty. After one hour of walking up and down its corridors, I had still only seen less than 10% of it. Night of terror . After this grand-scale folly, the simple, modernist design of the old Communist Party headquarters, now the Interior Ministry, looks mundane, banal even. It stands in front of what is now dubbed Revolution Square, where the protesting crowds gathered in December 1989, intent on bringing down the regime. My friend Gabriel has brought me here to remember that night. ""I was just 17,"" says Gabriel, trying to sound neutral, but in his voice the underlying emotion is easily discernible. ""I felt a change in the air. So on December 21, 1989, I came here with my friends. We stood here for hours, sometimes silent, sometimes shouting slogans against the regime. Then someone started shooting at the crowd."" He looks up to the balcony. ""The guy standing next to me just fell without a sound. He was shot in the head. I thought, my God, that could be me! But I stayed. Everyone encouraged each other and we did not go home."" Gabriel looks at me and guesses my thoughts. ""I do not consider myself a hero"", he says. ""I was just a curious boy."" Revolution Square is now adorned with the Pyramid Of Victory. It depicts ""a tall needle pricking the cloud of communism.""

""But I know he's one of them"", he says. Next day, Ceausescu left the besieged Communist party HQ by helicopter.

In 2010, Valentin, their only surviving child, received permission to have his parents' remains exhumed and reburied together under a modest tombstone. ""So what happened to the Ceausescu's villa?"" I ask Gabriel. ""I'll take you there"", he says and drives me to north Bucharest, where green parks, tree-lined avenues and high walls illustrate the affluence of the residents. Gabriel stops on the one side of a dual carriageway and points at a building on the far side.""That's it"", he says with an ironic smile. I read the sign: ""Embassy of Kuwait."" I cross the road and try to take a picture. There are two armed guards outside the embassy. ""No Photos,"" shouts one. I show him my press card. While he looks at it, I try to steal a few quick snaps. ""No, no, no,"" shouts the second guard running towards me. I smile, shrug and scamper across the carriageway to Gabriel who has been watching the scene with alarm. ""You don't argue with police"", he says, as he speeds off, shaking his index finger at me.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Pop singer Chris Brown was sentenced Tuesday to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna. Chris Brown received an expected sentence on Tuesday of probation and community service. Also Tuesday, CNN obtained a probation report for Brown that says the pair were involved in at least two other domestic violence incidents before the February attack for which Brown was sentenced. The probation report, which CNN obtained after Brown's sentencing, was used to reach his plea agreement. Brown, 20, was arrested after an early morning argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street on February 8.  Watch Brown get sentenced to probation » . Police investigating the February 8 attack ""learned of two earlier incidents related to domestic violence that went unreported,"" the probation report said. ""The first incident occurred in Europe about three months before the present offense,"" the report said. ""The victim [Rihanna] and the defendant [Brown] were involved in a verbal dispute and the victim [Rihanna] slapped the defendant [Brown]. He responded by shoving her into a wall."" Another incident happened in January, three weeks before the Hollywood incident, when Brown and Rihanna were visiting her home country of Barbados, the report said. ""The defendant [Brown] and the victim [Rihanna] were visiting Barbados and were driving a Range Rover loaned to them by a local dealership,"" the investigator wrote. ""They had an argument inside the car. The defendant [Brown] exited and broke the front driver and passenger side windows of the car."" At Tuesday's sentencing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg said she wants to see Brown do ""actual physical labor, as opposed to some type of community service."" The sentencing was delayed earlier this month because documents detailing Brown's proposed community service plan in Virginia, where he maintains a legal residence and wants to serve his sentence, had not arrived in time for Schnegg to review. Brown's probation will be overseen by the state of California, the judge said. Brown must also complete domestic violence counseling. Schnegg also put a restraining order in place, requiring Brown to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna, 10 yards if the two are at the same industry event. The judge issued a strict warning to Brown not to violate the order, which remains in place until 2014. Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, would not say whether she wanted the restraining order lifted, but if Rihanna wants the order modified she must personally appear in court to request it, Etra said. Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, did not attend Tuesday's sentencing.  Watch Brown arrive for sentencing » . According to Brown's probation report, the February argument began over an incident at a Beverly Hills party. An earlier, sworn statement by Los Angeles Police detective DeShon Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" The pair argued while in a sports car driven by Brown, the police statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement as Robyn F. -- numerous times and put her in a head lock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to beat her and kill her, according to the statement, and he bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, the statement said, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a domestic violence emergency protective order."" The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Rihanna's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown's right hand, which he used to punch her, the probation report said. ""Officers at the scene observed numerous contusions and abrasions to the victim's face and forehead, as well as bruising to her left arm near the bicep,"" it said. ""They also saw abrasions to her arms near both wrists and on her upper chest near her collarbone and around her neck. There were abrasions on her left leg and on the inside of her upper lips."" Rihanna declined to speak to the probation investigator, so the probation report's details were gathered from police detectives who interviewed her soon after the attack. ""He beat me up,"" Rihanna told the police, the report said. Brown made a public apology last month in a video statement posted on his personal Web site. ""I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better,"" Brown said. ""What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me. Please.""","NEW: Probation report: Brown, Rihanna in two previous domestic violence incidents .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A gubernatorial candidate in the northern Nigerian state of Borno was assassinated, and five police officers and the governor's brother were also killed in a gun attack outside a mosque Friday, said Borno state police commissioner Abubakar Mohammed. ""This was not Boko Haram. This was political assassination,"" Mohammed said. Boko Haram is an Islamic fundamentalist group in the region. Three men on motorbikes gunned down leading Borno state gubernatorial candidate Modu Fannami Gubio of the All Nigeria People's Party, Mohammed said. The violence occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, said Red Cross Borno secretary Mohammed Barma. Also killed were the Borno governor's younger brother, Goni Sherrif, and five plainclothes police officers, commissioner Mohammed said. The assassination came after afternoon prayers, he said. The current governor, who has reached his two-term limit, is a member of the same party to which Gubio belonged. The violence occurred in the lead-up to April's elections, in which Nigerians will also elect a new president. It also comes in a month marked by deadly sectarian violence in central Nigeria in which more than 200 persons have been killed, a human rights monitoring group said Thursday. Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission has extended the registration period by a week after a very widely and publicly criticized start. Voters now have until February 5 to register, instead of January 30, said commission secretary Alhaji Abdullahi Kaugama in a statement. The INEC chairman told the Senate on Wednesday that an extra week will cost more than $43 million. The extension is designed to yield a more complete roll of registered voters. The 2007 vote were considered one of Nigeria's most corrupt elections. In this month's bloodshed, the victims, including children, have been hacked to death, burned alive, dragged off buses and have ""disappeared,"" Human Rights Watch said. The group appealed to the Nigerian government to ""act swiftly to protect civilians of all ethnicities at risk of further attacks or reprisal killings."" It also urged the government to allow Francis Deng, the United Nations secretary-general's special adviser on the prevention of genocide, to visit central Plateau state. ""This terrible cycle of violence and impunity needs to stop,"" Corinne Dufka, the group's senior West Africa researcher, said in a statement. ""Both the state and federal governments have shown a disturbing lack of urgency in addressing the violence and tackling the underlying causes of these deadly outbreaks."" The wave of violence began with Christmas Eve bomb blasts in two Christian communities in Jos, the state capital that lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. At least 31 people died in those attacks. Since then, dozens of Muslims and Christians have been targeted and killed based simply on their ethnic or religious identity, Human Rights Watch said. It follows a year of bloodshed in 2010 that left at least 1,000 people dead in Plateau state. Deng submitted a request to travel to Jos in October but Human Rights Watch said the Nigerian government has not formally replied or authorized the mission. Earlier this month, eight Muslim youths heading to a wedding were attacked after they took a wrong turn and ended up in a Christian village. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that the Nigerian army exhumed five bodies from shallow graves near the village and returned them to their families. The three others remain missing. In reprisal, Muslim youths in Jos attacked Christians the next day. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that the victims were hacked to death with machetes and cutlasses or burned alive by the mob. Later that day, at least 14 more Muslims were killed by mobs in Christian neighborhoods in the Jos area. Witnesses told the rights group that Muslims and Christians were separated on buses, dragged off and hacked to death. Others spoke of people burned alive in their houses. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, more than 13,500 people have died in religious or ethnic clashes since the end of military rule in 1999, Human Rights Watch said in a report last year. The group charges the government exploits the violence for political gain. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Candidate Modu Fannami Gubio of the All Nigeria People's Party is gunned down .

"Filipino doctors, priests, journalists and accountants will be allowed to arm themselves while at work under a controversial new gun law that takes effect in their country this month. Under the Philippines' Republic Act 10591, people working in these sectors -- along with nurses, engineers, bank tellers, and lawyers -- are considered ""in imminent danger due to their profession"" and will be allowed to carry small guns when outside their homes. To qualify for a special firearms permit, people in these professions have to pass drug and psychiatric tests, and show they don't have any criminal convictions or pending cases for crimes with punishments of more than two years in prison. This relaxes the requirements of the previous gun law, the Republic Act 8294, under which they had to prove they were under ""actual threat"" of danger to carry a firearm. The regulations could be good news for reporters in the Philippines, who live in one of the world's deadliest countries for the media, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Some 74 journalists, mostly covering politics, have been murdered in the Philippines since 1992, the press freedom group says. In more than 70% of cases, the killers have gone unpunished. With gun ownership high -- there were 1.2 million registered firearms in the Philippines in 2012, according to data from the National Police Firearms and Explosives Office, and estimates for unregistered weapons are in the hundreds of thousands -- firearms are often blamed for violence in the country.  During New Year celebrations alone, at least 30 people were injured and one infant killed by stray bullets, the police said. Philippines' authorities say the new law will help them better regulate the use of firearms and curb gun-related crimes, according to local media reports. The law sets harsher penalties for individuals found guilty of possessing unlicensed guns, who now face at least 30 years in jail. The Republic Act 10591 also requires gun owners to have three separate permits: a license to own a firearm, registration for the gun, and a third permit to carry the weapon outside his or her residence. But not everyone who is eligible for the special permits will be rushing out to buy guns. Catholic priests criticized the law after it was signed by President Benigno Aquino III in May last year, saying that it was contrary to their belief that society needs peace, not violence. ""Priests are supposed to be men of peace, not of war,"" the Union of Catholic Asian News reported Bishop Jose Oliveros from Bulacan province as saying. ""Our Lord said: 'he who lives by the sword will die by the sword. We should not counter violence with violence.""

"Don Cornelius never led a civil rights march, launched a boycott or gave a speech before a cheering crowd of protesters. But his impact on America was as profound as virtually any civil rights leader, says Shayne Lee, a sociologist who grew up watching ""Soul Train."" Cornelius' groundbreaking TV show didn't just captivate African-Americans -- it tied white and black America together in a way that had not been done before, says Lee, who teaches a course on hip-hop at the University of Houston. ""He was an ambassador, the pope of soul,"" Lee said. ""For a lot of suburban whites living in segregated America, this was their first exposure to this exciting new world of movement and energy. He made black culture more accessible."" Cornelius, who hosted ""Soul Train"" for 22 of its 36 years on the air, died Tuesday. He was 75. Police reports indicate he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The suave Cornelius was known by an entire generation of African-Americans as the dapper host of ""Soul Train"" who signed off each show by blowing a kiss and declaring, ""We wish you love, peace and souuuullll."" Most of the tributes to Cornelius that poured in following his death focused on his contribution to music. Others said his legacy was bigger than sound. Cultural impact of 'Soul Train' Kenny Gamble, co-founder of Philadelphia International Records, which produced the theme song for ""Soul Train,"" says Cornelius was a great contributor to American, not just black, culture. ""Soul Train,"" like Apple and Coca-Cola, is an American brand, Gamble says. ""Soul Train"" traditions, like dancers gathering to cheer on fellow dancers as they shimmied down a dance line, are now a part of pop culture. ""No matter where you go in this world, people are doing the 'Soul Train' dance line,"" he said. ""What's a party without the 'Soul Train' dance line?"" Gamble still sounded stunned after hearing the news about Cornelius. ""Unbelievable,"" he said. ""That was my man."" Singer Gladys Knight told CNN that Cornelius was an unsung hero whose show amplified the message, ""I'm black and I'm proud."" ""He encouraged us to be ourselves,"" she said. ""We're going to give you this platform and you go out and do your thing."" Sociologist Lee said that message -- be black and proud -- drove the civil rights movement. And just as the civil rights movement overturned segregation, Cornelius erased cultural barriers that separated white and black Americans living apart in their own cultural cocoons. ""I see Cornelius as a civil rights activist,"" said Lee, author of ""Erotic Revolutionaries."" ""The civil rights movement changed the legal structure; Cornelius changed the cultural structure. Changing the culture can change hearts in a way that protests can't."" Cornelius first changed television. TV had not been known as friendly terrain for African-Americans before ""Soul Train."" Blacks were often seen in caricatured roles -- as minstrels, servants or outlaws. They were seen through the lens of white America. ""Soul Train"" changed the focus. It lifted the veil on black America and showed blacks being themselves, and not as whites imagined them, said Lee. ""The show introduced the notion that blacks were creative, we have something to offer and we're not going anywhere. And if you give us a chance, you might like some of our moves,"" Lee said. Cornelius offered white America a new way to see black men, Lee says. He wasn't a sidekick or servant, nor was he angry. ""He walked a tightrope,"" Lee said. ""If he was too in-your-face, he would have been offensive on television, or too accommodating he would have been perceived as an Uncle Tom. ""He was soooo cool."" The cool apparently wasn't an act to those who knew him and knew how he launched ""Soul Train."" The man behind the voice . Cornelius took a big risk to start ""Soul Train."" He was a former insurance salesman who entered broadcasting in the mid-1960s. He gave up a steady paycheck as a salesman because he'd often been told he had a wonderful voice for broadcasting. He was inspired by another television music host. ""Almost all of what I learned about mounting and hosting a dance show I learned from Dick Clark,"" the producer and host of ""American Bandstand,"" he once told Advertising Age. Cornelius was used to taking risks -- he used $400 of his own money to shoot a pilot and faced skepticism at many turns. Yet he had an edge -- ""Soul Train"" was a novel idea. There had been any number of radio programs focusing on black music and black listeners, but ""Soul Train"" was the first nationwide black-oriented music-variety TV show. It was also one of the most successful TV programs ever: To this day, its 35 years in syndication are a record. ""If you're an African-American of a certain age, 'Soul Train' was as important to your weekend mornings as your milk was to your cereal,"" broadcasting personality Tom Joyner wrote in 2010. Cornelius also was a shrewd businessman. He used a partnership with Sears and Chicago-based cosmetics company Johnson Products to take the show national in 1971 after a year's run in Chicago. He also stayed true to his market -- and by doing so helped popularize African-American artists among a wide audience. He gave a number of black performers their big break, including Shalamar, Rosie Perez and Nick Cannon -- the latter two as dancers. Soul Train's fashions . The fashions on ""Soul Train"" were almost as important as the music. Every Saturday, teenagers all across America tuned in to see what the ""Soul Train"" dancers were wearing. Viewers even paid attention to the commercials, where companies sold black beauty products such as Ultra-Sheen. ""It was appointment television in our household, and the clothes were talked about as much if not more than the new dance moves,"" said Billboard magazine editor Danyel Smith. ""The style of 'Soul Train' is a book, a movie, a documentary in and of itself. It was flashy, it was big, it was bold, it was sexy -- and frankly it was a way that I think many in America hadn't seen African-Americans look. To just even see people from another part of the country -- people forget how revolutionary that was back in the '70s."" No matter how popular ""Soul Train"" became, Cornelius never forgot those who worked behind the stage, said Christopher Lehman, author of ""A Critical History of Soul Train on Television."" ""He wanted to make sure that he had African-Americans involved in every level of production. He had African-American directors, and of course he had African-American dancers,"" Lehman told CNN Radio's Matt Cherry. ""If there had not been a 'Soul Train' there would not have been a whole network like BET that tries to do on a network level what Don Cornelius did on a program level."" In his later years, Cornelius became an elder statesman for the black music scene. He would show up at awards shows -- impeccably tailored as usual -- to receive accolades for ""Soul Train."" Looking at him then, it was hard to imagine the risks he took when he started ""Soul Train."" But NewsOne's Don Charnas remembered. Once, James Brown -- then the biggest name in soul music -- wondered how Cornelius would succeed. ""Who's backing you on this?"" he asked Cornelius repeatedly. ""It's just me, James,"" Cornelius answered. Not anymore. Cornelius' wonderful voice -- like the music and style of ""Soul Train"" -- is now a permanent part of America's soundtrack.","""Soul Train"" host Don Cornelius' impact on America was bigger than music .

"(CNN) -- The United States is urging Turkey to show restraint after Kurdish rebels attacked its forces on Sunday, killing at least 17 Turkish soldiers and wounding 16 others near Turkey's border with Iraq and Iran, according to Turkey's defense minister. A Turkish soldier walks through the village of Senoba, Turkey, near the border with Iraq. The initial response by Turkish forces was to hit back by killing 32 rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in southern Turkey, according to a statement on an official government Web site. Sunday's deadly attack on Turkish soldiers prompted outrage among citizens in Istanbul, Turkey, who took to the streets in protest. Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said that, in addition to the 17 killed, 10 Turkish soldiers were missing after the ambush in southern Turkey. He denied reports they had been abducted by PKK rebels. Shortly after the attack, a wedding convoy tripped a landmine in Daglica, Turkey, near the ambush site, a Turkish government source said. The attack wounded 12 people and is believed to have been the work of PKK rebels, the source said.  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the attack » . After an emergency meeting Sunday of Turkey's military and political leaders President Abdullah Gul issued a statement saying: ""We will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization. We respect Iraq's national borders. But [we] will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists."" There are fears that the escalation in fighting could spill into northern Iraq's Kurdish region, where Turkey insists the PKK leadership is based. But Iraq denies that, saying PKK leaders are hiding out in rugged mountain areas along the Turkish border that are not controlled by Iraq. Cross-border shelling between Turkish forces and PKK rebels in northern Iraq continued Sunday. Iraqi leaders fear Turkish ground forces could make a major push into northern Iraq after Turkey's parliament approved such an incursion in an overwhelming vote last week. Gonul on Sunday assured U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates that Ankara would not to carry out an imminent ground incursion, but he did not abandon the possibility of sending Turkish troops into northern Iraq, which Gonul called ""a safe haven"" for PKK rebels. Gonul and Gates met in Kiev, Ukraine. Gates said: ""A major cross-border operation would be contrary to Turkey's interests as well as to our own and that of Iraq."" Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, addressed the rising tensions with Turkey during a meeting with Kurdish regional leader Massoud Barzani in Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region. Talabani reiterated Iraq's demand that PKK rebels lay down their arms, and restated calls for a diplomatic solution. He also said Sunday that Iraqi forces are unable to find the rebel leaders because of the difficult landscape. ""The Turkish military, with its mightiness, could not annihilate them or arrest them, so how could we arrest them and hand them to Turkey?"" Talabani said at a news conference following his meeting with Barzani. Turkey's parliament last week passed a measure that enables its military to launch an incursion into northern Iraq and chase down Kurdish rebels. Although Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the vote in his parliament last week wouldn't necessarily trigger immediate military action against the PKK, the United States and Iraqi officials have been in high diplomatic gear for days in efforts to keep Turkey from carrying out the proposed cross-border assaults against the rebels. The United States fears a large-scale military operation by Turkey in northern Iraq would undermine the stability of the U.S.-backed government in Baghdad and jeopardize supply lines that support U.S. troops in Iraq. Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents and a top Sunni Arab leader, met with Turkish leaders last week about the tensions along the Iraq-Turkish border, and said the talks ""ended in good results,"" his office said in a statement. Iraq's Kurdish region -- which consists of Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces -- has had a close economic relationship with Turkey, and the passage of the Turkish measure has stoked anger there. When asked how Iraq's government would respond to the possibility of Turkish ground forces in northern Iraq, Barzani urged dialogue with Turkey but said Iraqi forces would act ""in self-defense."" ""We will not be a part of any such conflict,"" Barzani said. ""But if we are targeted directly we will defend ourselves."" E-mail to a friend .

"""Jordanians look around the region and they say to themselves --'We're lucky -- the streets are safe. There is stability.'"" Those were the words of a former Jordanian minister speaking to CNN on a bleak, damp day in Amman 18 months ago. At the time, Egypt and Yemen were in turmoil, Tunisia's president had fled, and Shiite protesters were taking to the streets of Bahrain. But even then, there was plenty of grumbling in Jordan -- over gas prices, unemployment, pervasive corruption. Tribal sheiks described their disappointment with King Abdullah, who succeeded his father to the throne in 1999. In towns like Mafraq, near the Syrian border and traditionally a bedrock of support for the monarchy, there was an undercurrent of resentment -- especially toward Queen Rania for her alleged lavish lifestyle. Those same grievances have stoked the current protests, triggered by a sudden and sharp increase in the price of cooking oil and fuel as state subsidies have been withdrawn. Now King Abdullah confronts what analysts in Amman say is the biggest crisis of his 13-year reign. Osama Al Sharif -- an Amman-based commentator and syndicated columnist -- says the  economic crunch is merging with evermore strident demands for political change, now led by the Muslim Brotherhood. But the sometimes violent protests in Amman and elsewhere this week have also included young men from poor areas, and for the first time a refrain from protests elsewhere in the Arab world -- ""The People Want the Downfall of the Regime"" -- has been heard. The street protests this week have underlined a growing divide between older tribal leaders and a younger generation that's ""on a totally different bandwidth,"" Al Sharif says. Al Sharif and others do not believe the monarchy is under threat. Jordan's military, security and intelligence services are efficient and intensely loyal. But the threat of more unrest beckons, and could deter what little foreign investment Jordan attracts. The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, is demanding the price hikes be rescinded immediately. It also wants changes to the election law -- and constitutional reform so that the prime minister is directly elected and not appointed by the king. The Brotherhood, which intends to boycott parliamentary elections in January, has built alliances with other opposition groups. The government appears adamant that with the state's coffers nearly bare and compensation offered to the poorest, subsidies have to be reduced. That's the condition set by the International Monetary Fund for $2 billion in further credit. Jordan simply can't survive without foreign aid. The state has a huge role in the economy -- as employer of more than one-third the work force and in subsidizing the price of basic commodities which consumes almost one quarter of all government spending. When it can't afford those subsidies, or the International Monetary Fund demands they are reduced in return for loans, trouble is not far away. As in Egypt and other Arab countries, the Jordanian ""street"" is hypersensitive to the price of bread and cooking oil. Most Jordanians struggle to get by: The average per capita income is $6,500. Price ""shocks"" provoked street protests in 1989 and 1996 -- just as they did in Egypt in 1979 and 2007. The Kingdom's current problems echo those of 1989. Aid was declining, but spending was rising amid ever-worsening unemployment. As part of a deal with the IMF, the government cut subsidies on basic goods and riots erupted in southern Jordan, quickly turning into more general protests against the government. The same syndrome has taken hold this year, worsened by cuts in gas supplies from Egypt to less than one-fifth the agreed amount. The government has already tried once (in August) to tackle subsidies, but retreated in the face of protests. Despite its lack of size and economic clout, Jordan matters to the West. The Hashemite Kingdom has been consistently pro-Western, is one of only two Arab states to have a peace treaty with Israel and is at the heart of a volatile neighborhood. In the past it has quietly allowed the American and British militaries to use its territory and facilities as a staging ground. About half of Jordan's population is Palestinian, and the monarchy has worked hard to ensure peace between them and the various tribes that live there. The Kingdom's geography -- as a neighbor of Israel, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- has thrown up awkward and sometimes impossible choices. Its current financial situation is not helped by the presence of some 200,000 Syrian refugees on Jordanian soil and King Abdullah's cautious attitude toward events in Syria -- while Jordan is quietly helping the Syrian opposition, it has kept its ambassador in Damascus. Al Sharif says the less-than-wholehearted Jordanian support for the Syrian rebels may explain why Saudi Arabia has not delivered the expected level of financial aid this year. There is also a growing threat from Salafist/jihadi groups. Eman Ebed Alkadi of the Eurasia Group says Salafists have acquired weapons from Syria and points out that Jordanian intelligence recently uncovered a plot to launch terror attacks on diplomatic missions in Amman. Radical clerics such as Abu Muhammad al-Tahawi have called for sharia rule in Jordan to replace ""the gang of corruptors"" in power. Al Sharif says some commentators, himself included, believe that as trust in the monarchy erodes, it's time for a ""grand political initiative"" from the king -- one that addresses the current dissent and sets a new role for the monarch within a revised constitution. The United States says it supports both the king's road map for reform -- which gradually shifts more power to the elected parliament -- and demands for a more inclusive political process. But the two may not be compatible. The tribes don't want to see the largely urban Muslim Brotherhood -- which derives much of its support from Jordan's Palestinian population -- gain power at their expense. Economic crisis, a government virtually out of money, a generational divide, political deadlock, rising unrest in neighboring countries: King Abdullah faces a multifaceted challenge that would have tested the abilities of his wily father.","Rising oil and food prices stoke unrest in Jordan .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner's plan to raise the nation's debt ceiling and slash government spending narrowly passed his chamber on Friday and then was blocked by Senate Democrats, setting up a weekend of negotiations to seek a deal that would avoid a potential federal default next week. The Senate vote was 59-41 to table the measure, which effectively kills it unless Democrats decide to bring it up again. Earlier, Boehner's proposal was approved by the House in a sharply polarized 218-210 vote that was delayed by a day while the speaker rounded up support from wary tea party conservatives. No Democrats supported the measure, and 22 of the 240 members of the Republican majority also opposed it. Even though it was blocked in the Senate, the Boehner plan now is the Republican negotiating position for hammering out a deal with congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama to avert a possible government default next week. However, no face-to-face talks were scheduled, with Democrats accusing Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of refusing to negotiate and McConnell in turn seeking a chance for his caucus to reject a proposal offered by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid as a vehicle for compromise. Democratic and Republican sources familiar with the situation told CNN that McConnell insists the White House be present in further negotiations toward a debt ceiling deal. In a continuation of the political theater that has characterized the negotiations so far, the House scheduled a vote on the Reid plan for Saturday -- before the Senate will even begin considering it -- as what appeared to be payback for the rejection by Senate Democrats of the Boehner proposal. Reid, meanwhile, said the Senate will likely vote to take up his plan at 1 a.m. Sunday ET as part of the procedural path required to get something passed in coming days. As the political maneuvering continues, the clock continues to tick down. If Congress fails to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by August 2, Americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar, among other problems. Some financial experts have warned of a downgrade of America's triple-A credit rating and a potential stock market plunge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a sixth straight day on Friday. Without an increase in the debt limit, the federal government will not be able to pay all its bills next month. Obama recently indicated he can't guarantee Social Security checks will be mailed out on time. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a statement Friday to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work next week as scheduled, regardless of whether a deal gets worked out. Panetta pledged to do ""everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected."" A Department of Defense official told CNN on condition of not being identified that on the possibility of military pay being withheld, ""it's not a question of whether, but when, if an agreement isn't reached."" Friday's House vote was a critical test of Boehner's control over his tea party-infused GOP caucus. The speaker was forced to quell a right-wing revolt over the measure after a number of members complained that it doesn't do enough to shrink the size of government and stem the tide of Washington's red ink. Boehner, R-Ohio, managed to sway several of those members by including a provision requiring congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution before the debt ceiling can be extended through the end of 2012. In his floor speech before the vote, Boehner called the proposal imperfect but necessary, and he criticized Obama and congressional Democrats for rejecting all deficit reduction measures passed by the House so far. ""We've tried to do our level best ... but some people continue to say no,"" Boehner said, adding: ""I stuck my neck out a mile to try to get an agreement with the president of the United States."" His voice rising to a shout, Boehner continued to cheers and applause from fellow Republicans: ""It is time for this administration and the other party across the aisle -- put something on the table. Tell us where you are."" Democratic leaders vehemently object both to the balanced budget amendment and the requirement of a second debt ceiling vote before the next election. They argue that reaching bipartisan agreement on another debt ceiling hike during an election year could be nearly impossible, and that short-term extensions of the limit could further destabilize the economy. Earlier in the day, Obama urged Senate Democrats and Republicans to take the lead in the congressional deliberations. Boehner's plan ""has no chance of becoming law,"" Obama said. ""The time for putting party first is over. The time for compromise on behalf of the American people is now. ... It's important for everybody to step up and show the leadership that the American people expect."" ""This is not a situation where the two parties are miles apart,"" the president insisted. But ""we are almost out of time."" Obama urged Americans to contact their members of Congress ""to keep the pressure on Washington."" Phone lines on Capitol Hill were jammed Friday as people from coast to coast tried to weigh in on the debate. Meanwhile, Reid, D-Nevada, has been pushing his own plan to raise the debt limit, though he will need to win over at least seven Senate Republicans to win the 60 votes necessary to overcome a certain filibuster. Reid announced Friday morning that he intended to ""take action"" on a Senate bill by the end of the day. Later, he complained on the Senate floor that Republicans would effectively filibuster his proposal by requiring a 60-vote super-majority in the 100-member chamber to support the start of debate on it. It was unclear when Reid would attempt to hold that vote, and he warned it could as late as 1 a.m. ET Sunday. Reid also blasted Boehner's decision to include a mandatory balanced budget amendment provision in the GOP plan, calling the addition of ""even more stuff in this right-wing leaning bill. ... It's really hard to comprehend."" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, accused Boehner of ""adding all kinds of unrealistic poison pills to his plan."" But McConnell, R-Kentucky, argued Senate Democrats were doing little to actually resolve the crisis. ""I would suggest to my friends on the other side ... that they start taking their responsibilities as a majority party a little more seriously, because at this point, the only people who are disregarding the consequences of default are Senate Democrats -- not the Republicans in the House -- but them,"" McConnell said. In a statement after the House vote, McConnell said: ""I eagerly await the majority leader's plan for preventing this crisis."" Leaders of both parties now agree that any deal to raise the debt ceiling should include long-term spending reductions to help control spiraling deficits. But they differ sharply on both the nature and timetable of the cuts. Despite the strong partisan rhetoric, there have been signs of a growing recognition of a need for further compromise. Earlier this week, McConnell called for renewed negotiations with Obama, and indicated that his party must be willing to move away from some of its demands. Sources close to the negotiations have also told CNN that Vice President Joe Biden is very much in the mix of back-channel conversations on a possible fallback position. White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley told CNN Thursday that, presuming the Boehner plan wins House approval and gets blocked in the Senate, the next step is for everyone ""to take a step back in the Congress and look at where is a point of compromise."" Daley said that similarities between the Boehner and Reid plans ""may be the grounds for a deal that, hopefully, both parties can pass."" Both plans suffered setbacks earlier this week when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released reports concluding that they fell short of their stated deficit reduction goals. Boehner's plan, which has since been revised, proposed generating a total of $917 billion in savings while initially raising the debt ceiling by $900 billion. The speaker has pledged to match any debt ceiling hike with dollar-for-dollar spending cuts. His plan, however, would require a second vote by Congress to raise the debt ceiling by a combined $2.5 trillion -- enough to last through the end of 2012. It would create a special congressional committee to recommend additional savings of $1.6 trillion or more. Any failure on the part of Congress to enact mandated spending reductions or abide by new spending caps would trigger automatic across-the-board budget cuts. The plan, as amended Friday, also calls for congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution before the second vote to raise the debt ceiling, which would likely be required at some point during the winter. As for Reid's plan, a revised version he proposed Friday would reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.4 trillion and raise the debt ceiling by a similar amount. It includes $1 trillion in savings based on the planned U.S. withdrawals from military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Reid's plan also would establish a congressional committee made up of 12 House and Senate members to consider additional options for debt reduction. The committee's proposals would be guaranteed by a Senate vote with no amendments by the end of the year. In addition, it incorporates a process based on proposal by McConnell that would give Obama the authority to raise the debt ceiling in two steps while providing Congress the opportunity to vote its disapproval. Among other things, Reid has stressed that his plan meets the key GOP demand for no additional taxes. Boehner, however, argued this week that Reid's plan fails to tackle popular entitlement programs such as Medicare, which are among the biggest drivers of the debt. A recent CNN/ORC International Poll reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise. Sixty-four percent of respondents to a July 18-20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Only 34% preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions. According to the poll, the public is sharply divided along partisan lines; Democrats and independents are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a major crisis for the country. Republicans, however, draw the line at tax increases, and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances.

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN)  -- When you're on a college campus and you ask someone what they're studying, one answer you don't typically hear is ""hip hop."" But McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnsota, is the first school in the nation to offer an accredited diploma program on the study and performance of hip hop music. For Austen Huls, it is one of the primary reasons he's pursuing secondary education at all. His first attempt at community college, taking general education courses, didn't work out so well. ""I pretty much bombed my math class right out of the shoot,"" 19-year-old Huls said. ""Then I realized I need to go to school for something that I enjoy, or at least pursue something that I enjoy, so I'm not miserable."" Playing drums gives him more pleasure than anything. But for a long time, he'd considered music school taboo. ""[I thought to myself] 'a lot of musicians don't go that route,' "" Huls said. ""But then I grew up in my head a little bit and I just said maybe I'll try it."" Huls discovered McNally Smith and its three-semester hip hop diploma program. His ultimate goal is to be a big-time drummer like Travis Barker of Blink-182. ""When I was 14, [my brother] took me to a Blink-182 concert in Minneapolis at the Target Center. I was watching Travis Barker play the drums, and his drum set sunk into the stage, went underground, and he went into the crowd and started going nuts for the crowd."" ""That is what I want to do, and there's no doubt in my mind."" His plan is to complete the diploma track and then consider a full degree in percussion performance. ""When I'm sitting at home, I just go up, close my eyes and play music. It comes to me. So, like if I were to do it for a job, it wouldn't feel like work, and I could be having fun making my own money."" But hip hop is not a genre without its critics. ""There are people who might say, 'If you have hip hop in a college, isn't that almost a contradiction in terms?"" said McNally Smith College President Harry Chalmiers. ""'It's a street music, it grew up in the neighborhoods, how can you have it in the college?'"" ""This is a very important art form that is not going away,"" Chalmiers tells the genre's opponents. ""When we look at hip hop closely, we see that we can study its impact on people's lives, on society. Where does this music come from? When it's angry, when it's sometimes vicious, vile or rude, why is that? What are people trying to say? These are important questions to ask."" Kevin Washington, a drums and rhythm instructor on the hip hop faculty, says that the birth of hip hop resembles that of jazz music  and the time is right for hip hop to be treated as such in the schools. ""Jazz started like hip hop -- out of the urban neighborhoods, black neighborhoods. There was a language, there was clothing, there was a style that everybody started copying. So when they started putting jazz in schools, there was controversy at first,"" Washington said. ""I felt that we were in the same situation with that."" In the six weeks the program has been underway, there has been no sign of a collective protest. One reason could be that the curriculum is part hands-on and part textbook learning, as well. Instructors include various Twin Cities-based hip hop artists such as Toki Wright, the program's coordinator who's  touring at venues across the country. More internationally known names are instructors as well. For example, DJ instructor Freddy Fresh had Top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and has also performed with industry figure Fatboy Slim. Founded in 1985, the school is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music. According to the school's Web site, it has a yearly average of 600 students enrolled who are taught by the 100-member faculty. And to those who are surprised at the geographic locale of the first hip hop program, the Minneapolis-St. Paul area just might have more to offer than you think. ""It's funny -- here we are in the upper Midwest, where people might think, 'Oh my gosh, it's a backwater, you're not New York, you're not Los Angeles,' "" Chalmiers said. ""The Twin Cities has a really rich musical community that goes from the best chamber orchestra in the world to some of the most unique rap music collectives you'd ever want to find. So this is a great place to do it.""","McNally Smith College of Music offers the first college diploma in hip hop .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Authorities are investigating reports that disabled children in India were buried up to their necks during this week's solar eclipse as a supposed remedy for their handicaps. Hindu women pray as they bathe in the River Ganges after the total solar eclipse in India. Officials said Thursday they were looking into reports that some 34 children aged 2 to 7 were buried in sand up to their chins -- with the consent of the parents -- in the belief that doing so during an eclipse would cure the children of their disabilities. V. Anbu Kumar, caretaker deputy commissioner of Gulbarga district in the state of Karnataka, told CNN that everybody at the site had left when he and police officers arrived. The act was apparently carried out in the early morning hours Wednesday, when the longest solar eclipse of the century turned day into night in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Vietnam, China and parts of the Pacific. Kumar denied that the ritual takes place during every eclipse, but said authorities are ""launching an awareness campaign"" against the practice. A complaint has been registered for ""knowingly endangering human lives,"" Gulbarg police chief B.A. Padmanayna told CNN. Stronger charges could also be pressed against the offenders, he said.  Watch the 'exceptional' eclipse » . So far, police have made no arrests in the case. Wednesday's eclipse reignited some superstitions in India. Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse, and Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when the event occurs.  View the eclipse in pictures » . ""It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality,"" said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a ""remedial astrologer."" A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere. ""Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power,"" he explained.","Authorities investigate reports disabled children were buried during solar eclipse .

"(CNN) -- The deaths of nine people during a raid by Israeli soldiers on a flotilla bringing aid to Palestinians in Gaza has once again brought worldwide attention on Israel's blockade of the area. Who organized the flotilla? The Free Gaza Movement, a Cyprus-based human rights group, brought together a number of organizations to form the Freedom Flotilla. The coalition includes the European Campaign to end the siege of Gaza. Another pro-Palestinian group, Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH), a Turkish organization, also sent a ship. The flotilla left Cyprus on Sunday and had been due to arrive in Gaza on Monday. Why a flotilla? The Free Gaza Movement says it wants to raise awareness of what it describes as the ""illegal siege on Gaza"" by Israel. It says the blockade of Gaza by Israel is unjustified and that it denies Palestinians vital goods and services. ""We want to raise international awareness about the prison-like closure of Gaza and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued Israeli occupation,"" the group says on its Web site. What does the convoy consist of? Six ships -- three passenger and three cargo vessels -- carrying over 10,000 tons of aid and 600 passengers from more than 20 countries, says the Free Gaza Movement. Most of the passengers were Turkish. The cargo consists of food, medical aid and other supplies including cement, prefabricated housing and educational equipment, the group said. The Turkish prime minister said Monday that the vessels were inspected before they left port in Turkey to make sure the cargo did not include weapons. What does Israel say about the blockade? The blockade was imposed by Israel in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the territory. It is designed to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza, the Israeli government says. Israel says the Gaza shoreline is closed to maritime traffic. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said Israeli civilians were plagued a year ago by rockets and missiles fired from Gaza that originated in places like Iran and Syria. What does the U.N. say about the blockade? The U.N. has described the blockade of Gaza by Israel as the ""collective punishment"" of the Palestinian people living there. The United Nations has repeatedly criticized the blockade and the insufficient flow of materials into the area for basic needs and reconstruction. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has warned the closure ""creates unacceptable suffering, hurts forces of moderation and empowers extremists."" What goods does Israel allow into Gaza? About 15,000 tons of humanitarian aid flows into Gaza each week, Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said. Israel says it allows enough humanitarian aid -- including food and medicines - into Gaza for the people who live there and that the blockade is designed to stop Hamas from building or acquiring arms. Israel has never published a list of banned items but it has refused to allow into Gaza books, paper, blankets and reconstruction materials. The U.N. says 80 percent of Gazans rely on some form of humanitarian aid. Why did Israel object to the flotilla? The Israeli government described the flotilla has a ""provocation"" and said it was a political stunt. Danny Ayalon, the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, said: ""The organizers' intent was violent, their method was violent and the results were unfortunately violent."" The Free Gaza Movement said the flotilla's aim was to ""challenge Israel's blockade of 1.5 million Palestinians trapped in an open-air prison."" Was there another route for this aid? The Israeli government said it would allow humanitarian aid on the flotilla into Gaza through its normal channels. An IDF spokesman said the vessels ""refused to comply with an invitation to come to Ashdod port where they could transfer aid into the Gaza strip."" Audrey Bomse, legal advisor to the Free Gaza Movement, told CNN the group did not believe the Israelis would let the cargo into Gaza and that the cargo also included reconstruction aid which Israel does not allow into Gaza . How did things turn violent? The Israel government says its soldiers faced violent resistance as they boarded the largest ship, the Marmara. The Free Gaza Movement denies there was violent resistance to Israeli soldiers, saying the soldiers immediately opened fire on unarmed civilians. Video released by the Israeli Defense Forces showed intense fighting on the decks of the ship. What happens next? The ships were escorted to the Israeli port of Ashdod and 15 people who had been aboard were taken to an Israeli prison in Beer Sheva, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prison authority. Meanwhile diplomatic tensions rise. Turkey recalled its ambassador to Israel, there was widespread international condemnation of the Israeli operation and the U.N. Security Council met Monday. Have ships been sent to Gaza during the blockade before? Yes, the Free Gaza Movement on its website says it has organized eight voyages to Gaza, ""successfully arriving in Gaza five times."" The group said its ""boats are the first international ships to sail to the Gaza Strip since 1967.""","Free Gaza Movement says it wants to raise awareness of the ""illegal siege on Gaza""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the ""digital version of a traffic cop"" to handle the overload. Servers hosting Web sites of the House of Representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days. ""This is unprecedented,"" said Jeff Ventura, communications director for the House's chief administrator. The tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced Sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system. In making the announcement, legislators said the public could view the agreement at financialservices.house.gov. ""In a short period of time, lots of Web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing,"" Ventura told CNN in a phone interview. As millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan, the House.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying ""this page does not appear."" iReport.com: Do you support a bailout? Ventura compared the situation to the ""old days, when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster. Then everyone calls the same 1-800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal."" ""This was a massive digital busy signal,"" he said. As more people gained access to the page and details of the bailout proposal were published in the news media, constituents then started to e-mail their representatives, Ventura explained. ""We know it's in the millions,"" he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving. ""But we haven't counted yet, because when you're about to get hit by a tidal wave, you don't count the drops of water in the wave."" After the House failed to pass the proposed deal Monday by a vote of 228-205, the e-mail volume surged again, Ventura said. ""Because there were so many e-mails, it was impacting even the presentation of House.gov,"" he explained. ""This morning, our engineers sounded the alarms ... and we have installed a digital version of a traffic cop. We enacted stopgaps that we planned for last night. We had hoped we didn't have to."" The office of the chief administrative officer of the House of Representatives issued a statement Tuesday saying: ""This measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional Web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system. Engineers are working diligently to accommodate this enormous traffic flow and we appreciate your patience in this matter."" Now, when House.gov or individual members' sites begin to get overloaded, a message will come up on the computer screen saying, in effect, ""try back later,"" Ventura said. ""This really tells us that the level of constituent engagement on this issue is extremely high,"" he added. He said after the failed vote Monday and the initial backlash, the House's Web site administrators thought there would be a drop in Web traffic -- especially with the Rosh Hashanah holiday. ""We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday,"" Ventura said. He predicted that traffic on those Web sites ""would start to subside once there's some guidance on the marketplace and political landscape about what comes next."" Ventura said the House.gov Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days.","Web sites of the House of Representatives are overwhelmed with e-mails .

"Ocean City, Maryland (CNN) -- Residents in several major East Coast cities -- including Washington, Philadelphia and New York -- braced late Saturday for the impact from Hurricane Irene. By Saturday evening, the storm had already knocked out power in more than a million homes, forced more than a million people off the New Jersey shore alone and caused at least nine deaths. Irene weakened somewhat since coming ashore early Saturday near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and it is expected to slowly lose more strength overnight. But it is still a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds around 80 mph and extending 85 miles from its center. Forecasters expect it to remain a hurricane until it once again makes landfall Sunday afternoon in southern New England. While the vast majority heeded calls to evacuate, emergency officials continued to plead with some stubborn residents to head to high ground, warning that heavy rains and a storm surge of 4 to 8 feet could cause widespread flooding of low-lying areas and pose untold dangers to residents from Virginia to Massachusetts. ""Living in New York City all my life and never experiencing a hurricane before, I have no idea what to expect,"" said CNN iReporter Elie Shaby, who lives one block north of where authorities have ordered evacuations in Manhattan. Five people died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and three were killed in Virginia due to falling trees, emergency officials said. In addition, a 55-year-old male surfer died around noon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. As of 11 p.m., Irene was 70 miles south-southwest of Ocean City, Maryland, moving north-northeast at 16 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane already had brought 10 to 14 inches of rain to much of North Carolina and was pushing a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane warnings extend up the coast to Cape Cod in Massachusetts, with tropical storm warnings issued for parts of coastal Canada. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including Virginia and North Carolina. Ed Schaeffer, a spokesman for the Lewes, Delaware, fire department, said between 30 and 40 homes have been damaged -- five of them severely -- though there have been no injuries. ""It's pretty tough, honestly,"" Delaware Gov. Jack Markell said of conditions Saturday night. ""So far, it's still early for us and it's already hitting us pretty hard."" A tornado in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, destroyed five homes and seriously damaged a business Saturday, Sheriff Darryl Liverman told CNN affiliate WITN. Vance County authorities published photos of a home damaged when a tree fell on it and crashed through a bedroom ceiling. It was unclear if anyone was injured. The National Weather Service issued tornado watches -- indicating favorable conditions  for a tornado to form, even when one hasn't been reported yet -- through Sunday morning for several areas, including New Jersey and New York City. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. William Lee, who tracked the storm by air, said he believed Saturday night the worst fears for Irene had not yet come to fruition. ""All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we expected,"" Lee told CNN. ""I've been through several hurricanes and, in comparison to ones like Frederick, Andrew and Hugo, this one (has had) significantly less damage."" As it passed through North Carolina, Irene ripped off roofs and caused other damage to homes and businesses in Hyde and Jones counties, toppled trees that blocked roads and brought down power lines statewide, according to the state emergency management division. ""We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast in some places,"" Brad Nieman of the state's emergency management division said Saturday evening. In Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina -- where a hotel facade, for instance, ripped away and fell into the ocean -- police and public works crews stopped responding to calls because of adverse conditions, the state emergency management division reported. More than half a million people in North Carolina had lost power as of 7 p.m. Saturday, and 5,000 people huddled overnight in 60 shelters around the state, said Brad Neiman from the state's emergency management division. ""We're not seeing catastrophic damage, but there is massive flooding near the coast,"" Neiman said. ""A lot we will figure out at first light (Sunday)."" Authorities in communities across North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland announced curfews. Some banned the sale of alcohol. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a state of emergency, telling residents to be prepared to go without power for up to two weeks. Boston has joined New York, New Jersey and the cities of Philadelphia and Baltimore in suspending all transit service, with no subway and bus service on Sunday. And the Philadelphia International Airport will remain closed until at least 4 p.m. Sunday, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. In Virginia, more than 600,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said. Officials warned people to be prepared to be without power for up to a week. In Newport News, Nate Morris -- a student at Christopher Newport University, about a mile from the ocean -- said he noticed numerous trees and power lines down. ""There were times when you'd walk around or be in the house, and you couldn't hear anything because of the wind and rain,"" Morris told CNN on Saturday night. ""And it sounds it like it will be a very hard night, too."" More than 1 million people on the Jersey shore had joined untold numbers of others from the Carolinas to New England in moving inland or to higher ground, away from the storm's worst impacts, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. Those who remained behind in communities where the storm has yet to hit are making a mistake believing that the storm is too weak to do any damage, said Craig Fugate, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator. ""Some of our most devastating floods have occurred in tropical storms,"" he said. The hold-outs included 92 residents of Atlantic City high-rises, many of them elderly, who refused pleas from Christie and others to get a free ride out of the danger zone. Mayor Lorenzo T. Langford told CNN on Saturday night that 94 of those inside had responded to the latest call by authorities to get out. ""We've made three sweeps, the most recent sweep probably was the last one,"" Langford said, adding that about 90% of the city's residents had evacuated. ""We've admonished them to leave when they could."" In New York -- where the city ordered the unprecedented evacuation of 370,000 people from low-lying areas on Friday-- even residents who aren't being ordered to leave could face an arduous few days following Irene's tour of the city. The city's transit system, shut down Saturday, may not be fully running again until Monday at the earliest, high-rise buildings are being instructed to turn off elevators and utility ConEd may have to cut power to Manhattan, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. ""This is a storm where, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it can be fatal,"" he warned. CNN's Chris Boyette, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Lawrence, Greg Botelho, Jason Carroll, David Mattingly, John Zarrella, Kimberly Segal, Sarah Hoye, Kristina Sgueglia, Rafael Romo, Eden Pontz and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.","NEW: Delaware's governor: ""It's still early for us and it's already hitting us pretty hard""

"El Salvador's Chaparrastique volcano erupted Sunday, sending a dark cloud of ash miles into the sky, forcing thousands to evacuate from their homes and snarling travel in the Central American country as airlines canceled flights. ""We are not certain there will be new eruptions, but we can't rule out that possibility either,"" President Mauricio Funes said in a televised address urging residents near the volcano in the department of San Miguel to leave their homes and head to shelters. According to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, the eruption began at 10:30 a.m. and produced a column of gas and ash approximately 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) high. Authorities warned residents not to approach the area near the volcano, which is located in eastern El Salvador. The international airport in San Salvador, the capital, redirected some flights to other airports, including in Guatemala, to avoid the ash. Avianca airlines announced Sunday night that it had canceled 33 flights scheduled to arrive and depart from El Salvador as a precautionary measure due to the ash cloud. Iberia and United Airlines also canceled flights that had been scheduled to arrive in San Salvador Sunday night. This is the first eruption of Chaparrastique in 37 years.","Avianca announces the cancellation of 33 flights into and out of the country .

"Nigeria is not renowned for its golfers, or its golf clubs. Most of its population of 170 million cannot afford to play a sport that is, in most countries around the world, the domain of the moneyed classes. Golf is, however, a measure of a society's aspirations -- and one Nigerian province is aiming high with a development that could mark it as an international destination. ""An up-to-date standard golf course becomes relevant in an economy like ours in Nigeria, that is growing rapidly,"" Cross River State's governor Liyel Imoke told CNN. ""We now see a new emerging middle class, what they used to call the yuppie class. The yuppie generation is here, and they play golf. If Calabar has something to offer, and they come to Calabar, then the people in Calabar benefit from that expenditure."" In the 18th century, Cross River State's capital Calabar was at the center of the African slave trade, with over a million people shipped across the Atlantic from its ports. It now describes itself as the ""People's Paradise,"" due to its lush surrounding rainforest and the picturesque Great Kwa River that borders the east of the city. And in the middle of this jungle, in an old rubber plantation, its government has committed $200 million to develop a golf complex that will help boost the region's economic growth. ""This is part of a wider development, including a conference center, hotel down on the river and some housing,"" says Tim Lobb, a golf architect with Thomson, Perrett & Lobb, the firm overseeing the design and construction of the course. ""The vision from the governor was to create an international destination for Nigerians. We're starting the golf course off in an old rubber plantation. We don't try to clear the whole forest; we selectively clear the golfing corridor. ""What we're trying to do is create a golf course that will look like it's been here for a long time."" Environmental impact? However, some environmentalists are concerned that the construction of golf courses in Cross River State could be damaging to the tropical rainforests that stretch through the region. They are home to endangered species such as the Drill Monkey, and conservation groups believe the natural beauty of the region should be the focus of development, not sport. ""This state has something that is unique,"" says Peter Jenkins, co-founder of the Pandrillus Foundation, a non-profit trust which seeks to protect wildlife. ""We have a forest that no other place in the country has, and we should be very careful that our development goals do not in any way harm the resource that makes it a paradise."" The Cross River State forestry commission describes the region as the ""environmental capital of Nigeria"" on its website. ""We pride ourselves as a biodiversity hotspot, and we want to maintain that,"" commission CEO Odigha Odigha told CNN. ""Our development should be based very seriously on the niche that we have, which is the rainforest."" Growing the game . There are only about 200,000 golfers in Nigeria, an oil-rich nation which has high levels of poverty. There is just one 18-hole golf course in Cross River State, and it is far from a luxury resort -- with its putting greens made of dirt, not grass. Lobb arranged for golf's main ruling body, the R&A, to donate 20 sets of clubs after hearing that kids hit balls around with sticks. Its club pro Peter Simon, who started out as a caddy for one of the members, partly relies on funds from a mentor to be able to play in Nigeria's few tournaments. ""Most of the big players in Nigeria get help from sponsors,"" he said. Across the state border in Akwa Ibom, Uyo is the home of Le Meridien -- a much more upmarket golf club managed by global sports group IMG. It stages amateur and pro events run under its own initiative as there is no official tour structure in Nigeria. ""There are not as many tournaments as we would like, perhaps 10 per annum,"" a golf professional named Michael told CNN. His colleague Emmanuel added: ""We need teachers to concentrate on bringing these young boys who will take over from us, because most of the time they concentrate on playing events."" Nigerian golf needs an overhaul the grassroots up to the top, says Le Meridien's general manager Sam Logan. ""We need to get the PGA of Nigeria stronger,"" he told CNN. ""We need to get the Nigerian Golf Federation organized. Every other amateur body of golf around the world controls the amateur golf -- here there is no control."" Future generations . In the capital Lagos, home to 17 million people, there is a new premier golf development called Lakowe Lakes . ""When you look at the trajectory of growth of golf as a sport in Nigeria, I think for many years to come will outstrip supply,"" says managing director Wale Odutola. ""As more facilities like this, which are of championship standard, come up then it becomes an easier sell for corporates to get involved in the project."" Also in Lagos, the established Ikoyi golf club is leading the way in creating new generations of golfers. It started a juniors program four years ago which has led to graduates playing in overseas events. ""The most important thing is to catch many children, so that they are interested and we can improve the quality of membership in golf,"" says its club captain Ebi Pinnick. Cross River State's government has already moved to encourage more youngsters to take up the sport. ""I've given approval for them to recruit new coaches at the existing facility,"" Imoke said. ""We've introduced programs for training in golf at our secondary schools and I believe that it is catching on. We believe it is important we build a culture of golf.""","Nigeria's Cross River State government is investing $200 million in a golf resort .

"A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck early Sunday off Indonesia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake rattled a remote swath of sea between the Pacific and Indian oceans, north of Australia and east of Timor-Leste, some 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) deep, according to the U.S. agency. It was centered approximately 212 miles (340 kilometers) west-northwest of Saumlaki in Indonesia's Tanimbar Islands, 217 miles east-northeast of Dili, Timor-Leste, and 226 miles of Ambon, Indonesia. Neither the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center nor the Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings or advisories immediately after the tremor.","The quake rattles a remote swath of sea between the Pacific and Indian oceans .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Even as FEMA rushes sandbags, generators and pumps to the flooded Midwest, a government report questions the agency's ability to distribute relief supplies effectively during major disasters. Rex Hipes walks on a sandbag wall Wednesday as Clarksville, Missouri, battles a rising Mississippi River. Field employees for the Federal Emergency Management Agency still rely on ad hoc computer systems and, in some instances, paper forms, to order and distribute goods, said the report, which was released Tuesday. Cots, tarps and other items donated by outside agencies and charities are not easily integrated into FEMA's supply chain, the report said. Field personnel also could place duplicate orders for disaster goods because some of the agency's computer systems don't talk to each other, it said. ""As a result, FEMA may be hindered in its ability to perform disaster response in an effective and timely manner,"" the report said. The report by Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Richard Skinner was written before a series of storms flooded communities in the Midwest this month.  Watch people return to flood-damaged homes in Iowa. » . In a lengthy response, FEMA said it already had identified the same shortcomings, had taken steps to upgrade its logistics systems and was on track to improve other systems in the coming months and years. It was not immediately clear how some of the logistical problems identified in the report might affect relief efforts for this month's flooding, FEMA's biggest challenge since hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. The response to those storms exposed deep flaws within the agency, including breakdowns in its ability to track food, water, ice and other supplies. Congress responded by reorganizing FEMA, with the agency chief reporting directly to the DHS secretary. FEMA maintains eight permanent distribution centers across the United States and its territories that are stockpiled with supplies and office equipment. But FEMA's logistics systems do not track disaster goods from initial shipment to final delivery, Skinner said. During disasters, goods are shipped from the distribution centers to federal operational staging areas, or FOSA locations, and then to state facilities or points where the goods are distributed to victims. The agency's order tracking system follows goods to the FOSA locations but does not track their subsequent distribution, according to the report. FEMA managers must contact field personnel regularly during disasters, forcing the latter to ""spend time and effort"" to track inventory, the report said. Field personnel developed an ""eFOSA system"" to track inventory, but the system does not operate on the FEMA network, the report said. The agency has asked a contractor to upgrade the order tracking system, but field personnel say the upgrade will make the system ""slower and less user-friendly,"" the report said. The system also does not provide information about goods shipped to FOSA locations by other agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers. For instance, it was unable to track cots provided by the American Red Cross during California wildfires in 2007, according to the report. And FEMA personnel use two separate systems to track commodities, such as food and water, and property, such as generators and cell phones, according to the report. ""Without a comprehensive system, FEMA personnel must spend extra time and effort to manage goods,"" the report said. ""For example, when distribution center personnel prepare a kit of furniture and supplies for a field office, it requires numerous steps to complete the shipment.""","Federal report: Communication problems may hinder FEMA's relief effectiveness .

"Dramatic scenes ended a tense hostage situation early Tuesday in Sydney, with sounds of an explosion and gunfire as Australian police stormed a cafe where a gunman had hours earlier taken more than 10 people hostage. ""The whole moment seemed to begin by the escape by our count of six or seven hostages; they ran out from the right-hand side of the cafe and flew down the steps and into the arms of the waiting police,"" Channel 7 reporter Chris Reason told CNN. ""At that point there were a couple of minutes of silence, a police unit moved in; we could see them in dark uniforms, night-vision goggles on, looking toward the door. There was a shot fired -- we think that at that point that it was the gunman firing a shot. We heard from one police officer saying that a hostage was down and at that point the police moved in,"" Reason said. ""We saw a lot of explosive material -- flash bangs as they're called, stun grenades to try to disrupt and startle the gunman as police units moved in from both sides of the cafe to try to get him before he could do any further damage."" Live footage from the scene later showed heavily armed police running toward the Lindt Chocolate Cafe before at least four people were carried away on stretchers. Channel 7 reporter Sean Berry said the scene had been quiet for several hours before police swarmed the area. ""All of a sudden, gunfire, heavily armed police officers -- police en masse -- and those hostages (were) beginning to be brought out,"" he said. On any ordinary workday, the scene in Sydney would have been packed with people crisscrossing Martin Place on their way to work, home and shops. But this week before Christmas, the inner-city streets fell silent. ""It is eerily quiet for the center of the city, which is normally humming with traffic and pedestrians. ... People would be normally walking the streets. They've roped off several blocks around Martin Place,"" said CNN's Anna Coren, who was about a block from the scene. Martin Place is a paved traffic-free zone, a pedestrian-friendly promenade a few blocks from the ferry terminal at Sydney Harbor. It's where people go to meet, have coffee and catch a train. Heavily armed police . Outside the Lindt shop, heavily armed police, some in camouflage gear and armed with sniper rifles, had taken positions as negotiators attempted to talk to the man inside, since identified as Man Haron Monis, also known as Sheikh Haron, a self-styled Muslim cleric. Passers-by were herded back behind police barriers, while surrounding buildings were evacuated. Opposite the Lindt shop is the entrance to the Martin Place underground train station, where trains stopped running during the siege. Beyond the train station are the studios of Australian network Channel 7, whose huge glass windows act as the backdrop for early-morning programming, and where crowds are encouraged to gather. In the early hours of the standoff, the network, a CNN affiliate, turned its cameras around to film across the street. It captured the images that Channel 7 producer Patrick Byrne described as ""shocking and chilling."" ""People were putting their hands up against the panes of glass at the cafe. This was just extraordinary,"" Byrne told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Moments later a black flag bearing white Islamic writing was pressed against the window, drawing gasps from the newsroom, he said. ""We've shut off the monitors that face onto Martin Place for fear that people inside the cafe might be able to see the pictures broadcast,"" Byrne said at the time. Picture emerging of alleged hostage-taker . 'Surreal' scene . Few live images of the cafe were broadcast amid police warnings not to disclose operational matters. Macquarie Radio Network reporter Glenn Wheeler described the scene as ""very surreal."" ""There are literally hundreds or thousands of people wandering around with this expression of bewilderment,"" he told 2GB radio station. ""We can't believe this is happening."" He said hundreds, if not thousands, of people had assembled in nearby Hyde Park after being told to leave the area around Martin Place. Wheeler recounted a conversation he had with two German tourists who said, ""We thought Sydney was safe."" It was a sentiment that was apparent in the street and on social media. While Australia's operating under a ""high"" terror alert, a high-profile attack in Sydney's central business district was unexpected and unprecedented. Authorities are not explicitly referring to the incident as a ""terror attack,"" but New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert."" Sydney residents expressed their shock and dismay. ""It's probably the first time in Australian history that something this major in regards to a terrorist threat has happened,"" Joshua Martin told Reuters. 'High' terror alert . The hostage situation follows dozens of police terror raids in the city that have strained relations with the local Muslim community. Amid reports that as many as 100 Australians had left the country to support ISIS' quest to create a so-called Islamic State, authorities introduced tough new terror laws. The new regulations give authorities the power to imprison people for ""advocating terrorism."" They also criminalize travel to areas deemed by Australia's foreign minister as ""no-go"" zones, and impose stiff penalties for Australian citizens who leave the country to engage in foreign wars. In September, Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised the country's terror threat level to ""high"" but said there had been ""no specific intelligence of particular plots."" ""What we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks,"" Abbott said. A week later, he announced a terror plot to decapitate members of the public had been foiled.","Explosions and gunfire heard as police storm Sydney cafe, ending siege .

"(CNN) -- Brett Favre's 297-game NFL record for consecutive starts for quarterbacks won't be getting any longer. The 41-year-old ""Iron Man,"" who has held the record since 1999, was out for Monday night's game against the New York Giants, Vikings spokesman Jeff Anderson said. Favre sprained a joint in his throwing arm during last week's game against the Buffalo Bills and didn't throw a ball during Saturday's walk-through. He had limited participation in Friday's practice, the first time all week he participated at all. He got a reprieve Sunday, the scheduled date for the game with the Giants. The Vikings were forced to reschedule the game when the inflatable roof of the Metrodome collapsed under 16 inches of snow. The game was played Monday in Detroit. Favre, knocked out of last week's game on his first passing attempt, has started every game since the fourth game of his 1992 season with the Green Bay Packers. He started every game in the 2008 season with the New York Jets, and every game since joining the Vikings in 2009. Including playoff games, he's started an almost unbelievable 321 consecutive games. That lengthy career means a lot more records -- he is the only NFL quarterback to throw more than 500 touchdown passes or to pass for more than 70,000 yards, among many others. His 297 straight starts puts him first for all non-special teams players as well as quarterbacks. He took over the quarterbacks lead in consecutive starts on November 7, 1999, against the Chicago Bears. It was his 117th consecutive start, putting him one ahead of the then-record holder, Ron Jaworski of the Philadelphia Eagles. Jaworski held the record since 1984. Favre's record is likely to stand for at least six years, which is how long it would take Favre's nearest competitor in this department -- Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts -- to catch him. Manning, who has started all his games with the Colts, beginning in September 1998, has 205 consecutive starts.","Brett Favre has 297 consecutive starts -- tops for quarterbacks and non-special teams players .

"A Kentucky firefighter has died, weeks after participating in an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that went horribly wrong. Electricity from a power line shocked four firefighters on a ladder as they sprayed water on a group of college students below who were trying to pull off the charity stunt. Crews from the Fire and Rescue Department in Campbellsville were helping the Campbellsville University band with their video ""Challenge"" August 21. Capt. Tony Grider died Saturday from burn-related injuries, according to dispatcher Mark Coker with the Campbellsville-Tyler 911 Center. The 41-year-old's body was driven, accompanied by an official escort, to his hometown of Columbia, Kentucky,  and transferred to Grissom-Martin Funeral Home. There are no details yet about his funeral, Coker said. The fire department posted a message on Facebook which included a ""thank you"" from Grider's family to the nurses and doctors who tried to save his life, and the firefighters who spent time at the hospital hoping that he would recover. Grider leaves behind a wife and children. They all lived in the same home with his parents in Columbia. Firefighter Simon Alex Quinn, also injured in the Ice Bucket Challenge, was released from the hospital Tuesday, according to Coker. During the ALS stunt, Grider and Quinn were inside a bucket on a ladder above the students. When they finished dumping water, the students left and the firefighters began moving the ladder, authorities told CNN. The bucket came close to power lines and shocked the men, officials said. Two firefighters who were on the ground -- Capt. Steve Marrs, 37, and Alex Johnson, 28 -- were shocked when they tried to lower the bucket and an electric current traveled down the extended ladder, Campbellsville Police Chief Tim Hazlette said at the time. Marrs and Johnson were taken to the hospital and later released, he said. Friend of man behind challenge dies . An investigation is ongoing. Hazlette told CNN in August that the ladder did not actually touch the power lines. The power company told investigators that if one gets within a distance of three to four feet from a power line, the energy that surrounds the voltage wire can arc and electrocute other objects, Hazlette told CNN. That's what authorities believe  happened in this case. Celebs embrace Ice Bucket Challenge .","Capt. Tony Grider died Saturday of burn-related injuries, authorities said .

"Rahm Emanuel is building a Second City. Two cities really, as the ""two summers"" theme shown in Episode 4 of ""Chicagoland"" suggests. One white, one black. One for the rich, one for the poor. One for private schools, one for closed schools. A new Chicago for the saved and the damned. Gold coast heavens and low-end hells. It's biblical, binary. The mayor's new Chicago is a second city for the first citizens who colonized the land and took it from the Pottawatomie. The mayor's vision is not for most Chicagoans who live here now. It is not for Jason Barrett. In last week's ""Chicagoland"" episode, Principal Elizabeth Dozier of Fenger High School secures the early release of Barrett, who she is mentoring. But he is re-arrested and becomes one of the thousands of black and brown bodies disproportionately locked up and routed into America's growing, often privatized, prison system. The mayor's new Chicago is not for black and brown and white workers who toil in multiple service sector jobs that the mayor's neo-liberal economic advisers hail as job creation. In fact Emanuel and his advisers have been the proponents of a global economic policy that packs up the kind of blue collar jobs that built Chicago and sends them south with ease: Emanuel championed NAFTA at the Clinton White House. The Chicago that the mayor and his team of wealthy financiers are continuing to create and sell is a second city of tourists and grand inequities. The disparity gap grows between those who have and those who have to rent. Those who can afford private schools like the mayor's children and those whose public neighborhood schools are underfunded and tracked and given impossible and idiotic standardized tests to validate their existence. The new Chicago is for new businesses that will be lured with tax-free incentives, gaining advantages they won't have to pay back in order to be responsible citizens. The new Chicago is based on old European models of urban planning, concentric zones of wealth where working and poor people are pushed to the margins of the land and public discourse. The mayor is like a suburban kid back in the city with his parents' money who wants to go to Lollapalooza. When the list of 50 school closings in mostly black and brown neighborhoods was leaked, he was skiing on spring break in Utah. This month when a group of poets from the Chicago public high school Team Englewood hoped to speak to the mayor directly at Louder Than A Bomb: The Chicago Youth Poetry Festival, he chose instead, the same night, to be on a giant swing at a $450-a-ticket gala, eating a $1,000 priced meal, served by a celebrity chef. The slick series ""Chicagoland"" glosses over issues such as economic injustice, white supremacy, the declining middle class and the school to prison pipeline. Chicago on TV appears in a vacuum, rather than in the torrent of history. Police Chief Garry McCarthy's stop-and-frisk policy is a continuation of America's long history of criminalizing and dehumanizing black and brown bodies. Police force and presence in neighborhoods is sometimes the cause of violence and destruction rather than its cessation. Chicago is, after all, the home of Jon Burge, a Chicago police commander who was fired for torture and later convicted of lying about the practice. It was also the home of Rekia Boyd, an unarmed young black woman shot and killed by a Chicago police detective. The mayor maintains systemic inequity and champions individual exceptionalism. In Episode 4, the gracious white mayor provides an internship for one young black man while his city locks up thousands. Recidivism and the school to prison pipeline is the ""real graduation"" to paraphrase the most honest articulation of Episode 4 from an interview with an unnamed prisoner. The dismantling of public education in Chicago is a pathway toward a privatized school system living at the center of the Department of Education in Washington. The mayor and his cronies are the architects of these blueprints concerned with standardized tests but not standards for every student's academic success and environment. Until they hold the system to the standards they demand for their own children, for all children, schools will continue to fail students they seek to teach. The mayor is not a mentor or educator. He is a millionaire businessman. In Episode 4, he walks around after-school programs patting black kids on the head like some king. He considers himself a white savior, but he is something antithetical. In Episode 4, he says he gives kids a second chance. But it is certain the schools and the city will fail students of color and send them to the largest jail in the country. Chance, the incredibly gifted hyper-literate emergent hip-hop superstar at the center of Episode 4 and at the center of a youth cultural renaissance in Chicago, succeeds despite the school system he was suspended from and because of a strong two parent household, an informal network of aunties in the working class community of Chatham, and a cadre of arts programs. Those include Young Chicago Authors and Louder Than A Bomb, where I serve as artistic director and had the privilege of mentoring the young rapper, where he was able to develop his voice and craft outside of the school day. Chance is not an anomaly when it comes to the brilliance of young Chicagoans and the contributions they have to share with the world. He is in the great tradition of Chicago realist working class portraiture. Chance is connected aesthetically and spiritually to Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, Studs Terkel and Kanye West, when he rhymes on Nostalgia from his mix-tape ""10DAY"": . Round here we lose best friends like every week . I like to think we playin' a long game of hide and go seek . And one day maybe ... I could lead them . Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom ... As Chicago goes, so goes the country. And we are here fighting for freedom, for all, for every person from every zip code. We are fighting for the soul of the city, the soul of the country. We are building again, indeed, a second city, as we derive our nickname from the ability to rise after the ashes and great fire of 1871. Chicagoans have the ability to rise like a phoenix. This is a testament to the resiliency of hard working people everywhere, not the backroom dealings of a millionaire mayor or his posse. We are the city of the eight-hour workday and the Haymarket martyrs. The home of Margaret Burroughs and Fred Hampton, home of Jane Addams and the mothers of Whittier Elementary School. A city of genius and gangsters. This is a writer's and fighter's town as Nelson Algren would say. And this is a fight to counter the mayor's vision of a future city, of two cities. We are trying to write and fight for a united city, a different city. A second city. A new city, a city anew, a city for all.

"Coast Guard crews are teaming with Royal Dutch Shell to keep one of the oil company's drilling unit from running aground amid terrible weather in Alaska, the Coast Guard said Monday. Crews of two Shell-contracted tug boats were able Monday secure towing lines to the drilling rig Kulluk, which went adrift for 10 hours on Sunday while being shuttled to Seattle. The Coast Guard said it planned to use helicopters to land technicians aboard the drilling rig. ""We have a brief weather window which provides the opportunity to get experts aboard the Kulluk to inspect the drilling unit and its tow set-up,"" said Rear Adm. Thomas Ostebo, commander of the Coast Guard 17th District. ""They will provide key on-site information about towing issues or concerns and allow the Unified Command to develop contingency plans accordingly."" Forecasters predicted the wind in the area, about 19 miles from Kodiak Island off the southern Alaska coast, to exceed 60 mph on Monday night. Waves could reach as high as 28 feet, the Coast Guard said. ""Ensuring the safety of personnel and protecting the area's environment continue to be of the utmost importance,"" Shell said in a statement. The Kulluk finished drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea in October and was headed to its winter home with a crew of 18 when the tug boat that was towing it lost power. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said there was no spill in that incident. The Coast Guard helped evacuate the crew on Saturday. No one was injured, Shell said. Two other response ships and a Coast Guard cutter are nearby as the tugs wait to steer the Kulluk toward a safe harbor, the Coast Guard said.","Royal Dutch Shell had finished drilling for year, rig was being towed to Seattle .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma death row inmate received a drug commonly used to euthanize animals Thursday because of a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental, the drug usually used as the sedative in its three-drug execution cocktail. John David Duty was convicted and sentenced to die for strangling his 22-year-old cellmate, Curtis Wise, with shoe laces in 2001. At the time, he was serving three life sentences for rape, robbery and shooting with intent to kill from a 1978 conviction. ""To the family of Curtis Wise, I'd like to make my apology. I hope one day you will be able to forgive me, not for my sake but for your own. My family and friends are here too. Thank you. You've all been a blessing. Thank you. Lord Jesus, I am ready to go home,"" Duty said before he was executed. Duty's execution was the last in the United States in 2010 and is believed to be the first in the country to use pentobarbital in a lethal injection. Sodium thiopental is a rapid-onset, short-acting barbiturate that causes unconsciousness. Duty's attorneys argued that pentobarbital was risky and unsafe. But an Oklahoma judge disagreed and last month approved its use in place of sodium thiopental. The sedative is the first drug in Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. It is followed by vecuronium bromide, a drug that causes paralysis and stops breathing. The third drug, potassium chloride, stops the heart. Pentobarbital is used in a similar manner for animal euthanizations.","NEW: John David Duty pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. CT .

"London (CNN) -- The president of Rwanda on Thursday denied as ""absurd"" reports that Tutsis entered the Democratic Republic of Congo over the course of 10 years and massacred Hutu refugees there. ""If it happened, if it ever happened, that would be a problem,"" President Paul Kagame told Becky Anderson on CNNI's ""Connect the World."" ""But, as far as I'm concerned -- and as I know, and as many Rwandans know -- that it did not happen,"" he said. But a draft U.N. report is the latest to allege that the Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutu in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1993 and 2003. More than 1 million Rwandans -- most of them Hutu -- fled west to neighboring Congo after the Rwandan genocide of 1994, in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by extremist Hutu militia in a wave of ethnic cleansing. In 1996, Rwanda invaded Congo in pursuit of the genocide orchestrators. Rwanda's stated goal during that time was to end the refugee crisis in eastern Congo. But the U.N. draft report says that the Rwandan military did not discriminate between fugitives and refugees, nor did it discriminate by age or gender. ""The majority of the victims were children, women, elderly people and the sick, who posed no threat to the attacking forces,"" it says. ""Tens of thousands of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives, bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading . to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,"" the draft report says. ""The numerous attacks against the Hutus in Zaire, who were not part of the refugees, seem to confirm that it was all Hutus, as such,"" it says. Although independent researchers have documented crimes against humanity committed by the Rwandan government, the draft report is the most official and forthcoming accusation made so far. The draft report, which was leaked late last month, was commissioned by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has said the final report will be made public next month. Kagame has rejected the draft's findings and threatened to pull Rwanda's peacekeeping forces out of Darfur in southern Sudan if the report is published unchanged. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Kigali in an attempt to mollify Kagame and keep him from carrying out his threat. Such accusations against Rwanda are motivated by people attempting to ""create an equivalence,"" Kagame said. ""They have been trying to say ... there are two genocides: There is one genocide of Tutsis and there is another genocide of Hutus."" He added, ""This is nonsense; this is absurd."" Asked if the United Nations was wrong in its conclusion, he said, ""The U.N. has always been wrong on the issue of Rwanda, not only in terms of statements, but in terms of actions they carried out or did not carry out when they were in Rwanda and the genocide took place."" He added, ""They should just keep quiet."" But he did not deny that deaths occurred. ""Certainly, there are -- there is death when there is war, when there is a conflict."" The bottom line, he said, is that Rwanda is currently at peace, and the conflict is no longer an issue. ""We have overcome the past, the tragedy, the different problems,"" he said. ""We are moving on."" Kagame, who recently won a second seven-year term as president, said he will not seek a third term. ""This is my last term,"" he said, vowing to observe constitutional term limits that would bar him from running again.","Rwandan president denies massacre of Hutus in neighboring Dem.

"(CNN)Two white specks appearing next to Pluto in the blackness of space may look like faint blips on a screen. Don't be fooled. The fuzzy images of moons that NASA New Horizons spacecraft are sending back to Earth are a slim crack in a door opening on a vast territory humankind has not seen clearly before. And the door will slowly swing open week by week. Traveling at 1,000,000 miles per day, one of the fastest space vehicles ever made is extending human sight to Pluto and beyond to spy out details the Hubble Space Telescope hasn't been able to see. Even at that speed, it took more than nine years to get this close. New Horizons launched in January 2006. The snaps published this week of Nix and Hydra -- as moons go, both runts the size of large asteroids -- are only a prelude. Starting in April, for the first time ever, we will begin raising the curtain on Pluto's surface in ever increasing detail. Expect surprises. NASA has likened it to the myths dispelled, when the Mariner 4 spacecraft sent back first images of the surface of Mars in 1965. Until then, many scientists thought they'd see water and vegetation on our neighbor. Mariner 4 hit them instead with a vast rocky desert. New Horizons, built and operated by Johns Hopkins University, will make its closest pass in July. Eye popping images will come. The on-board camera is powerful enough to recognize objects the size of buildings on Pluto's surface. What we will see is such a mystery that NASA doesn't speculate much on it. Perhaps the surface will have ice geysers. New Horizons took images of similar spouts as it passed by Jupiter. Maybe Pluto has rings like Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Multiple other instruments will inspect Pluto's atmosphere. By approaching Pluto, which NASA classifies as a dwarf planet, New Horizons will also reach a new region of our solar system, which astronomers divide into classes of planet make-up. Earth and its neighbors are rocky, earthy planets. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are gas planets. Pluto and its partner Charon, called by some its moon, are covered in ice. But there's more. Pluto is part of the Kuiper Belt, a collection of rough celestial bodies that orbit around the sun like the asteroid belt, but it's interminably larger. If the asteroid belt were a thread, the Kuiper Belt would be a strap. It is known for producing comets, such as Halley's Comet, which orbits the sun about every 75 years. New Horizon could get quiet after passing Pluto, but if NASA approves, in two years, the spacecraft will go to an additional object or two in that belt.","New Horizons satellite sends images of two of Pluto's moons back to Earth .

"The body of a man swept away while swimming in a rain-swollen creek in western North Carolina was found Sunday, authorities said. The body of a child who was dragged away by the swift currents was recovered Saturday evening. The drownings happened after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours in North Carolina's Piedmont region, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County. First responders stayed busy racing to save people stuck in fast-moving waters and closed dozens of roads Saturday because of major flooding. Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together  -- were both swimming in what is known as the ""bathtub"" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. Rain, which had already stopped, raised Wilson Creek 2 feet above normal levels and created ""very swift currents,"" according to a statement from the sheriff's department. Kayakers found Delilah's body nearly an hour after she disappeared, it said. Search and rescue crews found Alberdi on Sunday, about a quarter mile north of where they were first told he went into the water, according to LouAnne Kincaid, a spokeswoman for Caldwell County. Catawba County officials reported 10 swiftwater rescues for residents needing help getting out of their homes and vehicles Saturday afternoon, said Mark Pettit, an emergency official in the county. Some 52 roads in the inland county had been closed at that point, six of which might not see any traffic for as long as three months, according to Pettit. Lincoln County -- which is just south of Catawba County and about 35 miles northwest of Charlotte -- saw 8 to 10 inches of rain in 12 hours, county emergency management spokesman Dion Burleson said. First responders had done as many as five rescues by late Saturday afternoon, Burleson said, though things appeared to be on the upswing. The spokesman said the water rescue operation had been demobilized because waters were receding.","Search crews find body of a 48-year-old swimmer from Huntersville .

"(CNN) -- A Dutch lawmaker's film critical of Islam has been posted on a London-based Web site, though other Web sites and hosts have refused to air the film and the U.S. government has warned that it could spark protests and riots. Geert Wilders' 15-minute film, ""Fitna,"" Thursday was the top film posted on LiveLeak.com in both English and Dutch. In Arabic, its title means ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. Wilders, a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom, has been outspoken in his criticism of Islam and his support of immigration restrictions. He says Islam and the Quran are a long-term threat to the Netherlands and the world, and that his film is a ""last warning."" ""It's not a provocation, but the harsh reality and a political conclusion,"" Wilders told reporters on Thursday. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende rejected the film in a statement Thursday, saying, ""The film equates Islam with violence. We reject this interpretation. The vast majority of Muslims reject extremism and violence. In fact, the victims are often also Muslims."" The film opens with a controversial caricature of Islam's prophet, Mohammed -- one of those that prompted demonstrations in early 2006 after newspapers published the images -- followed by translated portions of the Quran. The passages are followed by graphic images of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States juxtaposed with audio from 911 calls made by the victims trapped inside the World Trade Center in New York. The video includes disturbing images of other terror attacks; bloodied victims; beheadings of hostages; executions of women in hijab, the traditional full-body attire; and footage, with English subtitles, of Islamic leaders preaching inflammatory sermons against Jews and Christians. In one sequence, the film includes a series of newspaper headlines suggesting that Europe is under threat from Islamic beliefs and practices hostile to democracy, and that some Muslims want to create Islamic states in Europe. The film concludes with scrolling messages reading in part: ""The government insists that you respect Islam, but Islam has no respect for you"" and ""In 1945, Nazism was defeated in Europe. In 1989, communism was defeated in Europe. Now the Islamic ideology has to be defeated."" Another film -- ""About Fitna, the Netherlands and Wilders"" from Radio Netherlands Worldwide -- is posted on LiveLeak.com as a counterargument to ""Fitna."" It questions the lawmaker's motives and criticizes the Dutch government for not reprimanding Wilders. LiveLeak issued a statement Thursday saying the site ""has a strict stance on remaining unbiased and allowing freedom of speech as so far as the law and our rules allow."" On the site, LiveLeak's posting rules include a ban on illegal media, such as child pornography, and videos glorifying death with ""gory scenes with no explanation and/or set to music."" LiveLeak officials referred questions about posting ""Fitna"" to a statement issued Monday that says, ""There was no legal reason to refuse Geert Wilders the right to post his film."" However, the statement adds, ""To many of us involved in LiveLeak.com, some of the messages therein are personally offensive. That being said, our being offended is no reason to deny Mr. Wilders the right to have his film seen."" Some in the Muslim community rejected the film as nothing more than dangerous anti-Islamic propaganda. ""This film is a direct attempt to incite violence from Muslims and help fan the flames of Islamophobia,"" Arsalan Iftikhar, a contributor to Washington-based Islamica Magazine, told CNN on Thursday. ""Any reasonable person can see this is meant to spit in the face of Muslims and insult our religion."" However, he called on Muslim leaders to react peacefully: ""Calmer heads should prevail."" Iftikhar said he doubted the film would spark the same type of violence that followed the caricature of Mohammed, adding, ""We in the global community learned a lot from the Danish cartoon controversy ... I don't think it will be anything remotely like that."" Balkenende said the Dutch government is aware of the concerns among Muslims about the film. ""We have recently spoken with many people at home and abroad to promote mutual understanding,"" he said. ""We will continue to follow this course."" Wilders said he hopes that the film does not result in violence. But, ""should this happen, which I don't hope, then it's the people who use violence or threats who are responsible."" This week, a Web site promoting ""Fitna"" was suspended by its host company after the firm received unspecified complaints about its content. ""This site has been suspended while Network Solutions is investigating whether the site's content is in violation of the Network Solutions Acceptable Use Policy,"" the company said in a posting on the Web site set up to promote the film. ""Network Solutions has received a number of complaints regarding this site that are under investigation."" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI also warned this month that the release of Wilders' film could spark protests and riots. Last month, Pakistan's government blocked the popular video-sharing Web site YouTube because of a ""highly blasphemous"" and ""anti-Quranic"" video featuring Wilders, according to a government news release. The video was reportedly a trailer for his movie. E-mail to a friend .","Britain-based LiveLeak.com posts ""Fitna,"" a film by Geert Wilders .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A Colorado man was convicted of first-degree murder and a bias-motivated crime and sentenced to life in prison for killing a transgender teen he met on an online social networking site. Allen Andrade was convicted of first-degree murder and a hate crime in the slaying of a transgender teen. It was the first time in the nation that a state hate crime statute resulted in a conviction in a transgender person's murder, the advocacy group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said. Seated in the front row of the courtroom, the family of Angie Zapata broke out in tears as the verdicts against Allen Andrade were read Wednesday. The jury deliberated for just under two hours before returning the verdict shortly after 3 p.m.  Watch Andrade listen to the verdict » . ""I lost somebody so precious,"" said Maria Zapata, the victim's mother. She glanced at Andrade and continued: ""The only thing he can't take away is the love and the memories that I have of my baby. My beautiful, beautiful baby."" Andrade spoke just one word. ""No,"" he said when asked if he wished to address the court. Judge Marcelo Kopcow then imposed the mandatory sentence for the first-degree murder conviction -- life in prison without parole.  Watch Andrade get sentenced to life without parole » . The verdict was hailed by gay and transgender rights groups. ""This is a landmark decision,"" said Mindy Barton, the legal director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center of Colorado. Barton attended the trial daily. ""Hearing 'guilty on first-degree murder' and 'guilty of bias-motivated crime' was a hugely emotional experience for all the family, friends and the supporters of Angie,"" Barton added. ""She will not be forgotten."" Andrade admitted killing Zapata, but his defense argued that he acted in the heat of passion after discovering that Zapata was biologically male. The defense asked for a lesser verdict, such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Throughout the trial, prosecutors referred to Zapata as ""she,"" while the defense referred to the transgender teen, who was born Justin Zapata, as ""he."" ""When [Andrade] met him, he met him as 'Angie,' "" defense attorney Annette Kundelius argued on Wednesday. ""When he found out it wasn't 'Angie,' that it was 'Justin,' he lost control."" But the jury rejected the argument, deciding in favor of prosecutors, who argued that Andrade knew Zapata was biologically male and that knowledge motivated the crime. ""This was an ambush attack,"" said Chief Deputy District Attorney Robb Miller. ""This was an all-out blitz."" Zapata was ""born in a boy's body but living as a female,"" added Miller. ""Ultimately, she was murdered because of it."" The case has become a rallying point for supporters of the transgender community, who have held vigils and launched Web sites in remembrance of Zapata. They are calling for the inclusion of transgender people in hate crime statutes across the country and at the federal level. Currently, 11 states and the District of Columbia recognize transgender people in their hate crime laws. According to prosecutors, Zapata, 18, and Andrade, 32, met online in summer 2008 and arranged to meet. Zapata brought Andrade to her apartment in Greeley, Colorado, where they spent nearly three days together. According to a police affidavit, Zapata was out of the apartment when Andrade noticed photographs that made him ""question victim Zapata's sex."" Andrade confronted Zapata, who declared, ""I am all woman."" Andrade then grabbed Zapata and discovered male genitalia. According to court records, Andrade told police he began hitting Zapata with his fists, knocking her to the ground. He then grabbed a fire extinguisher and twice hit her in the head. Andrade told police he thought he had ""killed it,"" referring to Zapata, and covered her with a blanket. Realizing what he had done, he then cleaned up the crime scene, the affidavit said. Andrade told police he heard ""gurgling"" sounds coming from the victim and saw Zapata sitting up. He hit her again with the fire extinguisher, he said, according to the affidavit. Andrade took Zapata's car and fled. Police discovered the car two weeks later and arrested Andrade. The jury heard jailhouse phone conversations, including Andrade telling a girlfriend ""gay things must die."" He did not testify in his own defense. Zapata was 16 when she adopted the name ""Angie,"" and made the decision to live as a woman.","Allen Andrade guilty of murder, bias crime in teen's slaying .

"As hundreds of firefighters began to get the upper hand on a huge blaze near Colorado Springs, investigators stepped up their probe into the cause of the most destructive wildfire in the state's history. Investigators are treating the 16,000-acre Black Forest Fire, which was 75% contained Monday, as a crime scene, though they don't yet know whether a crime was committed, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said. Authorities are allowing more people to visit their homes by the day -- the mandatory evacuation area covered the homes of 4,100 people Monday, down from tens of thousands last week. But Maketa asked for patience from those still being kept out, citing not only the remaining hot spots, but also the need to preserve evidence. ""When you're talking about a potential for prosecution -- we don't know yet whether it's a crime or not -- we're going to treat it as (if) it is, and preserve every element of that scene as we can,"" Maketa told reporters Monday. ""To allow people go in and trample through ... compromises our scene."" How to help . The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has been called in, along with state authorities. ""We are zeroing in on the point of origin, and it's a very slow, methodical process,"" Maketa said. ""We brought in additional experts to make sure we're not missing anything ... but I'm pleased with the process they are making."" The weather cooperates . Maketa's comments came after fire teams made significant progress against the flames northeast of Colorado Springs over the weekend, with containment growing from 5% to 75% in just a few days' time. And rain could help in the next couple of days. The National Weather Service says highs will be in the upper 70s through Tuesday, with a 30% chance of rain and light winds each day. Temperatures in the 90s, little rain and blustery winds fueled the Black Forest Fire in its early days. Gallery: Wildfire photographer Kari Greer goes inside the inferno . Maketa said Monday that no structures were lost in the fire Sunday. ""Another day of no growth in the fire, no lost structures, and we have begun an aggressive repopulation of some of the mandatory evacuated areas,"" he said. In the first few days after the Black Forest Fire broke out, crews had zero containment on the blaze as it ravaged woods and neighborhoods. County spokesman Dave Rose told CNN it appeared to be the most destructive in the history of Colorado, a state that's all too familiar with devastating wildfires. Residents hope for best, brace for worst . As of Monday, authorities had counted 502 structures lost to the blaze, which started Tuesday, according to the sheriff's department. Two people had died. The speed and intensity of the flames created a pattern where, for the most part, homes either were destroyed or escaped unscathed, Maketa explained over the weekend. In some areas, he said, there's no house, no mailbox and virtually no other signs that someone lived there just a few days ago. ""You can't even recognize where there was a house or some other kind of structure,"" the sheriff said Saturday. ""That is the level of incineration and destruction that took place in some areas."" New grandparents flee with family; fire destroys home . Other Colorado fires . Firefighters also made significant progress on the Royal Gorge Fire, southwest of Colorado Springs, announcing it was 100% contained Sunday night. The fire scorched more than 3,200 acres, including a beloved carousel and at least 20 buildings, according to Gov. John Hickenlooper. ""It's burned to a cinder,"" he said Friday of the area. Video shows firefighters fending off fire from house's deck . The governor has declared a disaster emergency in Rocky Mountain National Park, northwest of Denver, due to the Big Meadows Fire that's burned hundreds of acres there. The latest flare-up is the Ward Gulch Fire in the western part of the state. No structures have been reported destroyed in that blaze, but gusty winds, low humidity and warm weather have firefighters on edge. Woman records wildfire evacuation . While all those fires pose dangers in their own ways, the Black Forest Fire is still by far the biggest and the most dangerous, which is why thousands in that area remain evacuated, their homes in areas where it is too perilous to return. Said Maketa over the weekend: ""We're hoping to gain inches each day to get people's lives back to normal, where it can be returned to normal."" Study warns of continued wildfires in western U.S.","Sheriff: The Black Forest Fire is treated as a crime scene, despite uncertainty .

"Crew members ran for their lives when overhanging metalwork crashed onto a stage in a Toronto park Saturday afternoon, pinning and killing one man, authorities said. The collapse happened around 4 p.m., one hour before spectators were set to begin streaming in for a concert by the alternative rock group Radiohead. Several people were on the stage at the time, preparing for the show, when scaffolding-like material towering about 50 feet above collapsed. ""Unfortunately, four people were hurt,"" Toronto police Constable Tony Vella said. ""The remainder of the people, when they heard the stage coming (down), ran from the area."" Firefighters arrived to find one man ""trapped under the structure,"" said Toronto fire Platoon Chief Tony Bellavance. They helped to extricate the man, then moved away from what was then still considered an ""unstable structure,"" Bellavance added. Paramedics, who happened to be at the scene in preparation for the concert, ""immediately rendered aid,"" according to on-site Toronto Emergency Medical Services commander Peter Rotolo. The victim -- who has not been identified, amid efforts to contact his next of kin -- was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said he was in his 30s. Another man who suffered serious injuries due to the collapse was transported to Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital, Ian McClelland of the city's EMS department said. The 45-year-old man suffered a head injury that isn't considered life-threatening, according to Toronto police. Two other men with minor injuries were assessed and released, McClelland said. Aerial footage afterward showed that some metal framing -- some of it covered in a blue material -- crumpled on the stage, which was in front of a large grassy area. Some of the scaffolding-like material remained standing, reaching about 50 feet in the sky. The stage was being set up especially for the Radiohead concert, Vella said. At the time it came down, the weather was good with no storm rolling through or significant winds, added fellow police Constable Harrison Ford. ""The big question is how"" this happened, Vella said. ""And that's something we will be working closely with the Ministry of Labor to determine (the cause) exactly, to prevent any future cases."" Reports: Indiana State Fair stage where 7 died was inadequate . The gates were scheduled to open at 5 p.m., allowing fans onto the concert grounds for the sold-out concert, according to CNN affiliate CBC. The show was canceled due to what the production company Live Nation Entertainment described as ""unforeseen circumstances."" ""Radiohead concert canceled. There has been an incident, more details forthcoming,"" said a post on Downsview Park's official Facebook page. The band was to be joined by the Canadian musician known as Caribou. The Toronto incident comes 10 months after metal scaffolding supporting stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through at the Indiana State Fair right before the band Sugarland was to perform. Seven died and more than 40 were injured. In February, the Indiana Department of Labor announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse.

"If you care about justice and about the values that our country was founded upon, you will feel sickened by the grand jury's decision not to indict NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the choking death of Eric Garner in Staten Island. The facts in this case are not the same as Ferguson -- they're scarier. In July, Garner, an unarmed father of six children, had just helped break up a fight when police officers arrived and surrounded him. They accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes and tried to arrest him. Garner and the officers soon got into an argument. The officers escalated the situation and moved in on Garner.  Garner put his hands up, and then one officer grabbed him from behind in a chokehold, which is banned by the NYPD. Garner went down, and then it's a pile-on. We know all this because one of Garner's friends caught the entire incident on a phone. The video footage is very hard to watch. You can see multiple officers on Garner. One officer pressed Garner's face into the ground.  The whole time, the chokehold remained tight.  Garner said repeatedly that he ""can't breath"" before dying soon after. The medical examiner ruled it a homicide by choking. Let me repeat the facts. The police used a banned chokehold, on an unarmed man who said he couldn't breath many times, and the medical examiner ruled it a homicide.  And it was all caught on video tape.  What more do you need?  I'm not saying the cop is guilty of murder, but shouldn't he face a jury trial and a full examination of the facts to determine if there was excessive force? If a chokehold is banned by the NYPD, how is it reasonable force to use one? They banned it because it could kill someone. Isn't it ""excessive"" by definition and by law to end the argument with Garner by killing him with a banned procedure? For those of you arguing that Garner was ""resisting arrest"" -- do you really want to live in a country where you could get choked to death if you question why the police officers are targeting you? Do you want to live in a country where your car window will be broken and you will be Tasered in front of your kids if you ask calmly for an explanation as to why you need to step out of the car? Or shot, as you reach into your car for the wallet so you can show the officer your ID? Would it surprise you to learn that the police reports on Garner's death failed to mention the chokehold?  It doesn't surprise me -- why would the police self-report? Furthermore, grand juries are not the proper tool to determine whether police have committed crimes in the line of duty. Ironically, grand juries were created by our founding fathers to PROTECT us from overzealous prosecution by the government.  But it has become clear that they've become a tool that has failed to protect citizens from overzealous police. I thought body cameras would help in these types of cases. After the Eric Garner decision, I'm not so sure. A former police officer said to Erin Burnett on CNN that the lesson in this is that people need to ""comply with the police."" Actually, the real lesson here is that we need a major change. We need an independent body, perhaps run by the Attorney General's Office, to be in charge of every police shooting investigation. Every time we see a grand jury return no indictment, it's not only a blow to the victims and their families, it's a blow to the entire justice system.  It's a blow to the vast majority of amazing police officers that suit up and put their lives on the line every day and follow the rules.  It's a blow to the police departments that have worked so hard to foster a trusting partnership with the communities that they police.  It's a blow to the communities that rely on police to keep them safe.  It's a blow to the justice system, because with every one of these announcements, we lose tremendous faith and confidence in the system that was designed to protect us.","Grand Jury decides not to indict a police officer in the choking death of Eric Garner .

"Egypt's former military chief doesn't mince words when he describes what would happen if he wins this month's presidential vote. In a taped interview broadcast on Egyptian satellite networks Monday, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi vowed to finish off the Muslim Brotherhood if he's elected, arguing that's what his country's people want. And he said he had no choice but to run for President. ""Due to the challenges facing Egypt and the targeting of Egypt from inside and outside of the country ... any responsible patriot has a duty toward his country and its future, and has the opportunity to come forward to protect this country, and this people, and their future,"" el-Sisi said. The second part of the interview is due to air Tuesday. El-Sisi deposed Egypt's first freely elected leader, President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule. The officer is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power. His supporters see him as the kind of strongman needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since a popular uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule in 2011. In Monday's interview, he said there had been two attempts to assassinate him, but that didn't stop him from wanting to run for President. ""I believe in fate,"" he said. ""I am not afraid."" He appeared relaxed in the interview, talking about his children and saying his wife had urged him to seek election. El-Sisi resigned from his military post in March to run for the presidency. He'll face just one challenger at the polls, Hamdeen Sabahi, who also had harsh words for the Muslim Brotherhood when he spoke to CNN last month, accusing the group of being ""responsible for bloodshed and sponsoring terrorism in Egypt."" But Sabahi said he would scrap a controversial law enacted last fall and backed by el-Sisi, which places severe restrictions on demonstration in Egypt. ""I will issue a law that protects and regulates, not prevents, demonstration. And I will release all the innocent people who were convicted according to this unconstitutional law, and particularly college students in Egypt who were angry because of the excessive force used by the police,"" he said. In Monday's interview, broadcast on the Egyptian satellite channels CBC and ONTV, el-Sisi defended the protest law, saying that ""irresponsible"" demonstrations threaten the state. Egyptians are scheduled to head to the polls to vote for President on May 26 and 27. Parliamentary elections will be held soon afterward, but dates have not yet been determined, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online reported Monday.

"Syria has shipped out 11% of its chemical weapons stockpile -- falling far short of the February 5 deadline to have all such arms removed from the country, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told CNN Wednesday. The slow pace of removal prompted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to warn last month that all options remain available to force compliance. The OPCW is now in touch with senior Syrian officials to discuss a new schedule going forward. Meanwhile, groups of civilians were evacuating a besieged city Wednesday as opposition leaders unveiled a diplomatic road map they hope will lead their country out of a brutal civil war. At least 200 people had registered to evacuate the Old City of Homs on Wednesday, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society said in a Twitter post. Rasmus Tantholdt, a TV2 Denmark reporter inside the ancient quarter, told CNN he saw two buses packed with civilians arrive at a government-controlled transit point there. While some got ready to leave the quarter where they have been trapped as violence surges, a shipment of humanitarian assistance was delivered to those who decided to stay, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Elsewhere, nearly two dozen airstrikes were carried out on the Yabroud area of the Damascus suburbs, opposition activists said. Subsequent clashes left 11 regime forces dead, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Syrian state media made no mention of the deaths, but said the strikes targeted terrorist hide-outs. Both sides continue to meet for peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, where opposition leaders presented their proposal for a transitional government, Syrian National Coalition spokesman Louay Safi told reporters. Key steps for the proposed government would include: ending violence, releasing prisoners of conscience, maintaining law and order, bringing justice to those responsible for violence and protecting human rights. Syria's warring sides meet again, trade accusations . ""This transitional body is the hope for the Syrian people,"" Safi said. But Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces have regained momentum against a now-fractured opposition, has said he's not looking at the talks as a way to transition out of power. Bouthaina Shaaban, al-Assad's media adviser, said ""not much progress"" had been made in the peace talks. ""We have been discussing trying to reach a joint agenda with the other side. Unfortunately, they came this morning and started talking about the transitional government body,"" she said. ""The first item on the agenda should be combating terrorism, so our delegation did not discuss the transitional government."" Stopping terrorism, she said, is the Syrian people's top priority. ""We want the other side to put this as a primary objective in the agenda,"" she said, ""and unfortunately, so far, we have not succeeded."" The U.N. envoy leading Geneva talks met together with opposition and government representatives Wednesday, the United Nations said. Earlier in the day, he met with Gennady Gatilov, Russia's deputy minister of foreign affairs, the United Nations said. Meanwhile, British investigators from the South East Counter Terrorism Unit searched a home Wednesday in Crawley, Sussex, in connection with last week's suicide bombing in Syria's Aleppo Prison. British public broadcaster BBC reported that the bombing suspect was from Crawley. British authorities declined to comment.

"(CNN) -- Opposition fighters who attacked Alawite villages near the Syrian city of Latakia, killing at least 190 civilians, committed ""serious abuses"" that may amount to crimes against humanity, rights group Human Rights Watch said Friday. The abuses occurred after an opposition offensive on August 4 in which the fighters overran government army positions and occupied more than 10 Alawite villages, the rights group said. Bergen: Syria rebel group's dangerous tie to al Qaeda . Witnesses and survivors described how opposition fighters ""executed residents and opened fire on civilians, sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack, and at other times killing adult male family members, and holding the female relatives and children hostage,"" the Human Rights Watch report said. More than 200 civilians -- the vast majority of them women and children -- are still being held hostage by two opposition groups that led the offensive, the rights group said, citing opposition sources. It named the groups as the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS), which is affiliated with al Qaeda in Iraq, and Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's family belongs to the minority Alawite sect, which is associated with Shia Islam. His government has consistently blamed the country's conflict on ""terrorists"" backed by foreign powers, while his own forces are accused of abuses, including the use of chemical weapons against civilians. The Syrian Coalition, the main opposition alliance, said that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the Human Rights Watch report and that it ""once again disavowed"" the two groups holding the hostages. ""We unequivocally condemn all human rights violations committed by armed groups, including extra-judicial killings and kidnappings,"" it said. The offensive documented in the Human Rights Watch report ""does not represent an effort by the true Syrian opposition, but rather a shameful one-time attack by outlier extremist groups that thrive under the hand of the Assad regime,"" it said. Many ISIS fighters are believed to be foreign jihadists rather than Syrians. 'War crimes' evidence . The evidence collected by Human Rights Watch ""strongly suggests that the serious abuses carried out by the opposition groups on August 4 were not the actions of a group of rogue fighters,"" but were coordinated actions showing premeditation and organization. Human Rights Watch says it believes at least 20 distinct armed opposition groups were involved in the offensive, but it is not clear whether they were all present in the villages on August 4, when most of the abuses are thought to have occurred. Syria's rebels: 20 things you need to know . However, its report says five groups were ""the key fundraisers, organizers, planners, and executors of the attacks"" and ""were clearly present from the outset of the operation."" It says it has evidence ""linking all five to specific incidents that amount to war crimes."" Besides ISIS and Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar, they are listed by Human Rights Watch as Jabhat al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham and Suquor al-Izz. ""The evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch strongly suggests that the killings, hostage taking, and other abuses committed by the opposition forces on August 4 rise to the level of crimes against humanity,"" the report said. ""The scale and organization of these crimes indicate that they were systematic as well as being planned as part of an attack on a civilian population."" Bodies buried in mass graves . To compile the report, titled ""You Can Still See Their Blood,"" Human Rights Watch researchers visited five of the villages involved after August 18, where they spoke to residents and relatives of those killed or missing in the fighting, as well as Syrian army and militia members, emergency responders and opposition members. Its researchers also studied photographs and video footage of the events to corroborate witness accounts, the group said. The team collected the names of 190 civilians who were killed, including 57 women and at least 18 children and 14 elderly men, the report states. ""Given that many residents remain missing, and opposition fighters buried many bodies in mass graves, the total number of dead is likely higher,"" it said. Official says CIA-funded weapons have begun to reach Syrian rebels . ""Human Rights Watch has documented that opposition forces executed or unlawfully killed at least 67 of these 190 civilians even though they were unarmed and trying to flee."" Further investigation is needed to establish exactly how the other residents died, but the indications are that ""most of these individuals were either intentionally or indiscriminately killed by opposition forces,"" it said. The rights group calls on states with influence over the parties involved in the conflict to press them to bring a halt to attacks on civilians. It also urges them to stop selling or supplying arms and ammunition to these groups, ""given compelling evidence that they have committed crimes against humanity, until they stop committing these crimes and perpetrators are fully and appropriately held to account."" Complicated picture . Reports of abuses such as those alleged in the Human Rights Watch report have complicated international efforts to support the opposition to al-Assad's government. In more than two years of conflict, the opposition has fragmented across a wide ideological and geographic spectrum, according to Barak Barfi, a research fellow at the New America Foundation. While some are nationalists are bent on liberating their country from a ruthless regime, others view the conflict as a springboard to a global jihad. The main support for Syrian rebels has so far come from the Persian Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. U.S. aid has been limited largely to nonlethal assistance such as communications gear and medical equipment. In July, the Obama administration began supplying small arms and ammunition to the rebels. But American officials have struggled with how to back opposition groups without providing weapons to those linked to Islamic militants, such as the al-Nusra Front, a group considered the most effective anti-Assad force on the battlefield, but one the United States says has ties to al Qaeda. Meanwhile, fighters from the Lebanon-based Shiite militant group Hezbollah are helping Syrian government forces. A video posted to YouTube this week that purports to show Hezbollah fighters killing injured Syrians has angered many in the region. Hezbollah has not responded to the furor. It is not clear who the alleged victims are.","Opposition fighters committed serious abuses in Alawite villages, rights group says .

"Syrians began destroying their country's chemical weapons program Sunday, according to an international team tasked with overseeing the effort. Syrian personnel are using ""cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy or disable a range of items,"" a news release from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Sunday.  ""This included missile warheads, aerial bombs and mixing and filling equipment."" The OPCW team, which arrived in Damascus on Tuesday, ""are monitoring, verifying and reporting on Syria's compliance with international demands to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities,"" the release said. Security Council OKs Syria resolution, warns of consequences . ""The process will continue in the coming days,"" it said.  The inspectors plan to visit nearly 50 sites as part of the mission, the OPCW said. Some are not convinced the plan will work. A defected Syrian general told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will never give up its chemical stockpile. ""The locations of most of the scientific research centers in Syria and the storage facilities are known and under surveillance, thus, he will give up those centers and facilities for sure without lying. That said, however, Bashar al-Assad will not give up the chemical stockpile,"" said Syrian Brig. Gen. Zaher al-Sakat. Al-Sakat said that he defected from the Syrian military after he was ordered to use chemical agents. He said he swapped the chemicals out for something non-toxic to fool his commanders. The general said that in addition to four secret locations within Syria, the regime is currently transferring chemical weapons to Iraq and Lebanon, an allegation that the commander of the opposition Free Syrian Army, Gen. Salim Idriss, also recently made to Amanpour. Syrian foreign minister at U.N. General Assembly: 'There is no civil war' Lebanon and Iraq denied the claims at the time, and CNN's Barbara Starr reported that, if true, the claim would fundamentally shift the assessments of U.S. intelligence officials. The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously September 27 to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons -- or face consequences. ""Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability,"" Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb.

"(CNN) -- Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, face corruption charges in a scandal that encompassed the Chicago Cubs, President-elect Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat and a children's hospital, according to an affidavit. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich talks to laid-off workers in Chicago on Monday. The men were each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery, authorities said. According to the affidavit outlining some of the charges against the Blagojevich and Harris, here are some of the details that led authorities to charge the officials: . Senate seat . Blagojevich said in phone conversation that he is conspiring to trade the Senate seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama in exchange for positions that Obama has the power to appoint, namely the secretary of health and human services post.  Watch how the FBI's tapes show the governor wanted to trade seat » . In a November 3 conversation with an adviser, Blagojevich discussed receiving a kickback for appointing someone, identified only as ""Senate Candidate 1,"" to the vacant Senate seat. Obama reportedly backed the Senate candidate. ""During the call, Rod Blagojevich stated, 'Unless I get something real good for [Senate Candidate 1], s--t, I'll just send myself, you know what I'm saying?' "" the affidavit says. He later said, ""I'm going to keep this Senate option for me a real possibility, you know, and therefore I can drive a hard bargain. You hear what I'm saying? And if I don't get what I want and I'm not satisfied with it, then I'll just take the Senate seat myself,"" according to the affidavit. The governor said the seat ""is a f---ing valuable thing; you just don't give it away for nothing."" ""Blagojevich has also been intercepted conspiring to sell the Senate seat in exchange for his wife's placement on paid corporate boards or Rod Blagojevich's placement at a private foundation in a significant position with a substantial salary,"" the affidavit says. Intercepted phone calls indicate that the governor also has conspired to sell the Senate seat in exchange for millions of dollars in funding for ""a nonprofit organization that he would start and that would employ him at a substantial salary after he left the governorship,"" according to the affidavit. Tribune Co. Blagojevich and Harris threatened to withhold financial assistance from the Tribune Co. unless the company fired certain editorial board members who had been critical of Blagojevich and had called for the governor's impeachment. The money was related to the sale or financing of Wrigley Field, home stadium of the Chicago Cubs, a team owned by the Tribune Co. The governor instructed Harris to tell the Tribune's financial adviser that the assistance, which Blagojevich estimated to be worth at least $100 million, was contingent on the ouster of several board members. In a November 4 phone call, Blagojevich told Harris to tell the Tribune adviser, ""Our recommendation is fire all those f---ing people, get 'em the f--- out of there and get us some editorial support."" The affidavit gives only one name, Deputy Editorial Page Editor John McCormick. In a follow-up conversation, Harris said he had informed the adviser that the newspaper needed ""wholesale changes"" ""This is a priority. Stay on it, right. I mean, he, he gets the message, doesn't he?"" Blagojevich asked. ""Oh, yeah. He got it loud and clear,"" Harris reportedly replied. In another follow-up conversation, Harris said the Tribune owner told the financial adviser that he ""was very sensitive to our concerns"" and that certain cuts personnel cuts were imminent. On November 21, Harris said he had singled out McCormick ""as somebody who was the most biased and unfair."" Beginning November 30, Blagojevich began talking to a sports consultant and a Cubs officials about making state money available for Wrigley Field. Children's hospital . On October 8, Blagojevich told a person described only as ""Individual A"" that he was willing to make $8 million available for Children's Memorial Hospital, but ""I want to get [Hospital Executive 1] for 50."" Individual A felt that Blagojevich was talking about a $50,000 campaign contribution from the hospital's chief executive officer and that the $8 million referred to a recent commitment by Blagojevich to secure state funds via ""some type of pediatric care reimbursement."" ""Intercepted phone conversations between Rod Blagojevich and others indicate that Rod Blagojevich is contemplating rescinding his commitment of state funds to benefit Children's Memorial Hospital because Hospital Executive 1 has not made a recent campaign contribution,"" the affidavit says.","Affidavit says Blagojevich called Senate seat ""a f---ing valuable thing""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Three American crew members died when a Zimbabwean cargo plane crashed early Saturday at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said. The embassy said one of the injured crew members was also an American. The crash happened at about 8:15 a.m. (7:15 p.m. ET Friday) during takeoff in Shanghai, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. The plane was destined for Harare, Zimbabwe, said the agency. The NTSB is sending an investigation team to site of the accident. Four other people on the plane were seriously injured, and the cause of the crash is not yet known, the NTSB said. Earlier, China's official Xinhua news agency reported that the plane was on its way to Kyrgyzstan and caught fire on takeoff. Thick smoke was seen billowing from the crash site.","Three Americans die when cargo plane crashes at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Picture this: you're sat down for the Football World Cup final, or a long-awaited sequel to the ""Sex and the City"" movie and you're watching all the action unfold in 3-D on your coffee table. The future of television? This image is an impression of what 3D holographic television may look like. It sounds a lot like a wacky dream, but don't be surprised if within our lifetime you find yourself discarding your plasma and LCD sets in exchange for a holographic 3-D television that can put Cristiano Ronaldo in your living room or bring you face-to-face with life-sized versions of your gaming heroes. The reason for renewed optimism in three-dimensional technology is a breakthrough in rewritable and erasable holographic systems made earlier this year by researchers at the University of Arizona. Dr Nasser Peyghambarian, chair of photonics and lasers at the university's Optical Sciences department, told CNN that scientists have broken a barrier by making the first updatable three-dimensional displays with memory. ""This is a prerequisite for any type of moving holographic technology. The way it works presently is not suitable for 3-D images,"" he said. The researchers produced displays that can be erased and rewritten in a matter of minutes. To create television sets the images would need to be changing multiple times each second -- but Peyghambarian is very optimistic this can happen. He said the University of Arizona team, which is now ten-strong, has been working on advancing hologram technology since 1990 -- so this is a major step forward. He believes that much of the difficulty in creating a holographic set has now been overcome. ""It took us a while to make that first breakthrough, but as soon as you have the first element of it working the rest often comes more rapidly,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is trying to make the model better. What we showed is just one color, what we are doing now is trying to use three colors. The original display was four inches by four inches and now we're going for something at least as big as a computer screen."" There are no more great barriers to overcome now, he said. The breakthrough has made some long-time researchers of the technology believe that it could now come to fruition. Tung H. Jeong, a retired physics professor at Lake Forest College outside Chicago who had studied holography since the 1960s told NJ.com; ""When we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms, we are moving toward the possibility of holographic TV ... It has now been shown that physically, it's possible."" And what might these holographic televisions look like? According to Peyghambarian, they could be constructed as a screen on the wall (like flat panel displays) that shows 3-D images, with all the image writing lasers behind the wall; or it could be like a horizontal panel on a table with holographic writing apparatus underneath. So, if this project is realized, you really could have a football match on your coffee table, or horror-movie villains jumping out of your wall. Peyghambarian is also optimistic that the technology could reach the market within five to ten years. He said progress towards a final product should be made much more quickly now that a rewriting method had been found. However, it is fair to say not everyone is as positive about this prospect as Peyghambarian. Justin Lawrence, a lecturer in Electronic Engineering at Bangor University in Wales, told CNN that small steps are being made on technology like 3-D holograms, but, he can't see it being ready for the market in the next ten years. ""It's one thing to demonstrate something in a lab but it's another thing to be able to produce it cheaply and efficiently enough to distribute it to the mass market,"" Lawrence said. Yet, there are reasons to be optimistic that more resources will be channeled into developing this technology more quickly. The Japanese Government is pushing huge financial and technical weight into the development of three-dimensional, virtual-reality television, and the country's Communications Ministry is aiming at having such technology available by 2020. Peyghambarian said there are no major sponsors of the technology at present, but as the breakthroughs continued, he hopes that will change. Even if no major electronics company commit themselves, there is hope that backers could come from outside of the consumer electronics industry, he said. ""It could have some other applications. In training it's useful to show people three-dimensional displays. Also it would be good to show things in 3-D for defense command and control and for surgery,"" he said.","Researchers have created the first rewritable and erasable holographic images .
Holographic televisions could come out of the wall or up from a table .
The 3-D hologram technology could have uses in surgery or in the military ."

"There is only one fairytale story in Spanish soccer this season, but will it have a happy ending? Forget Atletico Madrid's first league title for 18 years, disregard its city neighbor Real concluding an exhaustive wait for ""La Decima"" -- a 10th European Champions League crown. Because this season is all about the ""Miracle of Eibar."" The Basque town has a population of just 27,000 and the club a budget dwarfed by almost all its rivals, yet back-to-back promotions have banked Eibar a place in the big time. Having already guaranteed a top-tier place, Eibar also claimed the Spanish second division title after second-placed Deportivo La Coruna lost 3-1 at Girona on Saturday. For the first time in its 74-year history Eibar will compete in La Liga next season, rubbing shoulders with Real Madrid and Barcelona as well as local rivals Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao. ""I don't know if miracles exist but this is something close to a miracle,"" Alex Aranzabal, club president since 2009, told CNN. However, amid all the emotion and reverence there is a bitter tinge, because like every famous fairytale fable, the threat of tragedy lurks in the background. Despite being self-sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other Spanish clubs -- Eibar could actually be relegated to the third tier of Spanish football. A 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25% of the average expenses of all sides in the second division, excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest. That has hoisted the financial bar way above the head of Eibar, which has responded by launching a share issue to raise the €1.7 million ($2.3 million) needed to take a place at Spain's top table. Unsurprisingly, Aranzabal is unimpressed. While he runs an admittedly small but undoubtedly tight ship, the estimated combined debts of Real Madrid and Barcelona amount to not far off €1 billion ($1.36 billion). ""Even though we have a small budget, we have a different economic model to other clubs in Spain,"" Aranzabal told CNN. ""We have less expenses, fewer outgoings and we always have a small deficit. ""This is something really strange in Spain because almost every team has huge debt, but in our case we have no debt. ""We think it is really unfair because the law was established to assure that all those clubs with a lot of debt had a minimum capital value to attend to all their debts. ""In our case we don't have any debt."" 'Special model' The club's story has struck a chord with football-loving people the world over, and support has been flooding in for its ""Defend Eibar"" campaign. Over €1.25 million ($1.7 million) has already been raised, the club's tentacles spreading far and wide thanks to pledges from China, Australia, Argentina, England, Ireland and many more countries. Crucially, no investor can purchase more than €100,000 worth of shares, ensuring Eibar's principles are kept intact. ""We want the team to remain for the people -- this is one of the ideas of our special model,"" Aranzabal explains. ""We very much appreciate all the help we have had -- it has been surprising for us, a small club in a small town in the Basque mountains. ""We have discovered that we have a story to tell and that people want hear stories like this, that we are fighting against this rule and we have achieved something big. ""I hope we will get the money but we have to keep going -- if we relax it is the shortest way to failure. It will be difficult but we will get it."" Humility and hard work . The question of finance festering in the background has done little to dilute the delirium among Eibar supporters, which pretty much counts as every single inhabitant of the town. Since being formed in 1940 in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, the club has never won a major trophy and only flirted with promotion to La Liga once, in the 2004-05 campaign. A teenage David Silva, now a star for the world champion Spanish national side and English Premier League winner Manchester City, was among its ranks then, as was Gaizka Garitano, the club's current manager. He has led the ""Armeros"" to successive promotions, sticking steadfastly to a culture and identity that has long pervaded the club -- one that embodies the spirit of the tiny town that is equidistant from Bilbao and San Sebastian. ""The secret to their success has been humility, hard work and above everything the spirit of the team,"" says Unai Eraso, an Eibar native who attended his first match at the age of four. ""No-one is above any other. This is indicative of Eibar's culture. The older players teach the younger players how to behave, how to work, how to be a team player. ""These young guys when they become older, they will do the same. It is a culture that is passed down from generation to generation. ""This year is a like a dream. Under no circumstances did we imagine of getting to La Liga. This is a real miracle."" 'All for one, one for all' Mikel Madinabeitia, a journalist with El Diario Vasco, is similarly gushing about the class of 2013-14 and their achievements. ""This is football and it is a dream machine. Football is the only sport that allows such things, it would be impossible in basketball or athletics,"" he told CNN. ""It's a typical rags to riches story. I wrote in my newspaper Eibar has been the D'Artagnan of the second division, with that famous catchphrase 'All for one and one for all.' ""There are no celebrities in this team, no millionaires. Jota Peleteiro is like the artist of the group, similar to David Silva, who played at Eibar. He's so creative."" Promotion may have brought unconfined joy to Eibar, but aside from the financial conundrum, it has also thrown up a different web of problems. Such is Eibar's size and budget, that a summer overhaul is needed if it is to have a chance of holding its own against the best 19 teams in Spain. ""It will be so difficult next season because the competition is so different,"" Madinabeitia said. ""Eibar will be the smallest town in the history of La Liga, with the smallest budget. They will have to change 50% of the team. They have a difficult summer ahead. ""Real Madrid and Barcelona play in another dimension and there are another set of clubs who play for Europe. If they avoid relegation it will be the most important achievement of Eibar."" Welcoming the superstars . But that is for another day. Now it is all about raising the money and daring to dream about life in La Liga alongside the soccer elite. ""The first day of the season will be very emotional. A day to talk about for all the days of your life,"" Madinabeitia said. ""It will be the happiest day of the season when Barcelona come to Ipurua, a historic day. ""Real Madrid played here in the cup some years ago, but not Barcelona. You can imagine the emotion of watching Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at Ipurua."" Aranzabal has barely had time to revel in the club's achievements, being swamped with media requests from around the world as well as spearheading the ""Defend Eibar"" campaign. But the president is determined this historic opportunity won't see a shift in his club's philosophy. ""We won't go crazy wasting a lot of money on getting very expensive players,"" Aranzabal said. ""We want to maintain our team philosophy and do things as we have been doing all these years. ""We will try to adapt to the new situation but without getting crazy. We want to stick to our guns and be true to our history."" Thanks to the record-breaking achievements of their players, it is a history that is becoming far more widely known.","Tiny Eibar promoted to La Liga for the first time in the club's history .

"New York (CNN) -- The federal government moved Thursday to seize assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp., including a Manhattan skyscraper and four mosques, citing alleged links to the Iranian government. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced Thursday's filing of an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of the Alavi Foundation's interest in the 36-story office tower located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The tower is owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company, a partnership between the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp., the Justice Department said. The amended complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli, Iran's largest state-owned financial entity. U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, considered terrorist groups by the United States. Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in any deceptive banking practices. Thursday's amended complaint seeks forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp., including bank accounts owned by 650 Fifth Avenue Company, the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp.; and properties owned by the foundation in New York, Maryland, Virginia, Texas and California. It alleges that the properties were ""involved in and [were] the proceeds of money laundering offenses,"" and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. ""As today's complaint alleges in great detail, the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran,"" Bharara said. ""For two decades, the Alavi Foundation's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials, including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations, in violation of a series of American laws. The Alavi Foundation's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice, and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing."" John Winter, a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation, said his client would challenge the complaint. ""We're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It may take some time, but at the end of this litigation, we're of the mind that we're going to prevail here."" The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual. ""There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants,"" said Yusill Scribner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement. ""The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today's filing."" According to the complaint, the New York tower was built in the 1970s by a nonprofit organization operated by the Shah of Iran to pursue the country's charitable interests in the United States. Bank Melli financed its construction in prime real estate near Rockefeller Center. In 1979, after the Iranian revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran established the Bonyad Mostazafan of New York, since renamed the Alavi Foundation, to take possession of and manage property it had expropriated from the former government, including the Fifth Avenue building. Calls to the Iranian Mission were not immediately returned. The mosques are in New York, Maryland, California and Texas. At the Islamic Institute of New York in Queens, two worshipers said they found out about the move Thursday as they arrived for evening prayers. The front page of the court document stating the terms of the case was tacked to the front door accompanied by a letter from the U.S. Attorney's office to the Mostazafan Foundation. A senior Justice Department official, trying to blunt any criticism from Muslim groups, told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings, not targeting or ""seizing mosques"" as religious-oriented facilities. The mosques just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question, the official said. But, in a statement, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called the move unprecedented and said it may have First Amendment implications. ""Whatever the details of the government's case against the owners of the mosques, as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide,"" said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. He said the move comes at a bad time, given the community's fear of a backlash resulting from a Muslim psychiatrist being charged in the deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood in Texas. Relations between Iran and much of the international community have been tense in recent years over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran states that it wants to develop its nuclear program solely for peaceful purposes; the United States and a number of other countries have said they suspect the oil-rich nation is pursuing a nuclear bomb. In another U.S.-Iran development, President Obama said Thursday in a letter to Congress that the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in 1979 during the Iranian revolution has not ended. ""Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still under way,"" Obama wrote in an official ""notice of continuation"" required to extend the emergency status with Iran beyond the anniversary date of November 14. ""For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2009.""

"A young Yemeni girl stares defiantly into the camera. Her question is a shocking one, coming from an 11-year-old: . ""Would it make you happy to marry me off?"" asks Nada Al-Ahdal. In the nearly two-and-a-half-minute video, which was uploaded to YouTube and quickly went viral, Nada accuses her parents of trying to get her married off in exchange for money. She explains how she doesn't want to be one of Yemen's child brides. ""Death would be a better option for me,"" she declares. Nada also speaks on behalf of other Yemeni girls: ""What about the innocence of childhood? What have the children done wrong so that you would marry them off like that?"" The video, which been seen by millions of people around the world, has put a spotlight once more on Yemen's child marriages. It has also made Nada an online sensation, although questions have been raised: Did her story add up? Was she really being pressured to get married? Nada's parents have repeatedly stressed they have no intention to marry her off. And Seyaj, Yemen's leading child-rights organization, said they believed portions of Nada's story were fabricated. Child brides: No sanctuary for Syria's female refugees . Yemen's history with child marriage . In deeply tribal Yemen, the issue of child marriage is extremely complicated. In 2008, 10-year-old Nujood Ali shocked the world when she went to a court in Sanaa and asked a judge for a divorce. After a highly publicized trial, she was granted one. She became a heroine to those trying to raise awareness about Yemen, where more than half of all young girls are married before age 18, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2009, Yemen's parliament passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 17. But conservative parliamentarians argued the bill violated Islamic law, which does not stipulate a minimum age of marriage, and the bill was never signed. Activist groups and politicians are still trying change the law, but more than 100 leading religious clerics have said restricting the age of marriage is ""un-Islamic."" ""The consequences of child marriage are devastating and long-lasting -- girls are removed from school, their education permanently disrupted, and many suffer chronic health problems as a result of having too many children too soon,"" said Liesl Gerntholtz, director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch. ""It is critical that Yemen takes immediate and concrete steps to protect girls from these abuses, including setting a minimum age of marriage."" Yemeni journalist Hind Aleryani, who interviewed Nada after the release of her video, says child marriage is a terrible problem in Yemen. ""It's common more in the poorer communities,"" Aleryani said. ""There is a proverb, a Yemeni saying: 'Marry an 8-year-old girl, she's guaranteed,' which means the 8-year-old girl is surely a virgin. It's a disgusting saying and inhumane, but it's said by everyone and it's very well-known."" Aleryani adds, however, that there's reason for hope -- explaining how the fact there's been such a huge reaction to Nada's video proves attitudes are beginning to shift there. ""Things changed a lot after the revolution, and now people are more aware of the problem,"" she said. ""Before we used to feel like there's no hope -- you can't do anything about it. Those conservative parties used to be stronger than us, but lately they are not."" Child bride turned scholar: Education is the road out of poverty . Talking to Nada . CNN found Nada a few weeks after the video's release, and she was living with her uncle in Sanaa. She said it wasn't just her immediate family that she ran away from in her hometown of Hodeida. ""I ran away from marriage,"" she said. ""I ran away from ignorance. I ran away from being bought and sold."" Seeming relaxed and happy, Nada showed off Facebook pages featuring her singing, and she talked about the singing group she's a part of -- an unusual sight in conservative, rural Yemen. She said she asked a friend to make the YouTube video so she could tell the world how tough it is for girls there. ""I'd rather commit suicide than get engaged,"" she said. Days later, Yemen's interior ministry, acting with Seyaj, took Nada from her uncle and placed her in a women's shelter. Ramzia Al-Eryani, one of Yemen's leading women's rights activists and president of the Yemen Women's Union, was appointed Nada's temporary legal guardian until the dispute could be settled. Married at 13 to a man in his 70s . The drama came to a head this past weekend, and CNN gained exclusive access as the parties came face to face. Before Nada entered the room, Al-Eryani spoke with both of Nada's parents and her uncle. ""If you love her, save her childhood. ... You all are adults -- you all know what's best for her -- but we need to protect this child,"" Al-Eryani said. Nada entered the room a short time later. Facing her parents, she answered allegations that her story may have been made up. At one point, she asked Al-Eryani, ""Why do you believe them and don't believe me?"" before breaking down in tears. ""I don't care about what's best for the mom or dad or uncle,"" Al-Eryani explained later, ""just what's best for the girl."" Where the truth lies has been hard to determine. In an extraordinary moment during the proceedings, Nada asked for something few in the room were expecting. ""In the countryside, there's no English classes, there's no computer classes,"" she said, talking about her hometown. ""Please let me stay in Sanaa and study here."" All she wants, apparently, is a chance at a better life. And she might get it: At the end of session, they made an agreement: The entire family -- parents and uncle included, are going to move into the house of another relative in Sanaa, to see if they can work it all out together.","In 2½ minute YouTube video, Nada, 11, says death would be better than marriage .

"The clear waters around Bermuda are as picturesque as you can imagine, and the brilliantly colored fish swimming around are like something from a crayon box. But a serious problem lurks behind the beautiful facade: the lionfish. Lionfish are not native to the Atlantic Ocean. The venomous, fast reproducing fish are aggressive eaters and will consume anything and everything, gorging so much they are actually getting liver disease. With no known predators -- except human beings -- they can wipe out 90% of a reef. ""The lionfish invasion is probably the worst environmental disaster the Atlantic will ever face,"" said Graham Maddocks, president and founder of Ocean Support Foundation, which works with the government and research agencies to help reduce the lionfish population in Bermuda. While the problem is only beginning to escalate, many in the marine preservation field are already concerned for the marine life that surrounds the lionfish. Ecologist James Morris with the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science said that while this may not be the worst epidemic the Atlantic Ocean has faced, it does have the makings of a disaster.  He said the lionfish has brought a ""big change in biodiversity,"" and it is what he called ""the most abundant top-level predator on some coral reefs (in the Atlantic)."" Lionfish were first recorded decades ago and their population has grown quickly. They produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs every few days and are sexually mature by 1 year old. Today, you can find them throughout the Amazon, the Bahamas, the Caribbean and in the waters along North Carolina. Invasive species: Eat them before they eat everything . As a non-indigenous species, lionfish are especially dangerous to the ecosystem because fish in the Atlantic lack a native instinct to stay away from them. How did they get there? Ask Florida. Florida pet owners are blamed for their release into unfamiliar waters. Believe it or not, DNA evidence traces all lionfish in the Atlantic back to only six to eight female lionfish. Scientists will tell you it's up to humans, the fish's only known predator, to save the ecosystem. I recently joined Maddocks and his team to get a front-row view into a lionfish hunt. An underwater scheme of this nature requires all the right technology, both to capture the scene visually and for the body to survive extreme depths. To get 200 feet beneath the surface, Maddocks and team had to use rebreathers, which are far more advanced and require more training than your typical tank. We had three GoPro Hero 3 cameras (the waterproof housing works up to 197 feet), with two on head mounts and one on a pole. There were also two Sartec cameras that can go up to 250 feet, and several Liquid Image Egos, which go up to 130 feet. To approach the proper depths at a fast speed, the team clips in to Magnus scooters, which can move divers 250 feet per minute, allowing them to cover more ground. 'Aporkalypse' now? It's a lot of work to capture all this on video, but the documentation is in high demand. The footage is critical because it allows researchers deep insights into the behavior of the lionfish and contributes to the database of information they're building. The team also collects GPS coordinates and fish counts, notes the number of species observed, surveys the stomach contents of each fish captured and more. They can determine if culling an area or hot spot makes a difference 30 days later. ""Scientists are scrambling for the data,"" said Maddocks. These dives are made more complicated by something called ""bottom time."" At deeper dives of 200 feet, these highly trained divers can only stay down for about 25 minutes before they run out of air and decompress their bodies. It's never enough time. At this depth, lionfish in Bermuda are everywhere, and the team caught 16 before they hit the time limit. Then it was my turn. I joined the guys on a 100-foot dive, spears in hand, to get the real experience (spear guns are illegal in Bermuda waters so we had to use a hand-operated elastic type of spear). Despite our weapons, I was shocked to see the lionfish just sit there. It seemed to be baiting us,""Come on hit me."" With 18 venomous spines and no predators, it does have a reason to be fearless. Across Bermuda, residents are also doing their part to try to take control of the lionfish population. There are lionfish tournaments and fish fries, and you can see ""Eat 'em to Beat 'em"" T-shirts throughout the island. To experts like Maddocks, these movements may not be enough. ""It's an infestation,"" Morris said over the phone. ""The Atlantic Ocean is a big place, but the areas being affected are extremely important."" Maddocks agrees. ""I don't know if we can stop the lionfish invasion. This isn't a battle we can win, we can only maintain,"" he said. ""Human beings started this problem. It is our fault they are here. We have to take responsibility and try to fix or hope we can control it."" 2012: Taming the lionfish - Florida fights back against invasive species .","Lionfish are invading the Atlantic ocean, reproducing quickly and consuming local fish .

"The Supreme Court's decision Thursday to uphold the Affordable Care Act means that the predictions about how it will affect Americans remain in place. Obama: Supreme Court ruling on health care a victory for all Americans . The court did rule that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change.  The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states.  The law threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don't participate in the expansion.  The high court said the government must remove that threat. Several groups that follow the health care law closely said they were concerned about the high court's ruling on the Medicaid portion of the law. Read the court ruling (.PDF) Here are some highlights: . The uninsured . The decision leaves in place the so-called individual mandate -- the requirement on Americans to have or buy health insurance beginning in 2014 or face a penalty -- although many are exempt from that provision. In 2014, the penalty will be $285 per family or 1% of income, whichever is greater. By 2016, it goes up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income. Health care exchanges, which are designed to offer cheaper health care plans, remain in place as well. American Cancer Society CEO John Seffrin said his organization was looking at the ruling on Medicaid, and is ""concerned that the decision may limit the expansion of quality coverage to some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens."" The group Health Care for America Now, which spent tens of millions of dollars on ads supporting the health care plan, said it was ""disappointed"" and will work to make sure no states ""choose to exclude the lowest-income uninsured adults from their Medicaid programs."" Medicaid Health Plans of America, the trade group representing Medicaid health plans, praised the court ""for keeping in place key elements of this historic legislation"" and said it remains ""committed to a strong partnership with the states and CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to find a way to cover this population in need."" Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, a physician who staunchly opposed the health care law, told CNN he believes many who would have received Medicaid will now enter the health care exchanges, which offer subsidized plans.  That, he argued, could cost taxpayers billions of dollars across the country. Breaking down the court's decision . The insured . Because the requirement remains for people to have or buy insurance, the revenue stream designed to help pay for the law remains in place.  So insured Americans may be avoiding a spike in premiums that could have resulted if the high court had tossed out the individual mandate but left other requirements on insurers in place. Young adults . Millions of young adults up to age 26 who have gained health insurance due to the law will be able to keep it.  The law requires insurers to cover the children of those they insure up to age 26.  About 2.5 million young adults from age 19 to 25 obtained health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Two of the nation's largest insurers, United Healthcare and Humana, recently announced they would voluntarily maintain some aspects of health care reform, including coverage of adult dependents up to age 26, even if the law was scrapped. People with pre-existing conditions . Since the law remains in place, the requirement that insurers cover people with pre-existing medical conditions remains active. The law also established that children under the age of 19 could no longer have limited benefits or be denied benefits because they had a pre-existing condition. Starting in 2014, the law makes it illegal for any health insurance plan to use pre-existing conditions to exclude, limit or set unrealistic rates on coverage. It also established national high-risk pools that people with such conditions could join sooner to get health insurance.  As of April, a total of only about 67,000 people were enrolled in federally-funded pools established by the health care law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than 13 million American non-elderly adults have been denied insurance specifically because of their medical conditions, according to the Commonwealth Fund.  The Kaiser Family Foundation says 21% of people who apply for health insurance on their own get turned down, are charged a higher price, or offered a plan that excludes coverage for their pre-existing condition. Photos: Who is John Roberts? All taxpayers . No matter what the Supreme Court had decided, it would have been a mixed bag for all Americans when it comes to federal spending.  There is heated dispute over what impact the health care law will have on the country over the long term. The federal government is set to spend more than $1 trillion over the next decade to subsidize coverage and expand eligibility for Medicaid. It is not immediately clear how the high court's ruling on the part of the law dealing with the expansion of Medicaid eligibility could affect spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the law could reduce deficits modestly in the first 10 years and then much more significantly in the second decade. The CBO said a repeal of the mandate could reduce deficits by $282 billion over 10 years, because the government would be subsidizing insurance for fewer people.  But the nation faces costs in various ways for having people who are uninsured.  The Urban Institute's Health Policy Center estimated that without a mandate, 40 million Americans would remain uninsured. Meanwhile, the Flexible Spending Accounts that millions of Americans use to save money tax-free for medical expenses will be sliced under the law.  FSAs often allow people to put aside up to $5,000 pre-tax; as of 2013, they were to face an annual limit of $2,500. Opinion: Are voters ready to move on? Small business owners . The rules and benefits small business owners face as a result of the health care law remain in place. As CNN has chronicled, the law brought a mix of both.  The director of the National Federation of Independent Business is one of the plaintiffs who pushed the court to strike down the law.  Meanwhile, a group called Small Business Majority fought to protect the law, saying its loss could be a nightmare. As of 2014, under the law, small firms with more than 50 full-time employees would have to provide coverage or face expensive fines. All Americans, in lesser known ways . The massive health care law requires doctors to report goodies they get from medical supply companies; demands more breastfeeding rooms; requires all chain restaurants to list calories under every menu item, and includes numerous other provisions, which now remain in place. Doctors and other health care providers . Health care providers have already begun making changes based on the 2010 law, and in preparation for what will go into effect in 2014.  Those plans continue. In the short term, doctors avoid ""chaos"" that may have resulted from the law suddenly being dropped or changed, according to Bob Doherty, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the American College of Physicians, who wrote a blog post on the website kevinmd.com this spring. Medical groups have disagreed over the law. How the Supreme Court Justices voted . Opinion: A health care victory that's only a start .

"The military's equivalent of the Supreme Court overturned the conviction Wednesday of a Marine found guilty of murdering a civilian during the Iraq war, saying he was interrogated after asking for a lawyer. A court originally sentenced Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III to 15 years in prison for the murder of 52-year-old Hashim Awad in April of 2006. Prosecutors said Hutchins, who led a Marine squad that dragged Awad from his home, shot him in the face several times and then placed a shovel and AK-47 near his body to make it appear he was an insurgent burying roadside bombs. Several other Marines were convicted in the attack but all served less than a year and a half behind bars. The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces overturned Hutchins' convictions because the court members said investigators violated his Fifth Amendment rights. The court said Hutchins asked for legal counsel when first questioned by military investigators from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. He was then placed in solitary confinement for a week before investigators asked to search his belongings. Hutchins consented to the search and also asked if he could tell his side of the story about what happened. This time, he waived his right to an attorney and wrote a detailed confession. The court ruled his conviction overturned because they said once Hutchins requested an attorney he could not be interrogated without one present unless he initiated contact with investigators with a desire to talk. The court said it was in fact the NCIS that re-initiated talks beginning with investigators' request to search his belongings. The Judge Advocate General's office, which prosecuted the case, could not be immediately reached for comment on any decision whether to re-try the case.

"Al Qaeda's leadership has sent experienced jihadists to Libya in an effort to build a fighting force there, according to a Libyan source briefed by Western counter-terrorism officials. The jihadists include one veteran fighter who had been detained in Britain on suspicion of terrorism. The source describes him as committed to al Qaeda's global cause and to attacking U.S. interests. The source told CNN that the al Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, personally dispatched the former British detainee to Libya earlier this year as the Gadhafi regime lost control of large swathes of the country. The man arrived in Libya in May and has since begun recruiting fighters in the eastern region of the country, near the Egyptian border. He now has some 200 fighters mobilized, the source added. Western intelligence agencies are aware of his activities, according to the source. GPS: Rebuilding the ruins of Gadhafi . Another al Qaeda operative, of dual European-Libyan nationality, was arrested in an unnamed country on his way to Libya from the Afghan-Pakistan border region. The individual now trying to establish a bridgehead for al Qaeda in Libya is known as ""AA."" His name has not been made public because of UK law on terrorist suspects who are detained but not charged. ""AA"" has been close to Ayman al-Zawahiri since the 1980s and first traveled to Afghanistan in the early 1990s to join mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation -- as did hundreds of Arab fighters. ""AA"" later moved to the United Kingdom, where he began spreading al Qaeda's ideology to younger Muslims. He was an admirer of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who emerged as leader of al Qaeda in Iraq after the U.S. invasion and who led an especially brutal campaign that targeted civilians and promoted sectarian hatred between Sunni and Shia Muslims. War crimes court leaves Gadhafi inquiry up to Libya . After the terrorist attacks in London in July 2005, heightened concern about terrorist activities in the UK led to the arrest of a number of Libyans resident in England. ""AA"" was detained under what was termed a ""control order,"" a mechanism used to detain terrorist suspects -- usually under home arrest -- without charging them. Control orders have been used in dozens of cases where the government does not want to reveal evidence in court for fear of compromising security sources. Those subject to control orders are not named by authorities. ""AA"" also spent some time in Belmarsh high-security jail in the UK in 2006-07, possibly because he was seen as a flight-risk. It is also possible, according to the source, that he was resisting legal moves to have him deported to Libya. At the time, relations between the Gadhafi regime and the United Kingdom were improving, and Libyan authorities were seeking the deportation of opponents. At some point the control order lapsed, and ""AA"" left Britain late in 2009 and went back to the Afghan-Pakistan border area -- taking two teenagers with him. One was subsequently killed. Western intelligence agencies have voiced concern in public and privately about the potential for Islamist extremists and especially al Qaeda to gain a foothold in Libya. The al Qaeda leadership has included several Libyans -- among them Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was killed in August, and Abu Yahya al-Libi. In a video message to fellow Libyans distributed on jihadist forums earlier this month, al-Libi said: ""At this crossroads you have found yourselves, you either choose a secular regime that pleases the greedy crocodiles of the West and for them to use it as a means to fulfill their goals, or you take a strong position and establish the religion of Allah."" Militant groups have long had a presence in eastern Libya, even if they were ruthlessly suppressed by the Gadhafi regime. Al Qaeda documents discovered in Iraq in 2006 showed that many of the fighters who had joined the insurgency had come from eastern Libya. And a U.S. diplomatic cable from 2008 -- published this year by WikiLeaks -- told of support for extremist Islamist views in the town of Derna, which is close to where ""AA"" has established a presence. Entitled ""Die Hard in Derna"" the cable describes the town as a ""wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters"" for al Qaeda in Iraq. The diplomat who traveled to Derna quoted a local businessman who had ""likened young men in the town to Bruce Willis' character in the action picture 'Die Hard,' who stubbornly refused to die quietly. For them, resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of 'jihad' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime."" High youth unemployment, discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation. ""It's jihad -- it's our duty, and you're talking about people who don't have much else to be proud of,"" the businessman said.","A source tells CNN that al Qaeda's leadership is mobilizing forces in eastern Libya .

"Mexicans are watching closely as U.S. President Barack Obama prepares to announce his administration's proposals to stem gun violence. The country's top diplomat in the United States says the tragic Connecticut school shooting may have ""opened a window of opportunity"" for Obama to fix a problem that has long plagued both sides of the border. ""The Second Amendment ... is not, was never and should not be designed to arm foreign criminal groups,"" Mexican Ambassador Eduardo Medina Mora told reporters last week. His comments were just the latest in years of criticism of U.S. gun policies by Mexican officials, who blame weapons trafficking from the United States and the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban for fueling brutal drug violence south of the border. Now, the issues many Mexicans felt Washington had neglected are in the spotlight. On Wednesday, Obama is scheduled to announce his administration's proposals to crack down on gun violence. And with indignation over guns growing in the United States, reforms that Mexico has long awaited may come through, Medina said. Mexico will keep pushing for better U.S. gun regulation, he said, noting that an assault weapons ban is one constitutional option. The end of the ban in 2004 impacted Mexico, he said. ""There is certainly a statistical correlation between the end of this measure and the increase in the firepower of foreign criminal groups, particular those that operate out of our country,"" he said. On Monday, prominent Mexican peace activists renewed their call for the United States to stop weapons trafficking across the border, saying that the Connecticut shooting made the need for action all the more clear. ""We wish to convey our deepest condolences over the repeated slaughter of innocents in your country. As parents and grandparents, the killing of innocent children in Newtown (Connecticut) has moved us deeply,"" Mexico's Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity said in a petition delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. ""Consequently,"" the petition continued, ""we are disconcerted and offended by the indifference of the United States toward the massacres that daily plunge Mexico into mourning."" Most of the weapons used in drug-related violence in Mexico can be traced back to the United States, the group said, citing U.S. government statistics. Nearly 70% of the 99,000 weapons seized in Mexico from 2007 to 2011 came from the United States, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said last year. That issue surged to the fore in Washington last year, amid a U.S. congressional inquiry into ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" an operation run by U.S. federal agents. Authorities have said the operation was intended to track the flow of illegally purchased American guns to the Mexican cartels, but in practice, ATF agents allowed so-called straw buyers to take weapons across the border without being intercepted. In Mexico's capital, authorities have started an exchange program to try to stem gun violence. In one Mexico City neighborhood last month, residents handed in hundreds of guns in exchange for money vouchers. Handguns, high-caliber weapons and even a hand grenade were among the weapons authorities collected. As part of the program, children also swapped toy guns for bicycles, electronic devices and toys. Last year, Mexico's government used decommissioned weapons to build a massive sign near the U.S. border that said, ""NO MORE WEAPONS."" Americans on the other side of the border were the intended audience for the English-language sign, then-President Felipe Calderon said at the time, saying an increase in violence in Mexico was directly connected with the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban. ""The criminals have become more and more vicious in their eagerness to spark fear and anxiety in society,"" he said. ""One of the main factors that allow criminals to strengthen themselves is the unlimited access to high-powered weapons, which are sold freely, and also indiscriminately, in the United States of America.""","Mexico blames brutal drug violence on guns trafficked from the United States .

"New York (CNN) -- The principal of a Catholic elementary school in the Bronx has been fired because of his writings on race and white supremacy, the Archdiocese of New York said Tuesday. Frank Borzellieri was relieved as principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel elementary school in the wake of recent coverage in the New York Daily News and other local media concerning his writings and his previous ties to a group called American Renaissance. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors extremist groups in the United States, describes American Renaissance as a ""white nationalist movement."" Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, issued a statement Tuesday saying that the principal was let go because ""many of the opinions expressed by Mr. Borzellieri in his writings were found to be incompatible with the philosophy and practices of Our Lady of Mount Carmel School, and with Catholic schools throughout the archdiocese."" Borzellieri was hired in 2009 as principal of the elementary school, which has, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a mostly black and Latino student body. Zwilling's statement did not specify when the termination was effective, and Borzellieri could not be reached by CNN on Tuesday. The official who originally hired Borzellieri, the Rev. Eric Rapaglia, pastor of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, made the decision to remove Borzellieri as principal after reviewing his writings, according to the archdiocese. Borzellieri previously served as an elected member of the New York School Board for 11 years. During his tenure, according to published reports, he made efforts to forbid references to homosexuality and to ban literature he considered ""anti-American,"" including a biography of Martin Luther King Jr. The website for American Renaissance currently advertises writings by Borzellieri, including a 2009 book titled ""Lynched: A Conservative's Life on a New York City School Board."" Another book by Borzellieri, titled ""The Unspoken Truth: Race, Culture and Other Taboos,"" lists among its topics ""the myth of integration"" and ""multicultural madness,"" according to the website. CNN affiliate WCBS reported that Borzellieri's sister, Maria, told a  reporter Tuesday, ""He wrote these books a long time ago. I don't know who'd drag  them up. It has nothing to do with the type of principal he is today."" During his time on the New York School Board, Borzellieri tried to fire teacher Daniel Dromm for being openly gay, according to published accounts. Dromm, now a New York City Council member, described Borzellieri to CNN Tuesday as an ""equal-opportunity hater."" ""It's completely inappropriate to have someone of this type be anywhere near children,"" Dromm said, describing Borzellieri as ""unqualified to teach and unqualified to be near children."" Dromm said he also wrote a letter to the archbishop of New York calling for the removal of Rapaglia, who hired and then fired Borzellieri, for ""incredibly poor judgment."" Rapaglia provided CNN with a written statement Tuesday apologizing ""for my mistake in judgment: in hindsight, I should not have hired Mr. Borzelleri."" But Rapaglia said in the statement that he hired Borzellieri based on the recommendation of a search committee that ""represented the full diversity of the school population and included teachers and parents."" ""Neither myself, nor any of the members of the search committee knew of Mr. Borzelleri's political writings at the time of his hiring. I read them after he was hired as principal,"" Rapaglia wrote in the statement, with the word ""after"" in italics for emphasis. ""I did my best to correct the situation and now, please God, we will find a new  and very qualified principal,"" Rapaglia said in the statement. CNN's Max Markham contributed to this report.","A Catholic elementary school principal is fired because of his writings on race .

"Russia has expelled an American journalist and author critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the first such cases since the Cold War. David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times and author of three books on Russia and the former Soviet Union, had been working as an adviser to the U.S. broadcasters Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty since September. ""As some of you may know, I've been expelled from Russia,"" he wrote on his Twitter page Monday. Satter told CNN he had gone to the Ukrainian capital Kiev to exchange his existing visa for a correspondent's visa when he was told his application had been rejected, on the grounds that his presence in Russia was ""undesirable."" He is now in London ""until we figure out what to do next."" Satter is a fellow at Johns Hopkins University and the Hudson Institute, a U.S.-based think tank. He has written extensively on the history of Russia in the post-Soviet era. In a prepared statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Satter of violating entry visa regulations. It said that after entering Russia on November 21, he waited five days before converting his initial visa into a multi-entry visa -- a ""major breach of the Russian migration law."" After receiving his accreditation from the ministry, Satter was supposed to immediately go to the Federal Migration Service to get his multi-entry visa, but he showed up there on November 26, the statement said. Satter spent about five days in Russia ""illegally"" in November, according to the ministry. A Moscow court heard his case on November 29, and he was fined and ordered to leave the country, the ministry said. Satter left Russia on December 4. He is now barred from the country for five years, the ministry said, adding that this was not uncommon, with more than 500,000 foreign citizens banned from entering Russia for three to 10 years because of breaking rules. Spy cases . Asked about the statement, Satter told CNN: ""That's just an attempt to confuse world opinion."" ""I at no time violated any regulations. I operated strictly in conformity with what I was told to do by the Foreign Ministry,"" he said. ""I followed all bureaucratic procedures."" He described being told by a diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Kiev that ""the competent organs,"" referring to the Federal Security Service, had determined that his ""presence on the territory of the Russian Federation is undesirable and I am banned from entering Russia."" He said such language was usually used in spy cases. Satter said he wanted to go back to Russia. ""I think their decision should be reversed immediately. I don't accept it,"" he said. ""On the other hand, being realistic, I understand that the chances are not great. ... It looks pretty serious."" Critical of Putin . In December, after suicide bombers killed more than 30 people in the Russian city of Volgograd, Satter wrote for CNN.com that visitors to the upcoming and highly touted Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi ""are walking into what effectively is a war zone."" ""I've always been critical of the Putin regime. This is nothing new,"" he said. ""It may be that for reasons of their own, they've finally found that criticism to be more than they wanted to put up with. But there's actually quite a lot to criticize, so if you're going to report honestly from Russia, you almost have to be critical."" Satter said the language used to reject his visa hearkened back to the Cold War era and its application to a journalist was ""unprecedented."" But whether it reflected a shift in policy toward international newsgathering was unclear, he said. ""In any case, the expulsion of even one correspondent has an effect on everybody else because it makes it clear that critical reporting may incur a very serious cost,"" he said.

"It's deja vu, drug lord style. Mexican authorities say they gunned down notorious cartel leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez on Sunday. By most measures, it sounds like a major victory in the government's fight against organized crime. But there's a catch. He was supposed to be dead already. In 2010, then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government trumpeted Moreno's death, announcing that he'd been killed after two days of shootouts between armed forces and criminals. Officials revealed a surprising twist on Sunday, announcing the 2010 report of his death was inaccurate. Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, executive secretary of Mexico's National Public Security System, said Moreno was very much alive when federal troops cornered him on Sunday. They planned to arrest him, Rubido said, but Moreno was fatally shot after he opened fire. For years, rumors have swirled about Moreno. Critics said the Mexican government had never proven that Moreno had been slain after the 2010 announcement. Federal authorities initially said they couldn't provide physical evidence because Moreno's body had been collected by fellow cartel members after clashes. In 2011, state prosecutors acknowledged they'd never recovered Moreno's body and couldn't confirm he was dead. ""We've never found a body, fingerprints, photographs,"" George W. Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and Mary, told CNN that year. ""We know his burial site, but no one has exhumed the body. There are a lot of questions."" Authorities received numerous reports that Moreno remained alive, Rubido said Sunday, . On Sunday, Mexican authorities said fingerprint tests had confirmed that Moreno was really the one they killed this time, but they were still awaiting DNA test results. More on the Mexican Drug War . Cartel founder 'known for his dangerousness' Moreno -- nicknamed ""The Craziest One,"" ""El Chayo"" and ""The Doctor"" -- was ""known for his dangerousness,"" Rubido said Sunday. He was a founder of La Familia Michoacana, a cartel that started in the western Mexican state of Michoacan and grabbed national attention in 2006 after reportedly hurling five decapitated heads of rival gang members onto a dance floor. The group began splintering soon after authorities announced Moreno's death in 2010, and a similar spinoff organization known as the Knights Templar effectively took La Familia's place as the dominant group in the region. The Knights Templar has increasingly found itself in the Mexican government's cross-hairs in recent months as citizen self-defense militias in Michoacan pressured authorities to crack down on the cartel and capture Moreno, who they claimed was still alive and leading the group. On Sunday, Mexican officials described his death as ""the most important blow to the criminal group that he headed"" and said he was ""the undisputed leader of the criminal group that dominates the state,"" but didn't mention the group's name. Toning down the rhetoric about drug cartels has been part of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's security strategy since he took office in December 2012. Authorities have largely stopped parading suspects before cameras after high-profile arrests and seem to be making an effort to avoid actions that could be seen as glorifying cartels. 'Spiritual leader' A Mexican government dossier released in 2010 described Moreno as the brains behind many killings. Authorities said he was a self-fashioned ""spiritual leader"" who used religion to recruit criminals and strengthen his stronghold. But he started small. As a teenager, he was a migrant worker in the United States and worked in several locations in California, the profile said. He was arrested for the first time on drug trafficking charges in McAllen, Texas, in 1994. ""Moreno started as a migrant in California, continued trafficking marijuana on the border and became the leader of one of the most violent criminal organizations in the history of Mexico,"" the report said. In Mexico, Moreno dubbed himself the ""savior of the people"" and crafted La Familia's philosophy, outlined in a ""bible"" provided to new recruits. La Familia's approach showed a ""strong religious background,"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2009. ""It purportedly originated to protect locals from the violence of drug cartels. Now, La Familia Michoacana uses drug proceeds to fuel their agenda that encompasses a Robin Hood-type mentality -- steal from the rich and give to the poor,"" the DEA said. ""They believe they are doing God's work, and pass out Bibles and money to the poor. La Familia Michoacana also gives money to schools and local officials."" In 2011, the Knights Templar announced its presence and took a similar approach, with banners hanging in prominent locations vowing to protect residents of Michoacan. ""Our commitment to society will be to preserve order and prevent robbery, kidnapping and extortion, and protect the state from interventions by rival organizations,"" the signs said. In a raid aimed at cracking down on the new cartel that year, Mexican police seized white robes emblazoned with bright red crosses and handbooks outlining a code for the Knights Templar. Analysts have long pointed to such finds as a sign that the Knights Templar also used religion to recruit and retain members.

"It is safe to go back into the water again -- at least in Scandinavia. A warning over the weekend for male swimmers off the coast of Denmark and Sweden to protect their private parts because of a testicle-munching fish appears to have been a joke that got out of hand. After a Danish fisherman caught a South American pacu among his eels and perch this month, a professor at the Copenhagen Museum of Natural History told men to be careful because the fish sometimes mistake male reproductive organs for tree nuts, one of their favorite foods. ""Anyone choosing to bathe in the Oresund these days had best keep their swimsuits well tied,"" Professor Peter Rask Moller said in a Saturday news release about the fish discovery in the strait separating Denmark and Sweden. Wednesday, however, Moller said he was just joking and never meant for his warning to get so much publicity. ""We did say that we recommend men to keep their swimsuits tied up until we know if there are more pacus out there in our waters,"" Moller told CNN by e-mail. ""Of course, this is half a joke since it is very unlikely that you would actually meet one here and that it would bite you. It's up to people themselves how careful they want to be. I'll keep my shorts on, though."" Finding a pacu, a close relative of the piranha normally found in South America, is unusual so far north. Moller said it was likely dumped in the strait by an amateur aquarium owner or fish farmer. William Fink, a piranha researcher at the University of Michigan who is also curator of fishes at the school's Museum of Zoology, poured water on the pacu warning. For one thing, he said, pacus are vegetarian -- and there's no record of them attacking a human. ""They're fruit eaters. Those big crushing teeth they have is for crushing seeds,"" he said. Pacus tend to swim under fruiting trees during high water, waiting for the trees to drop their fruit, seeds and nuts, Fink said. The fish then swim to the surface to eat the tasty morsels. In fact, Fink said, that's how fishermen catch them: by putting a piece of fruit on the end of a line and letting it float in the water. Pacus swim up to grab it and then get caught. ""The nuts that they're eating, the fruits that they're eating, are splashing down from above, and humans don't act like that when they're swimming,"" Fink said. And unlike piranhas, which have rigid, razor-sharp interlocking teeth, pacus have teeth that resemble human molars and fit together in a similar bite, Fink said. The pacus use those teeth to crush their food, not to rip it apart -- or off. He speculated that the pacu found in Denmark was probably released shortly before it was found because pacu species can't survive in either saltwater or chilly temperatures. ""It's just too cold for pacus to be living there. They certainly wouldn't make it through the winter,"" or even past October, he said. CNN was among numerous news outlets around the world that reported the Danish news release over the weekend, focusing on the special warning for male swimmers. Moller said he only meant to publicize the surprise discovery of a pacu in the Baltic and to advise the public that the fish can be invasive and possibly dangerous. ""The story about the 'nuts' was never meant to be the headline. But it certainly got people's attention,"" Moller told CNN. ""I'm sorry if it has caused you any trouble. It was a bit of a joke, but I still will keep my swimsuits tied up, and I will never swim in an aquarium with these fishes.""","A Danish professor said a South American fish was found in Danish waters .

"For soccer's world governing body FIFA, it is an unwanted hat-trick. Brazil, who will stage the 2014 installment of FIFA's showpiece tournament -- the World Cup --  faced a wave of protests about the costs involved in playing host when the forerunner to the tournament, the Confederations Cup, took place in June. Recently FIFA have also appointed a task force to examine the possibility of moving the date of 2022 Qatar World Cup to escape the searing temperatures of the tiny emirate's Middle East summer. Sandwiched in between those two is Russia 2018, who are again having to field accusations of racism among supporters of one of their biggest clubs. Manchester City's Yaya Toure claims he was the subject of monkey chants from CSKA Moscow fans during their Champions League game on Wednesday and even raised the possibility of boycotting the 2018 World Cup. Ivory Coast international Toure declared himself ""furious"" and in an interview with City's TV channel called on UEFA -- European football's governing body  -- to impose tough sanctions on CSKA, and ""ban them for a couple of years."" While UEFA confirmed they'd opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA for ""racist behavior of their fans"" after reports submitted from their two officials at the match, the club denies any allegations of racist behavior, and claim that UEFA's delegate didn't hear anything untoward. Toure's Ivory Coast teammate Seydou Doumbia, who played in the match for CSKA, said he had heard nothing in the way of monkey chants and told the club's official website Toure ""clearly got worked up."" Doumbia distanced himself from those comments on Friday, saying he hadn't spoken to any journalists after the game. Whatever the outcome, the furore has provoked another wave of negative headlines about the World Cup and brought the issue of racial discrimination into sharp focus. Brazil's World Cup winning defender Roberto Carlos twice had a banana thrown at him from the stands in 2011 when playing for Anzhi Makhachkala in the volatile Dagestan region while Zenit St Petersburg were forced to distance themselves from a fans group who called for non-white and gay players to be excluded from the team. However, it is arguable that racism is way down the 2018 committee's to do list of priorities. ""There is still this attitude in Russia that the 2018 World Cup is a long way away and they have got all sorts of problems they need to tackle before they even get to the issue of racism,"" James Appell, a Moscow-based football journalist told CNN. ""I think the organizing committee for the 2018 World Cup has probably taken the decision that FIFA are much more concerned that the stadiums aren't going to be built, the roads will be bad and the railway links aren't going to be there by the time 2018 comes around."" While FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared himself happy with Russia's preparations at a recent summit in Argentina, Appell argues infrastructure development remains a huge concern. ""So if a few thousand fans -- and I'm not trying to diminish the issue -- but if a few thousand fans air these chants in a Champions League game in the year 2013, they are pretty confident they can sweep that under the carpet, but they've got to get the transport, logistics and stadiums in order. ""There are 14 or 15 host stadiums, how many of them are ready today? None, not a single one. Some of them are built but need renovating; some haven't even been built yet. ""That is where FIFA can say we literally can't hold a major tournament here if you don't have stadiums or roads, so that is where the prime motivation is at the moment. ""To even get to the point where they can say 'Right, we've solved that problem' they are years away."" Russia's organizing committee has insisted all stakeholders in Russian football have made it clear there is no place for racism in the game. It also pointed to a new 'Fans Law', ratified by President Vladimir Putin in July, that bolsters the sanctions available to the authorities when dealing with hooliganism by Russian fans, like stadium bans and harsher fines. ""What is clear is that football is uniquely positioned to educate fans in combating this global issue,"" said the Russia organizing committee in a statement sent to CNN. ""The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, in particular, can act as a catalyst to positively change the mindsets and behavior across all involved in Russian football over the next four years. ""The Fans Law that was recently passed into legislation shows Russia's determination to eradicate the problem for good. The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia will be a festival of football where talented athletes from every corner of the globe will be celebrated."" Asked if infrastructure projects were being prioritized ahead of tackling discrimination, the organizing committee declined to comment further. Outside of Russia, condemnation of the alleged monkey chants aimed at Toure was rapid, with the Professional Footballers' Association in England calling for swift action and the ""strongest possible sanctions."" The worldwide professional players' union FIFPro said UEFA's own racism protocol ""failed"" Toure. FIFPro argued that after the 30-year-old Ivorian told referee Ovidiu Hategan of the alleged abuse, the official should have informed the safety officer to ensure a stadium announcement was made imploring fans to curtail their chants. If they persisted, the teams should then have been taken off the field. On Friday, UEFA president Michel Platini ordered an investigation into why the protocol wasn't followed. The British 'Kick it Out' campaign against racism called the incident a ""depressing throwback"" and said it raised questions around the suitability of Russia as World Cup hosts. However, one seasoned racism campaigner, Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) organisation, said it was unlikely that FIFA would consider replacing Russia as the host nation unless there was a wide scale boycott by the players involved. ""I'm very confident that when it comes to the World Cup, the government, the football authorities will make sure that in terms of racism it's a very clean World Cup -- I don't think that is in doubt,"" he told CNN. CNN investigates: Racism in Football . ""Generally when these big tournaments take place the country rises to the occasion and people understand their responsibilities. ""I think the wider issue is the one that Yaya Toure has highlighted, which is that if the government and the football authorities in Russia can't come to terms with this, then should the World Cup be played there? ""I think it's probably too late for that but he also raises the prospect of players boycotting the tournament, that has never happened before and in the end if the African players were to do that then there wouldn't be a World Cup."" One of the most high-profile footballers ever to play in Russia was Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, twice a Champions League winner with Barcelona and a four-time African Player of the Year. He spent two years with Anzhi, playing a season alongside Carlos, and told CNN recently that in his experience of Russia, the ultras there are no more or less racist than in other countries. ""Racism wasn't born in Russia,"" said Chelsea striker Eto'o. ""The first time I played in St. Petersburg, a lot of people told me, ""Whoa, watch out there,"" when I came out onto the pitch to warm up, the fans stood up and applauded me. ""Racism is a question of education -- you get to one place and, in the moment, they do it to you. Or a lot of times, in the stadium, they do it to certain players -- not to offend you -- but to make you lose your concentration. ""And I'll tell you what, same as they said about the World Cup in South Africa, Russia will be one of the best World Cups we'll ever have."" Yet Appell insists there won't be an appetite to fight racism head on in Russia until the punishments meted out to clubs do them real damage. ""Futile is the word for potential punishments because there is no fear of any serious consequences,"" said Appell. ""It has to be something on the horizon that is immediate and would affect all fans. ""There are certain things I think UEFA could do that might make a lot of Russian fans sit up and take note that would involve banning their clubs from playing in Europe or a serious sanction involving next year's World Cup. ""What is key for the clubs is television revenue and the prize money they get from competing in Europe.  As far as they are concerned fan behavior is an inconvenience but it isn't the be all and end all. ""What would affect them is if they were barred from competition and therefore couldn't get that revenue.""","The next three FIFA World Cups, in Brazil, Russia and Qatar mired in controversy .

"(CNN) -- I am sorry to report that Colorado has shut down all government and civilian activities under a haze of pot smoke. Trains will not run. Store shelves are bare. Citizens are rioting in a pot-induced trance. Tourists are avoiding the Sodom and Gomorrah called Colorado. Keep your children indoors and your money in the mattress! Yes, many skeptics predicted terrible consequences, but six months after legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, the sky still hasn't fallen. We understand that Colorado and Washington are under intense scrutiny because of their forward-thinking legalization of marijuana. Being first presents challenges and opportunities. But there is much to learn from Colorado's experiment, lessons in what works and what doesn't. 'I like weed, and I'm a good person' Success in these early stages already shows reduced underage use and tremendous tax revenues, according to statistics compiled by the Drug Policy Alliance, amounting to millions of dollars a month. Gov. John Hickenlooper anticipates cannabusiness to be a billion-dollar industry in 2014 in Colorado. Crime rates are down. Colorado travel is up. Applications to attend Colorado schools have increased -- to no one's surprise. Identifying the single biggest problem facing the state, counties, cities, and cannabusinesses in Colorado is easy: It's the banking situation. Because pot remains illegal under federal law, legal financial institutions won't work with marijuana businesses, and they are forced to operate on a 100% cash basis. No one wins when consumers must pay cash only; and businesses must pay taxes, employees, rent, electric bills, and every other normal business expense in cash. Quarterly withholding is paid only in cash, only by appointment, only in Denver, and only with a 10% cash payment penalty added by the federal government. The federal government must provide more than lip service to this issue, and sooner is better. Legal marijuana has benefits on many social fronts. Drug laws have for too long put young people in prison, often ruining their lives; this is especially true for people of color. Renting an apartment can become a personal nightmare because of a marijuana conviction. A mortgage can become impossible. We know that marijuana is substantially safer than alcohol. No one seriously disputes this anymore. How safe is it? The number of people killed by marijuana overdose every year remains at zero. A study reported an average of 317 Americans died each year from alcohol poisoning -- but the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 88,000 deaths a year ""can be attributed to excessive use of alcohol."" Recent police sting operations, from January 2014, resulted in zero violations of the ban on selling to minors. Law and regulation means greater safety for consumers. Large numbers of people consume pot in every state -- a Pew Research Center survey in April found that 47% of Americans say they have tried marijuana. In Colorado and Washington, they can expect some protection from adulterants, mold, and other impurities, while knowing the potency of their intended purchases. The states can expect substantial tax revenues, increased employment, and a reduction in jail overcrowding. Private prisons will become less necessary. But the garden is not entirely roses. Colorado has struggled with problems linked to marijuana edibles. People who have eaten or ingested too much of a marijuana-laced treat have become nauseous and extremely anxious; half of the 79 calls to medical facilities concerning marijuana in the first four months of legalization regarded edibles. More education is necessary. The state is pursuing labeling, packaging, and potency regulations as part of the solution. Parents should protect children from marijuana as they would from alcohol or aspirin. Consumers should expect consistent dosages and known ingredients. The state and the other stakeholders must continue to work toward solutions as areas of concern become apparent. Another benefit: Being able to grow hemp as a fiber, overlooked by the country in 1937 and easily forgotten, is a tremendous positive result of legalization. Hemp helped win World War II and plays a significant role in a laundry list of applications. Colorado, as a large farm state, stands to win. The U.S. benefits. The inexcusable practice of buying processed hemp from other countries is eliminated. The industry has willingly complied with wall-to-wall video surveillance, labeling, child-proof packaging, dose control, and hundreds of pages of detailed laws and regulations. This is government-civilian cooperation at its best. The mutual desire to find intelligent solutions permits industry-government cooperation at levels simply impossible in the past. Colorado is not finished -- and every success will be reported on Page 12. Every problem will be ""Page one, above the fold."" As a world role model, Colorado can lead the way on how to do this right. The United States was properly referred to as the ""Great Experiment"": Colorado is part of that. This is our democracy at work in a vibrant, organic way. Peace has been declared in a particular corner of the war on drugs. Mr. President, in Colorado, we respect your right to say ""No, thank you,"" as you did when someone offered you a hit on your recent visit to Denver. However, if you change your mind, our invitation to visit and to have a toke is still open.","Leonard Frieling says pot is legal in two states and the sky hasn't fallen .
Of Colorado, he says: sales tax revenues will bring millions, and crime is down .
Lack of bank service causes problematic cash economy, he says .

"McDonald's and Target dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company's barns. The undercover video, released by Mercy for Animals, was allegedly shot between May and August at facilities run by Sparboe Farms in Colorado, Iowa and Minnesota. It shows hens crammed in crowded cages, workers burning beaks and one, trying to shove a bird inside the pocket of a co-worker, apparently for fun. Another worker presses his thumb against the back of a chick's neck until it breaks. ""Regarding the undercover videos, the behavior on tape is disturbing and completely unacceptable. McDonald's wants to assure our customers that we demand humane treatment of animals by our suppliers. We take this responsibility -- along with our customers' trust -- very seriously. It's important to note that the most alarming actions on video did not occur at Sparboe's Vincent, Iowa, facility that supplies McDonald's. Nonetheless, our extremely high standards for our suppliers prohibit this conduct,"" McDonald's said in a statement, announcing its decision to cut ties with Sparboe Farms. Target similarly said it was dropping Sparboe Farms, which describes itself as the fifth-largest shell egg producer and marketer in the United States. The Minnesota-based egg supplier said it first heard about the abuse allegations from ABC News, which conducted an investigation of the company. Sparboe Farms launched an internal investigation upon learning about the undercover video, which was shot by an animal activist hired under false pretenses, according to Beth Sparboe Schnell, president and owner of Sparboe Farms. Four employees have been fired and management changes have taken place as a result of that investigation, which is ongoing, she said. An independent auditor from Iowa State University was also hired to conduct a third-party animal welfare audit. ""I was deeply saddened to see the story because this isn't who Sparboe Farms is. Acts depicted in the footage are totally unacceptable and completely at odds with our values as egg farmers. In fact, they are in direct violation of our animal care code of conduct, which all of our employees read, sign and follow each day,"" Sparboe Schnell said in a statement. The release of the video and the company's response come in the wake of a warning letter sent to Sparboe Farms from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this week. The agency said it found ""serious violations"" after visiting five of the companies' production facilities, including failure to have and implement a written Salmonella Enteritidis prevention plan and failure to prevent stray poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals from entering poultry houses. The company said it responded to the FDA, which in turn told Sparboe Farms that some of the corrective actions it took were insufficient. Further steps were then taken to remedy the situation, the company said. The egg industry has been a frequent target of animal rights groups, which accuse suppliers of keeping hens in unusually cruel conditions, and have sometimes used undercover videos to prove their point. In 2004, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released video showing slaughterhouse workers for a KFC supplier stepping on birds, kicking them and slamming them against walls and floors. According to PETA, it is common practice for workers to cut a hen's beak with a hot blade at just a few days old, with no painkillers. Those that survive are then kept in small wire cages, or battery cages, that are so small as to prevent them from lifting their wings, it says. The Humane Society of the United States advocates for so-called cage-free systems, which allow hens to walk around, spread their wings and lay their eggs in nests. However, the simple absence of battery cages is not enough to ensure a facility is ""cruelty-free,"" the rights group says. The egg industry has also been buffeted recently by food safety concerns. Regulators recalled about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market in the wake of a salmonella outbreak traced to two Iowa farms in August. About 1,300 cases of salmonella was linked to eggs from Wright County Eggs and Hillandale Farms of Iowa, forcing a recall of their products in at least 17 states, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control reported. Wright County Egg recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs.","The activist group Mercy for Animals releases undercover video shot at Sparboe Farms .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound flight on Christmas Day, security experts, political commentators and the media have been asking one question: How can the United States prevent terrorists from smuggling homemade bombs through security? The most frequent answer has been full body scanners, a developing technology used in a handful of airports around the world. Although these scanners may be effective, they are at best the right answer to the wrong question. The question that law enforcement and security professionals must ask is how to prevent the terrorists themselves from getting on the airplane. Once we focus our attention on individual terrorists rather than their potential weapons, one fact is immediately clear: We must completely change the way we go about airport security and counterterrorism in general. The procedures are both inadequate and ineffective. The current random searches do only a minimum to improve security. Nothing is more unproductive than searching an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair from Sweden or a 3-year-old child simply because she or he was the 10th person in line. Quite simply, the system has failed and must be revamped. Recognizing existing deficiencies, on Monday the Transportation Safety Administration announced it has taken the first step toward implementing a revised screening process for airline passengers. TSA will mandate that ""every individual flying into the U.S. from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening."" This is a step in the right direction. But more should be done. Instead of a system akin to searching for a needle in a haystack while blindfolded, the Transportation Security Administration and the intelligence community should institute a system of ""smart screening."" Such a revised screening process would consider a host of factors in determining whether someone is a potential security threat. Among the considerations would be: behavioral signs; appearance; itinerary and travel history; appearance on watch lists; known connections to radical organizations or individuals; and yes, ethnicity and religious identity. Recognizing that the inclusion of ethnicity and religious characteristics in this list may be unsettling, it simply cannot be ignored that the overwhelmingly large majority of terrorist attacks undertaken over the past decade were committed by Islamic fundamentalists. Consequently, to ignore it as a factor -- as does current policy -- could have devastating effects. The procedures are both inadequate and ineffective. The current random searches do only a minimum to improve security. Any characteristic that can help us identify followers of radical Islam would be critical to determining who should be denied a visa, who should be put on the no-fly list and who should be subjected to a secondary inspection at the airport. One point worth mentioning is that a proposal for ""smart screening"" is not a call for a ban on Muslims flying on planes, nor is it an attempt to stop every person with Arab features and put them on a watch list. Rather than an accusation of guilt, it is simply an additional investigative tool that will allow law enforcement officials to effectively and efficiently marshal their resources toward a known threat, that posed by violent adherents of radical Islamic theology. Screeners and officials of intelligence agencies need as much information as possible to make decisions. To ban the use of critically relevant criteria in preventing catastrophic acts of terrorism, a policy in effect today, is to deny intelligence officials all the tools they need to make critical decisions. Law enforcement has done criminal profiling for decades and recognizes it as an invaluable tool. If a child is raped, the first suspects logically are pedophiles. Skeptical that ""smart screening"" will be effective? Mohammad al-Qatani, the intended 20th hijacker from the September 11 attacks, was stopped in Orlando, Florida, in 2001 because of profiling. It must be conceded that this proposal may not be 100 percent effective. No system ever will be. However, as  terrorist groups consistently demonstrate their adaptability, one thing that has remained relatively constant is the pool of willing and able recruits. If some of the most well-trained and effective terrorists cannot carry out their mission because of profiling, that makes the likelihood of a successful terrorist attack that much slimmer. The new operatives may be less well-trained and hence less deadly. What they will undoubtedly have in common with their more experienced brethren, regardless of their ethnicity or nationality, will be an adherence to radical Islam. Rather than calling for an all-encompassing program where all followers of Islam would be swept up in some sort of dragnet, law enforcement officials should be provided with all of the tools necessary to prevent acts of terrorism, including the ability to consider the potential that an individual getting on an airplane has been radicalized. Race and ethnicity should never be sole criteria in evaluating threats. Rather I am calling for consideration of such criteria only in addition to many other factors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Emerson.","Steven Emerson: New TSA rules for screening passengers good start, but more needs to be done .

"The Obama administration has decided to buy the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois to house high-security federal inmates, and promises the facility will not be used for terror detainees currently incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said the Justice Department filed paperwork in federal court in Rockford, Illinois, on Tuesday to buy the prison from the state for $165 million dollars. The government may spend approximately $25 million dollars to make renovations. The cost estimate to construct a new prison is approximately $400 million dollars. Durbin called the move a good deal for his state and for the federal government. ""This historic action will lead to the creation of hundreds of construction jobs and over 1,000 permanent jobs at this federal facility,"" he said. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter on Tuesday to Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee dealing with Justice Department funding. Wolf fought the move by the federal government to acquire Thomson.  Holder said the prison is being purchased to help alleviate severe overcrowding in Bureau of Prisons facilities. ""As I have committed publicly -- and as I now reiterate --Thomson will not be used to house Guantanamo detainees,""  wrote Holder. Guantanamo detainee back in Canada to serve out sentence . In 2009 the administration considered buying the prison to hold some Guantanamo detainees.  That led to an uproar from Republican members of Congress.  Legislation was passed to prevent transfer of Guantanamo prisoners, a fact Holder acknowledged in his letter. Holder said the decision to go ahead and buy the prison -- after two and a half years of delays -- is solely about dealing with overcrowding and keeping federal prisons as safe as possible. Wolf remained unconvinced. ""I am concerned that this purchase will set in motion the administration's plan to close the terrorist detention facility in Guantanamo by transferring terrorist detainees to U.S. maximum security prisons, like Thomson,"" Wolf said in a statement. Wolf said Democrats remain interested in doing just that and pointed to a request by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairperson of the Intelligence Committee, to have the Government Accountability Office study which U.S.prisons might be suitable to hold Guantanamo detainees. House Homeland Security Committee chairman Peter King, R-New York, said the administration ignored Congress in pressing ahead with buying Thomson. ""If the Obama Administration is willing to ignore Congress about the purchase of the Thomson prison, how are the American people expected to trust that the Administration will not ignore Congress about the transfer of terrorists into it?""

"(CNN)You're a backup dancer. This awards show is a big deal for you. You've been the one chosen to snatch a cape dramatically off Madonna during a musical number. It's going to be a moment you'll remember for all time. And now that it's happened, you'll remember it for a much different reason. Madonna was sent tumbling Wednesday night when the show didn't go as planned and she was yanked down a small flight of stairs. The 56-year-old singer says she's fine. The darn cape was just tied too tight. Here's what happened: Madonna was belting out ""Living for Love"" at the Brit Awards in London. It's a song that coincidentally includes the lyrics ""lifted me up and watched me stumble, after the heartache I'm gonna carry on."" The plan was for the dancer to pull off the cape, but it was still tied around Madonna's neck. And down goes Madonna! If she was in pain, she didn't show it, getting back to her feet and finishing the number. Carry on, indeed. Of course, the socialsphere has gone nutso, mocking Madonna or the dancer, although some did send support.

"Former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt was found guilty of the genocide of more than 1,700 indigenous Ixil Mayans during his 1982-83 rule. A three-judge panel issued the verdict Friday, one day after the conclusion of the trial. The court sentenced Rios Montt, 86, to 80 years in prison. The trial marked the first time a head of state has been tried for genocide by his country's own judicial system. Yassmin Barrios, the tribunal's president, read a lengthy review of how the judges reached their verdict before announcing it. The dozens of Ixil witnesses proved that the military killed, tortured and raped the indigenous population. As de facto president, Rios Montt knew atrocities were being committed and did nothing to stop it, Barrios said. Rios Montt's co-defendant and intelligence chief, Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez, was absolved. Guatemala confronts a dark chapter . The court ordered the former leader go straight to prison, revoking his house arrest. A conclusion of the trial seemed in doubt in the past weeks, as the defense filed multiple challenges in several courts. At one point, one judge annulled the testimony in the trial before it got back on track. ""It's historic for this country,"" Guatemalan political analyst Martin Rodriguez told CNN en Español. ""Surprising, because many of us remain incredulous that Guatemala's judicial system could handle a trial of this magnitude."" The landmark criminal trial could open the doors for future charges against military officials accused of atrocities during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. There will almost certainly be an appeal to Friday's verdict, Rodriguez said. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, who has said that there was no genocide during the civil war, reiterated his position following the verdict. ""Today's ruling is not set in stone,"" Perez Molina told CNN en Español, referring to the expected appeals. His view on genocide is personal, and his government will respect the outcome of the legal system, he said. Perez Molina's view has an added importance because during the Rios Montt trial, one former soldier implicated him as having ordered attacks on villages during his time as a military commander. ""When I say that here in Guatemala there is no genocide, I say it from my experiences"" as commander, he said, denying that there was a conflict of interest in his publicizing his opinion. The important thing to recognize in the verdict, Perez Molina said, is that the judicial system is working in ways it never has before. A trial and conviction of genocide for a former head of state ""was unthinkable just 10 years ago,"" he said. While Rios Montt was in power, the military used the threat of leftist rebels as a guise to exterminate Ixil villages accused of harboring insurgents, prosecutors argued. Prosecutors said the campaign led to the genocide of more than 1,700 Ixil Mayans. Rios Montt did not speak in his defense until the last day of the trial, arguing that it was not he, but local commanders, who had control over their territories. ""I never authorized, I never signed, I never proposed, I never ordered these attacks against a people, ethnicity or religion,"" Rios Montt said Thursday. The former dictator was not without his supporters, who claim there was no genocide, but a high cost during a bloody civil war. Human rights groups hailed the verdict. ""With this conviction, Guatemala leads by example in a region where entrenched impunity for past crimes sadly remains the norm,"" Sebastian Elgueta, Guatemala researcher at Amnesty International, said. ""Guatemala must now follow up on this historic moment by ensuring that all those who took part in the murder, torture, rape and disappearance of tens of thousands of people are brought to justice."" The verdict also has implications for the United States' role in Guatemala during Rios Montt's rule. When Rios Montt became president, human rights violations had already prompted the United States to cut off aid to the Guatemalan government. But a political scandal in the United States in the 1990s revealed that in fact the Central Intelligence Agency continued to provide money to Guatemalan military intelligence sources for years during the civil war. Now-declassified secret CIA cables indicate the United States had knowledge of the atrocities being committed against the Ixil Mayans but did little about them. Then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan went as far as to say that Rios Montt was being given a ""bum rap"" by critics. At the same time, the United States was backing other strongmen in Latin America against leftists. Responding to Friday's verdict, the State Department noted the importance of a ""strong and transparent justice system as an essential component of democracy,"" according to a statement from spokesman William Ostick. ""We see an opportunity for progress toward a true reconciliation in Guatemala, an essential step for the Guatemalan people to continue moving forward as everyone hopes,"" Ostick said.","The U.S. notes the importance of a strong, transparent justice system .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A suspected U.S. missile from an unmanned drone killed three people Saturday in Pakistan's tribal region, according to a Pakistani military source and a North Waziristan official. Young Pakistanis look at a house after a missile hit it in the tribal region of North Waziristan last month. The strike hit a village near Miran Shah, in North Waziristan, the military source and Muhammad Nasim, a North Waziristan political official, said. The military source asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. This is the latest in a series of deadly missile strikes in Pakistan's border region over the past two months. Pakistan has repeatedly blamed the United States and condemned the strikes, saying they cost lives, violate the nation's sovereignty and undermine public support for its counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. government has not acknowledged hitting targets within Pakistan, an ally in the war on al Qaeda launched after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The U.S-led coalition and NATO -- based in Afghanistan -- have been seeking a way to effectively battle Taliban and al Qaeda militants who they believe are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years, saying it is not being active enough against militants -- a claim Pakistan denies. A week ago Saturday, two missiles, also believed fired by a U.S. Predator drone, hit a house in the North Waziristan region and killed at least four people and wounded six others, a local official said. North Waziristan is one of seven districts within Pakistan's ungoverned tribal region along the Afghanistan border. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry recently has summoned U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson to lodge formal protests. On November 20, the ministry lodged a protest with Patterson against a strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province that left five dead and seven wounded and was deeper inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks. In October, the Foreign Ministry summoned Patterson and said strikes should be stopped immediately. At the time, a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people. The United States is the only country operating in the region known have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Missile from an unmanned drone kills three people in Pakistan's tribal region .

"The baby Amanda Berry gave birth to while she was held captive in a Cleveland home was delivered by another one of the young women in the house, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. The information was corroborated in a police report seen by CNN. When Berry went into labor, Ariel Castro, now charged with kidnapping and rape, grabbed captive Michelle Knight and told her to deliver the baby. The baby was born into a plastic tub or pool to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid. When the baby was born, it stopped breathing and everyone started screaming, the source said, citing the girl's account. Castro allegedly said, ""if that baby dies, I'm going to kill you."" ""What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,"" the source said. The three women spent their days and nights captive at 2207 Seymour Avenue, a 1,400-square-foot home in one of Cleveland's oldest neighborhoods. They went outside only twice in that span -- just ""briefly"" at that -- Cleveland public safety director Martin Flask said. More often, the three would be in different rooms, though they interacted occasionally and came to ""rely on each other for survival,"" said a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. One thing they could count on was that their alleged captor would never let them out. Castro would often test Berry, Knight and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, the young women he'd allegedly abducted, by pretending to leave, said the law enforcement source. He'd return suddenly: If there were indications any of the women had moved, they'd be disciplined. Years went by. In that time, the women saw their parents on television at vigils held for them, according to the law enforcement source. They got emotional, knowing their loved ones were looking for them. And in time, Knight and DeJesus ""succumbed"" to ""their reality,"" the law enforcement source said. But ""something must have clicked"" for Berry on Monday evening, said Cleveland's deputy police chief Ed Tomba. She staged a daring escape, and with the help of Castro's neighbors Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero, freed herself, her 6-year-old daughter, Knight and DeJesus. Neighbor who helped Berry an instant Internet star . On Wednesday night, Castro, the man who allegedly held them against their will for so many years, was behind bars. He'll be arraigned Thursday morning on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape tied to the case, said Victor Perez, chief assistant prosecutor for the city of Cleveland. The women found in his home, meanwhile, are back with family -- the same relatives who cried and struggled but, for the most part, never gave up hope. ""I knew my daughter was out there alive,"" said Felix DeJesus, Gina's father, moments after she arrived Wednesday afternoon at a family home in Cleveland. ""I knew she needed me, and I never gave up."" Survival the key difference from 'House of Horrors' case . Lured into a vehicle, then trapped in a home . Knight was 21 on August 22, 2002, when Castro lured her into his vehicle along Cleveland's Lorain Avenue, according to charging documents. Castro took her back to his home on Seymour Avenue, about three miles away, and didn't let her go. In that time, Knight was sexually assaulted repeatedly, the documents state. But soon, she wasn't alone. The next year -- on April 21, 2003, the eve of her 17th birthday -- Berry experienced the same nightmare scenario. While walking home from her job at Burger King that night, she too took a ride from Castro on Lorain Avenue. Almost exactly a year later, they were joined by DeJesus, then all of 14 years old. Who are Berry, DeJesus and Knight . They remained in that hell until Monday evening, when Berry screamed for help. Hearing her cries, Ramsey and Cordero kicked in a door to help her escape. According to Cordero, Berry's 6-year-old daughter ran out of the house too, wearing only a diaper and a sullied shirt. Police are conducting a DNA test to determine the child's paternity. ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry,"" Berry begged a 911 operator from Ramsey's house. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" Cleveland police Chief Michael McGrath told NBC's ""Today"" show that the women were bound and that there were ""chains and ropes in the home."" There were no apparent constraints Monday, the law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation said. Yet Knight and DeJesus didn't run out of the house with Berry although they could have, the source said, describing them as brainwashed and fearful. 'Ariel kept everybody at a distance' So how did this all happen in an urban neighborhood? Did Castro, a former school bus driver and upbeat and ""outgoing"" musician, according to one bandmate, keep such a secret from not only his neighbors but his family, as police allege? Timeline: From missing to liberated . Soon after the three women were found, Castro and two of his brothers who were with him were taken into custody. Over the next two days, authorities officials ""found no facts to link"" Onil and Pedro Castro to the kidnappings -- though both brothers will appear in Cleveland Municipal Court on Thursday related to outstanding warrants on misdemeanor cases on other matters. ""Ariel kept everybody at a distance,"" Tomba said of the suspect, explaining why even his brothers and other family members (Castro talked on Facebook about having five grandchildren) apparently were in the dark. Castro has been talking to investigators since Tuesday, as have the three young women police say he kidnapped and raped. After those conversations, Tomba said he doesn't believe there are other victims -- including Ashley Summers, who was 14 when she went missing in the same part of Cleveland in 2007 -- or anyone other than Castro involved. And since Monday, law enforcement personnel have combed through Castro's Seymour Avenue home -- which Tomba said was in ""disarray"" when officers first went in -- and removed more than 200 items that they hope will let them piece together what happened. Additionally, FBI agents searched a boarded-up home two doors down after obtaining information over the past few days tying that building to the case, the deputy police chief explained. Second-guessing if more could have been done . As they investigate, authorities are facing second-guessing as to whether any of this could have been prevented. Some comes from neighbors who say they contacted police about suspicious activity on Castro's property such as reports of screaming and naked women in his backyard. Authorities say they never got any such calls. In fact, police say they had only been to Castro's house twice, once after he called about a fight on his street and in 2004 to investigate an incident in which he was accused of leaving a child alone on a bus. No one answered at the home, and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere, police said. Police deny neighbors called about suspicious activity . And according to court documents from 2005, Castro's former common-law wife accused him of repeatedly abusing her, including breaking her nose twice, breaking two ribs, dislocating her shoulder twice and knocking out a tooth. A judge granted a protection order but lifted it three months later. Tomba, for one, said he doesn't think authorities dropped the ball. ""I'm just very, very confident (that) law enforcement officers ... checked every single lead, and if there was one bit of evidence (they would have) followed it up very, very aggressively,"" he said. ""In hindsight, we may find out that maybe we did, but that's going to be in hindsight."" Neighbors feel 'fooled' by Cleveland abduction suspect . Relief, joy as victims reunite with family . For the first time in years, relatives of Berry, DeJesus and Knight -- whom Perez described Wednesday as ""safe and healthy"" -- don't have only memories to fall back on. They can look forward, and move on with their lives. Barbara Knight told ""Today"" that, as of Wednesday, she still hadn't talked with her daughter Michelle. Michelle Knight, now 32, was then in a Cleveland hospital in a good condition. ""She's probably angry at the world, because she thought she would never be found,"" Barbara Knight said. ""But thank God that somebody did."" Asked what she would tell her daughter, her mother said, ""I love you and I missed you all this time."" Well-wishers welcomed Berry and her daughter on Wednesday to a family home in Cleveland that was decorated with balloons and stuffed animals. ""We are so happy to have Amanda and her daughter home,"" said her sister, Beth Serrano. A similar scene played out at a DeJesus family home, where relatives embraced their long-lost relative. Sandra Ruiz said that her niece, DeJesus, is ""ecstatic"" to be back with her relatives. When the now 23-year-old arrived at the house, ""she was happy, she looked at the house and she wanted a tour."" ""What more can she say -- her face, her expression, her smile, (her) hugging says it all.""","Police:  When the baby was born, it stopped breathing .

"Nancy Reagan is recovering from a number of broken ribs sustained in a fall in March, a representative for the former first lady said. Reagan, 90, was unable to attend a speech given Tuesday evening by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. ""Mrs. Reagan has been recovering slowly and has been adding a few appointments back on to her schedule, but was advised by her doctor today not to try and attend large events too far from home just yet,"" Joanne Drake, a spokeswoman for Reagan, said Tuesday. ""She personally invited Congressman Ryan and really wanted to be here, but sent her apologies to him earlier today."" Since President Ronald Reagan died in 2004 from Alzheimer's disease, the former first lady has been involved with the National Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute in Chicago. However, she has been hospitalized at least twice in recent years and her public appearances have been rare. In February 2008, she spent two days in the hospital following a fall at her home, but the following month was able to hold a press conference endorsing Sen. John McCain for president outside her Bel Air, California, home. Later that year, she was hospitalized in October for a broken pelvis a week after a fall at her home. She admitted herself to a hospital after experiencing ""persistent pain,"" Drake said at the time, and tests revealed a fractured pelvis and sacrum, the triangular bone within the pelvis. In 2009, Reagan helped unveil a statue of the late president in the Capitol rotunda, and in February 2011, she laid a wreath on his grave on what would have been his 100th birthday, during a reopening ceremony of his presidential library.

"The Chicago Crime Commission named a new Public Enemy No. 1 on Thursday, a designation originally crafted for Al Capone. The new holder of this dubious distinction, however, is not American nor believed to be in the United States. He is Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the infamous Mexican drug lord who is Chicago's most wanted because his Sinaloa cartel supplies a majority of the narcotics in the city. Not since Capone ""has any criminal deserved this title more than Joaquin Guzman,"" commission President J.R. Davis said in a news release. ""Guzman is the major supplier of narcotics to Chicago. His agents are working in the Chicago area importing vast quantities of drugs for sale throughout the Chicago region and collecting and sending to Mexico tens of millions of dollars in drug money."" Daughter of accused drug lord deported to Mexico . Guzman is the boss of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking operations. His nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug smuggling business. Forbes magazine has estimated that ""El Chapo"" is worth $1 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart. Chicago is among the major destinations for the cartel's illegal drugs. ""While Chicago is 1,500 miles from Mexico, the Sinaloa drug cartel is so deeply embedded in the city that local and federal law enforcement are forced to operate as if they are on the border,"" said Jack Riley, who heads the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in the city. The DEA is heading up a new strike force focusing on what Riley calls ""choke points"": where the drugs and money change hands between the cartel operatives and Chicago gangs. Language and cultural barriers at that juncture make the criminal groups more vulnerable, he said in a statement. Officials hope this strategy weakens the cartel and creates leads that may bring the capture of Guzman, who is in hiding in Mexico. ""If I pitted Chicago's traditional organized crime group against Guzman and the Sinaloa Cartel, it wouldn't be a fight,"" Riley said. ""In my opinion, Guzman is the new Al Capone of Chicago. His ability to corrupt and enforce his sanctions with his endless supply of revenue is more powerful than Chicago's Italian organized crime gang.""

"One of the most exciting things about the African continent is its dynamic arts and culture scene. The celebration of this is even more amazing. The Fest Gurus have set out on a journey to visit every major festival on the continent to share their beauty and tell a different story about Africa through the exploration of its arts, culture and music. Festivals are not just a good time but a key element in the development of the arts scene, one of Africa's hidden treasures. Here are seven of the continent's best. Lake Of Stars - Malawi . Every year for the past 10 years, Lake Malawi has played host to one of Africa's most respected festivals, the Lake of Stars. The Lake of Stars festival has been hailed variously as ""simply the finest festival in the world"" and ""the world's most spectacular music festival"" by major media outlets. There's never a dull moment at this event; some performers have been known to do their sets from trees, while the minister of tourism even skydived into the festival. One of the most interesting aspects of the festival is that none of the international artists who perform are paid a fee. Past editions have included headliners The Noisettes, Oliver Mtukudzi, and FreshlyGround. Local Malawian music fuses with styles including Swedish electronic dance music at this festival. (26-28 September 2014) HIFA - Zimbabwe . The Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) is touted as the ""Glastonbury of African festivals."" Established in 1999, the festival takes place each year in late April or early May in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. The week-long festival encompasses five principal disciplines: theater, music, dance, fine art, and poetry. Attendees can take djembe drumming lessons, take in a poetry session, fashion show or catch their favorite artists performing. HIFA is probably the most innovative in terms of social media use; last year, the festival had a screen that showed attendees' tweets. Another great thing about HIFA is that you pay per event, according to your interest, unlike other festivals where a standard price is paid for all events.

South Africa plays hosts to many of Africa's big festivals including Oppikoppi, Joburg Arts Fest and Grahamstown Festival. However, the Cape Town International Jazz Festival is one of the most popular and longest running. Founded in 2000, it is recognized as the fourth-largest jazz festival in the world and the largest jazz festival on the African continent. The great thing about this festival is that it features performers across a variety of genres, so there's something for everyone. The action takes place across two huge stages. This year's crop of artists features Erykah Badu alongside local acts like Micasa, The Soil and more. With the festival celebrating 15 years, and Cape Town being named the ""World Design Capital of 2014,"" it's one not to be missed!

"Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer has been indicted on a felony charge of aggravated assault stemming from two July arguments with his wife. The aggravated assault charge, a class 4 felony, was returned by a Maricopa County Grand Jury on Friday. Dwyer also was indicted on eight misdemeanors that included one assault charge. The Cardinals deactivated Dwyer after he was arrested earlier this month in connection with the incidents, including one in which police say Dwyer head-butted his wife, Kayla Dwyer. According to a court document, the first argument began the morning of July 21, when after a verbal argument with his wife at their Phoenix apartment, Dwyer allegedly tried to kiss his wife and remove her clothing. She told him to stop several times, and ""when he continued, she bit the defendant's lip. He head-butted her in the face, which she later learned had caused a nasal bone fracture."" A neighbor called police because of ""the loud arguing,"" and when they arrived, Dwyer's wife told them that only she and her son were in the house, the document says. Dwyer acknowledged later that he was hiding in a bathroom at the time, according to police. On July 22, there was another argument, and Dwyer punched his wife on the left side of her face, according to the court document. ""He also began punching the walls, causing visible damage. The defendant then picked up a shoe and threw it, striking their 17-month-old son in the stomach,"" it says. The child was not injured. Dwyer was not indicted for hitting the child. NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' When his wife threatened to call police, Dwyer took her phone and threw it from their second-story residence, the document says. As his wife fled, witnesses heard her yell, ""He f---ing hit me; I'm calling the police."" Witnesses also reported seeing ""swelling and discoloration"" on the left side of her face, according to police. Neither the Arizona Cardinals nor Dwyer's agent, Adisa Bakari, responded immediately to CNN's request for comment. Because he was deactivated, Dwyer cannot play the rest of the NFL season. Dwyer's legal trouble comes as the NFL has been struggling with its public image over how it deals with domestic violence cases.

"Esther Williams, whose success as a competitive swimmer propelled her to stardom on the silver screen in the 1940s and 1950s, died Thursday in California, her spokesman said. Williams, known for films that featured synchronized swimming spectacles, was 91. She grew up in Southern California and was a U.S. swimming champion in freestyle and the breaststroke by her late teens. But her Olympic dreams ended in 1940, when the Summer Games were canceled because of World War II. ""That's one of my sad moments in my life,"" Williams told CNN's Larry King in November 1999. ""It taught me how to live with a sad moment."" Her fortunes turned around quickly. After an audition, she starred opposite Olympian and film star Johnny Weissmuller in the ""San Francisco Aquacade Review,"" a ""Broadway musical in swimsuits,"" her online biography reads. MGM then signed her, and she made her movie debut alongside Mickey Rooney in the 1942 film ""Andy Hardy's Double Life."" ""They did a sequence where I swam with Mickey, underwater kiss, which was my idea,"" Williams told King. ""They didn't think you could kiss anybody underwater without drowning."" Williams went on to appear in more than 20 films through the 1950s, including ""Bathing Beauty,"" ""Neptune's Daughter"" and ""Million Dollar Mermaid,"" taking many roles that featured her as a swimmer. She was a 1966 honoree of the Florida-based International Swimming Hall of Fame. ""Her movie career played a major role in the promotion of swimming, making it attractive to the public, contributing to the growth of the sport as a public recreation for health, exercise, water safety -- and just plain fun,"" her biography on the hall of fame website reads. In 1999, Williams penned ""The Million Dollar Mermaid,"" a candid look at her career and life in Hollywood. In several films, Williams played opposite Latin lovers, including Ricardo Montalban and Fernando Lamas, the latter her third husband. Lamas' son, actor Lorenzo Lamas, paid tribute Thursday to his stepmother on Twitter: ""The best swim teacher and soul mom RIP."" Williams and her fourth husband operated a swimwear company in recent years. Then in her late 70s, Williams told King in 1999 she still swam daily. ""It is the best part of my day. I see what it does for women,"" Williams said. ""I think I've invented the aerobics that you see at these retirement homes."" Williams will always be remembered for the Technicolor films and the fashionable swimsuits she wore. Should a swimsuit maybe you look better than you are? King asked Williams .

"It was a great story. For years the lore has been that Neil Diamond's 1969 song ""Sweet Caroline"" was an ode to the then young daughter of late president John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline. On Monday, the singer revealed the truth behind the hit. ""I was writing a song in Memphis, Tennessee, for a session. I needed a three-syllable name,"" Diamond said during an appearance on ""Today."" ""The song was about my wife at the time — her name was Marsha — and I couldn't get a 'Marsha' rhyme."" ""Sweet Caroline"" has since become a staple track, and in 2013 Diamond announced that he would donate the royalties to One Fund Boston to help those affected by the Boston Marathon bombing. The song has been played at every Boston Red Sox home game for more than a decade, and there was a spike in downloads after the April 2013 tragedy.

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez will have plenty of time to ponder his tendency to bite opposition players after the Uruguayan striker was banned for nine international matches and suspended for four months from any football activity by FIFA. The Liverpool striker, who has bitten players three times in his career - the latest incident coming in a key World Cup game -- is also set to miss a large chunk of the English Premier season as he is ""banned from any football related activity"" by football's world governing body. The punishment is the most severe ever handed out at a World Cup for an offense committed on the field of play but the striker does have the right to appeal and is allowed to transfer clubs during the four month period. FIFA had begun proceedings Wednesday after the striker was accused of biting another player during his team's World Cup victory over Italy a day earlier and announced its verdict at a news conference Thursday. ""The first match of this suspension is to be served in the upcoming FIFA World Cup fixture between Colombia and Uruguay on 28 June 2014,"" said FIFA's statement, referring to the last-16 game between the South American teams in Rio de Janeiro Saturday. ""The remaining match suspensions shall be served in Uruguay's next FIFA World Cup match(es), as long as the team qualifies, and/or in the representative team's subsequent official matches."" Suarez is also ""prohibited from entering the confines of any stadium"" during his ban and must pay a fine of 100,000 Swiss Francs -- $111,000. ""Such behavior cannot be tolerated on any football pitch, and in particular not at a FIFA World Cup when the eyes of millions of people are on the stars on the field,"" said FIFA disciplinary committee chairman Claudio Sulser. ""The disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of Mr Suarez's guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code. The decision comes into force as soon it is communicated."" According to FIFA's disciplinary code, the forward could have faced a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years. Former Italian international Mauro Tassotti was given an eight-match ban in 1994, the longest suspension in World Cup history, after breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique. The ban for Liverpool striker, who has been repeatedly linked with a move away from the Premier League club, leaves his club in the lurch as they plan for a return to Europe's top tier competition -- the Champions League -- next season. ""Liverpool Football Club will wait until we have seen and had time to review the FIFA Disciplinary Committee report before making any further comment,"" said the club's chief executive Ian Ayre in a statement on their website. Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, Suarez was at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy earlier this week. Just before Uruguay's winning goal, the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with Italy defender Chiellini with both men falling to the floor. Television pictures showed Suarez dipping his head towards Chiellini, and when the Italian defender eventually got up, he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder. The Uruguayan was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal. It's not just biting that features on Suarez's rap sheet. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he deliberately handled the ball on the goal-line to deny Ghana a place in the semifinals of the World Cup. He was sent off for his troubles but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to finish fourth in the tournament. The following year after his move to Liverpool, Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. He was fined $63,000 and banned for eight matches. Ahead of the World Cup, Suarez had undergone knee surgery, missing Uruguay's first World Cup game, before returning to face England, when he scored twice in the South American team's 2-1 win. ""Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,"" Suarez told reporters following the game. ""I want to see what they think now. I have dreamed of this moment."" Suarez enjoyed a sensational season with Liverpool -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the Champions League. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put behind him his troubled past. But he now looks set to miss Liverpool's first nine Premier League games of the season and the start of the club's Champions League campaign.","Uruguay striker Luis Suarez banned for nine international games and four months .

"Less than a month after President Barack Obama announced his executive action on immigration reform, the country's chief executive made a concerted effort to reach out the Latino community, and assure them that his policies will not be overturned under a new administration. In back-to-back interviews Tuesday with networks that reach Spanish-speaking audiences, the President assured viewers that there is enough public support for his policies to carry over into  a new administration, making it unlikely that they will be deported. ""The American people believe that if you've done things the right way, then you shouldn't be punished for it,"" Obama said in an interview with Telemundo's Jose Diaz-Balart. ""You're not gonna see Democrats or Republicans who suggest that we're gonna treat worse the people who did the right thing compared to those folks who don't register, don't go through a criminal background check and haven't been paying their taxes,"" he said. Speaking to viewers who qualify for a path to citizenship under his executive action, the President vowed, ""You can register, and you can be assured you won't be deported."" ""We are going to make sure that families -- people who are working and responsible in their communities -- are not prioritized for deportation,"" Obama said. ""So the likelihood of their deportations are going to be much lower."" A former constitutional law professor, the President detailed what gave him the legal authority to act on immigration now without Congress' approval -- a move he once said he didn't have the authority to do. ""We always knew that we could reprioritize some of our enforcement powers, not to simply eliminate deportations,"" Obama told Díaz-Balart. ""That would be something that only Congress could do. But what we could do is change, given the limited resources we have, who we're going after and where our resources are deployed."" Obama also acknowledged that he asked the White House Office of Legal Counsel for guidance about how much legal authority he actually had, and with that insight, stretched his executive arm as far as it could reach. From a political perspective, Obama echoed his State of the Union ""phone and pen"" rhetoric, arguing that House Speaker John Boehner's reluctance to bring immigration reform to a vote, is what caused him to act alone.","President Barack Obama reassured Latino audiences his immigration action would stand .

"Two firefighters lost their lives responding to a nine-alarm fire at a brick brownstone in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood Wednesday. More than a dozen other firefighters were injured. ""In 30 years, I've never seen a fire travel that fast, escalate that quickly, and create such havoc in such a short period of time,"" Deputy Fire Chief Joe Finn told reporters. He identified those killed as Lt. Edward Walsh, 43, and Firefighter Michael Kennedy, 33. Walsh had worked with the Boston Fire Department for close to 10 yeas, while Kennedy had 6 1/2 years on the job. Walsh was married with three kids, all under the age of 10. Kennedy was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. ""These two heroes ran into a burning building -- got people out of the building,"" said Boston Mayor Martin Walsh. ""We lost two heroes here today."" According to Finn, firefighters were able to rescue a number of people stuck on upper floors. He said Walsh and Kennedy became trapped soon after entering the building. They were both later located in the basement, where the fire appears to have started. Fueled by strong winds, flames quickly engulfed the four-story building. At one point, there was an explosion and a number of firefighters were blown down stairs, Finn said. ""That fire ... was blowing like a blowtorch out the front, from the rear to the front,"" the deputy fire chief added. In addition to those killed, 13 firefighters were injured. Some suffered burns, others broken bones. On its Twitter page, Boston Emergency Medical Services said that it had transported 18 patients to area hospitals from the Beacon Street blaze. The area is west of downtown Boston, near the Charles River. Video showed smoke rising over the city. More than 150 firefighters and between 20 and 30 trucks responded to the incident, according to Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear. It's under investigation. Mark Bristol, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate WCVB, that he saw people climbing down the building's fire escape. ""I watched it go from pretty small to really, really big -- like there was just smoke absolutely pouring out the front entrance,"" Bristol said. 2 firefighters killed in Ohio blaze .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In one of the shortest session in its history, the Senate's final session of the year lasted a total of 12 seconds Monday. Democrats kept the Senate in session over the holiday season. Only one senator, Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, was in the chamber to gavel open the Senate and adjourn it until January 3. Monday's event was the latest in a series of ""pro forma"" sessions the Senate has called. Pro forma means ""for the sake of formality"" and these micro sessions are part of the last political scuffle between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress. Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments. During congressional recesses, a constitutional mechanism allows the president to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday nearly a week and a half ago, but only one senator is needed to keep the Senate in session. During the session last week, Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. Wednesday's session lasted for 11 seconds. In all, he spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of pro forma sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects. Similar sessions were conducted over the Thanksgiving recess. Other Democrats -- including Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York -- will share the duty of presiding over the ""pro forma"" sessions next month.

"ISIS videos are part of today's new reality. One of the many to hit social media has the viewer hearing a recitation of Quranic verses describing a jihad in the battle for Syria's Al Omar energy facility. Syria's largest oil field is one of a handful now under the firm grip of the terrorist organization. ISIS may not be operating the type of polished pipeline infrastructure one would find in southern Iraq around Basra, but Iraqi oil ministry officials say an old fashioned truck network for this crude is active and serving distribution needs. And now, after nearly three months of heated battle in Iraq, one can see a clearer picture of where ISIS stands as an energy player. It popped up on the global radar in June by seizing assets in Iraq, but building on those early gains, according to a number of energy sources, is proving difficult. August was not a good month for ISIS. It lost its battle for one of Kirkuk's big fields, with potential production of 600,000 barrels a day, and could not keep control of Iraq's largest refinery at Baiji, on the main road to Mosul. What they do hold, Iraqi officials suggest, will need maintenance. So far, it is getting that work done only through intimidation of on-site engineers who are not loyal to the ISIS cause. ISIS' income from oil is falling as they struggle to control the personnel within refineries, according to Assim Jihad, a spokesman at Iraq's Oil Ministry. ""At first they got a large sum of money by seizing inventories, but this cannot last,""  he added. The Iraq Energy Institute estimates ISIS is producing about 30,000 barrels a day in Iraq and 50,000 daily in Syria. On a black market price of $40 a barrel, it is earning $1.2 million a day in Iraq and $2 million in Syria. Energy traders and regional security specialists tell me supplies are being funneled into regional oil importing countries of Jordan, Turkey, and Syria. ""They use oil tank trucks instead of oil pipes. There are about 210 oil tank trucks smuggling oil to Turkey and other places every day,"" Hussein Allawi, Baghdad manager of the Iraq Energy Institute told me. The transport may be rudimentary, but this network of black market traders stretches back to the days of Saddam Hussein, when Iraq was under UN sanctions in the 1990s. ""We are not talking about people who own a couple of  trucks and tanker trucks,"" said Kate Dourian, senior editor at the Middle East Economic Survey. ""We are talking about certain market-oriented people who have organizations that trade in illegal oil."" ISIS has taken a page from Hussein's war playbook, when he left Kuwait. Still pictures of fields torched have emerged this week of fields outside of Mosul when it was pushed out by Iraqi forces. Oil strategists say Iraq's national military and the Peshmerga forces of the Kurdish region are trying to strike a fine balance.  They want to keep ISIS out of their prized fields and refineries, but they don't want to destroy infrastructure which would take years and millions of dollars to rebuild. While ISIS has clearly suffered setbacks, there is also a stark reality. The organization may be falling short of designs to become a ""state"" oil company, but revenue of over $3 million a day can certainly finance its operation of terror.

"One freight train rear-ended another Friday afternoon, sending debris into a passing third train, authorities in Porter County, Indiana, said. Firefighters put out flames among the jumble of derailed cars. Two crew members on the train that struck the back of the other suffered non-life threatening injuries, officials told CNN. CSX said it appeared there were no significant leaks or spills of hazardous materials, ""but inspections of all loaded and empty hazardous materials cars are under way,"" it said in a statement. The three-train accident occurred about 1:15 p.m. Friday about 11 miles northeast of Valparaiso, said David James of the county's highway department. The first train, with two engines and 77 cars, was stopped on the westbound tracks, said Sgt. Larry LaFlower of the Porter County Sheriff's Department. CSX said it was investigating why the first train was stopped. A second train, with two engines and 60 cars, hit it from behind, LaFlower told CNN. The third train, with 48 cars, was moving on a parallel track. ""It struck the wreckage and derailed itself,"" the sheriff's spokesman said. He did know which direction that train was moving in. James said he did not know what speeds the trains may have been traveling. ""The trains carried a wide variety of freight, including three rail cars of flammable products,"" CSX said in a statement. ""Also in the incident are a number of empty hazardous materials cars."" The train struck from behind was carrying empty ethanol tankers, according to LaFlower. The county's hazardous materials team was on the scene, and residents of about 50 homes were evacuated, authorities said. CSX said it was assisting officials with the evacuation. James said the stretch of railroad was in an agricultural section of the county. ""It's been like a spring day here,"" he said of weather conditions.

"It was another day in nearly five years of captivity for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and he didn't know what the 18 Taliban fighters had in store for him Saturday. There, in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, the heavily armed fighters turned Bergdahl over to U.S. military commandos. The soldier's plight had come to an end. Within minutes he was airborne. The helicopter's rotors whooped so loudly that Bergdahl couldn't communicate clearly with the men on board. So he grabbed a paper plate and wrote three characters: ""SF?"" The men understood: Special Forces? The U.S. commandos didn't bother to write back. ""Yes!"" shouted at least one over the roar of the flight. ""We've been looking for you for a long time!"" Captivity . The long road to freedom began for Bergdahl with his capture on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 25th Infantry Division. The soldier disappeared after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost. It was about 4:30 a.m. when he was first reported missing, and by 7 a.m. his comrades began an all-out search to find him, according to secret military reports made public by WikiLeaks in 2010. But there was no sign of the soldier. According to the reports, radio conversations between suspected militants picked up by U.S. reconnaissance aircraft confirmed he had been captured. Conflicting details have since emerged about how the militants managed to capture Bergdahl. Published accounts have varied widely, from claims he walked off the post to another that he was grabbed from a latrine. U.S. officials believe he was captured by the Taliban, but may have been held by the Haqqani Network, a terror group that operates along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The group is aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda. In the ensuing years, there were occasional video clips released by his captors. The so-called proof-of-life videos appeared to show the soldier gaunt and disheveled. Over time, he appeared with a beard . The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it had been engaged in direct talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The Taliban, according to officials, broke off those talks. For more than year, there was no word of the soldier. Road to freedom . Then, in November 2013, the Taliban signaled it was prepared to talk, according to senior administration officials. In return, the United States asked for proof of life, they said. That proof came in December in the form of a video of Bergdahl, the first in three years. And it showed the effects years of captivity had on the soldier, who appeared haggard and unwell. With neither U.S. officials or the Taliban trusting each other, Qatari officials took on the role of intermediary. The negotiations began in earnest last week, with Qatar ferrying messages back and forth between U.S. officials and the Taliban. It culminated in Doha, with the agreement that called for the handover of Bergdahl in exchange for five detainees held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, the administration officials said. As Taliban fighters headed with Bergdahl toward an agreed upon meeting point in Afghanistan, on the other side of the world Qataris officials were waiting for the five detainees to be released. According to senior administration officials, the Qatari officials met the detainees on a runway at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. How the Qataris signaled to the Taliban that the detainees were in the custody is unclear, and administration officials have not detailed the communications. Flight to freedom . It was late afternoon Saturday in Afghanistan, about 10:30 a.m. ET, when Bergdahl surrounded by 18 Taliban fighters was led to a meeting point. There, waiting, were U.S. commandos, according to the officials. In the air above, helicopter gunships circled. Slowly, Bergdahl walked toward the commandos. It is believed the soldier was searched by the commandos, who as a matter of protocol would check to make sure the Taliban had not strapped explosives on him. Within a matter of minutes, Bergdahl was aboard a helicopter bound for Bagram Air Base. On the helicopter, with the knowledge he was in the hands of Special Forces, Bergdahl broke down and cried. He was free.","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl writes on a paper plate because the helicopter is too loud .

"Jim ""Pee Wee"" Martin acted like he'd been here before, like jumping from a plane is as easy as falling off a log. Maybe that's because he had -- 70 years ago. ""I'm feeling fine,"" Martin told reporters moments after landing in a French field. ""... It was wonderful, absolutely wonderful."" Martin was part of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division that parachuted down over Utah Beach in their bid to retake France and, eventually, the rest of Europe from Nazi Germany. They actually touched down in enemy-controlled territory a night before what's referred to as D-Day. His jump Thursday in the same area was different and -- despite his being 93 years old now -- a whole lot easier. ""It didn't (compare),"" Martin said, ""because there wasn't anybody shooting at me today."" Every year, every day it seems, the number of surviving World War II veterans like Martin dwindles. He estimates there are only a few dozen members of his unit who took part in the now historic D-Day invasion who are still around. Share your family's D-Day stories . It's ironic, in a sense, because Martin was among the oldest of his bunch in June 1944 -- at 23 years old -- surrounded by others who were mere teenagers. Together, they parachuted onto France's northern coast in the dark of night not knowing what awaited them. Whatever it was, it would not be friendly or easy, they expected. ""Everybody (was) scared all the time, and if they tell you anything differently they are full of crap,"" the former paratrooper recalled. ""But you just do what you had to do regardless of it. That's the difference."" And they didn't stop. According to a Facebook page he regularly updates, Martin fought for 43 days as part of the Normandy campaign before moving onto invade Holland, fending off Nazi fighters during the Battle of the Bulge and finishing off by taking Berchtesgaden, site of Hitler's ""Eagle's Nest"" redoubt in the German Alps. None of it was easy, but Martin insists, ""I don't ever have flashbacks. Never. Nothing ever bothered me."" All these years later, he has become a celebrity of sorts -- as evidenced by a mob of reporters who greeted him after his parachute landing Thursday. Martin says he feels ""kind of humbled and embarrassed at the adulation because I don't feel we did anything that we weren't supposed to do or anything exceptional."" He adds: ""We just did what we trained to do.""

"Editor's note: Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University. A Libertarian, he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan. Economist Jeffrey Miron says the bailout plan presented to Congress was the wrong solution to the crisis . CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Congress has balked at the Bush administration's proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. Under this plan, the Treasury would have bought the ""troubled assets"" of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown. This bailout was a terrible idea. Here's why. The current mess would never have occurred in the absence of ill-conceived federal policies. The federal government chartered Fannie Mae in 1938 and Freddie Mac in 1970; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis. The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk. Worse, beginning in 1977 and even more in the 1990s and the early part of this century, Congress pushed mortgage lenders and Fannie/Freddie to expand subprime lending. The industry was happy to oblige, given the implicit promise of federal backing, and subprime lending soared. This subprime lending was more than a minor relaxation of existing credit guidelines. This lending was a wholesale abandonment of reasonable lending practices in which borrowers with poor credit characteristics got mortgages they were ill-equipped to handle. Once housing prices declined and economic conditions worsened, defaults and delinquencies soared, leaving the industry holding large amounts of severely depreciated mortgage assets. The fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place, not attempt to fix bad government with more government. The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company. Bankruptcy does not mean the company disappears; it is just owned by someone new (as has occurred with several airlines). Bankruptcy punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable. In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending. Thus, the bailout encourages companies to take large, imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government. This ""moral hazard"" generates enormous distortions in an economy's allocation of its financial resources. Thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective, but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse. According to this view, lenders are not making loans, even for worthy projects, because they cannot get capital. This view has a grain of truth; if the bailout does not occur, more bankruptcies are possible and credit conditions may worsen for a time. Talk of Armageddon, however, is ridiculous scare-mongering. If financial institutions cannot make productive loans, a profit opportunity exists for someone else. This might not happen instantly, but it will happen. Further, the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents. The costs of the bailout, moreover, are almost certainly being understated. The administration's claim is that many mortgage assets are merely illiquid, not truly worthless, implying taxpayers will recoup much of their $700 billion. If these assets are worth something, however, private parties should want to buy them, and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value. Far more likely is that current owners have brushed under the rug how little their assets are worth. The bailout has more problems. The final legislation will probably include numerous side conditions and special dealings that reward Washington lobbyists and their clients. Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take. The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets. So what should the government do? Eliminate those policies that generated the current mess. This means, at a general level, abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay. This means, in particular, getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that pressure banks into subprime lending. The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place. Someone has to pay for that. That someone should not be, and does not need to be, the U.S. taxpayer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Jeffrey Miron: Government encouraged lenders to relax their standards .

"(CNN) -- Champion skier or female fighter pilot? Whether to hurtle down the slopes at breakneck speed or defy G-force in the cockpit of a jet plane. The need for speed is the common theme, but it was an unusual and certainly unique career choice that faced Switzerland's Olympic downhill gold medalist Dominique Gisin. Even as an up and coming star on the junior circuit, Gisin was plagued by persistent knee injuries and fearing for her future in the sport, turned to her second passion, flying, to make a living. She had learned to fly as a teenager and after opting for pilot training in the Swiss military was one of the star recruits. Showing the sort of determination that was to see her reach the heights of the sporting world, Gisin may well have become the first woman to pilot fighter jets for the country's air force. Fate then played its part and, ironically as a result of her skiing injuries, the officers in charge of the flying program decided Gisin's fragile knees would not stand the rigors of full-time military service. ""It was a risk so the decision was partly taken away from me,"" Gisin told CNN's Alpine Edge program. ""But I never regretted. I mean I love skiing with all my heart. And although I love flying, skiing was my childhood dream. ""And all the other people that were still in the selection back then, their sole dream was to fly. I think it was a fair decision."" The choice of skiing looked to be validated by her first World Cup podium in early 2007, but Gisin's injury problems continued and after a fall in downhill training she was sidelined yet again through a knee problem. Indeed during the course of her 15-year skiing career, the 28-year-old has had no less than nine operations. ""After every injury you lie in hospital and you're like 'I'm not going to do this again, for sure.' But then you set little goals,"" she recalls. ""The goal that you can walk again, then that you can train again. And then that you can ski again. And then you're back on snow and it's just the most beautiful thing."" Showing that trademark determination, she rebounded with her first victory on the circuit, tying for first place in a downhill at Altenmarkt with Sweden's Anja Paerson in January 2009. The shared victory was to set the precedent for Gisin's ultimate triumph, topping the podium in the Sochi Winter Olympics earlier this year. Without a win at the highest level since winning her third World Cup race in 2010, Gisin had gone into the Games with slender hopes of victory. But she had the perfect run down the treacherous Rosa Khutor piste and set a time of one minute 41.57 seconds which a host of top contenders could not match. Until Slovenia's 30-year-old Tina Maze -- a close friend of Gisin's -- did exactly that, posting precisely the same time down to a hundredth of a second. It was the first time in Olympic skiing history that a gold medal had to be shared. ""We're close; even closer now,"" Gisin joked after their joint triumph. Victory was greeting with acclaim in skiing mad Switzerland, elevating Gisin to superstar status and putting paid to any doubts she may have had about her chosen career path. Gisin still finds time to keep her license as a pilot -- getting about 25 hours of flying in her log during the off season. She feels the experiences of her twin passions have a similarity that helps her concentration for the task in hand. ""I think the freedom and the peace when you're up in the air and when you're on a (racing) course is quite similar. You focus on this very moment and that's a beautiful thing,"" she said. Despite reaching the pinnacle of achievement with her gold medal, Gisin has no intention of retiring just yet and is focusing on the world championships in Vail early next year for another taste of global glory. ""I mean in the speed disciplines it's all about my head. If I can find the courage, if I can find the energy to race like I did in Sochi, a lot of things are possible,"" she insists. She is also a supportive figure to her 20-year-old sister Michelle, who is beginning to make a name for herself on the women's World Cup circuit, claiming 16th in the slalom in Aspen recently. Her 26-year-old brother Marc has also represented Switzerland on the World Cup circuit, but like his older sister has suffered a serious knee injury, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a fall in 2012. But showing the battling spirit which is clearly a family trait he has returned to the circuit to pursue his promising career.","Dominique Gisin won gold at the Sochi Winter Games .

"Not many mayors in the United States enjoy belly rubs from their constituents. Then again, most mayors don't prance around town naked and curl up for naps in front of local businesses. For 15 years, Stubbs the cat has held the top office in Talkeetna, Alaska. And his approval ratings have never been higher. ""He doesn't raise our taxes -- we have no sales tax. He doesn't interfere with business. He's honest,"" said Lauri Stec, manager of Nagley's General Store, which doubles as the mayor's office. Stubbs may be the only mayor in the country who rose to office as an infant. ""He was in a box full of kittens in the front of the store, and (the owners) were giving them away,"" Stec said. She picked ""Stubbs"" because he had no tail. Soon afterward, residents weren't happy with any of the human candidates in the upcoming mayoral election and voted for Stubbs as a write-in candidate. The kitten won. Because Talkeetna is a ""historical district,"" the mayoral post is more symbolic than functional, said Andi Manning, president of the Talkeetna Chamber of Commerce. So most residents are fine with a four-legged feline running the show. But the power, apparently, has gotten to Stubbs' furry head. ""All throughout the day I have to take care of the mayor. He's very demanding,"" said Skye Farrar, a clerk at Nagley's. ""He meowed and meowed and meowed and demanded to be picked up and put on the counter. And he demanded to be taken away from the tourists. Then he had his long, afternoon nap."" In addition, the mayor will only drink water from a wine glass that has catnip in it, Stec added. But most everyone is willing to put up with the mayor's high-maintenance lifestyle, especially because he's a big tourist attraction for the community of about 800 human beings. Manning said the mayor frequently draws dozens of tourists who are en route to other Alaska destinations such as Mount McKinley. And as of late Monday night, the Mayor Stubbs Facebook page had well over 6,000 subscribers. But Stubbs remains true to his community, often showing up in local businesses -- albeit unexpectedly. ""When my building burned down in 2002, he was the last to come out of it,"" said Todd Basilone, owner of Mountain High Pizza Pie in Talkeetna. ""He's always in the restaurant. Stubbs wanders into every place in town."" Even though dogs run loose and outnumber people in Talkeetna, he said, the canines seem to respect Stubbs' authority. ""I've never seen a dog mess with him,"" Basilone said. Though the mayor generally receives positive reviews for his laissez-faire politics, he is guilty of frequently sleeping on the job. ""His biggest political rivals would be other local businesses that would hate that he comes over and takes a nap and leaves fur everywhere. They aren't big fans of him,"" Farrar said. ""We usually say, 'You have to deal with it. He runs the town.'"" Obama's campaign going to the dogs -- and cats and chickens .","Stubbs became mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, 15 years ago .

"When I was first diagnosed with Arnold-Chiari malformation -- a brain disorder involving structural defects -- I was shocked. After learning more about it, and then after successful surgery in 2011, I realized that I could emerge a stronger person, both mentally and physically. Today I am able to continue to compete at the highest level in the sport of luge and continue to live life to the fullest. I remain committed to my sport as well as to sharing my story about overcoming challenges. During my surgery, and in times of adversity, the most important thing for me has been the support of my awesome family and friends. I had a new outlook on the sport when I returned to competition in 2012. While I knew my ACM was never going to be gone completely, I was healthier than I had ever been and ready to see what I could do as an athlete, free of my symptoms. I never wanted to use my ACM as an excuse not to do something, and I am thankful to my medical team for encouraging and supporting me to continue my athletic endeavors. In my first season back, I had my best results ever. I won my first national title, scored eight top-10 finishes in the World Cup -- including my first-ever silver medal in front of a home crowd in Lake Placid, New York.  I also achieved a personal best, placing sixth in the overall World Cup rankings. I refuse to let my ACM define or limit me as a person. From the very first day I was diagnosed, I decided that I was going to recover from this and I set to work making a plan on how I was going to do it. In addition to recovering physically, I am extremely proud of the work I have done in my home state of Maine by reaching out to youth on an emotional level, educating them about my personal challenges and encouraging them to go after their dreams. Since 2010, I've been the spokeswoman for the Maine Beer & Wine Distributors Association. During the past four years, I've been reaching out to Maine high school students. My presentations are 20 minutes long, and include a video and my personal story of overcoming challenges, including my neck surgery and the passing of my father and sister, as well as the athletic challenges I have faced in my life. I also share with them the importance of individual responsibility and good decision-making. As part of my work with the MBWDA, I have been to 34 high schools in Maine and reached more than 9,000 students. My goal is to reach as many as 10,000 students in the next few months, and perhaps develop the MBWDA responsibility initiative into a national model. Some of the most rewarding experiences of my life have come from my work to inspire young people. This is one of the biggest reasons that I am proud to host Julia Clukey's Camp for Girls each summer. The camp is designed for young girls ages 8 to 11 as a place to develop self-confidence and a healthy lifestyle. I have been blessed with the opportunity to share my experiences with young girls and give them the strength and confidence to go after their dreams.","Julia Clukey was diagnosed with Arnold-Chiari malformation .

"A man suspected of running a pro-ISIS Twitter account was arrested Saturday, the police chief for Bangalore said. Mehdi Masroor Biswas reportedly confessed to operating the ISIS-friendly @ShamiWitness account before it was recently shut down. The 24-year-old  was charged with waging a war or abetting the waging of war against powers friendly to India, police commissioner M.N. Reddi said. He is also charged under prevention of unlawful activities and anti-cyber-crime laws, Reddi said. Biswas is expected to appear in court in 24 hours. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison, according to the police official. An electrical engineer by training, Biswas was working as an executive in a food company until this week, Reddi said. He described Biswas as an ISIS ""sympathizer."" However, Reddi told CNN that Biswas' efforts on Twitter had been of greater significance outside India than within his native country. ""The effect of what he was doing, the impact of what he was doing was really not about India, nor was he provoking or promoting people within India to align or sympathize with ISIS,"" he said. ""It was more about how he could manage to anglicize the conversations of ISIS and that led to a huge impact from what I can understand in the European world, particularly in the UK. Therefore the interest was very high in the UK to track and trace him and he incidentally happened to be in Bangalore."" ISIS shoots down Iraqi helicopter, killing 2 . The exposure this week in UK media of the identity of the man behind the prolific Twitter feed captured headlines worldwide. The suspect told CNN's UK affiliate ITN that he expected to be arrested even though he believed he had done nothing wrong. Fearing that the police might kill him during that operation, he also insisted to ITN that he would not resist arrest and was unarmed. He said he had been overwhelmed by the frenzy of media attention since the identity behind @ShamiWitness was revealed. ""I thought it would die down within the first one or two hours but it's still raging. I can't believe this,"" he said. Asked why he thought the persona had provoked such interest, he replied: ""I think Shami Witness is the first person who really reached the people who like to wage war with the so-called war on terror.""

"A man once detained by Libyan officials and interviewed by the FBI over suspected links to the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, has turned up dead. Faraj al-Shibli, whose name is also spelled Chalabi, was last seen in the custody of a local militia in Marj two days ago, a Libyan source said. His body was found Monday in the eastern Libyan town. He's the second Benghazi suspect to surface in recent weeks. U.S. forces arrested suspected attack mastermind Ahmed Abu Khattalah last month. Here's what CNN has previously reported about those suspected of involvement in the attacks. With the exception of Abu Khattalah, it's unknown if any have been charged in connection with the Benghazi attack. The charges remain under seal. Al-Shibli -- The Libyan government took al-Shibli into custody in March 2013 in connection with the Benghazi attack. The FBI was able to question him during that detention. Al-Shibli was no longer in custody as of May 2013, according to a Libyan source briefed on the case. Libyan officials have not explained why he was released. It's not clear what role he may have played in the attack, or if he's among the suspects named in sealed federal charges brought last year. Al-Shibli was a member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group, a militant organization that tried to overthrow the government of late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the mid-1990s. That regime named him as a suspect in the murder of a German counterintelligence official and his wife, who were killed in the Libyan town of Sirte in 1994. Libyan authorities also issued an arrest warrant for former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in connection with the crime. Abu Khattalah -- The Libyan militia leader for Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi has been described as the mastermind of the attack -- an allegation he denied in an interview with CNN's Arwa Damon. He was captured by U.S. forces last month and brought to Washington to face charges. He has pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists and will remain jailed until his trial, a federal magistrate ruled July 2. Ali Ani al Harzi -- Tunisian authorities held him in Tunis for several weeks in 2013 in connection with the Benghazi attack. A Tunisian judge released him in January on grounds of insufficient evidence, but a U.S. law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the Benghazi investigation told CNN at the time that al Harzi's release ""doesn't mean he's any less a suspect."" Mohammed al-Zahawi -- One of the leaders in Ansar al-Sharia. He has denied the group's involvement in the attack, and U.S. officials have also expressed doubts. Sheikh Nasser al-Tarshani -- Ansar al-Sharia's religious authority. Sufian bin Qumu -- He headed the Darnah branch of Ansar al-Sharia, which the U.S. State Department said in January was involved in the Benghazi attack. Several unnamed Yemeni men -- A senior law enforcement source told CNN in May 2013 that authorities had traced the men to northern Mali, where they are believed to have connected with a fighting group commanded by jihadist leader Moktar Belmoktar. It's unclear where these men might be. Moktar Belmoktar -- He is an Algerian terror suspect linked to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb who was on the receiving end of an excited phone call from someone in or close to Benghazi in the attack's aftermath, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN in May 2013. ""Mabruk, Mabruk!"" the caller repeated, meaning ""Congratulations"" in Arabic. There is no proof the call was about the attack, but it was assumed to be, the source said. Troops in Chad claimed to have killed Belmoktar in 2013, but several taped messages from him have been released since then. Mohammed Jamal Abu Ahmed -- According to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation, authorities were examining in December whether Abu Ahmed played a role in the attack. He is allegedly the leader of a post-revolution terrorist network in Egypt. He was released from jail after the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak but was thought to be back in an Egyptian prison late last year.","Faraj al-Shibli is the second Benghazi suspect to surface in recent weeks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After more than 18 years on the nation's highest court, Supreme Court Justice David Souter is retiring, a source close to Souter told CNN Thursday. David Souter has served more than 18 years on the Supreme Court. Souter will leave after the current court term recesses in June, the source said. Filling Souter's seat would be President Barack Obama's first Supreme Court appointment -- and the first since George W. Bush's picks of Samuel Alito in 2006 and Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005. Souter, 69, was tapped for the court by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, but disappointed many conservatives when he turned out to be a typical old-fashioned Yankee Republican -- a moderate, with an independent, even quirky streak. Souter's departure will leave the two oldest justices -- and the most liberal -- still on the bench. Retirements for John Paul Stevens, 89, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 76, have been rumored for years, with many expecting that one or the other would be the first to give a new Democratic president a Supreme Court vacancy. Souter's decision came as something of a surprise, although he has long been known to prefer the quiet of his New Hampshire farmhouse to the bustle of the nation's capital. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Souter will leave after the current court term recesses in June, source says .

"There's a lot of sky-is-falling doomsday predictions about the World Conference on International Telecommunications, which opens Monday in Dubai with some 190-plus nations discussing the global internet's future. That's because much of the accompanying proposals from the global community have been kept under lock and key, although some of the positions of nations have been leaked and published online. The idea behind the meetings is to update the International Telecommunications Regulations governed by the International Telecommunications Union, a United Nations agency known as the ITU, that is responsible for global communication technologies. But the outcome of the two-week session isn't likely to make much change, as no proposal will be accepted if not agreed to by all nations. And the biggest fear — that the session will lead to net censorship — has already come to pass. ""Member States already have the right, as stated in Article 34 of the Constitution of ITU, to block any private telecommunications that appear 'dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency.' The treaty regulations cannot override the Constitution,"" said Hamadoun Touré, the ITU Secretary-General. Emma Llanso, a policy attorney with the Center for Democracy & Technology, said proposals by various governments to treat internet connections like the telephone system are cause for concern regarding privacy and the unfettered, free flow of information. But there is no ""doomsday"" internet kill switch scenario, she said. ""There's not going to be some kind of doomsday scenario that there's a treaty that makes the internet go dark,"" Llanso said. ""What we're seeing is governments putting forward visions of the internet and having discussions."" The last time the International Telecommunication Regulations global treaty was considered was in 1988. But technology has changed dramatically in the past 25 years. On the table for discussion are spectrum and technology standards to improve global interoperability and efficiency. Cybersecurity, spam and data retention are also on the table. Brett Solomon, executive director of Access, a digital rights group, is livid that the debate will be done largely in secret, with limited input from stakeholders. ""The ITU and its member states have attempted to respond to our criticisms and other challenges about the WCIT, but they fail to address the critical flaw: It's a closed, government-controlled agency that should not be making decisions about internet policy,"" he said. ""Such decisions necessarily require the participation of governments and the private sector and civil society."" The United States is battling plans to treat the internet like the telephone when it comes to transmission agreements. Some European and Middle Eastern members are calling for so-called termination fees, in which networks where a web session begins must pay the routing cost for the session's destination — like phone companies work with phone calls. ""That model, in general, lends itself to fewer providers, higher prices, slower take-up of internet, slower economic growth,"" said Terry Kramer, the head of the U.S. delegation. Llanso said termination fees, which would obviously be paid for by consumers, also opens the door to more internet monitoring. ""You can also read it as a campaign,"" she said, ""to make all internet communication more traceable and more trackable, invading users' privacy."" The dot-nxt site has published a clearinghouse of leaked documents regarding member proposals.","World Conference on International Telecommunications opens Monday in Dubai .

"Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens running back suspended by the NFL for two games after video showed him dragging his unconscious then-fiancée from an elevator, told reporters Thursday his actions were ""inexcusable."" ""You know that's not me,"" he said. ""You know that's something I have to live ... with the rest of my life."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week the running back would be suspended without pay for the first two games of the regular season. Rice indicted on assault charge . He also was fined an additional game check for ""conduct detrimental to the NFL,"" according to a league news release. The total amount Rice loses in pay reportedly amounts to $529,411. Rice resolved the charges stemming from the incident with his now-wife, Janay, and entered a pretrial intervention program in May, the NFL said. Under the program, he won't be prosecuted, and the charges will be expunged after a year, the league said. The punishments, both from the NFL and criminal justice system, were widely decried as too light, and it quickly spiraled into debates over domestic violence and victim blaming. Jane McManus, an espnW.com columnist, asked what message the suspension sent to the women who make up 45% of the NFL's audience. She said that an NFL official assured her the league doesn't tolerate domestic violence, ""but today I think we're seeing a little bit of a different message -- and one that might be a lot louder."" Fellow ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith was suspended by the network for a week after advising women not to behave in a way that might ""provoke wrong actions"" -- an assertion colleague Michelle Beadle publicly lambasted, tweeting, ""I'm now aware that I can provoke my own beating."" Smith has since apologized to Beadle and said he will strive to be more articulate in the future. Meanwhile, CNN anchor Carol Costello took to a soap box to ask point-blank: ""What was the NFL thinking?"" She questioned Coach John Harbaugh's decision to call Rice a ""heck of a guy"" and the Ravens' decision to tweet: ""Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident."" Costello also invoked many observers' dismay over the suspension of Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Gordon, who was suspended for a year after testing positive for marijuana. However, Gordon's suspension for a second positive drug test is dictated by the league's 2011 collective bargaining agreement, where Goodell is judge and jury when it comes to suspensions and fines for off-the-field conduct. Speaking at Thursday's news conference, Rice said he let down his family, teammates and the city of Baltimore. He said he knows his 2-year-old daughter might read about this on Google one day. ""I let so many people down because of 30 seconds in my life that you know I know I can't take back."" Rice apologized to his wife and called her an ""angel"" who could do ""no wrong."" ""We're in counseling. We're taking the necessary steps to move forward,"" he said. ""My job is to lead my family, my job is to lead my wife, my job is to lead in whatever I do. And If I'm not being the example, then my family crumbles. He said violence -- ""especially man on woman""-- is wrong and shouldn't be ""tolerated."" He said he and his wife will speak out about domestic violence. ""When the time is right we will go out there and help as many people as we can,"" he said.","Ray Rice will miss first two games of the season .

"The doubters have spoken. A group of independent experts -- who prodded authorities to release satellite data on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- says it thinks it knows the approximate location of the missing aircraft. Five separate computer models all place the plane in a tight cluster of spots in the south Indian Ocean — hundreds of miles southwest of the previous search site. ""We recommend that the search for MH370 be focused in this area,"" the group said in a statement late Tuesday. ""While there remain a number of uncertainties and some disagreements as to the interpretation of aspects of the data, our best estimates of a location of the aircraft (is) near 36.02 South 88.57 East,"" according to the statement,  which was approved by 10 named experts. The group opted to release its statement late Tuesday in advance of a BBC documentary on the missing plane, and ahead of the Australian government's announcement on the focus of the search, so that there would be no question about the independence of the group's findings, said one member of the group,  American Mobile Satellite Corp. co-founder Mike Exner. ""We wanted to get our best estimate out,"" Exner said. The group believes that after the Boeing 777 circumnavigated Indonesia, for reasons that are still unknown, the plane traveled south at an average speed of 470 knots, probably at a consistent altitude and constant heading,  Exner said.  All five computer models developed by the experts place the aircraft in a ""pretty tight cluster...plus or minus 50 miles of each other,"" he said. The plane and its 239 occupants vanished March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. In a blog post, group member Tim Farrar called the recommended search site ""our best estimate -- but not the only possible -- location for a potential search."" Meanwhile, a team of government experts and Inmarsat employees is re-evaluating the data before pinpointing where to resume the search. On Wednesday the agency overseeing the search said the analysis was ""nearly complete"" and it expects to announce the new search site by the end of June. Australian government authorities only recently acknowledged that acoustic pings heard two months ago are now believed to be unrelated to the aircraft's data recorders, or ""black boxes."" The ad hoc group of independent specialists came together through web sites of two experts, Duncan Steel of Wellington, New Zealand, and Tim Farrar of Menlo Park, California.  Several members of the group initially cast doubts on Inmarsat's conclusions that the plane had flown south, saying the publicly available information from Malaysia and Inmarsat was insufficient to draw that conclusion. The plane could have flown north, landing or crashing along an arc extending from Thailand to Eastern Europe. But shortly after Malaysia released raw satellite data on May 27, several of the loose confederation of scientists agreed it provided sufficient data to show the plane had flown south. The ""breakthrough piece of information,""  Exner said, was that the satellite terminal on the aircraft had been programmed to use a simplified assumption about the location of the satellite. The terminal assumed that the satellite was geostationary -- fixed over a spot on the equator -- when, in fact, it drifted to the north and south. Over the past few weeks, the group continued to exchange information through emails and through postings on the web sites. The group worked five or six hours Tuesday exchanging some 120 emails in drafting the statement on the  possible location of MH370. Exner said he believes authorities were narrowing in on the correct search site, but were thrown off course when searchers detected acoustic pings northwest of Australia. ""It's my personal opinion that the official search team weighed too heavily"" on the acoustic pings, he said. Exner said the informal group of experts has volunteered to work with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. But, while the government agencies have been polite, they have been reticent to release additional information that could further help the independent group, he said.

"The family of a teen critically injured when another teen, Ethan Couch, drove drunk last year has reached a settlement of more than $2 million. The case made national headlines after a witness claimed Couch was a victim of ""affluenza"" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the Texas boy. For the crimes of driving drunk and causing a crash -- which killed four people and critically injured two -- Couch received no jail time. He was ordered to go to a lockdown treatment facility and sentenced to 10 years' probation. The settlement, reached this month, involves the case of Sergio Molina, who was riding in the back of Couch's truck the night of the accident. He suffered a brain injury and can no longer speak, or move. He is considered minimally responsive. ""They told us that, basically, that's as much as he's going to rehabilitate,"" Sergio's brother, Alex Lemus, told CNN last year. In the six months since the accident, which took place in June, Lemus said medical bills had already topped $1 million. The family filed the lawsuit against the Couch family and the father's company because Ethan was driving a company-owned truck. The settlement includes a cash sum of more than $1 million, plus periodic payments, according to documents from the 96th District Court in Tarrant County. Most of the payment will be made by a liability insurer. An attorney for the Molina family declined to comment. Earlier this year, a lawyer representing Couch, who was 16 at the time of the wreck last June, lashed out at the news media for their focus on the use of ""affluenza"" to describe the boy's privileged upbringing. Of the two experts who testified in defense of the boy, only one used the word and he used it just once, attorney Reagan Wynn told CNN's ""New Day."" ""That term was not used by either of the lawyers that represented Mr. Couch, and it was not our defense, simply put,"" said Wynn. Last June, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when Couch's pickup truck plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. The vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Two people riding in the bed of the pickup, including Sergio Molina, were injured. According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Ethan had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit.

"It seems that McDonald's has finally realized how tone-deaf its internal employee resource website was. It has shut it down. The final straw? A tip on the site to employees to avoid McDonald's fare. A graphic on the site shows a meal with a cheeseburger, fries and drink under the caption ""Unhealthy choice."" Next to it is a picture of a sub, a salad and water under the caption ""Healthier choice."" The latest embarrassment is among a string that's cropped up since the McResource Line website went live. A McResource budget-planning guide for its employees was ridiculed in July for being out of touch. ""For starters, it didn't account for food and gasoline,"" CNNMoney reported. ""The second line on the sample budget leaves room for income from a second job, which many called an admission by the fast food giant that its workers can't live on its wages alone."" And then earlier this month, NBC News reported that the site offered a guide on how much one should tip a pool cleaner, housekeeper, and even an au pair. The only problem: The University of California Berkeley Labor Center and University of Illinois released a study in October that said 52% of families of fast food workers receive assistance from a public program like Medicaid, food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The fast food giant found itself again having to deflect unwanted attention from its internal site this week after CNBC reported that McResource ostensibly advises McDonald's employees to not eat at McDonald's. ""Fast foods are quick, reasonably priced, and readily available alternatives to home cooking. While convenient and economical for a busy lifestyle, fast foods are typically high in calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt and may put people at risk for becoming overweight."" Visitors to McResource Line on Wednesday were greeted with this statement: ""We are temporarily performing some maintenance in order to provide you with the best experience possible. Please excuse us while these upgrades are being made."" McDonald's confirmed the site had been taken down in a statement posted on its website. ""A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate and we've directed the vendor to take down the website. Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary.

"Editor's note: Richard Gabriel is the president of the American Society of Trial Consultants Foundation and president of Decision Analysis, a national trial consulting company. He has worked on the Casey Anthony and O.J. Simpson cases and is the author of the upcoming book, ""Acquittal"", to be published by Berkley Publishing, Penguin Group USA. In the courts and in society, we tend to think of racial bias as overt bigotry and imagine that the George Zimmermans and the Paula Deens of the world hold negative stereotypes of other races and intentionally think less of them as people. Actual bias, however, operates in the brain in a much different way. Our acceptance of other people and cultures is a recent development in human history. The thousands of years of survival training we have acquired in our slow march up the Homo sapiens ladder have taught us to fear and suspect others who do not look and act like us. Wars and genocide have ravaged populations in such forms as the Crusades, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, the war in Bosnia, the Hutu-Tutsi conflict, and the recently highlighted battles between Shiites and Sunnis, all in the name of demographic differences. Thomas Jefferson wrote the ""all men are created equal"" language in the Declaration of Independence while owning slaves. And despite the Emancipation Proclamation, the Supreme Court codified the oxymoronic ""separate but equal"" Jim Crow laws in the Plessy v. Ferguson case only 33 years later. So, despite our noble desire to love our fellow man, we are all suspicious of ""The Other"" -- in this case, the young man in a hoodie in the rain. Whether that figure comes in the form of a black teenager, a gay co-worker, the Muslim neighbor, the overweight teacher, the barista with the tattoos and piercings, or, yes, even the gun owner, we all have biases. And yet most of us will never admit we have them, placing our own Gandhi-like bias-free self-image on a pillar of fairness and equity. But the truth is, the more we deny we have biases, the more we broaden and deepen those prejudices. George Zimmerman has denied he holds any racial animosity. And that may be true. But with his statements, ""F***ing punks. These a**holes, they always get away,"" he may have been unconsciously referring to a combination of race, youth, behavior, and clothing. His frustration with the high crime rate in Sanford, Florida, and the robberies in his neighborhood no doubt aggravated his need to ""profile"" the perpetrators he felt were victimizing his community. Trayvon Martin, in saying he was being followed by a ""creepy-ass cracker,"" no doubt also racially labeled Zimmerman out of fear. That is how all of our brains work. We categorize the characteristics of those who seem so different from ourselves that it makes us uneasy. And we do it without even thinking about it. There is a well-known principle in social psychology called ingroup-outgroup bias, which is the tendency to judge members of your own group more favorably and others more harshly. This has been followed by a great deal of recent research on ""implicit bias"" -- a subconscious negative association that we automatically attribute to others. Both of these cognitive blind spots are dangerous because they run in the background of our minds, all day long, outside our awareness. So when Juror B37 speaks to Anderson Cooper about not finding Trayvon Martin's friend Rachel Jeantel credible because she found her ""hard to understand"" and Jeantel was ""using phrases I had never heard before,"" it is obvious that it was hard for this juror to relate to this witness. And it is a combination of skin color, idiom, nonverbal behavior, and personality that causes this cultural outgroup divide, not just her race. This juror did not know about Rachel Jeantel's underbite, or that she grew up speaking Spanish and Creole, or how those things affected her communication style, and thus could not relate to her. In her interview, Juror B37 spoke about Zimmerman's justified actions, his state of mind, her sympathies for him as well as the deceased Martin. In jury selection, she spoke about the Sanford protests before the trial as ""rioting."" This juror could more easily relate to Zimmerman as the neighborhood watch volunteer trying to protect his neighborhood. Jeantel, in her interview with Piers Morgan, said she believes that the situation was ""racial"" and Zimmerman was ""finally gonna get one."" Some of Martin's supporters invoked Emmett Till and Medgar Evers and criticized the racial makeup of the Zimmerman jury. Their comments, from their experiences, reveal the harsh reality of the world they live in. Nearly 20 years ago, when I was working for the defense on the O.J. Simpson case, much was made about the racial makeup of that jury (made up of nine blacks, two whites and one Hispanic). But again, it was not just the skin color of those jurors alone that determined that verdict. Three-quarters of those jurors had personal experience with the police profiling, planting evidence, and engaging in other  mistreatment. Their experience, derived from their racial reality, obviously made them more receptive to the defense's arguments about police misconduct. We see what we have experienced. So we see what we want to see, whether we are a white juror in Sanford, Florida, or an African-American juror in Los Angeles. I have worked on more than a thousand trials and have watched jurors in hundreds of jury selections struggle to recognize their own biases and reconcile them with their desire to be impartial judges of facts and laws. In jury selection in the Zimmerman case, jurors spoke about impressions they had already formed about the case, as well as their own experiences with crime and law enforcement.  And while I do not question the Zimmerman jurors' fairness in deciding this case, fundamental psychology and common sense says that you are never fully able to ""set aside"" your experiences and the beliefs that you have held for years. In much of this country, this pervasive ingroup-outgroup implicit bias has allowed minority defendants to be charged and sentenced at statistically disproportionate numbers while the disparity is dismissed with excuses, a shrug, and a resigned ""What are you gonna do?"" It has allowed institutional discrimination to occur in government, businesses, schools, and the courts, while politicians, executives, teachers, and judges vehemently deny its existence. And it has left a bitter legacy of disparate treatment of African-Americans by mostly white juries. At the conclusion of this tragic case, we can divide again into camps of pro-Martin or pro-Zimmerman advocates and bemoan the lack of racial progress. However, instead of just shaking our heads and speaking sadly about how far we still have to go in the area of race relations, let's use this solemn opportunity to actually move the discussion forward. Just the fact that there has been so much peaceful reflection after this verdict shows a great deal of progress. The American Bar Association, the National Center for State Courts, the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System, and the American Society of Trial Consultants Foundation have all recognized that these biases are a pernicious form of decay in our justice system, and these organizations are studying and implementing reforms in the courts. A Tufts University study in 2006 showed that diverse juries made better decisions because the different perspectives made them more thorough and less likely to make factual errors. While I am not criticizing this jury's decision, the courts and local communities would all benefit from greater diversity. Former Police Chief William Bratton significantly reduced inner city crime rates in New York and Los Angeles and improved police relations in minority neighborhoods by community policing policies that favored mediating differences instead of authoritarian strong-arm tactics. Community courts are gaining favor as a way of building partnerships among residents, merchants, churches, and schools to address local safety and crime problems. Bias is not simple, and we shouldn't pretend it is. We also should not act as though it is a horrible monster that we should run from. It isn't. It lives in all of us. We just don't know it. The real question for us is not whether we have biases, but how our biases affect how we see and interact with strangers, standing scared in the rain in the middle of a gated community. So it's time to stop pretending. It's time to make implicit bias explicit. If we're going to talk about race, let's talk about race without resorting to platitudes, righteousness or defensiveness. It's time to recognize that race is more than skin color. It is a rich tapestry woven with cultural, linguistic, behavioral and moral threads. It's time to talk without judging. It's time to listen without condemning. It's time to admit and take responsibility for who we are. Most importantly, it's time to start understanding. If we really want this trial to mean something, we owe both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman at least that much.","Richard Gabriel: People see themselves as unbiased, but we all carry prejudices with us .

"The gunman behind the deadly siege of a cafe in Sydney this week was not on a security watch list, and Australia's Prime Minister wants to know why. Tony Abbott said Wednesday that the system fell short. ""There's no doubt about that, and this is why we've got to constantly learn the lessons of everything that happens,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""We've got to be constantly asking ourselves: Is this the best we can do? ""And frankly, we've got to always be better at this because if we aren't good at this, our people suffer. And the tragedy of this atrocity is that two delightful Australians, two very decent people, are dead. Others are injured. Others are traumatized because of a madman who was roaming our streets,"" the Prime Minister said. His office announced that authorities will carry out an urgent review into the hostage taking and ""what lessons can be learned from the events leading up to and surrounding the siege."" At a news conference later Wednesday, Abbott told Australians, ""I will not rest until I am confident that you are as safe as any government can possibly make you."" A report on the conclusions of the review is due by the end of January. Authorities have identified the gunman as Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia. He seized control of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in the heart of Sydney's central business district and held it for some 16 hours. The siege ended when police stormed the cafe early Tuesday. The gunman was killed, but so were two hostages -- Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old barrister and mother of three, and Tori Johnson, the manager of the cafe. Victims of Sydney siege . 'I share the exasperation' Monis was on bail for violence criminal offenses at the time of the attack. He had a long history of mental illness and violence, the Prime Minister said. ""This was the act of someone who was way beyond any mainstream, any mainstream, and has been rightly, absolutely repudiated by all the communities of Australia,"" Abbott told the Australian broadcaster. ""We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism."" At the news conference in Canberra later in the day, he also raised questions about how Monis was able to obtain permanent residency in Australia, as well as welfare benefits. ""I share the exasperation of the Australian public at what appears to be someone who's been having a lend of us, for many years,"" Abbott told reporters. He also said that the gunman had a firearms license, but the Australian Federal Police later clarified that that wasn't true. The federal police, who had originally given Abbott the erroneous information, said the confusion arose from an entry in a national database that was now being investigated. At the news conference, Abbott said he also wanted to know why Monis seemed to have fallen off Australian security agencies' watch lists in 2009. But he offered little in the way of details about what took place in the final hours of the siege. ""When you are in a firefight, all sorts of things happen,"" Abbott told reporters. ""The important thing for the police in a situation like that is to take care of the terrorist as quickly as possible."" He said that on the police's advice, he had refused to act on the gunman's demand to talk to him during the siege. As authorities work to find the answer to that, and other unanswered questions, a makeshift memorial has sprung up in Sydney as people come to pay tribute to the victims. Thousands of people have left flowers, cards and signed condolence books. ""We're a country that is not innocent of these issues,"" Kim Beazley, Australian ambassador to the United States, told CNN's ""The Lead With Jake Tapper,"" on Wednesday. ""We are well-prepared in many ways, but we weren't well-prepared enough for this particular man, in this particular place, and that will require investigation,"" he said.","Police say gunman didn't have a firearms license, correcting earlier information .

"A journalist accused of striking Brad Pitt at the ""Maleficent"" premiere has been charged with four misdemeanors, Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox said Friday. Ukrainian TV reporter Vitalii Sediuk was charged with one count of battery, one count of assault and two violations of the Los Angeles municipal code, Wilcox said. The code violations relate to Sediuk's stage crashing at the 2013 Grammy Awards, Wilcox said. Pitt was signing autographs Wednesday at the area of the red carpet where fans are allowed to gather when Sediuk allegedly jumped the rope and hit  the actor in his face, according to Los Angeles Police Sgt. Leonard Calderon. Pitt, who was there with partner Angelina Jolie, star of ""Maleficent,"" continued unfazed on the carpet to give interviews. Sediuk, who was due to make a first appearance in court Friday afternoon, was transferred from the LAPD's Hollywood precinct jail to the county's central jail, operated by the sheriff. While his bond was initially set at $20,000 after his arrest, the judge could raise that since additional charges have emerged connected to the Grammys incident. Sediuk is infamous for red carpet pranks around the world, including kissing Will Smith in Moscow and hugging Leonardo DiCaprio and Bradley Cooper around the knees at separate events earlier this year. Sediuk, 25, was fired from his reporter job with Ukrainian television channel 1+1 after he jumped under actress America Ferrera's dress on a Cannes red carpet on May 17, a spokesman for the company told CNN. The TV network was not involved in his stunts, a spokesman said. He was already on three years of ""formal diversion"" -- a form of probation -- in Los Angeles for crashing the Grammy stage during Adele's acceptance last year, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman. The lawyer who represented Seduik in the Grammy case was surprised when CNN called him Thursday about the latest arrest. Attorney: Client 'a real nice guy' Sediuk is ""a real nice guy,"" Anthony Willoughby said. ""I'm really shocked that he would be accused of hitting somebody."" ""This was an unfortunate and inappropriate incident that is being investigated by the LAPD,"" a spokesman for Disney Studio, the film's distributor, said of the incident involving Pitt. Police did not say whether Pitt was punched or slapped, just that the attacker struck him in the face. The attacker was quickly tackled by bodyguards, handcuffed by police and hauled away to jail. He now is barred from going near Pitt. Los Angeles police issued an emergency protective order effective for five days starting Thursday, but the actor's lawyer could ask a judge to extend it. Sediuk's celebrity pranks are usually silly, attention-getting stunts that do not involve violence. Grammys stage-crasher reveals his entry plan . He eluded security to get a second-row seat inside the Staples Center at the 2013 Grammy Awards, despite having no credentials. Sediuk jumped onto the stage when Jennifer Lopez announced Adele as the winner.  ""I love you, Adele,"" he is heard saying as the singer approached.  He was arrested offstage and later prosecuted on two misdemeanor charges. He eventually accepted a plea deal for probation with the provision that he not go back to the Staples Center and stay out of trouble for three years. ""I think that the court overly protects the entertainment industry,"" Willoughby told CNN. A not-welcome presence at events . Award show and premiere producers apparently black-listed Sediuk after last year's Grammy incident.  He was denied reporter credentials to the Oscars, but he showed up anyway wearing a feathered swan outfit similar to the one worn by Björk on the 2001 Oscars red carpet.  He was ordered to leave the venue after telling police it was a protest. Will Smith on the red carpet slap heard 'round the world' The celebrity stunts apparently began when Sediuk handed Madonna an odd and unwelcomed gift of a hydrangea during a news conference at the Venice Film Festival in September 2011. ""I absolutely loathe hydrangeas,"" she said as she stuffed them under a table. Don't buy Madonna hydrangeas . Sediuk's infamy grew in May 2012 on a Moscow red carpet where Will Smith was attending a movie premiere. Video shows Sediuk attempting to kiss the actor on the mouth.  ""Come on, what the hell is your problem?"" Smith said as he pushed the reporter away and lightly slapped him.  ""He's lucky I ain't sucker punched him."" Sediuk crawled onto a red carpet and under Ferraro's dress at the Cannes Film Festival in France earlier this month. Video shows him being dragged away.  It was this incident that cost him his job at the Ukrainian channel, the company said. Sediuk's actions ""were neither suggested nor coordinated by the network,"" 1+1 TV spokesman Serhiy Popov told CNN on Thursday.  ""Vitalii was acting on his own behalf and not on the behalf of the channel."" The network is not helping Sediuk deal with his legal problems, Popov said.","Los Angeles prosecutor files four charges .

"He had been on the run for four decades. He escaped from prison when Richard Nixon was in the White House, joined the Black Liberation Army in Detroit, hijacked a plane and (in)famously demanded that FBI agents deliver ransom money in bathing suits. And they did. Now, after a manhunt spanning three continents that often appeared to run cold, the FBI has finally found George Wright. At age 68, he was living quietly in the resort of Sintra near Lisbon in Portugal when he was arrested Monday. The United States is seeking his extradition from Portugal to serve the remainder of a 15- to 30-year sentence for murder. Portuguese judicial authorities could not be reached Tuesday for details of the extradition process. Wright is fighting extradition, a U.S. federal agent said, and his next court appearance in Portugal is in about two weeks. Wright's life story reads like an international crime novel. In 1962, at the age of 19, he and three associates carried out a series of robberies in New Jersey. Wright and another man shot and killed a World War II veteran in a gas station robbery in Farmingdale. He was arrested soon afterward and, after pleading no defense, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison. But in 1970, Wright escaped from Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, reportedly stealing the warden's car to make his getaway. Wright made his way to Detroit, then a hotbed of militant black politics, and joined the Black Liberation Army. (He is also reputed to have made some money during this period as a part-time model, using an alias.) On July 31, 1972, Wright and four other members of the Black Liberation Army went to Detroit airport and boarded Delta Flight 841 for Miami. Wright was dressed as a priest and carried a handgun in a hollowed-out Bible. Airport security was different in those days. Various Palestinian groups were hijacking planes regularly, as were individuals keen to go to Cuba. Altogether, the U.S. Department of Transportation recorded 364 hijackings worldwide between 1968 and 1972: more than one a week on average. The hijackers of Delta 841 -- three men and two women accompanied by three children -- seized the plane as it approached Miami. The FBI says ""subsequent investigation identified Wright as one of the hijackers."" Once on the ground, the hijackers demanded that FBI agents dressed only in bathing suits deliver $1 million ransom to the plane. They wanted to be sure the agents were not carrying guns. The money was duly delivered by the scantily clad agents. The hijackers allowed the 88 passengers off but kept the flight crew on board and ordered that the plane fly to Boston. With the addition of an extra navigator (wearing swim trunks and a shirt), the DC-8 was refueled there and flew on to Algiers. Algeria in the early 1970s was run by a hard-line socialist government that was no friend of the United States and allowed various dissidents, militants and alleged terrorists to take sanctuary there. A leading member of the Black Panthers, Eldridge Cleaver, had been welcomed as a political refugee there in 1968 after jumping bail in California. The Algerian government confiscated and returned the $1 million in ransom money to the U.S., but Wright and his associates melted away. Some of the hijackers were arrested in Paris in 1976, but for decades, there was no trace of Wright. Then, nine years ago, a fugitive investigator with the New Jersey Department of Corrections working with the U.S. Marshals Service got a lead. Officials won't comment on reports that Wright had begun to contact relatives in the United States. Juan Mattos, U.S. marshal for the District of New Jersey, said: ""Over the course of nine years, their tenacious resolve has proven to be very powerful in seeking justice and closure for the victims."" And in a press release Tuesday, Michael Ward of the FBI's Newark Division said the case should ""serve notice that the FBI's determination in pursuing subjects will not diminish over time or distance."" At the time of the hijacking, there was limited screening of passengers at U.S. airports. This screening system did not require every passenger to be examined, only those who met a profile established by the Federal Aviation Administration. After the Algiers flight and several hijackings that turned violent, the Nixon administration instructed the FAA to adopt emergency regulations to improve screening. At the end of 1972, the FAA ordered airports to ensure that all passengers and their carry-on baggage be inspected before boarding.","George Wright, 68, arrested Monday in Portuguese resort town .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday during an unannounced visit to Afghanistan that he doesn't know whether soldiers will continue to receive paychecks if an agreement over the U.S. debt ceiling cannot be reached. ""I certainly hope it gets solved,"" Mullen told reporters. America's highest-ranking military officer said soldiers had recently asked him about the crisis, saying ""here we are, halfway around the world, fighting our country's wars, and I've got to worry about a paycheck."" Mullen said August 15 would be the first payday jeopardized if the United States defaults. Soldiers normally get paid in two-week increments, making the last assured payday on August 1, he said. Senate leaders said Sunday that progress had occurred in the talks on a deficit reduction deal that would raise the debt ceiling and cut spending. However, the deadline for the United States to face possible default on its obligations is midnight Tuesday, and political wrangling in Congress has held up an agreement so far. On Friday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a statement to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work as scheduled in the coming week, regardless of whether a deal gets worked out. Panetta pledged to do ""everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected."" A Department of Defense official told CNN on condition of not being identified on the possibility of military pay being withheld, ""it's not a question of whether, but when, if an agreement isn't reached."" The Treasury Department has not specified what might happen for troops if an agreement is not reached. But the impact could be substantial if a prolonged battle prevents the government from sending out millions of checks owed to active-duty soldiers, Social Security beneficiaries, federal employees and others. Congress has until August 2 to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Otherwise, Americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar, among other problems. Mullen said Sunday that he has seen progress in Afghanistan since a so-called ""surge"" of 33,000 additional troops. Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" is also in Afghanistan to visit with troops, along with basketball player Karl Malone and magician David Blaine.","NEW: Defense Secretary Panetta asks for patience from troops .

"A New York jury Wednesday found former pharmaceuticals executive Gigi Jordan guilty of first-degree manslaughter for feeding a lethal drug concoction to her autistic 8-year-old son. The jury accepted her claim that she acted in a state of ""extreme emotional disturbance."" Jordan faces a 5- to 25-year prison sentence. ""Gigi Jordan showed no mercy to her son, and should receive none at the time of her sentencing,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement. Jordan, 53, displayed little emotion as the verdict was announced at the close of a sensational two-month trial in Manhattan, in which prosecutors described in chilling detail how the businesswoman, who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals, forced little Jude Mirra to swallow a cocktail of painkillers and anti-inflammatories in 2010. Prosecutors said Jordan, who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused, forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe. Jordan's defense lawyers, citing legal errors during the long proceedings, said they will appeal and seek a new trial. ""This was not a murder case,"" defense attorney Norman Siegel said outside court. ""And that's because there were extenuating and horrific circumstances. And, apparently the jurors got it."" Defense lawyer Allan Brenner said the verdict was a victory. ""She loved him so much that she couldn't bear the thought of him living without her, or him being subjected to the life she tried to rescue him from,"" he said. ""Any time someone is convicted of a crime, particularly of the crime of having caused the death of a young child, there's nothing to revel in. There's no glory or triumph here. To the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously, violently, coldly doing away with her child, that's a triumph."" Defense: She was a desperate mother . At her trial, which started on September 10, no one disputed the unthinkable manner in which Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan's was unable to reach her. When police arrived at the hotel, they found Jordan sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive, surrounded by pills and pill bottles. An autopsy found four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill the boy still undigested in his stomach. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs. Prosecutor Matt Bogdanos presented expert testimony that showed the boy's injuries were consistent with Jordan climbing on top of Jude and holding open his mouth as she poured the lethal cocktail. But Brenner painted a portrait of Jordan as a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude by her two former husbands. The defense said one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other former husband -- his biological father -- who she believed had sexually abused the boy. ""This was not an act carried out with murderous intent,"" Brenner told jurors in closing arguments. The prosecution said there was no evidence Jude was ever sexually abused. On the stand, Jordan, a former nurse who started a home health care company, portrayed her actions as a mercy killing. Her ex-husband was threatening to kill her, she said. ""You're a dead woman,"" she claimed he told her. ""I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life,"" she told the jury, placing her hand over her mouth. Jordan said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by ""a good number of people."" The boy's father has denied the allegations and has not been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS has reported. BlackBerry communication disputed . While on the stand, Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a jury the last time she saw her son alive. Jude's vocabulary was limited. He typed on a BlackBerry to communicate with her. ""We were typing throughout some period of time. We were saying goodbye to each other,"" Jordan told the jury and then began to cry. ""At some point, I put the pills together,"" she recalled. ""I gave him the pills."" ""Which drugs did you give him more of?"" Brenner asked. ""A lot more of the Ambien,"" she said. ""I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of. I gave him Hydrocodone, which were large. I was drinking a vodka orange and there was a little left. I broke up the pill and put it into the juice mixed with vodka."" But the prosecution challenged the idea that Jude was actually communicating via a BlackBerry through the use of a controversial method known as ""facilitated communication."" Some witnesses described how Jordan held the device in one hand while supporting and possibly guiding her son's arm with the other as Jude looked away. Bogdanos questioned whether a young autistic boy would even know how to use and spell words like ""aggressively"" and ""sadistic."" Brenner sought to show that Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. Prosecutors said the killing was premeditated and Jordan expected to survive. As Jude lay dying, the prosecution said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. In addition, Jordan transferred $8 million from a savings to a checking account before checking into the hotel with her son. Jordan told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.","Defense lawyers, citing legal errors, say they will appeal and seek a new trial .

"Prince Harry has spoken for the first time about his notorious romp in a Las Vegas hotel suite when photographs were published around the world of him nude, just weeks before he began his tour of duty in Afghanistan. The prince was photographed during a game of strip billiards in his hotel suite with friends and a group of women they had met. The prince said he had ""probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down."" ""But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. ""Back home all my close friends rallied round me and were great."" He added that it was ""probably a classic example of me you know probably being too much army and not enough prince. It's a simple case of that."" No action over naked Prince Harry photos, palace says . His deployment with 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps allowed him to withdraw from the public eye, but speaking while stationed at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan he allowed his frustration with the media to show through. Harry received news that the Duchess of Cambridge, was expecting a baby while he was on his tour of duty and, from afar, he expressed sympathy at his sister-in-law's treatment at the hands of the press. ""I can't wait to be an uncle. I think it's very unfair that they were both forced to publicize it when they were, but that's just the media for you. I just only hope that she and him, but mainly Catherine, hopefully that she gets the necessary protection to allow her as a mother-to-be to enjoy the privacy that that comes with."" Harry's own privacy is clearly a concern for the prince as well, and he made little attempt to hide it. Referring to the TV producer whom he was addressing, he said: ""I never wanted you guys to be out here, but there was an agreement made to invite you out on the deal that the media didn't speculate before my deployment. That's the only reason you guys are out here."" Back home the media glare will inevitably be brighter than it has been on him for the last four months. And the pressure will be back on the 28-year-old to settle down. ""If you find the right person and everything feels right, then it takes time, especially for myself and my brother. You ain't ever going to find someone who's going to jump into the position that it would hold. Simple as that."" Harry said he now put his military role ahead of his royal duties. ""Once you are wearing the uniform you are part of the gang and you know, fine, I am the queen's grandson and all that good stuff. ""I love representing her, but to be honest with you ... and as far as I see it ... and as far as William sees it as well -- our service towards our country in the military in whichever shape or form it takes -- will always come first. I know some people look at it thinking it's all a big bluff -- and the only reason they are doing all this is to keep themselves out of public duties -- well to a certain extent yes. There is no reason for us to do public duties, because we are doing public service."" Harry on Afghan mission: 'Take a life to save a life' Life in the army is ""as normal as it's going to get"" for Harry and he said relishes having the chance to be hang out and be treated as ""one of the guys. Asked if he was more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry, he answered: ""Definitely. I've always been like that. My father's always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that. ""But it's very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the army. Everyone's wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing."" Harry admitted that he was more at home in an aircraft cockpit than a classroom. ""I don't know ... I am one of those people that during my flying course especially ... I would be fine at flying, probably should have done a lot more reading. But I was fine at flying. Then every now and then a written test would come up and I would be absolutely useless ... exams were always a nightmare. Anything like kicking a ball around and playing Playstation or flying, I do ... I genuinely find a bit easier than walking sometimes. ""My brother (was) probably exactly the same, my father flew, my uncles have flown all, all sorts of people have flown in my family, I wouldn't suggest that is where it comes from it is, it's great fun. I was given the opportunity and I couldn't say no to it."" What do you think about Prince Harry's comments?

"A New York man who pleaded guilty in January to charges of aiding al Qaeda was ready to be a suicide bomber for the organization, but was told he needed more religious instruction, according to a document obtained by CNN on Thursday. Bryant Neal Vinas says he spent time in the mountains of Waziristan with al Qaeda members. Bryant Neal Vinas gave an interview in March to Belgian prosecutors as part of a terrorism case there involving a cell he was associated with. CNN obtained the prosecution-prepared interview summary document from a Belgian defense attorney, and it was authenticated by both a federal prosecutor in New York and Vinas' defense attorney. The French-language document gives a detailed picture of how Vinas traveled from New York to Pakistan and what he did while he was there. Vinas pleaded guilty in January to charges of conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization, the FBI said Wednesday. He admitted involvement in an attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan in September 2008, according to an indictment filed under seal and made public Wednesday. In addition, authorities said he provided al Qaeda with information about the New York transit system and the Long Island Railroad. Vinas, 26, is an American citizen, said a source close to the investigation. He was arrested in Pakistan, the source said. According to the document obtained Thursday, the Queens, New York-born Vinas converted from Catholicism to Islam in 2004. He hooked up with al Qaeda in Pakistan three years later, and by September 2007 was determined to wage jihad in Afghanistan, the document says. He left New York exactly six years after al Qaeda struck the city and arrived in Lahore, a major city in eastern Pakistan, on September 12, 2007. With the help of a friend he had known in New York, who was connected in militant circles, Vinas sought out individuals in Lahore who could help connect him to jihadists fighting in Afghanistan, according to the document. Weeks later, the document says, Vinas was in Afghanistan's Kunar province, a hotbed of the insurgency, with a group of 20 insurgents who crept up near an American combat outpost. At the last minute, they decided not to fire mortars on the base because American war planes were circling overhead, the document says. Before launching the raid, Vinas said, recruits were required to sign a number of forms. From the document, it is not clear whether those forms constituted formal membership in al Qaeda, but Vinas stated that ""it was not necessary to sign documents or take part in a ceremony to become a member of al Qaeda."" Later in the document, he was quoted as saying he succeeded in becoming a full member of al Qaeda. Vinas then returned to Mohmand, an agency in Pakistan's tribal areas, the document says. His handlers then asked him to become a suicide bomber. He agreed, and was sent to Peshawar, Pakistan, to receive more instructions. But Vinas told investigators that his handlers decided he needed more religious instruction before he would be ready to become a suicide bomber, the document said. After his instruction in Peshawar, Vinas said, he traveled into the mountains of Waziristan in Pakistan's tribal areas. Vinas said that during his time there he spent a lot of time with members of al Qaeda, including operatives from Saudi Arabia and Yemen, according to the document. Between March and July 2008, Vinas said he attended three al Qaeda training courses, learning how to fire an AK-47, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and handguns. He also familiarized himself with explosives and was taught to make suicide bombing vests. At the end of his training, Vinas said, his handlers judged that he was qualified to participate in missile attacks against American, NATO and Afghan bases in Afghanistan, the document said. In September 2008, Vinas said, he traveled to a town near the Afghan frontier where he joined a group of jihadists including al Qaeda fighters. Creeping toward the Afghan border, he said, the group fired rockets toward an American combat outpost in Afghanistan. This is the attack Vinas pleaded guilty to in January, authorities said Wednesday. After launching the attack, Vinas spent several weeks in the mountains of Waziristan near the Afghan border. It was there, Vinas said, that he had detailed conversations with ""al Qaeda chiefs,"" according to the document. Vinas is quoted as saying the subject of those discussions included attacks in the West, including in the United States. Vinas is not quoted in the document elaborating further. Vinas stated that he left Pakistan's tribal areas in October 2008 and returned to Peshawar in search of a wife. That's where he was arrested a few weeks later. Vinas is quoted in the document saying that during his stay in Pakistan he spent time with a number of Belgian and French citizens who had traveled to Pakistan's tribal areas in early 2008, and who, like Vinas, received military training there. In December 2008, several members of this group and some of their Brussels associates were arrested on their return to Europe after security services received indications they might be plotting a terrorist attack in Belgium. Belgian magistrates wanted to question Vinas in March for this reason. Vinas pleaded guilty on January 28 in a closed hearing, according to court documents. At the time, the case was filed naming ""John Doe"" as a defendant and was sealed. The FBI's New York office would not say whether Vinas has been sentenced or comment on why the case was sealed. It said Vinas is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Vinas is also known as ""Ibrahim,"" ""Bashir al-Ameriki"" and ""Ben Yameen al-Kandee,"" according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday. In Pakistan, according to the document, Vinas said he met with the alleged leader of the Franco-Belgian cell, a Tunisian, who Belgian intelligence sources have told CNN was Moez Garsallaoui. Garsallaoui is the husband of Malika el Aroud, a Belgian woman who has been described as an ""icon"" of the jihadist movement because her former husband assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, the head of Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, two days before 9/11. El Aroud was one of those arrested in Brussels and is awaiting trial, accused of having teamed up with her new husband to recruit Europeans to fight Jihad. In 2006, CNN interviewed Garsallaoui and El Aroud in Switzerland. Garsallaoui, who Belgian counterterrorism sources believe is still at large in the tribal areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan, boasted to other group members that he had carried out an attack on an American base in Afghanistan, firing rockets from Pakistan, according to legal documents obtained by CNN. It is not clear whether Vinas also joined Garsallaoui on these raids.","Man has pleaded guilty to charges of aiding al Qaeda .

"Three or four years ago, it was supposed to be the next big thing in consumer tech: the magic of 3-D, right in your living room. Fast-forward to today, however, and the truth comes right at you. Despite waves of hype, 3-D TV has never caught on. And now that one of its biggest early champions is abandoning the format, some are wondering whether the 3-D experiment should be declared dead. ESPN, which in 2010 announced that it would offer events like World Cup soccer and the NCAA national championship football game in 3-D, now says it will stop doing so this year. ""ESPN 3D was great at home but due to low adoption of 3D to home, we are discontinuing to focus on other products for fans and affiliates,"" ESPN spokeswoman Katina Arnold announced on Twitter. She followed up by promising that the network will keep trying to push the boundaries of the viewing experience. ""ESPN 3D production unmatched!"" she wrote. ""As tech leader, ESPN will continue to experiment with things like UHDTV (ultra high-definition)."" Analysts say ESPN's reasoning reflects a sad truth for an industry that once thought the runaway success of movies like ""Avatar"" meant consumers would have similar interest in watching 3-D in their living rooms. ""The excitement around 3-D TV was coming from many places: the industry, the TV manufacturers and the content providers,"" said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Gartner Research. ""But not the consumers, and ultimately that is what proved fatal."" According to data from research firm DisplaySearch, adoption of 3-D TV in North America peaked in early 2011, when about 11% of TV owners had one. But growth has stalled and even dipped since then. The technology fared better among TV owners in the rest of the world, growing to about 20% of the market before beginning to slide late last year. Quite simply, Milanesi said, consumers just haven't considered it worth the money. Combine that with consumer-tech trends moving in the opposite direction, and it's a recipe for failure, she said. ""The lack of content and the higher cost of the hardware made adoption slow,"" she said. ""And now we see consumers focus their money on other consumer electronics such as tablets, adding screens to their home rather than focusing on the main screen."" Complaints about home 3-D have centered around high prices, the limited number of 3-D offerings and the awkward glasses that made viewing uncomfortable over long periods of time. And many consumers, having recently traded in their clunky tube TVs for high-def flat screens, weren't ready to replace their sets yet again with newer models. ESPN's 3-D channel has been carried by several cable networks, but  AT&T's Uverse dumped all 3-D in 2011, saying it was too expensive. That's not the sort of thing that's going to encourage many producers or networks to make their own 3-D shows or pay for the pricey equipment needed to shoot live events in three dimensions. A few other 3-D providers remain, most notably 3net, a channel jointly owned by Discovery, Sony and IMAX. In a statement, 3Net said ESPN's decision would have ""no impact on our business."" ""It's understandable that content creators are hesitant to continue investing in costly new technologies if the viewer base is not growing at an attractive rate,"" said Paul Gagnon, DisplaySearch's director of TV research in North America. ""This move by ESPN might signal that the momentum has shifted away from 3-D in the U.S., and TV manufacturers and retailers would be wise to take note."" That momentum appears now to be swinging toward the technology Arnold mentioned in her post: ultra HD, also known as 4K TV. Screens on that emerging format promise definition that's four times sharper than regular HD. Sony is leading the pack with a giant 4K model already on the market and others hitting stores soon. But other manufacturers aren't far behind. As with 3-D TV, there's still not a ton of available content for that level of definition. But 4K is in its infancy, and observers, including Milanesi, predict it will catch on in a way that home 3-D never has.","ESPN announced it will suspend 3-D TV broadcasts by end of the year .
The prospect of 3-D excited the TV industry, but consumers never took to it .
Consumers complained about cost, awkward glasses, scarce 3-D content .
Analysts say ultra-HD, 4K television may be the next wave ."
"A new survey about preferences and trends in Mexico concludes that one out of every three Mexicans would migrate to the United States if given the opportunity.  The survey published Tuesday by the Washington-based Pew Research Center also says that of the 34% of Mexicans who indicated they would like to move to the U.S., 17% ""would do so without authorization,"" meaning without legal documents. Katie Simmons, senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, says that attitude has changed little in the past five years. ""It's been relatively constant,"" Simmons said.  ""We first asked people about this in 2009, and the percentage was 33%, compared to 34% this year."" On the other hand, the survey found that fewer Mexicans have friends or family in the United States.  According to Simmons, this means the migration of Mexicans to the United States has continued to decline in the last few years.  The number of Mexicans who report having a friend or family member living in the U.S. has fallen to 32%, compared with 42% in 2007. ""The most interesting finding that we reported in terms of migration is this change in the percentage of Mexicans who have friends or relatives in the United States.  This percentage is a reflection of the change in net migration.  It's an objective indicator of current migration trends,"" Simmons said. The Pew Research Center reported in 2012 that net migration from Mexico to the United States fell to zero (and perhaps less) between 2005 and 2010, meaning the number of Mexicans migrating north is equal to or less than those going back to their country. The latest Pew survey ""is based on face-to-face interviews conducted among a representative sample of 1,000 randomly selected adults from across the country between April 21 and May 2, 2014."" The survey covered a wide range of topics including the popularity of current President Enrique Pena Nieto (51%), which declined 6 percentage points in the past year as he pushed through energy and communications reforms some view with suspicion. Crime continues to be the top concern for Mexicans (79%), followed by corruption of political leaders (72%) and drug cartel-related violence (72%). The survey also shows that Mexicans seem to have a very positive image of the military (75%), although many people are concerned about human rights violations as the armed forces continue to fight criminal organizations. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Fast facts: Immigration statistics .

"In increasingly virtual South Korea, the latest bizarre fad is watching someone eat online. Called 'muk-bang' in Korean, which translates to 'eating broadcasts,' online channels live-stream people eating enormous servings of food while chatting away to those who are watching. The queen of this particular phenomenon is the Diva, a waifish, pretty 33-year-old woman apparently blessed with the stomach capacity of several elephants and the metabolism of a hummingbird. Every evening around 8 p.m, several thousand viewers tune in to watch The Diva -- real name Park Seo-Yeon -- begin inhaling enough food for several college linebackers. She easily polishes off four large pizzas or three kilograms (6 lb) of beef in one sitting, albeit over the span of several hours. After she eats, she spends another two or three hours just talking to her fans, who communicate with her via a chat room which accompanies her live-stream channel. For Park, online eating is not just a niche hobby but a significant source of income — she makes up to ₩10 million ($9,300) a month from her broadcasts alone. Her costs are also high, however. She says she spends an average of $3,000 per month purchasing food for her show, which she broadcasts for about four to six hours per night. Confessions of a Diva . Thanks to the live chat room that accompanies her channel, feedback is instantaneous and the show interactive. Comments flood in and she reads from them in real time. ""My fans tell me that they really love watching me eat because I do so with so much gusto and make everything look so delicious,"" says Park. ""A lot of my viewers are on diets and they say they live vicariously through me, or they are hospital patients who only have access to hospital food so they also watch my broadcasts to see me eat."" While it would seem that her metabolism would make her public enemy number one, some of the Diva's biggest fans are women, and indeed her channel is more popular with women than with men, with a 60-40 ratio. ""One of the best comments I ever received from a viewer who said that she had gotten over her anorexia by watching me eat,"" says Park. ""That really meant a lot to me."" She cooks about a third of the food that she eats, and the rest she has delivered. Offers of sponsorship have come in thick and  fast, but she says she tests out sponsored food first and only features what she truly likes and wants to share. Her fans show their appreciation by sending her money, in the form of virtual tokens that can be cashed in. Afreeca TV, the publicly-listed social networking site that hosts her channel, allows users to buy and send virtual ""star balloons"" which can be monetized after the site takes a 30-40% commission. Any payment by viewers is purely voluntary, as all channels can be viewed for free. The service is currently limited to South Korea, although the company has plans to expand it to other countries. Cultural background . The Diva's success and the Korean eating broadcasting trend can be attributed to a number of specific cultural factors. ""We think it's because of three big reasons — the rise of one-person households in Korea, their ensuing loneliness and finally the huge trend of 'well-being culture' and excessive dieting in Korean society right now,"" says Afreeca TV public relations coordinator Serim An. While watching food porn on a diet may sound like masochistic torture, apparently lonely, hungry Koreans prefer to eat vicariously. Another thing, Koreans hate eating alone. ""For Koreans, eating is an extremely social, communal activity, which is why even the Korean word 'family' means 'those who eat together,'"" says Professor Sung-hee Park of Ewha University's Division of Media Studies. She believes its the interactive aspect of eating broadcasts that's so appealing to these lonely hearts. Loneliness was also the catalyst for the Diva. ""So many of my friends were getting married and I was living alone and lonely and bored,"" she says. ""When I first started my channel two years ago, I was showing a variety of content, from dance to outdoor activities, but it was my love of eating that really began drawing a response from fans,"" says Park. The setting . And then there's the platform to make the phenomenon possible in the first place. It's difficult to imagine the unique live-streaming online platform of Afreeca TV working as well on a daily basis anywhere other than South Korea's extremely wired culture. With 78.5% of the entire population on smartphones and 7 million people riding the Seoul subway network every day, Afreeca TV is becoming particularly popular with Korean commuters, given that the Seoul subway has cellphone reception and Wi-Fi, and South Korean smartphones have TV streaming capabilities. ""Our mobile users surpassed our PC users a while ago, and most of our viewers watch our content while they are on the move,"" says An. The majority of Afreeca TV's content is actually online gaming, where individual broadcasters called 'BJs' (short for Broadcast Jockeys), stream their gaming live for others to learn from or comment on. Anyone can live-stream from any device as long as they log in. ""Eating broadcasts"" began popping up around 2009, says An, when users began to imitate celebrities' food shows by commenting as they were eating while broadcasting. Now, of the platform's 5,000 channels that are streaming at any given point in time, 5% of those are eating broadcasts. Afreeca TV has a daily average viewership of 3 million. Spinning off . The Diva says her success was a huge surprise, but there are still many who don't understand the concept and are liberal with their criticism. ""I get some really awful commenters who make me reexamine 'why am I doing this again?' but at the end of the day the positive feedback overwhelmingly outweighs the bad, so I am happy to continue."" While Park maintained her real estate consulting day job over the past two years, she quit last week to focus more on her eating broadcasts and potential spinoff businesses, including a clothing company. When asked if she has any time for a private life, considering she broadcasts more than six hours a day every day including weekends, the answer is that she doesn't need one. ""This is a lot more fun,"" she says.","The Diva is an online ""eating room"" where thousands watch a woman devour food .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two days before the deadline for a possible U.S. government default, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders reached agreement Sunday on a legislative package that would extend the federal debt ceiling while cutting spending and guaranteeing further deficit-reduction steps. The proposed deal, which still requires congressional approval, brought some immediate relief to global markets closely watching the situation play out and to a nation filled with anger and frustration over partisan political wrangling that threatened further economic harm to an already struggling recovery. However, there is no guarantee the plan will win enough support to pass both chambers of Congress. ""There are still some very important votes to be taken by members of Congress, but I want to announce that the leaders of both parties in both chambers have reached an agreement that will reduce the deficit and avoid default,"" Obama said in brief remarks to reporters. Asian markets surge on news | U.S. futures rally . Democratic and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate were briefing their caucuses about the agreement on Sunday night and Monday. A Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that the Senate planned to vote first on the measure on Monday afternoon, and if the measure passes an expected Republican filibuster attempt, the House could vote on it Monday night. According to information from the White House and a PowerPoint presentation for his colleagues by House Speaker John Boehner, the proposed deal includes $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years while authorizing an increase in the federal debt ceiling by a slightly smaller amount to allow the government to pay its debts through 2012. The agreement proposes a two-stage process. In the first stage, it includes $917 billion in spending cuts and other deficit reduction now, as well as a $900 billion increase in the debt ceiling. Because of the pending Tuesday deadline, Obama would have immediate authority to raise the debt ceiling by $400 billion, which will last through September, according to the White House document. For the other $500 billion of debt ceiling extension in the first stage, Congress can vote on resolutions of disapproval that, if passed, the president can then veto, the White House said. In the second stage, a special joint committee of Congress will recommend further deficit reduction steps totaling $1.5 trillion or more by the end of November, with Congress obligated to vote on the panel's proposals by the end of the year. If the recommendations are enacted, Obama would be authorized to increase the debt ceiling by up to $1.5 trillion -- as long as the additional deficit reduction steps exceed that amount. The president also can get the additional debt ceiling increase if both chambers of Congress pass a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution in votes to be held by the end of the year. However, Obama would be able to request only up to $1.2 trillion in additional debt ceiling if the special congressional committee fails to agree to at least $1.2 trillion in cuts. At that point, across-the-board spending cuts would be activated, equal to the difference between the committee's recommendations and the $1.2 trillion in additional debt ceiling. The across-the-board cuts would be split between defense spending and non-defense programs, an unpopular formula intended to inspire legislators to approve the special committee's recommendations instead of triggering such automatic cuts. In addition, the across-the-board cuts are automatically enacted if Congress fails to pass the special committee's recommendations. Debt fight shows tea party's influence - so far . ""You want to make it hard for them just to walk away and wash their hands,"" Gene Sperling, the director of Obama's National Economic Council, told CNN earlier Sunday. ""You want them to say, if nothing happens, there will be a very tough degree of pain that will take place."" The White House document said the debt ceiling increase of the second stage also would be subject to a congressional vote of disapproval that can be vetoed. It said the special congressional committee would comprise 12 members -- six from each chamber, equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. The panel's recommendations would be due by November 23 and guaranteed an up-or-down Senate vote without amendments by December 23, the White House document said. In an important concession to Democrats, benefits from entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and veterans benefits will be exempt. ""Is this the deal I would have preferred? No,"" Obama said. ""I believe that we could have made the tough choices required -- on entitlement reform and tax reform -- right now, rather than through a special congressional committee process. But this compromise does make a serious down payment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done before the end of the year."" Boehner also told his caucus the deal represents a compromise, but he also praised his colleagues for moving the focus of the talks in their direction. ""This isn't the greatest deal in the world,"" Boehner said, according to excerpts of remarks to his caucus. ""But it shows how much we've changed the terms of the debate in this town."" Minutes before Obama spoke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also announced the deal on the Senate floor and encouraged colleagues to support it. However, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, earlier told reporters that she needs to see ""the final product"" in writing before she can decide if she supports it. Pelosi said she would meet with the House Democratic caucus on Monday to discuss the matter. ""I don't know all the particulars of what the final product is in writing and what the ramifications will be,"" Pelosi said, noting the measure will have an impact for a decade or more. Asked about the outcome, she warned: ""We all may not be able to support it or none of us may be able to support it."" If Congress fails to raise the current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by Tuesday, Americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar, among other problems. Some financial experts have warned of a downgrade of America's triple-A credit rating and a potential stock market plunge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a sixth straight day on Friday. Meet the nations in the Triple-A club  Zakaria: Damage is already done . Without an increase in the debt limit, the federal government will not be able to pay all its bills in August. President Barack Obama recently indicated he can't guarantee Social Security checks will be mailed out on time. In Afghanistan on Sunday, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen was unable to assure U.S. troops they would get their paychecks following the Tuesday deadline without a deal. Mullen said August 15 would be the first payday jeopardized if the United States defaults. Last week, a Department of Defense official told CNN on condition of not being identified that ""it's not a question of whether, but when"" military pay gets withheld if no agreement is reached. Sources described a tense day of behind-the-scenes negotiating, with Vice President Joe Biden a prominent figure, one Democratic source told CNN on condition of not being identified. Initial news of a possible deal came shortly after the Senate delayed consideration of a debt ceiling proposal by Reid late Saturday night, pushing back a key procedural vote by 12 hours. When that vote occurred on Sunday afternoon, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to end debate on the Reid proposal and move to a vote, extending consideration of the plan while negotiations continued. Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York told CNN on Sunday morning that a main sticking point still under discussion was the trigger mechanism of automatic spending cuts in case Congress fails to enact the special committee's recommendations. The deal includes no tax increases, a key demand of Republicans. Obama has pushed for a comprehensive approach that would include additional tax revenue as well as spending cuts and entitlement reforms to reduce budget deficits, and he told reporters he would continue to do so in coming months as the special committee drafts its recommendations. A recent CNN/ORC International Poll reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise. Sixty-four percent of respondents to a July 18-20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Only 34% preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions. According to the poll, the public is sharply divided along partisan lines; Democrats and independents are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a major crisis for the country. Republicans, however, draw the line at tax increases, and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances. CNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Gloria Borger, Keating Holland, Brianna Keilar, Jeanne Sahadi, Xuan Thai, Jessica Yellin, Athena Jones, Lisa Desjardins, Dan Lothian and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama, Boehner both say the deal isn't perfect .

"When Rachel Frederickson, 24, stepped out onto the stage at NBC's ""The Biggest Loser"" finale Tuesday night, some wondered if she had gone too far. While the show is known for its dramatic weight loss transformations -- most winners lose more than 50% of their body weight -- Frederickson appeared extremely thin. And the looks on trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels' faces could be interpreted as shock -- or dismay. Frederickson went from 260 pounds to 105 pounds, losing 59.62% of her body weight. At 5 feet, 5 inches tall, that puts her body mass index at 17.5. Anything under 18.5 is considered by the National Institutes of Health to be underweight. NBC on Wednesday declined to comment on its $250,000 grand prize winner, a voice-over artist who lives in Los Angeles. Social media, however, was buzzing. ""Are you kidding?"" One woman wrote on the show's Facebook page. ""Rachel looks anorexic! She has gone from one extreme to the other!"" Other posts called Frederickson ""frail"" and said she seemed ""dizzy"" and ""disoriented"" on stage. ""She obviously worked incredibly hard to achieve her weight loss goals, but I am wondering if the pressure of winning a large cash prize caused her to take it too far,"" one said. Others posted on Frederickson's Facebook page, asking her to get help and expressing disappointment. ""I'm saddened that my 13-year-old daughter watched as you were rewarded for doing that to your body,"" one woman said. Frederickson as of Wednesday had not responded to the posts and had not commented on the controversy on Twitter. Michaels issued a statement late Wednesday on social media on behalf of herself and Harper, saying, ""Bob and I want to take a moment to congratulate all of the BL contestants on their hard work. We're not comfortable commenting on Rachel's journey because (we) weren't her trainers and weren't given an opportunity to work with her at any point. Any questions about the contestants on the Biggest Loser should be directed to the show's producers."" Asked by another Twitter user whether she was concerned about Frederickson's weight, Michaels posted, ""We won't comment because we had nothing to do with it and want no part in shaming someone with 'public statements.'"" HLNtv.com: Opinion: Dropping pounds nothing like 'Biggest Loser' BMI applies less on an individual level and is more utilized for population norms -- many people, such as marathon runners or endurance athletes have low BMIs and are perfectly healthy. And some people who eat well and exercise normally are just naturally thin. However, losing a significant amount of weight using unhealthy methods can be dangerous, said experts unfamiliar with Frederickson. It's the darker side of weight loss -- as obesity is unhealthy, so is being underweight. ""Can you be too thin? Yes. Can it be as dangerous as being too fat? Yes,"" said Dr. Steven Lamm, weight management expert and medical director of NYU's Preston Robert Tisch Center for Men's Health. Severe weight reduction can result in hormone disruption or bone thinning (reduction in bone density) and can affect women's fertility, as they stop menstruating, said Lamm and Dr. Robert Kushner, clinical director of the Northwestern Comprehensive Center on Obesity in Chicago. Kushner said most of his patients lose about 30% of their body weight over the course of a year. ""On the other end, I have patients with a BMI of 30 that are in perfectly good health,"" he said . Lamm notes the television show is about extremes, ""not what we as a profession are looking at."" But ""if I were to see this in a patient, I would be concerned about their emotional stability,"" he said. Frederickson is ""just below that lower end"" on the BMI scale, Kushner said. ""Not watching the show ... I really couldn't say whether she's unhealthy, or she shouldn't weigh that much. Because she very well could have a healthy lifestyle."" Still, ""there are some people who we see for weight management who develop disordered eating,"" he said. ""It's like a pendulum and they swing to the other end ... I don't see a lot of those patients, but I do see them."" Such patients are afraid to gain any weight because of their fear of again becoming obese, he said. The real message, said Lamm, ""is that people should appreciate that when they are overweight they don't have to lose 100 pounds to improve their overall health, that small changes in body weight can have a very sigificant impact on blood sugar, cholesterol. ""They shouldn't think that if they can't lose 100 pounds they shouldn't try.""

"U.S. Rep. Trey Radel  said Wednesday night he will take a leave of absence for an unspecified time and donate his salary. ""I have no excuse for what I have done. I have let down our country,"" he said at a news conference. Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to southwest Florida, hours after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession. The 37-year-old first-term Republican from Florida said he will enter an inpatient drug treatment program. The cocaine possession charge came after authorities said he bought a small amount of cocaine in a sting in the nation's capital last month. During the brief news conference, Radel said he ""grew up with a mom who struggled with alcoholism."" ""I don't want my son to struggle with that,"" he said. The plea and sentence were part of a deal that Radel's attorney struck with federal prosecutors. He could have received a maximum sentence of 180 days imprisonment or a $1,000 fine, or both. Instead, he was placed on one year probation, and if it is ""successfully completed,"" his guilty plea will be cleared from his record. ""Your honor, I apologize for what I've done,"" Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday. ""I think in life I've hit a bottom where I realize I need help."" Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones. He was charged after he bought 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover police officer in Washington's Dupont Circle area on October 29, court documents say. Who is Trey Radel? It was a sting that stemmed from a broader FBI/Drug Enforcement Administration investigation of a drug trafficking organization in the nation's capital, law enforcement officials told CNN on condition of anonymity. The targets of the investigation are dealers and high-level people in the organization, not buyers and users. But a dealer who was arrested last month told federal agents that one of his customers was a congressman, one of the law enforcement officials said. So, deciding they couldn't turn away from that, agents set up the sting, the law enforcement officials said. Court documents say Radel gave the undercover officer $260 for the cocaine outside a restaurant, and the two got into the officer's vehicle, where the officer gave Radel the cocaine. Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents. Radel then agreed to talk to the agents in his apartment, where he admitted he bought cocaine, according to the documents. ""The defendant also retrieved and provided to the agents a vial of cocaine that he had in his apartment,"" the court documents say. A tea party favorite, Radel was elected last year to represent southwest Florida's 19th Congressional District. He is a former journalist and TV news anchor, having worked for WINK in Fort Myers, Florida. He also owned and eventually sold the Naples Journal newspaper, according to a biography on his congressional website. Radel is married with a young son. He is active on Twitter, where he posts about touring the Capitol, listening to hip-hop, playing guitar and opposing Obamacare. In a statement released by his office this week, Radel said he is ""profoundly sorry to let down my family, particularly my wife and son, and the people of Southwest Florida."" ""I struggle with the disease of alcoholism, and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice,"" he said. ""As the father of a young son and a husband to a loving wife, I need to get help so I can be a better man for both of them. ""However, this unfortunate event does have a positive side. It offers me an opportunity to seek treatment and counseling. I know I have a problem and will do whatever is necessary to overcome it, hopefully setting an example for others struggling with this disease."" A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said in a prepared statement this week that members of Congress ""should be held to the highest standards, and the alleged crime will be handled by the courts."" ""Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents,"" Boehner's spokesman said.","""I have no excuse for what I have done,"" Radel says .

"A federal appeals court has blocked enforcement of parts of a controversial immigration enforcement law in Alabama. The injunction issued Friday from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta came after the U.S. Justice Department -- supported by a coalition of immigrant rights groups -- requested the legislation, known as HB 56, be put on hold until the larger constitutional questions can be addressed, a process that could take some months at least. The 16-page order gives both sides partial victories, allowing some parts of the law to go into effect while others are temporarily blocked. The Obama administration says the Constitution does not permit states to deter illegal immigration, saying an issue with foreign policy implications is the exclusive mandate of the federal government. Alabama's law, passed by the legislature this summer, would allow state and local officials to check the immigration status of public school students and to detain suspected undocumented immigrants without bond. It would make it a crime for immigrants who lack proper documents to conduct business with the state for things such as driver's licenses. Among the provisions temporarily blocked from being enforced are: . -- One requiring state officials to check the immigration status of students in public schools; . -- One making ""willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration card"" a misdemeanor for immigrants; . But the state will be allowed to enforce these contested sections: . -- One requiring that police during ""lawful"" stops or arrests ""attempt to determine the immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized alien of this country."" That provision is similar to other laws aiming to crack down on illegal immigration passed by other state legislatures over the past year. -- One barring state courts from enforcing contracts involving undocumented immigrants, if the hiring party had a ""direct or constructive"" knowledge that the person was in the country unlawfully. -- One making it a felony for illegal immigrants to enter into a ""business transaction"" in Alabama, including applying for a driver's license or a business license. In schools, towns and farms, battle heats up over immigration law . The appeals court also announced it would hear oral arguments on the constitutional questions on an expedited basis, as early as December. The issues in Alabama and in other states with similar crackdown laws may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge last month had temporarily blocked enforcement of some parts of the Alabama law while allowing other provisions to go into effect. The U.S. Justice Department issued a statement welcoming the appeals court ruling, and adding that ""We continue to believe that the other key provisions we challenged are also preempted and we look forward to the upcoming consideration by the court of appeals of the merits of the appeal."" Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange issued a statement saying the state disagrees with the ruling, but officials ""are pleased that the court has allowed the state to proceed enforcing some of the act's central provisions.  We will continue to vigorously defend the law as we proceed through the appeals process."" Ahead of the injunction, Justice Department officials met with civic and religious leaders in Alabama Friday morning. Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez told reporters that local leaders are concerned about reports of increased bullying in schools and a large absence of Hispanic students from classes. The section of the law that raised those worries is now blocked. Perez also said he is ""absolutely"" sure that victims of crime are not going to police out of fear of being deported. Given Friday's news, that could remain a concern. Three or four Justice Department lawyers remain in Alabama investigating the impact of the law, Perez said. State officials confirm an unspecified number of Hispanics and other immigrants have left the state, many in fear of being arrested or targeted by police. Workers in the agriculture, landscaping, food service, maintenance, and construction fields in particular have not been showing up on the job. Many immigrant rights groups have launched workplace boycotts in recent days. In addition to the Justice Department, other opponents of the measure -- including state church leaders and the American Civil Liberties Union -- had filed their own separate lawsuits against the state. ""H.B. 56 creates a panoply of new state offenses that criminalize, among other things, an alien's failure to comply with federal registration requirements that were enacted pursuant to Congress's exclusive power to regulate immigration,"" said the brief from the federal government. But the state argued it was only helping Washington enforce existing laws. ""Does it really cause harm to the United States when a state informs the federal government of persons who are in violation of federal law, and then leaves it to the federal government to decide whether to initiate deportation proceedings?"" wrote Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange. ""Of course not."" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed the law in June, has said it would not have been needed ""if the federal government would have done its job and enforced the laws dealing with this problem. However, they have failed to do that."" He added, ""This law was never designed to hurt fellow human beings."" Republican Alabama state Rep. John Merrill told CNN in June that the legislation would be ""good for Alabama"" because it would reduce illegal immigration to the state and ""provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to Alabama legally."" In August, leaders from the Episcopal, Methodist and Catholic churches of Alabama separately sued Alabama's governor, its attorney general and a district attorney over the law. Bishops from two of those churches have opposed the provision preventing the harboring or transporting of undocumented aliens, saying it violated their ""religious liberties."" ""We will continue to provide food, shelter, transportation, housing, and the church's sacraments to all of God's people, regardless of race, class, or citizenship status,"" said a  joint statement by Bishop Henry N. Parsley Jr. of the Episcopal Church's Alabama Diocese and Bishop William H. Willimon of the United Methodist's North Alabama Conference. The Mexican government had also appealed, arguing the law would promote racial profiling, targeting Hispanics especially. Alabama in its legal briefs noted a 145% rise in its Hispanic population, numbering around 186,000, or 4% of the population. Lawmakers promoting the legislation said it was motivated mainly to protect jobs of its citizens and legal residents. Alabama's law is considered the strictest in the nation. Key portions of Arizona's immigration reform law have also been blocked while a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court consider various challenges. Similar challenges are taking place in Indiana and South Carolina. The case is U.S. v. Alabama (11-14532).","The 11th Circuit acts on a Justice Department request to put the law on hold .
The Obama administration says immigration control is for the federal  government alone .

"Right on schedule, singer Lauryn Hill reported to federal prison on Monday to begin a three-month sentence for failing to pay federal income taxes. The musician and mother of six pleaded guilty last year to three counts of failing to file tax returns on more than $1.8 million from 2005 to 2007. The Grammy winning artist was sentenced to three months in federal prison, which she'll serve at a low security female facility in Danbury, Connecticut. Hill has sold millions of albums -- 16, to be exact -- but when she appeared before a judge in May, she said that she lives modestly considering the amount of money her music has earned for others. ""Someone did the math, and it came to around $600 million,"" she said at the time. ""And I sit here before you trying to figure out how to pay a tax debt? If that's not like enough to slavery, I don't know."" The U.S. attorney's office said that the income in question was earned mainly from music and film royalties that were paid to companies she owned from 2005 to 2008. According to the prosecutor, the sentence handed down ""also takes into account additional income and tax losses for 2008 and 2009 -- when she also failed to file federal returns -- along with her outstanding tax liability to the state of New Jersey, for a total income of approximately $2.3 million and total tax loss of approximately $1,006,517."" After her three-month prison stint, Hill was also sentenced to three months of home confinement and a year of supervised probation.

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Tony Alamo was arrested Thursday in Flagstaff, Arizona, on charges related to a child porn investigation, an FBI spokesman said. The 74-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries was arrested without incident at 2:45 p.m. (4:45 p.m. ET) as he was departing the Little America Hotel with his wife, said Manuel Johnson, spokesman for the FBI in Phoenix, Arizona. The FBI, the Flagstaff Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety were involved in the arrest, he said. Alamo was charged under a federal statute with having knowingly transported a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity, Johnson said. Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, was taken to Coconino County Jail in Flagstaff, where he is to have an initial appearance Friday in federal magistrate court, Johnson said. Over the weekend, about 100 federal and state agents authorities raided Alamo's 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas, and took six children into temporary custody. The children were interviewed as part of a two-year investigation into Tony Alamo Christian Ministries to determine whether they were physically or sexually abused, said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police. Alamo, reached by phone Saturday in Los Angeles, California, denied any wrongdoing. ""It's a hoax,"" Alamo said. ""They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will."" Asked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ. ""Why were they after Jesus?"" he asked. ""It's the same reason. Jesus is living within me.""","FBI: Founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries arrested Thursday .

"In a decision many might consider a blow to freedom of dissent in Egypt, one of the nation's most popular comedians, Bassem Youssef, announced on Monday his political satirical show will no longer air on Egyptian TV. Youssef didn't offer a detailed explanation for his decision but suggested outside pressure and a fear for his safety were factors. ""I'm tired of struggling and worrying about my safety and that of my family,"" Youssuf said at a news conference inside a Cairo theater where he performed his weekly show. Youssef shot to fame during Egypt's 2011 revolution when he mocked former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak on his homemade political satire show -- shot in his laundry room and posted on YouTube. His show ""El Barnameg"" -- ""The Program"" in Arabic -- drew more than 5 million viewers in three months. One year later later, Youssef had his own show on Egyptian TV where he derided Mubarak's replacement, Islamist President Mohamed Morsy. By then, Youssef had gained worldwide recognition and was regularly compared to American political comedian Jon Stewart. In April 2013, Time magazine named Youssef one of its 100 Most Influential Men in the World. Several months later, Egyptian broadcaster CBC pulled the plug on Youssef when he poked fun at the almost cult-like adoration of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- the former Army chief who is now Egypt's President- elect. Youssef made a comeback in February when Saudi-owned Egyptian broadcaster MBC began airing his show. Once again, he drew huge ratings and laughs with carefully crafted back-handed jokes aimed at the army chief. Youssef's return was cut short before Egypt's presidential election campaign last month when MBC announced the show would be on hiatus so that ""Egyptian voters' orientation and public opinion won't be influenced."" But the show never returned to air as scheduled on May 30. The end of Youssef's show will likely fuel concern among international rights groups and pro-democracy activists who have increasingly accused Egyptian authorities of stifling dissent and freedom of speech. ""In a nutshell, we've gone as far as we can,"" Youssef said. ""We are tired of moving from one network to another network and being under emotional pressure.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Sharpshooters from Russia and Georgia embraced Sunday after earning medals for their countries, which have been teetering on the brink of war since the Beijing Summer Olympics kicked off last week. Russia's Natalia Paderina and Georgia's Nino Salukvadze hugged after winning Olympic silver and bronze medals, respectively, in the women's 10-meter air pistol competition. The rivals kissed each other on the cheek after standing on the medal podium with China's Guo Wenjun, who won the gold medal in the event. Waving flower bouquets high, the women smiled broadly at the audience. ""If the world were to draw any lessons from what I did, there would never be any wars,"" Salukvadze, 39, said afterward, according to media reports. The reports described the two as friends. Georgia said it launched an operation in South Ossetia on Thursday after artillery fire from separatists killed 10 people. Russia, whose forces entered the republic Friday, accuses Georgia of plotting to wipe out Ossetians loyal to Russia. Georgia says Russia merely wants control of an oil pipeline. Before Sunday, Paderina and Salukvadze had competed against each other several times, including at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics; the 2005 European Championships in Tallinn, Estonia; the 2006 World Championships in Zagreb, Croatia; and the 2008 European Championships in Winterthur, Switzerland. Salukvadze's bronze medal marked the first for her country in these Games. She won a silver medal in the same event two decades ago at the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where she also took home a gold for the 25-meter pistol competition. Salukvadze was a member of the then-Soviet Union's 1988 Olympic shooting team. Sunday's silver medal was first in an Olympics for Paderina, 32. Despite reports that the Georgia Olympic delegation might return home, team spokesman Giorgi Tchanishvili said Sunday the athletes would stay and compete, according to The Associated Press. Tchanishvili said that the competitors were ready to leave China if it would help the situation back home, but that Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili sent a message saying the athletes should remain at the Games, AP reported.

"President Barack Obama has weighed in. The pro football commissioner, has too.  And now, a Native American tribe hopes recent attention to controversy surrounding the name of Washington's National Football League team will provide the momentum needed to get it changed. As NFL executives arrived in the nation's capital for their annual fall meeting on Monday, the Oneida Indian Nation held a symposium in town to discuss their campaign to find a new name for the Washington Redskins after 80 years. ""We are asking the NFL to stop using a racial slur as the name of Washington's football team,"" said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter. The ""Change the Mascot"" campaign launched last month with a string of radio ads airing in Washington and cities where the Redskins play this season. The NFL executives were invited to the symposium, but Halbritter said none attended. In an interview with the Associated Press last week, Obama said if he were the owner of the Redskins and he knew the name was ""offending a sizable group of people,"" then he would ""think about changing it."" Halbritter began his remarks by thanking the president for weighing in. ""As the first sitting president to speak out against the Washington team name, President Obama's comments over the weekend were nothing less than historic,"" Halbritter said. ""Isn't that the real issue? No matter what the history of something is, if it's offending people, then it's time to change it. And this is a great time to do it."" Obama on the Redskins . A Washington Post poll from June indicated that two-thirds of people who live in the D.C. metropolitan area didn't want the Redskins to change their name, but more than eight in 10 said it wouldn't make much of a difference to them if the name were changed. Last month, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who had previously expressed support for the team mascot, changed his tone on the ""The LaVar Arrington Show with Chad Dukes"" on 106.7 The Fan in Washington. ""I want all of us to go out and make sure we're listening to our fans, listening to people of a different view, and making sure that we continue to do what's right to make sure that team represents the strong tradition and history that it has for so many years,"" Goodell said. The NFL confirmed on Monday that it would meet with Oneida leaders. But Redskins owner Dan Snyder has steadfastly refused to consider it, telling USA Today last spring that he will ""NEVER"" change his team's name, even if they lose an ongoing federal trademark lawsuit that would stop the NFL team from exclusively profiting from the Redskins name. In addition to the federal trademark lawsuit, a group of U.S. lawmakers drafted a bill last spring to cancel trademark registrations that use the name ""Redskins."" Two of them, Democrats Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, and Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota attended Monday's forum to voice their support. D.C. council member pushes name change for Washington Redskins . McCollum, who is co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus, said the use of the Redskins name is ""exploitation perpetrated for profit by the NFL and Dan Snyder's football business."" ""Mr. Snyder, change the mascot. End this ugly history and tradition of your team's racial slur. Pick a new mascot. Pick one that offends no one, hurts no one, dehumanizes no one. It is time to put dignity and respect for native American people ahead of your profits,"" McCollum said. Snyder did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. But Redskins attorney Lanny Davis said Halbritter is being ""selective in his outrage,"" citing other teams named after Native Americans who are not targeted in the ""Change the Mascot"" campaign. ""Why is he not protesting the Atlanta Braves Tomahawk Chop, or President Obama's hometown Chicago Blackhawks?"" Davis said. While Halbritter said that there are certain Native American names that ""can be unifying and respectful,"" he maintains that the Redskins name is ""a dictionary defined racial epithet,"" that shouldn't be used to ""sell a national sports team to America or to the rest of the world."" Washington Redskins' owner: 'We will never change the name of the team' ""Washington's continued use of the current team name is not just a slur against one group of people, it has demonstrable and serious public policy cultural educational, public health ramifications for our entire country,"" Halbritter said. Critics argue that the Redskins' name is based on a historically offensive slur and presents negative identity issues for Native Americans, a community already distressed by a slew of public health and social crises including high rates of poverty, diabetes, and suicide. Dr. Michael Friedman, a clinical psychologist who attended the forum, called Snyder's refusal to consider calls for a name change ""textbook bullying."" ""Experimental study after experimental study shows that if you bring a Native American person into an experimental situation and you show them an image of a Native American mascot, their self-esteem goes down, their faith in their community goes down, their feeling that they can achieve goes down,"" Friedman said. But Davis said Friedman is ignoring other data that shows Native Americans are not insulted by the name. ""I ask him, since there's no intent to disparage or disrespect - and I certainly respect those, and am sorry for those, who are offended - why is he selecting the Washington Redskins? Does he see the Tomahawk Chop of the Atlanta Braves fans? They're doing that not out of disrespect. They love the Atlanta Braves."" Other at the forum, like Norton, said the intent behind keeping the name doesn't matter. ""I want to say this to Redskins fans. No one blames you for having used a name that was always used as this team. They will only blame you if you continue to use it and if you use it will impunity,"" she said. The NFL Redskins were in Boston before the Washington franchise was born in 1933. Braves reject 'screaming Indian' logo .","Washington Redskins have had their name for 80 years .

But the soldiers are too late to prevent the grisly scene that awaits them. One of their own is on the ground, seriously wounded. One of the attackers is dead, and three others have been shot. ""They didn't even say a word. They just pulled out their weapons and started shooting at our soldiers,"" army commander Carlos Rolando Discua said of the scene, which has become all too familiar in Honduras' second-largest city. Discua oversees a unit of soldiers, often masked to protect their identities, who patrol the streets of San Pedro Sula, the so-called murder capital of the world. Photos: Deadly violence grips Honduras . For the second straight year, San Pedro Sula, in northwest Honduras, has topped a list of the world's 50 most violent cities, with a rate of 169 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants -- an average of more than three people every day. The report, compiled by the Mexican think tank Citizen Council for Public Security, Justice and Peace, compared intentional homicide statistics around the world in 2012. The report does not include cities in the Middle East. The sunny beach resort of Acapulco in Mexico ranked second on the group's list, followed by the Venezuelan capital of Caracas. New Orleans is the murder capital of the United States, according to the report, which ranked the city 17th on the list. Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore and Oakland were the other U.S. cities to make the list. Central America's bloody drug problem . San Pedro Sula's challenge, experts say, is that Mexico's offensive against drug cartels and the active U.S. deportation of criminal immigrants are pushing the problem south. Some of this criminal element has ended up in Honduras, where, like most Central American countries, law enforcement has few resources to fight it. But city residents say that ""murder capital of the world"" is an undeserved label that is hurting local businesses. There are only three morgues in Honduras, and one of them is in San Pedro Sula. Residents say that people who are murdered elsewhere and then taken to the city's morgue are being grouped into the city's crime statistics. ""All of the crimes that happen in northern Honduras are registered as happening here,"" businessman Luis Larach said. ""So what we businessmen are doing is an accurate count to determine where crime or violent deaths originate so that the information is truthful."" The National Autonomous University of Honduras said that only people murdered in San Pedro Sula were tallied in the group's report -- and that in fact the actual murder rate in the city is even higher. The authors of the report defended their research on the group's website, writing: It ""is not the ranking that damages the image of the city but the violence and the government's inability to contain and reduce it. To hide the problems never solves them."" Honduras is far from the only country in the region with a murder problem. The top 10 -- and 39 of 50 overall -- most violent cities on the list are Latin American. Authorities have launched Operation Lightning in San Pedro Sula, saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers, and some residents believe the beefed-up security is working. ""There's more security now,"" said local resident Nicolle Valladares. ""And that gives us peace."" Unfortunately, at least so far, the measures seem to have had little impact on the murder rate.","San Pedro Sula, Honduras, named murder capital of world for second straight year .

"(CNN) -- If you want a world-class education without the hefty price tag it usually carries, it's time you pack your bags and head to Germany. The country's federal state of Lower Saxony became the last region to scrap tuition fees in mid-October, which means that studying in Germany is now completely free even for international students. So wherever you come from, doors of elite institutions like the University of Heidelberg and Technical University of Munich, both among the world's top 100 universities, are flung wide open if you're a gifted student. ""We don't want higher education which depends on the wealth of the parents,"" Gabriele Heinen-Kljajic, minister for science and culture of Lower Saxony told German Pulse. Her Hamburg counterpart Dorothee Stapelfeldt, whose region abolished fees in 2012, called tuition fees socially unjust: ""They particularly discourage young people who do not have a traditional academic family background from taking up studies. It is a core task of politics to ensure that young women and men can study with a high quality standard free of charge in Germany,"" she told Britain's The Times newspaper. Low cost/high rank . Germany has had a long tradition of free education, introducing fees only in 2006 when the constitutional court ruled that moderate tuition fees were not at odds with the country's pledge for education for all. However, even at around $1,300 per year, significantly lower than $14,500 and $30,000 paid by UK and U.S. students respectively, the fees caused widespread backlash, with federal states dropping them one by one. The funding gap was mainly bridged by the government, with the average worker in Germany facing a tax burden on labor income of 49.3% in 2013, the second highest rate out of 34 OECD member countries. The country is already a major destination for international students, ranking third in the world after the U.S. and Great Britain, according to data from the OECD. Overseas students flock to the Germany's illustrious universities, attracted by the relatively low cost of living and a vibrant cultural scene and nightlife. Independent thinking . But before you pack up and go, be aware that studying in Germany can be a very different to campus-based life common in the U.S. and Britain. Lectures often pack up to 200 people, and there is a greater onus on the student to keep track of all the reading and deadlines. ""I feel like English universities are a bit more like schools, they really look after you, print out your timetable for you, and if you miss a seminar they ring you up and ask is everything ok. In Germany, you have to be more independent,"" says former CNN intern Phoebe Parke who spent a year studying at Berlin's Humboldt University during the 2011/2012 academic year. ""My campus was spread all over Berlin, so I would take the underground between classes. That was very difficult if you didn't know the city because there wasn't really anyone to help you, and the buildings were sometimes out of the way,"" adds Parke, who completed her studies at Britain's Warwick University. Navigating your way . Social life for international students can also be harder to form, as many German students study in their home town and often live with their parents, or share an apartment with friends. But if you negotiate those challenges successfully, Parke says that the German system offers freedom to expand your interests: ""There is a lot less pressure on students because they are not paying for it, so it's more about the pursuit of learning than just passing an exam and forgetting everything. But you are the one propelling your education forward, not the lecturer."" Read more: Germany: 25 years later and no looking back . Read more: A look inside Europe's economic powerhouse .

"Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is on a flight from Europe and is scheduled to arrive in San Antonio, Texas, within hours. Bergdahl had been in a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, since he was released in Afghanistan after five years of Taliban captivity. He is expected to be taken to a military hospital in the Texas city for continued rehabilitation. ""I can confirm that he is now en route to the United States aboard a U.S. military aircraft, having departed Ramstein Air Base earlier this afternoon,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement Thursday. ""He will arrive in San Antonio early tomorrow morning, where he will continue the reintegration process at Brooke Army Medical Center."" ""Our first priority is making sure that Sgt. Bergdahl continues to get the care and support he needs."" Previously, three U.S. officials had told CNN that the soldier would arrive in Texas at midnight local time (1 a.m. ET). Bergdahl was exchanged on May 31 for five Taliban figures detained at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The swap sparked a controversy that touches on a range of volatile issues --  ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the partisan divide in Washington. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has defended the deal, saying it was Bergdahl's last and best chance to get out. Critics have said the cost of the swap was too high, and that Congress should have been notified in advance. Slow recovery . Bergdahl is ""continuing to improve every day,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said this week. The solider had not spoken with his family. The ""decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call,"" Warren said. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. Citing an American official, The New York Times has reported that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. CNN has reported that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse. In his own words . The exact conditions of his captivity are not known, and Bergdahl has not spoken publicly since his release. But on Thursday, The Daily Beast published two letters the solider reportedly wrote to his family while imprisoned by the Taliban. The website obtained the letters by ""sources in contact with the Taliban."" It confirmed their authenticity with U.S. and Western officials. In the letters -- dated 2012 and 2013 -- Bergdahl discusses his life and partially explains why he disappeared in 2009. ""To my friends & family, in regards to the circomestance (sic) here, I am as well as can be here,"" he wrote. ""I am given food and drink."" Bergdahl had harsh words for Army leadership. ""Leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly (sic) the ones risking thier (sic) lives from attack,"" he wrote. ""If this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),"" Bergdahl said. ""Please tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in."" Hagel on Bergdahl deal . Hagel appeared Wednesday at a House Armed Services Committee hearing to defend the swap, where Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, appeared to strike a nerve when he pressed the defense chief on why it was taking the U.S. military so long to interview Bergdahl. Hagel already had fielded lawmakers' accusations that the White House overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain Bergdahl's freedom. Hagel started to explain that doctors treating Bergdahl will decide when he is ready to talk, but Miller cut him off. ""Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why hasn't he been returned to the United States?"" Miller asked, noting that wounded soldiers from battle zones get flown back for treatment within days. ""You're trying to tell me that he's being held at Landstuhl, Germany, because of his medical condition?"" Hagel responded, ""Congressman, I hope you're not implying anything other than that,"" as the two continued to talk over each other. ""I don't like the implication of the question,"" Hagel said at one point, and when Miller persisted about injured combat troops coming back to the United States quickly, Hagel raised his voice. ""This isn't just about a physical situation,"" he said. ""This guy was held for almost five years in God knows what kind of conditions. ... This is not just about can he get on his feet and walk and get to a plane.""","Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is en route and expected to arrive in Texas .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Western nations and organizations Tuesday condemned Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for recognizing the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway regions in Georgia. A Tskhinvali resident celebrates Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's independence. ""This is not an easy choice to make, but it represents the only possibility to save human lives,"" Medvedev said Tuesday in a televised address. He called on other countries to follow Russia's lead, which comes in the wake of the Russian-Georgian conflict which erupted earlier this month. U.S. President George W. Bush led the condemnation with a strongly worded statement said: ""The United States condemns the decision by the Russian president to recognize as independent states the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."". Bush said Russia's move was ""inconsistent"" with the French-brokered cease-fire agreement that ended the fighting and called on Russia to ""reconsider this irresponsible decision."" Bush added: ""The territorial integrity and borders of Georgia must be respected, just as those of Russia or any other country. Russia's action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations."" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the decision was ""unjustifiable and unacceptable."" ""It will also not work. It is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement, which Russia recently agreed... [it] further inflames an already tense situation in the region,"" Miliband said. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the decision was in ""direct violation of numerous U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Georgia's territorial integrity."" The European Union also urged a political solutions to the tensions in Georgia. Speaking to CNN's Matthew Chance, Medvedev said the move was in line with international law. ""It is internationally recognized that if a people based on all these [U.N.] provisions express their will to have an independent existence... any other state in the world has the right to recognize this independence whether you like it or not,"" the Russian president said.  Watch Medvedev defend recognizing the breakaway regions » . The stand-off has exacerbated already frayed relations between Russia and the West. Moscow has been infuriated by U.S. plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe. It said an agreement signed last week to base missiles in Poland would open that country up to an attack in the event of conflict. Medvedev said: ""The most important thing for us is that our American colleagues be pragmatic, that they defend the genuine interests of the American people, as opposed to defending made-up ideological schemes. ""If everything will be fine in that regard, I am convinced that we'll be able to agree on a very broad range of issues. We don't want any complications, we don't need another Cold War or its modern-day remake."" He signed the order a day after it was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Russia's parliament. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said it was ""clear around the world that Russia is acting as an aggressor state.""  Watch Saakashvili's reaction » . ""My appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject Russia's dangerous and irrational decision -- not only for Georgia's sake -- but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order. ""In the days and weeks ahead we will work with the international community to prevent this decision from having any effect on the sovereignty of my country and from further undermining the international order."" Western nations have expressed support for Georgia, which aspires to NATO and European Union membership, with the U.S. dispatching a major humanitarian aid mission. South Ossetia and Abkhazia broke away from Georgia during civil wars in the 1990s. Russia strengthened ties with them after the U.S. and much of Europe recognized the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo earlier this year, a move that Moscow had warned against. Georgian troops attacked pro-Russian separatists in South Ossetia on August 7, triggering a Russian invasion of Georgia. Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and Abkhazia the following day, advancing into Georgian cities. Each side offered conflicting figures on how many people died in the fighting. The Bush administration has insisted that both Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain part of Georgia, a U.S. ally that is seeking NATO membership, and says resolving the disputes between the Georgian government and the regions ""should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussions among the parties.""","Russian president signs order recognizing independence of Georgian territories .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed legislation Friday that will overhaul the U.S. patent system for the first time since 1952. ""We have to do everything we can to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit wherever we find it,"" Obama said at a signing ceremony at a high school in Arlington, Virginia.  This measure ""cuts away the red tape that slows down our inventors and entrepreneurs."" Obama used the occasion to promote his $447 billion jobs plan, calling patent reform a ""part of our (larger) agenda for making us competitive over the long term."" Among other things, the measure, dubbed the America Invents Act, will transition the country to a ""first-to-file"" system, instead of the current ""first-to-invent"" approach.  Issuing patents to the first person or company to file will help provide clarity in the patent-granting process, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says.  It will also prevent inventors from coming out of the woodwork to challenge pending patents. The first-to-file system is the predominant method used by the vast majority of industrialized countries throughout the world. The measure also will help provide adequate funding to the overwhelmed patent office by allowing it to set and keep its own fees.  Currently, all patent-filing fees are sent to Congress, and the patent office is allocated a set amount that is unrelated to how many patent applications are filed in a given year. Congress will continue to allocate funds to the patent office, but any fees that the office collects in excess of its allocation would be placed in escrow.  The patent office will then need to appeal to Congress to release that money, allowing Congress to maintain a certain level of oversight. The patent office currently examines roughly 500,000 applications every year. Underfunding has led to a 700,000-patent backlog and a three-year waiting period for the average patent to receive final approval. Finally, the bill will create a post-grant review process intended to clear up legal battles before they start. The measure allows inventors or companies to contest the validity of a patent for nine months after it is issued.  The patent office will then go back and review the case. The idea is to keep more expensive, lengthy patent fights out of the courts. CNN's David Goldman and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Obama signs a bill overhauling the U.S. patent system for the first time since 1952 .

"Remember those three Canadian prisoners who flew to freedom a few weeks ago after a daring helicopter escape? Well, they apparently didn't fly far enough. Quebec police arrested the trio early Sunday, and they're right back where they started, at the Orsainville Detention Centre in Quebec City. ""The prisoners were arrested at 1:30 in the morning in Montreal. The SWAT team made the arrest and those three people will appear in court ... Monday in Quebec City,"" Quebec police spokesman Sgt. Ronald Mc Innis told CNN. He declined to say any more about the arrest as the investigation is continuing. The helicopter's pilot hasn't yet been caught, according to police, but more arrests are expected, Mc Innis said. Yves Denis, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49, escaped June 7. Denis and Lefebvre were awaiting trial on charges stemming from a 2010 drug bust that netted weapons, cars and a plane. Officials didn't release any information about Pomerleau. The charges against them included murder, according to CNN partner CBC. They were being held under tight security, but a judge had issued a ruling allowing the three of them to be in the courtyard at the same time on court days, after they complained harsh security conditions were making it difficult to plan their defense, the CBC reported last week. The three, however, escaped on a Saturday. It was unclear who allowed them to go outside, the CBC reported. Helicopter escapes aren't common, but they're not unheard of, either. In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away. A Greek prison inmate escaped by helicopter in 2006 and did it again in 2009. Another inmate tried the same trick last year, but was shot. In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter. That escape inspired a book and a movie. Oklahoma jail shower escapees captured .

"Even among terrorism watchers, the Algerian group Jund al Khilafa has not been a daily preoccupation. But on Sunday this obscure cell found a 55-year old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, wandering in the rugged and beautiful Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. The innocent mountaineering enthusiast provided the group with an opportunity to catapult itself onto the world stage and burnish its credentials as one of the (relatively few) jihadist groups to declare allegiance to Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Its leader, Gouri Abdelmalek, had declared Jund al Khilafa's loyalty to ISIS earlier this month; the name means ""Soldiers of the Caliphate."" (There are other groups with the same name in Kazakhstan and Egypt.) In carrying out its threat to behead Gourdel, the group said it was responding to an appeal by ISIS spokesman Muhammad al-Adnani to kill ""the spiteful and filthy French"" because of their support for military action against the group. A video message showing the execution was designed to resemble those carried out by ISIS, as were the words of one of the militants, who said: ""Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their president, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham (Syria)."" So does that mean that ISIS' message spreading like wildfire across the Maghreb? And what does Gourdel's tragic murder tell us about a more general threat to Westerners? Jund al Khilafa is no ISIS. It is a small splinter group of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), an al Qaeda affiliate prone to disunity. Abdelmalek, sentenced to death by Algeria in 2012, was the commander of AQIM's central region. By then, he'd been an active in the militant Islamist insurgency in Algeria for 12 years. He said his fighters were abandoning AQIM because of ""the certain deviation of the methods of the mother organization al-Qaeda, and that of the Islamic Maghreb."" Jund al Khilafa holds no territory and cannot threaten Algeria's main cities -- though occasional suicide attacks cannot be ruled out -- let alone launch attacks beyond Algeria. French intelligence analysts say there are plenty of such groups roaming the densely-forested mountains, beyond the authority of the state, some mixing jihad with banditry and smuggling. Their main threat is to Algerian troops: Jund al Khilafa killed 10 soldiers in an ambush in April close to where Gourdel was seized. It is not the first -- and likely will not be the last -- jihadist outfit to quit al Qaeda for the millennarian message of al Baghdadi.  This week, a group of the same name in Egypt declared its allegiance to the ISIS leader as the Caliph and threatened attacks on US diplomatic missions. A group of jihadists in Yemen made the same pledge last week; so did a group in Pakistan. So far none of the big fish among al Qaeda's affiliates have gone over to ISIS. But in a joint statement, AQIM and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have expressed solidarity with the people of Syria and Iraq in the face of U.S. military action -- while studiously avoiding any expression of support for ISIS. That's not to say that smaller groups like Jund al Khilafa are irrelevant. ISIS can use their declarations as propaganda, 'evidence' that its path is the true one and the tide is flowing in its favor. Some analysts see a ""bidding war"" developing among these groups and cells, as they seek attention and support. Geoff Porter, who runs the North Africa Risk Consulting, says the murder of Gourdel poses a challenge to AQIM. ""Will it ratchet up its activities to reclaim primacy among the Maghreb's jihadi groups? Will it condemn the kidnapping as futile and reckless? Will it try to pull Jund al-Khilafa back into its fold?"" he asks. And even if Jund al Khilafa's reach is limited, other militants might be tempted to follow its example -- hence the announcement by the French government of preventive security measures Thursday in the wake of Gourdel's killing. There is one other takeaway from the murder of Gourdel. It is another sign that an ever-growing 'arc' of territory is now too perilous for even the most adventurous of travelers: from the Atlantic coast of Africa through the Maghreb, much of the Middle East, Somalia, Yemen and on to Pakistan. The famous Paris-to-Dakar motorized rally was abandoned in 2008 because of security threats and moved to South America; backpackers have long since crossed the scenic Swat Valley in Pakistan off their list. More recently the fabled city of Timbuktu in Mali saw multiple abductions of Westerners by terrorist groups, excursions to St. Catherine's monastery in Egypt's Sinai Desert were halted earlier this year after a bomb attack, and the beautiful coastline of northern Kenya has become a virtual no-go zone thanks to raids by al Shabaab. Even well-protected commercial ventures, like the uranium mine in Niger owned by French company Aveva and the In Amenas refinery in southern Algeria, have been subject to terror attacks. Many travelers will now add to that list the breathtaking scenery of the Tizi Ouzou mountains in Algeria.","Before Sunday, the Algerian group Jund al Khilafa was little known .

"At a gray church on the outskirts of Wenzhou in eastern China, Christians from across the county keep a nervous watch. Some stand behind the iron gate; others sit just inside the church door. For more than two months they've waited, preparing themselves to protect the cross on top of their church. ""If I have to, I am going to hold it in my arms and protect it,"" one elderly man says. ""They have no right to tear it down, that is why we have to defend our church."" Like many here, it's too risky for him to give his name. Wenzhou is known as the ""Jerusalem of China"" and throughout this year the local Communist Party authorities have demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than 300 church crosses. Chinese church leaders say it's the worst anti-Christian crackdown in decades. ""What the government here is doing is so barbaric, they're like bandits and we are furious with them,"" says Chen Zhi'ai, a respected church leader in the Wenzhou area. ""Today we've seen the fundamental symbol of our faith violated and it hurts us deep inside our hearts."" Crackdown . The local authorities are mostly targeting state-sanctioned churches, long tolerated by the ruling Communist Party and often touted as a sign of religious freedom in the officially atheist country. Scores have been injured in the crackdown, as congregations throughout the region try to stop the government teams. In late July, hundreds of police tried to storm the gates of the Salvation Church in Pingyang County in Wenzhou. Like other attempted demolitions, they moved in in the middle of the night, and scenes of extraordinary defiance unfolded on the church's CCTV video as club-wielding police beat their way in. They appear to lose their resolve when an older man is rushed away by ambulance. A blow to the head fractured his skull, say church activists. But several weeks later, they came back with reinforcements and tore down the cross. It now lies under a cheap plastic shroud at the foot of the church's stairs. ""They wanted to drag it away,"" says a church caretaker who wouldn't give his name. ""But we refused. Now it is too big for us to move."" Illegal structures? The local government denies the crackdown on Christianity. They say the demolitions are part of a broader campaign to target illegal structures in the province. They say church demolitions represent only a tiny fraction of their work. But leaked party documents single out churches and folk religious sites in the so-called ""three rectifications and one demolition"" campaign. And church leaders like Chen say that the demolition campaign is merely a front for a crackdown to curtail Christianity's influence in the region. Church leaders say that the central government has ignored all their complaints and petitions. They fear that the Wenzhou demolitions could be a test case for the party, an opening salvo in what could become a wider national campaign. ""The leaders think Christianity is a foreign religion and it is part of a foreign culture, which they define as 'western' culture,"" says Chen.  ""They see our growth as an invasion of western culture into China."" Since Chairman Mao's death in 1976, Christianity has taken hold in China. Though it is still a minority religion. ""Christianity has been growing very rapidly in China in the last several decades,"" says Fenggang Yang of Purdue University in Indiana.  ""There is very little sign that it is slowing down."" ""It moved from a largely rural religion, came into the cities and became very popular with entrepreneurs. Many converts are now the youth."" He estimates that in a few years China will have more Christians than Communist Party members, which stood at more than 85 million in the last count. And in just 15 years, China could overtake the U.S. as the country with largest Christian population in the world. Chinese state media have disputed those claims. 'Social glue' Back at the gray church, the Christians have managed to keep the demolition crews away for now. Their striking red cross sits above the church's spire. They often sing hymns to steel their resolve. ""The Cross Is My Glory"" by a Taiwanese composer has become a rallying cry in Wenzhou. The congregation don't look like typical Chinese activists. There are elderly faithful with their grandchildren, wealthy-looking businessmen and clean-cut students. Chen says, far from hurting the party, Christianity has been a refuge and social glue for many Chinese as income gaps rise and Chinese look for meaning. ""We help promote social harmony,"" he says. But Chen has a warning. ""If they keep doing things this way, there is a saying 'those who play with fire will get burned,'"" he says.","Chinese Christians keep watch to protect cross on Wenzhou church .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- One of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's sons -- Saif al-Arab Gadhafi -- was killed after a NATO airstrike, a spokesman for Libya's government said Sunday at a press conference. Moammar Gadhafi and his wife were in their son's house when it was targeted, spokesman Musa Ibrahim said. Both of them are in good health, according to the spokesman. The victim is one of two Gadhafi sons whose names begin with Saif. The other is Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, who had previously touted reform but has emerged as one of his father's most visible defenders in recent months. Ibrahim said several of Moammar Gadhafi's grandchildren also died in the attack. The house in Tripoli was destroyed by the strike, with a massive crater where the house used to be. At least one unexploded bomb could be seen. The building was in a residential area of Tripoli, according to Ibrahim, who insisted that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was a student in Germany who was not deeply involved in Libya's military and government. The 29-year-old was the sixth of Gadhafi's eight biological children. Ibrahim railed against NATO after the fatal strike, calling it an illegal act and a ""war crime."" He vowed revenge. Speaking at a rally, Ibrahim told fellow Libyans, ""Every one of you are Saif al-Arab."" Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of NATO's military operations, said in a statement he was ""aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gadhafi's family members may have been killed. ""We regret all loss of life, especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict,"" Bouchard said. ""NATO is fulfilling its U.N. mandate to stop and prevent attacks against civilians with precision and care -- unlike Gadhafi's forces, which are causing so much suffering."" The NATO commander stated that all targets ""are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals."" A senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said the U.S. government is ""very aware"" of the reports, but cannot confirm who, if anyone, died in a strike until they see the evidence. Gunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out, while a large crowd of demonstrators gathered around Moammar Gadhafi's compound. Images on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags. Protesters could be heard yelling, ""We want to redeem the martyr,"" as well as, ""Oh youth, this is time for jihad."" Members of Gadhafi's inner circle have been calling members of Obama's administration, saying ""someone important"" in the regime had been killed, a senior U.S. administration official told CNN. But they did not specify who had died, only to stress that it wasn't Moammar Gadhafi himself. A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the veracity of the report of the son's death, saying, ""In all honesty, we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising."" ""We don't believe this is true,"" said Abdul Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi. ""It is all fabrications by the regime in a desparate attempt to get sympathy ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying."" Ibrahim, the spokesman for Gadhafi's government, accused NATO of launching the strike specifically in order to kill the Libyan leader. Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz acknowledged that ""our own laws"" would affect any decision to try to assassinate Moammar Gadhafi directly. ""I don't believe that any credible group or individual sees the solution to the Libyan problem without the removal of Moammar Gadhafi, one way or the other,"" he said. ""But our job and our goal is to get a political solution, but through the means that we are allowed to by our own laws."" This is not the first time that Moammar Gadhafi reportedly has been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children. In April 1986, U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted Moammar Gadhafi's residential compound. As a result, the Libyan leader's adopted daughter, Hanna Gadhafi, was killed. Saif al-Arab Gadhafi, then just 3 years old, was hospitalized after suffering injuries in that strike, Libyan officials then said. Video shows what Libyan officials claimed were him and his brother Khamis, though both boys were heavily bandaged and their faces were not clearly visible. At the time, President Ronald Reagan told the American people the bombings were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others. And on Monday, Ibrahim issued a defiant statement saying Moammar Gadhafi was alive despite what the Libyan government called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound. ""The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address,"" Ibrahim said. Bruce Riedel, a former adviser to three U.S. presidents and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the reported killing could complicate any chances that Moammar Gadhafi might leave Libya peaceably after a negotiated solution. ""A political solution was always a long shot,"" Riedel told CNN by e-mail. ""But in Libya's very tribal politics, the death of a son makes any political settlement all that much harder.""

"(CNN) -- San Francisco residents will not be voting on whether male circumcisions should be banned in the city this fall. A Superior Court judge ordered Thursday that the proposed measure, which had initially made it onto the November 8 city ballot, be removed entirely. The measure proposed banning male circumcisions with the penalty of jail time or a $1,000 fine. It would not have granted religious exemptions. From the beginning, the controversial ballot measure faced strong resistance from medical, religious and civil liberties groups. Should teens make circumcision decision? Superior Court Judge Loretta Giorgi wrote that male circumcision is ""a widely practiced medical procedure"" and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state, not individual cities. The judge's ruling was hailed by the Jewish Community Relations Council, the Anti-Defamation League and others who had sued to remove the measure from the ballot. 'Inactivists' to San Francisco: Ban circumcision . ""While we are confident that the overwhelming majority of San Franciscans would have voted to defeat this extreme measure and are grateful for the outpouring of support from every sector of the community, we believe the right decision was made in the right venue,"" said Abby Michelson Porth, associate director of Jewish Community Relations Council. The plaintiff's efforts were also supported by the American Civil Liberties Union and San Francisco's Medical Society. And even the San Francisco City Attorney's office expressed concerns about whether the measure was constitutional. San Francisco's proposed circumcision ban galvanizes religious opposition . ""It's unusual for a judge to order an initiative off the ballot, but the proposed circumcision ban presented that rare case where the court should block an election on an initiative,"" said ACLU Northern California staff attorney Margaret Crosby in a released statement. ""Not only is the ban patently illegal, it also threatened family privacy and religious freedom. The court's order protects fundamental constitutional values in San Francisco."" Anti-circumcision advocates who had gathered more than 7,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot expressed disappointment and said they would appeal. Circumcising our son -- how do we decide? ""To remove an initiative before it comes on ballot is an extraordinarily irregular thing to do,"" said Lloyd Schofield, who is part of a Bay Area advocacy group that says the surgery violates human rights and likens it to ""male genital mutilation."" ""To go to this length to have it struck from the ballot is undemocratic,"" he said. ""It's very, very unfortunate.""","Judge rules that cities can't regulate medical procedures .

"A U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan's eastern Kunar province killed 11 civilians, including women and children, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Wednesday. Karzai strongly condemned the airstrike and has sent a government delegation to investigate, a statement from his office said. The governor of Kunar province said that two women and two children were among the civilians killed in the strike Tuesday night in Narang district and that 12 others, including women and children, were injured. A spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, Maj. Paul L. Greenberg, said it was ""currently looking into the circumstances"" of the operation in Narang district. Amnesty International called for a transparent investigation, with victims' families being kept apprised of developments. Villagers reportedly brought the bodies of their relatives to the provincial capital to show that civilians had been killed, the organization said Wednesday. An August Amnesty report, ""Left in the Dark,"" documented how it says previous killings of civilians during U.S. and NATO military operations have not been properly investigated. Attacks that involved likely war crimes, it says, have not led to prosecutions. ""The lack of accountability for killings of civilians by US/NATO forces in Afghanistan sends a message that foreign troops have free rein to commit abuses in Afghanistan and that the lives of Afghan civilians have little or no value,"" said Richard Bennett, Asia-Pacific director at Amnesty International. Another airstrike Tuesday night in Dangam district, also in Kunar province, resulted in the death of one armed militant, he said. There were no civilian casualties in that strike. Most NATO troops are due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year as the U.S.-led war effort against the Taliban winds down.","Amnesty International calls for a transparent investigation .

"A man convicted of killing his grandmother decades ago ambushed firefighters on Monday, fatally shooting two of them as they arrived to battle a blaze in upstate New York, police said. Two other volunteer firefighters were wounded in the attack in the Rochester-area town of Webster. A police officer from the nearby town of Greece suffered minor shrapnel wounds when his vehicle was hit by gunfire. Investigators believe the suspect, William Spengler, 62, set the original fire, then likely set himself up on a berm with a clear view of the scene and started shooting. ""It appears that it was a trap,"" Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said. ""There was a car and a house that were involved in flames, probably set by Mr. Spengler, who laid in wait in armament and then shot the first responders."" Authorities do not know how Spengler -- who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after the four firefighters were shot -- obtained the weapon or weapons he used or why he opened fire, Pickering told reporters. As a convicted felon, Spengler was not allowed to legally possess weapons, but he had ""several different types of weapons"" Monday, the police chief said. Spengler was convicted in 1981 of first-degree manslaughter in the death of his grandmother and had been released on supervised parole, Pickering said. N.Y. man who shot dead 2 firefighters killed grandmother in 1980 . He is believed to have lived in the home where the original fire erupted  with his sister, who has not yet been accounted for, Pickering said. Their mother died sometime in the past year, the chief added. In chilling audio heard over the scanner, a West Webster Fire Department firefighter reported ""multiple firemen shot"" -- including himself, with wounds to his lower back and lower leg -- and ""shots still being fired."" ""I'm pretty sure that we have two DOAs"" -- the term for dead on arrival -- ""on the street,"" the wounded firefighter said. ""... They're down and not good."" For several hours after that Monday, the threat of gunfire stopped firefighters from battling the blaze and forced police SWAT teams to evacuate 33 people in the neighborhood of small, waterfront homes. Eventually, seven houses were ""totally destroyed"" by the fire. Although the fires were under control as of 2:30 p.m. ET, by then authorities still hadn't been able to get in any of the homes. Pickering said it's possible more victims could be inside. ""I'm hoping that everyone was able to escape from the inferno,"" he said. ""Those houses were close together."" With 'raging inferno' and gunfire, scene described as 'chaos' Firefighters first arrived at the Webster fire before 6 a.m., said Rob Boutillier, the town's fire marshal. By then, Spengler had set up himself somewhere above the scene in a ""natural hollow, a position of cover to actually be a sniper,"" Pickering explained. The calls from firefighter came in soon after, reporting that four of them had been shot. Police officers rushed to the scene, and one of the first ones there exchanged fire, ""in all likelihood, (saving) many lives,"" according to the police chief. ""When we get there, we have people down, we have raging fires, and we have gunshots going off,"" Pickering said. ""It's chaos. It's chaos."" Authorities worked quickly to set up a perimeter, trying to contain the situation and the shooter. Neighborhood residents were first told to ""shelter in place"" because the gunman was at large, but some left their homes because of the fire. Several people could be seen running. Police tracked some of them down, found they were neighbors seeking safety and escorted them out. Eventually, residents were whisked from the area in armored personnel carriers. All the while, there was ""this raging inferno, with black smoke everywhere,"" Pickering said. No more gunfire was exchanged after that initial burst, though police did see a man they believed to be Spengler moving at times. The police chief said he didn't know if the police officer hit Spengler early on, but he said the medical examiner indicated that Spengler died after shooting himself in the head. Two firefighters also died at the scene. One of them, Lt. Michael Chiapperini, was a veteran of the West Webster Fire Department and a police lieutenant. He'd been named Firefighter of the Year just two weeks ago, and not long before that, he had volunteered to go to Long Island to help those suffering after Superstorm Sandy, according to Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy. The other slain firefighter was Tomasz Kaczowka, who was also a 911 dispatcher. He'd been with the West Webster Fire Department for just more than a year, fire department spokesman Al Sienkiewicz said. One firefighter escaped from the scene in his own vehicle about an hour after he was shot and was taken to a hospital by an ambulance from another location, Boutillier said. Another wounded firefighter was conscious and speaking when he was removed from the scene, he said. The wounded firefighters were in intensive care Monday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, officials said. The other person wounded was a Greece, New York, police officer who was on his way to work when his car was fired upon. He suffered shrapnel wounds that Pickering described as minor. ""We work with these people everyday; they're like our brothers,"" said Pickering of the slain firefighters, as he fought back tears. ""It's terrible."" New shooting spurs more talk on gun control . Authorities have not said what weapons were found with Spengler, though Pickering said ""probably at least a rifle was used"" to shoot the first responders. ""I know that many people are going to be asking, 'Were they assault rifles?' I don't know that. I can't answer that at this time,"" he told reporters. The shooting occurred amid a renewed gun control debate after the December 14 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, most of them children. The gunman in that case, Adam Lanza, also killed his mother and himself. The head of a lobbying group that represents first responders said the Monday shooting was ""senseless and cruel."" ""The firefighters who responded today were performing a selfless, meaningful service to their community, unaware that a cold-hearted maniac was planning to ambush them and take their lives,"" said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the Washington-based International Association of Fire Fighters. ""Coming on the heels of the horrific tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and on Christmas Eve, this shooting is even harder to comprehend."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described the Webster shooting as ""horrific."" And the state's attorney general called it a ""senseless tragedy"" President Barack Obama has set a January deadline for ""concrete proposals"" to deal with gun violence in the wake of the Newtown school shooting. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, while National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre has said his group will fight any new gun restrictions, saying most gun laws now on the books are rarely enforced. Pickering, the Webster police chief, said it was important -- in the wake of the shooting in his town and others -- to ""get a handle on gun control."" He also said more needs to be done to make sure that dangerous people aren't in society, where they can kill. ""For the last 20 years we have been turning people loose and deinstitutionalizing people, and I think we've swung too far,"" he said. ""I think there are still people that need to be in institutions that are a danger to themselves or others. And this is a classic example."" Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kenyan mall in September 2013. Here is a Q and A that looks at this group: . What is Al-Shabaab and what are its aims? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, which published a backgrounder on the group in July. The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has struck abroad, too. It was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, as they gathered to watch a World Cup final soccer match. How big is it? The total size of the group is not clear. A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country. A U.N. report identifies one insurgent leader who is ""believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of them Kenyans. And it has links to other groups. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi aw-Mohamed, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. Though Al-Shabaab's size may be in doubt, its potential for sowing terror is not. ""I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,"" said Gen. Carter Ham in 2011, when he was commander of the U.S. Africa Command. CNN security analyst: Kenya, Westerners high on Al-Shabaab's list . Al-Shabaab's origins . Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist organization, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between IAIA's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members (Al-Shabaab, which means ""the youth""), who were seeking to establish fundamental Islamic rule. That led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. ""Remember Mumbai?"" one tweet asked Saturday, as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi. The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai, India, killing 164 people over a three-day period. ""Some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive. It's going to be a long ordeal,"" Saturday's tweet said. Soon after, it announced it was responsible for Saturday's attack in Nairobi, Kenya. ""Alshabab confirms its behind the #Westgate spectacle,"" it said. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. ""Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,"" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab ""regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy"" and feared for his life. He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating ""between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. In May, a report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. The U.S. State Department said this week that Somali security forces, aided by the African Union Mission in Somalia, have driven Al-Shabaab out of major cities and towns, creating ""a window of opportunity to fundamentally change Somalia's trajectory. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. Want to know more about Somalia? Get the fast facts .

"New York (CNN) -- Fareed Zakaria, the CNN host and Newsweek columnist, has returned a prestigious prize to the Anti-Defamation League, another rebuke for the esteemed civil rights group's opposition to an Islamic center near ground zero. Zakaria, who received the ADL's Hubert Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize five years ago, gave back the honor to ADL for publicly siding ""with those urging the relocation"" of the center, which would be located near the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""I cannot in good conscience hold onto the award or the honorarium that came with it and am returning both,"" he said. It is the latest in a wave of stinging criticism toward the Jewish organization's position from a range of people and groups, including those in the Jewish community, and the ADL said it was ""saddened and stunned"" by Zakaria's decision. The ADL, which exists to fight discrimination, especially anti-Semitism, has said the center's backers had ""every right to build at this site"" and that ""the bigotry some have expressed in attacking them is unfair, and wrong. But at the same time, it said ""that building the center at the site will cause some victims more pain -- unnecessarily -- and that is not right.""m . In a letter dated Friday to ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman, Zakaria explained that he had been ""delighted and moved"" to be picked for the award ""because of the high esteem"" he had for the ADL. ""I have always been impressed by the fact that your mission is broad -- 'to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens' -- and you have interpreted it broadly over the decades. You have fought discrimination against all religions, races, and creeds and have built a well-deserved reputation,"" Zakaria said. That's why, he said, he was ""stunned"" that the ADL used its ""immense prestige to take a side that is utterly opposed"" to its own ""animating purpose."" He said the group's statements that it ""must honor the feelings of victims even if irrational or bigoted, made matters worse."" Zakaria said he hopes his move will complement those who are urging the ADL ""to reconsider and reverse"" its stance. ""This decision will haunt the ADL for years if not decades to come. Whether or not the center is built, what is at stake here is the integrity of the ADL and its fidelity to its mission. Admitting an error is a small price to pay to regain your reputation,"" he said. Foxman responded with a letter to Zakaria, saying he's ""not only saddened but stunned and somewhat speechless by your decision."" ""As someone I greatly respect for engaging in discussion and dialogue with an open mind, I would have expected you to reach out to me before coming to judgment,"" Foxman said. Foxman reiterated that the group isn't opposing the right for an Islamic center or a mosque to be built and that it has and will continue to stand up for Muslims and others who are ""targets of racism and bigotry."" ""What we did was to make an appeal based solely on the issues of location and sensitivity. If the stated goal was to advance reconciliation and understanding, we believe taking into consideration the feelings of many victims and their families, of first responders and many New Yorkers, who are not bigots but still feel the pain of 9/11, would go a long way to achieving that reconciliation,"" Foxman said. Foxman told Zakaria in his letter that he's holding onto his award and check ""in hope that you will come to see that ADL acted appropriately and you will want to reclaim them."" The ADL this week said it won't fight the building of the center after New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission eliminated a hurdle to the construction of the Islamic center two blocks north of the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center. The commission denied landmark status for the building already at the site, moving the center one step closer to reality. The existing building is owned by the Cordoba Initiative, a Muslim outreach group, and already serves as a site where prayer services are held. ""We raised an issue ... but once the community board ruled, we move on,"" Foxman told CNN on Wednesday. The Cordoba Initiative wants to demolish the existing structure and build a ""$100 million, 13-story community center with Islamic, interfaith and secular programming, similar to the 92nd Street Y,"" its website says, referring to the cultural institution on the upper east side of Manhattan. The project calls for a mosque, a performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. On Wednesday, Foxman, a Holocaust survivor, compared the ground zero controversy to the battle over building a convent near the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. ""We're not challenging rights. We're asking, is this the right thing to do?"" he said Wednesday. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Zakaria returns an ADL award over Islamic center stance .

"After 16 straight days of bombardment, Homs is such an incessantly bleeding wound that Syrians speak of it now as though it were a norm. Theirs are voices of resignation as food, medicine, water, electricity dwindle and Bashar al-Assad's forces show no intent of letting up. ""Is today Sunday? Wednesday? Saturday? I honestly don't know all days have become same here in #Homs- they begin and end with shelling #Syria,"" tweeted @Samsomhom. Activist Omar Shakir told CNN he is confident the Syrian army is preparing for a massive ground invasion of the besieged neighborhood of Baba Amr, the heart of the revolt. U.S. conservatives urge ""immediate"" action on Syria . ""Just like every day, the residents of Baba Amr woke up (Sunday) to the sounds of violent bombing, as al-Assad forces continue to use different types of weapons, bombs, and rockets in their attacks,"" he said. Sunday, 10 people in Homs were among the at least 23 killed across Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria, a network of opposition activists. In the 11 months of Syria's uprising, almost 9,000 people have been killed, the LCC estimates. ""Each day, the bombing gets more intense and the destruction increases,"" said Dima Moussa, a Syrian activist in Chicago. ""There are reports of increased cases of dehydration among children because of the shortage in food supplies. There is also an increasingly severe shortage of medical supplies, while the electricity, water, and communication services outages continue in Baba Amr."" The LCC also offered another disturbing report: at least 295 doctors have been arrested in what it called a fierce campaign to shut down physicians. In many places, doctors have been overwhelmed trying to treat the wounded and save lives without proper medicine or equipment. They work in makeshift trauma clinics, clandestinely, for fear of being shot. A group of Syrian doctors were in the United States this week to urge action that will allow critical medical aid to the injured. The regime's interference, they said, amounts to a violation of the Geneva Conventions that protect victims of armed conflicts. GPS: Why Damascus remains eerily calm . ""We lost last week two people carrying medicine.  They killed them. Just carrying medicine inside,"" Dr. Monzer Yazji told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. Despite the grim accounts from Syria, China said Sunday that a peaceful resolution was still possible. After meetings between al-Assad  and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun, the state-run news agency Xinhua said Sunday that Western nations were mistaken in their conclusion that time was running out for talks. The news agency said ""calls for peaceful inter-Syrian dialogue have been largely ignored, intentionally or unintentionally, in Western media reports, which convey the wrong impression that there is an overwhelming consensus among different factions of the opposition forces that they want foreign intervention in their country."" Foreign intervention, it said, would also ratchet up sectarian tensions within Syria and plunge the volatile nation into bloody civil war. GPS: Would a post-Assad Syria look like Iraq? The West, Xinhua said, ""appears to be driven less by their self-proclaimed 'lofty goal' of liberalizing the Syrian people than by geopolitical considerations."" China and Russia snubbed Western nations on the United Nations Security Council with their veto of a draft resolution urging Assad to end the crackdown and give up power. Syrians expressed extreme disappointment at the global body. Some told CNN that they could not understand how the world could stand by and watch a slaughter. Homs residents describe random shelling, rooftop snipers and slow painful deaths due to the lack of medical care. There is not enough respite to even bury the dead. U.S. military chief dubious about arming rebels . Egypt, meanwhile, voiced its disapproval of the violence by recalling its ambassador to Syria, Shawky Ismail, state-run EgyNews.net reported. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it was ""an obligation for the Syrian leadership and government to stop the violence and begin to respond to the demands of the people particularly after the events of Homs,"" EgyNews.net said. Al-Assad has all along, for the 11 months of the uprising, blamed ""terrorists"" for threatening the stability of Syria. His regime lashed out again Sunday after the assassinations of a provincial attorney general and a judge in Idlib province. Attorney General Nidal Ghazal, Judge Mohammed Ziyadeh and their driver were fatally shot on their way to work by an ""armed terrorist group,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also acknowledged the deaths, but said the three were killed by ""unknown assailants."" Idlib rebels denied responsibility for the assassination, claiming that Ghazal was an opposition sympathizer. ""The regime continues with a series of assassinations of leaders and officials who sympathize with the rebels,"" said an activist with the opposition coordination committee in Idlib province, who asked not to be named for security reasons. ""What the regime is trying to do is frame the rebels as criminals,"" the activist said, citing the recent killing of the Red Crescent director in Idlib, Dr. Abdel Razak Jibaro, as an example of this strategy. Rebels said they kidnapped the son of a top security official in Idlib, Brigadier General Nofal Hussein, in retribution for Ghazal's murder. Meanwhile, many opposition activists from surrounding villages traveled to the town of Taftanaz Sunday afternoon, to attend Ghazal's funeral, a sign that he was against the regime. Mourners hoisted a framed portrait of the slain man and vowed to kneel only to God. The Idlib deaths follow the Saturday assassination of Aleppo city council member Jamal al-Bish, who was also killed by an ""armed terrorist group,"" SANA said. And last weekend, SANA reported a Syrian general was gunned down in Damascus -- perhaps the first significant hint that the resistance is spreading to the seats of power. The capital was tense Saturday after two people were killed at a funeral for three protesters  that turned out in a massive expression of anti-government sentiment. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence due to government restrictions on access of international journalists. Sunday evening, a protest in solidarity with Syria's besieged people erupted in the Damascus suburbs, the LCC reported. Al-Assad, the protesters said, must be held to justice.","At least 23 are killed across Syria Sunday .

"American Amanda Knox vowed Tuesday to fight with her head ""held high"" to prove her innocence after Italian Supreme Court judges ruled Tuesday she should stand trial again for the death of her former roommate in Italy. Knox spent four years in prison before an appellate court overturned her murder conviction, citing lack of evidence against her in the 2007 death of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia. Knox, who returned to the United States in 2011 and has been living in Seattle, was not in court for Tuesday's ruling. The Supreme Court judges in Rome also ordered that her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, who was acquitted with her, face a new trial as well over Kercher's death. Knox said it had been ""painful"" to hear the news that the court had ordered a retrial, in a statement issued through the family's PR spokesman, David Marriott. Timeline: Meredith Kercher murder case . The prosecution's case against her ""has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and unfair,"" she said in the statement, and an ""objective investigation"" and ""capable prosecution"" are needed if any questions remain about her innocence. ""The prosecution responsible for the many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for Raffaele's sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith's family. Our hearts go out to them,"" she said. ""No matter what happens, my family and I will face this continuing legal battle as we always have, confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity."" 'Psychological impact' Knox's attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, earlier told CNN that Knox was ""upset and surprised because we thought that the case was over."" But, he added, ""at the same time, as she's done in the last five years, she's ready to continue and we are ready to fight."" Dalla Vedova said he did not expect his client to leave Seattle for Italy ""for many reasons,"" although she is free to travel. Experts disagree over extradition for Amanda Knox . ""She's a very young girl and she's looking to have her life,"" he said. ""This has a psychological impact on her."" Prosecutors have argued that despite the appellate decision, they still believe Knox and Sollecito are responsible for the death of the 21-year-old student. Another man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of Kercher's killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Kercher's older sister, Stephanie, said Tuesday that the family welcomed the news of the retrial because they still hoped to discover the full story behind her death. ""We are never going to be happy about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously support the decision and hope to get answers from it,"" she told CNN affiliate ITN from the family home in Coulsdon, south of London. ""There are still so many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night. ""Rudy Guede's conviction was on the basis that there was more than one person there so that is something that needs to be looked into."" The Kerchers' family lawyer, Francesco Maresca, earlier said they wanted a retrial because they believed the ruling that acquitted Knox and Sollecito was ""superficial and unbalanced."" Amanda Knox: Fascination with 'the evil female' Judge Saverio Chieffi told the court he would publish the reasoning behind his decision within 90 days, after which the parties would have 45 days to present their case. The retrial is not expected until sometime early next year, to be heard in an appellate court in Florence. After that, both parties would again be able to appeal at the Supreme Court. Riccardo Montana, a law lecturer at City University London and an expert on the Italian legal system, said that the judges' decision to order a retrial is ""not unusual when a case is very complex and there is a clear contrast between different accounts of the factual scenario."" While the Italian Supreme Court decides on points of law, the boundaries are not always clear, Montana said. ""In this specific trial, the use and interpretation of evidence was discussed,"" but the picture should become clearer when the full reasons for the court's ruling are issued in the coming weeks, he said. Knox may be ordered to return to Italy for the retrial. If she refuses, the Italian government could appeal to the U.S. government for her extradition. But even if it does, Knox might still not end up before an Italian court. Double jeopardy? U.S. officials might reject such a request because it violates the U.S. legal principle that a criminal defendant can't be tried twice on the same allegation, said Joey Jackson, a contributor for HLN's ""In Session."" Italy lacks the absolute prohibition present in U.S. law preventing authorities from retrying a criminal defendant who has been acquitted of a charge. 2011: Was Italy fair to Amanda Knox? ""We have principles that are well-founded within our Constitution, one of which is double jeopardy,"" Jackson said. ""So as a result of that, I think it would be highly objectionable for the United States to surrender someone to another country for which justice has already been administered and meted out. So I don't think or anticipate that that would happen."" Another lawyer for Knox, Luciano Ghirga, said Monday that her client was confident in the Italian legal system and hoped one day to return to Italy as a free woman. The Supreme Court did not order her retrial Tuesday on a charge of defamation. Knox's conviction for defaming Patrick Lumumba, a club owner whom she accused of killing Kercher, was upheld in October 2011 by the same appeals court that cleared her of murder. 2011: Amanda Knox judge explains murder acquittal . The case began in 2007, after Knox moved to Perugia to study at the University for Foreigners of Perugia for one year. Knox, then 20, shared a room with British student Kercher. That November, Kercher's semi-naked body was found at the home, with her throat slashed. Police arrested Knox and Sollecito, who was her boyfriend at the time. Two years later, they were convicted of murder, but they were cleared when they appealed the verdicts in 2011. 'Lack of evidence' In legal paperwork published in December 2011, the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty. Knox's family said last year the appeal was unwelcome, but no cause for concern. ""The appeal of Amanda's acquittal by the prosecution was not unexpected as they had indicated from the day of the verdict that they would appeal,"" a family statement in February 2012 said. 2011: Knox makes emotional return to Seattle . Knox has spent the last year and a half trying to resume a normal life, studying creative writing at the University of Washington in Seattle, her hometown, according to family spokesman Marriott. She also has written a book on her ordeal, titled ""Waiting to be Heard,"" which will be published next month. According to Harper Collins, Knox ""tells the full story of her harrowing ordeal in Italy -- a labyrinthine nightmare of crime and punishment, innocence and vindication -- and of the unwavering support of family and friends who tirelessly worked to help her win her freedom."" The publisher did not have any immediate response to the news that Knox now faces a retrial. Francesco Sollecito, Raffaele's father, told CNN in a phone interview last year that the family was ""not happy about the decision (to appeal). My son is trying to get back to normal life."" ""We can do very little in this situation,"" he said, but as Italian citizens, they would have to accept the court's decision. ""We hope that the high court will finally put the words 'the end' to this story.""","""There are still so many unanswered questions,"" says sister of murdered British girl .

"At first blush, the biography of Iranian actress Pegah Ahangarani could read very much like my own.  Ahangarani is a working actress who supports social causes in her time away from set. The difference? In October, Ahangarani was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her peaceful activism. In this regard, she is just the latest in a string of filmmakers and actors of Iranian cinema -- including acclaimed filmmakers Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof and actor Ramin Parchami -- to be arrested or sentenced to lengthy prison terms in recent years. Panahi and Rasoulof each were sentenced to prison -- the former for six years and the latter for five -- and banned from filmmaking for 20 years, accused of making ""anti-regime propaganda."" Parchami, a prominent actor, was sentenced to prison after he was arrested in anti-government protests. Many more have been arrested and jailed. In my role as a spokesperson for Amnesty International USA and as a supporter of various charitable causes including Unlock Iran, a campaign to release prisoners of conscience in Iran, I have never been faced with the threat of intimidation or arrest. Indeed, I cannot even fathom that speaking out for the most vulnerable in society and those locked up for peaceful expression and activities would, in turn, be grounds for my own detention and arrest by government authorities. A celebrated and hugely popular actress in her native Iran, Ahangarani first landed on the radar of the Iranian authorities for her open support of opposition figure Mir-Hossein Mousavi, which led to her arrest in July 2009 in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in Iran.  Another arrest in July 2011 followed, as well as a ban on her leaving the country. Now she has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for ""acting against national security and links to foreign media."" The idea that an actress -- mostly lauded for her performances in more than a dozen films -- somehow represents a threat to Iran's national security is laughable at best. But in Ahangarani's case, far from anything humorous, the allegations have actually resulted in the sober prospect of real prison time. Ironically, Ahangarani's sentence was handed down just a month after the reopening of the House of Cinema in Tehran, which had been unceremoniously ordered to shut its doors during the tenure of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Although the reopening was welcomed by many as a delivery of one of the promises that President Hassan Rouhani made on the campaign trail to increase cultural freedoms for Iranians, the reality is that artists such as Ahangarani, rapper Amir Tataloo and poets Mehdi Mousavi and Fatemeh Ekhtesari  -- who were arrested in December and later released -- continue to come under fire for their peaceful exercise of creative expression. And it's not only artists who languish in Iran's prisons.  According to Unlock Iran's reporting, at least 845 people are prisoners of conscience in Iran, jailed for the peaceful exercise of their lifestyle, beliefs or profession. The list of hundreds includes lawyers, students, bloggers, journalists, labor union activists and political opponents. The crisis is so acute that U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recently admonished the Iranian government for continuing to jail a large number of political prisoners. And just last month, the mandate of a U.N. expert assessing Iran's human rights record was renewed for yet another year because of the chronic nature of human rights abuses in the country. Aside from all the reports of abuses, it is an odd thing when your counterpart in another society has experiences that are directly opposite to your own. My human rights activism has been widely met with encouragement and support.  Ahangarani should earn plaudits, not only for her cinematic achievements, but also for her humanitarian deeds and her commitment to increased rights and freedoms for all. She should not be intimidated and silenced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence looming over her head. Ahangarani's only ""crime"" is that she dared be an agent of change and speak out in support of women and young people. The Iranian leadership is keen to prove that it is ready to engage with the international community, both on resolution of the nuclear issue in ongoing negotiations and renewal of economic ties. In addition to these concerns, human rights should be made an equal priority. A good first step would be the unconditional pardon of the 843 prisoners of rights  and the hundreds of others, such as Ahangarani, who are waiting to serve out their sentences. Ahangarani, and all those risking their own freedom to ensure the rights of others, are national treasures, not national traitors.","Iranian Pegah Ahangarani is actress and activist, as is Iranian-born Nazanin Boniadi .

"(CNN) -- Retired U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, on Sunday questioned whether Sen. John McCain's military experience qualified him to be commander-in-chief. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who ran for president in 2004, questioned John McCain's qualifications Sunday. The McCain campaign called for Obama to condemn the remarks. The dust-up began with Clark's appearance Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,""  where moderator Bob Schieffer asked him about his interview with the Huffington Post earlier this month. In the interview, Clark said McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, was ""untested and untried."" When Schieffer asked to explain the comment, Clark said he was referring to McCain's experience, or lack thereof, in setting national security policies and understanding the risk involved in such matters. ""I certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war. He was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces, as a prisoner of war. And he has traveled all over the world. But he hasn't held executive responsibility,"" said Clark, a former NATO commander who campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. ""He hasn't been there and ordered the bombs to fall. He hasn't seen what it's like when diplomats come in and say, I don't know whether we're going to be able to get this point through or not,"" Clark said. Schieffer noted that Obama did not have any of those experiences, nor had he ""ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down."" ""Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president,"" Clark said. In a statement released by the McCain campaign Sunday afternoon, retired Admiral Leighton ""Snuffy"" Smith criticized Clark's comment. ""If Barack Obama wants to question John McCain's service to his country, he should have the guts to do it himself and not hide behind his campaign surrogates,"" Smith said. ""If he expects the American people to believe his pledges about a new kind of politics, Barack Obama has a responsibility to condemn these attacks.""","Retired U.S. Gen.

"President Barack Obama plans to nominate the first U.S. ambassador to Somalia in more than two decades, a top State Department official said Tuesday. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman called the decision ""a reflection both of our deepening relationship with the country and of our faith that better times are ahead."" Sherman said the nomination would occur ""soon,"" but did not give any specifics. Sherman said the United States has no plans in the immediate future to open an embassy in Mogadishu, the Somali capital wracked by violence from al Qaeda-linked extremist group Al-Shabaab. Last month, the group launched a deadly attack on the nation's parliament. The new ambassador would work out of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, with another dozen or so diplomats working on Somali issues, and would travel to Mogadishu. ""I would hope that in years ahead ... that we will see a full presence both in Somalia and by the Somalis here in Washington,"" Sherman said. ""It'll take some time, but we take this in a step-by-step approach."" The United States and Somalia closed their embassies in each other's capitals in 1991 after the overthrow of Mohamed Siad Barre and the effective collapse of central government in the Horn of Africa nation. The United States and its European allies have strengthened diplomatic ties with Somalia since Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, a civil activist, was elected president in September 2012. The United States officially recognized the Somali government in August 2013, and Britain is operating its diplomatic mission an office at the Mogadishu airport until the rest of the UK Embassy compound is completed.","State Dept. official: Move reflects ""our faith that better times are ahead"" for Somalia .

"The ""Downton Abbey"" phenomenon just keeps getting bigger. Sunday's season four premiere of the upstairs-downstairs drama on PBS surpassed the comparable ratings for every previous episode. According to Nielsen data, at least 10.2 million viewers tuned in live (or within a few hours via digital video recorders) on Sunday night, up from 7.9 million at the start of season three and 8.2 million at the end of it. This was more than a ""personal best"" for ""Downton."" The season four premiere outperformed every other drama on Sunday night, too. CBS's ""The Good Wife,"" for instance, had 9.2 million viewers; ABC's ""Revenge"" had 6.7 million. (All these totals will increase once several days of digital video recorder viewership is factored in.) PBS isn't rated like a traditional network because it doesn't carry traditional commercials. But even last season's ""Downton"" premiere was described as one of the highest-rated events in the history of the public broadcasting network; analysts said PBS hadn't seen numbers this high since the premiere of the ""Civil War"" documentary series in 1990.  An apples-to-apples comparison is impossible because of changes in ratings methodology. But the season four premiere affirms that ""Downton"" is making history for the network. Season four, of course, debuted several months ago in the United Kingdom. PBS has received no small amount of criticism for its decision to delay the episodes in the United States, and the network's executives are aware that some fans get a sneak peek by finding the episodes illegally on the Internet. But they say the sky-high ratings two seasons in a row are proof that their scheduling strategy is a wise one. Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, said in a statement on Monday, ""I'm so pleased that millions of viewers have returned to 'Downton Abbey' on their local PBS stations for what has become a post-holiday tradition."" Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of ""Masterpiece,"" added, ""Julian Fellowes has written every word of all four seasons of 'Downton,' and I toss him a huge bouquet on behalf of his American fans."" The premiere ratings suggest ""Downton"" could grow to be even more popular as the season progresses. Last year 8.2 million viewers tuned in on the night of the season three finale, and more than 4 million tuned in later, for a total of 12.3 million. The second-to-last episode of the season did even better once delayed viewership was totaled up: 12.4 million. That's the next ""personal best"" for the drama to beat.","At least 10.2 million viewers tune in Sunday to season 4 premiere .

"(CNN) -- Though no longer a hurricane, ""post-tropical"" superstorm Sandy packed a hurricane-sized punch as it slammed into the Jersey Shore on Monday, killing at least 11 people from West Virginia to North Carolina and Connecticut. Sandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore. Sandy's wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center. ""We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival,"" spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said. In addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital. The storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday. Superstorm Sandy's wrath . ""I've been down here for about 16 years, and it's shocking what I'm looking at now. It's unbelievable,"" said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. ""I mean, there's cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water."" Dahm's family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on. The storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still ""too many people"" who didn't heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to ""hunker down and try to wait this thing out."" ""When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we're at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can,"" Langford said. And in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, ""The whole north side of my town is totally under water."" Mass transit grinds to a halt . In New York, lower Manhattan's Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960's Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere. Flooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an ""extraordinary"" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages. ""We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,"" he said. ""The worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts."" The storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose. But as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan -- including most of the island south of 39th Street. Five things to know about Sandy . At least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN. In West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office. And before hitting land, it overwhelmed the sailing ship HMS Bounty, a replica of the historic British vessel, off North Carolina. Fourteen of the ship's crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship's captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said. Sandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti. Sandy's storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms. ""It could be bad,"" said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, ""or it could be devastation."" Mass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it's over. On Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms. ""I'm concerned that it might come into the first floor,"" she said. ""If that's the case, I'll just move into another house that's higher up."" Based on pressure readings, it's likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 ""Long Island Express"" Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars; Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: ""Be kind to us Sandy."" The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . ""Everything that we've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us,"" she said. ""We're definitely worried about it."" Its arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm. ""The most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying,"" Obama said. ""When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate."" And in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his ""victory centers"" to be donated to victims of the storm. ""There are families in harm's way that will be hurt -- either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe,"" Romney said. Tips from Katrina survivors . By Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy's wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss. Sandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday. On the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border. ""This is not a typical storm,"" said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. ""Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a 'nor'easter.'"" Sandy grounds thousands of flights worldwide . CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Dana Ford, Tom Watkins, Josh Levs, Chelsea J. Carter, Greg Botelho, Jason Kessler, Sarah Dillingham, Sean Morris, Ashley Corum, Eden Pontz and George Howell contributed to this report.","One New York hospital evacuates 200 patients; another turns to backup power .
