The 11-story brick apartment building on Governors Island formerly housed Coast Guard families. The Trust for Governors Island says the building has been vacant since 1996 and does not meet current building codes. Scroll down for video . Before: The building demolished Sunday was a former Coast Guard residence from when the military branch used the island as a base between 1966 and 1996 . Time bomb: The building had been vacant since 1996 and was no longer up to current building codes . Boom: Building 877 was the largest non-historic building on the island before it was demolished Sunday . The implosion just after at 7:30 a.m. Sunday took about 10 seconds. It was overseen by the city Fire Department and the Department of Buildings. Governors Island, a 172 acre island off the tip of lower Manhattan in New York Harbor, was a longtime military base. The city and state now control most of the island, and are redeveloping it, with some of it becoming parkland. Twenty-two acres of the island belong to the Governors Island National Monument which is run by the National Park Service. The island was open to the public Sunday as normal after the implosion. Governors Island is only open seasonally, from May to September. Visitors can access the island via a free ferry. The island offers biking, kayaking and live music events. Retreat: The island is now host to many New Yorkers looking to make a quick day-trip out of the city during the summer . For most of its history, Governors Island was used as a military base. It got the name Governors Island because it was used as the official residence of the British colonial governors of New York, before the Revolutionary War. Over the years it transferred control from the U.S. Army to the Coast Guard and was eventually sold to the people of New York. Today, the island is run by the Trust for Governors Island which is in charge of operations, planning and redevelopment on the island.","Former Coast Guard residence vacant since 1996 was blown up Sunday morning .

A female doctor is accused of putting a toxic chemical in the coffee of her lover, a co-worker at a Texas hospital. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo, a breast cancer oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, was charged last week with aggravated assault against Dr. George Blumenschein, a specialist in lung and head and neck cancers at the institution. The pair were engaged in a 'casual sexual relationship,' according to the complaint filed May 29, when the incident occurred. Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo has been charged with aggravated assault against her 'casual lover' and co-worker George Blumenschein . On Jan. 27, Gonzalez-Angulo reportedly served Blumenschein coffee that tasted sweet, something he questioned her about because he preferred his coffee black. The 42-year-old woman said she had added Splenda and urged him to drink it, which he did even having a second cup. Rather than sweetener, Gonzalez-Angulo is accused of mixing ethylene glycol into the coffee. It is a sweet-tasting toxic substance used in antifreeze and medical research. Four hours later, Blumenschein's started slurring his speech and experiencing poor balance as well as the loss of fine motor skills. Gonzalez-Angulo is alleged to have given her colleague poisoned coffee, which she claimed was Splenda, at their workplace the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center . Medical records show he was taken to an . emergency center 16 hours after drinking the coffee.

Mississippi will require doctors to collect umbilical cord blood from babies born to some young mothers, under a new law intended to identify statutory rapists and reduce the state's rate of teenage pregnancy, the highest in the country. The measure, which takes effect on July 1 and is the first of its kind in the country, targets certain mothers who were 16 or younger at the time of conception. Under the law, doctors and midwives will be expected to retrieve umbilical cord blood in cases where the father is 21 or older or when the baby's paternity is in question. Samples will be stored at the state medical examiner's office for testing in the event that police believe the girl was the victim of statutory rape. But they will not automatically be entered into the state's criminal DNA database. New law: doctors and midwives in the state will be required by law to collect samples of umbilical cord blood from babies born to some girls under the age of 16 . Supporters of the law say it offers an important new tool to prevent older men from having sex with younger girls. Critics argue, however, that it violates privacy and will do little to deter teen pregnancy. 'We think it's a very invasive law to a woman who is already in a vulnerable situation,' said Carol Penick, executive director of the Women's Fund of Mississippi, a nonprofit organization dedicated to women's rights. Mississippi leads the nation in teen live-birth rates with 55 out of 1,000 babies born to young women between the ages of 15 and 19, according to 2010 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The national average was 34.2 live births per 1,000 population and the lowest was 15.7, in New Hampshire, the CDC reported. Governor Phil Bryant said, 'As governor, I am serious about confronting and reducing teen pregnancy in Mississippi. Unfortunately, part of this epidemic is driven by sexual offenders who prey on young girls. This measure provides law enforcement with another tool to help identify these men and bring them to justice.' First in the nation: Officials will analyze the samples and try to identify the fathers through matches in the state's DNA database . Mississippi is the first state to pass such a law, said the bill's author, Republican state Representative Andy Gipson. The state will pay for the costs of the collection and testing of cord blood, Gipson said, adding that testing will be conducted as needed as part of criminal proceedings. An estimate of those costs was not yet available. Bryant also championed a 2012 state law requiring doctors to preserve fetal tissue in abortions involving girls under 14 if they suspect the pregnancy resulted from a sex crime against a minor. The latest measure puts Mississippi in uncharted territory and opens it to legal challenges, according to Matt Steffey, a constitutional law professor at Mississippi College School of Law. 'The argument is that the DNA is abandoned or about to be abandoned as medical waste, and a person doesn't have constitutional privacy over trash,' he said. 'But I think people are understandably nervous about the government collecting and permanently storing information from their DNA.' Steffey said the law puts doctors in the awkward position of acting as law enforcement officers. The state medical association successfully pushed for a penalty exemption for doctors who do not comply in good faith. 'Physicians would rather the Board of Medical Licensure supervise and regulate the practice of medicine instead of having government intrusion between doctors and patients,' said Thomas E. Joiner, immediate past president of the Mississippi State Medical Association. Penick said the state would be better off pursuing proven teen pregnancy prevention methods, such as comprehensive sex education and access to confidential health services. Mississippi requires public schools to teach sex education, but the instruction is limited to either an abstinence-only or abstinence-plus curriculum, which critics say is not comprehensive enough.","Law gives officials another tool to determine the fathers of children born to women under age 16 .

Less than two months after coming out, NBA veteran Jason Collins happily showed off his true colors and marched with thousands in Boston's gay pride parade. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with with a rainbow hashtag '#BeTrue', Collins walked alongside his onetime roommate at Stanford University, Congressman Joe Kennedy III, according to the Associated Press. Collins said he started thinking about coming out when Kennedy marched in last year's parade and Collins didn't think he could walk with his friend. 'BeTrue': Jason Collins, who played most recently for the Washington Wizards, marched in the Boston pride parade a month and a half after coming out as gay . Proud: NBA veteran Jason Collins poses for a picture before the Boston gay pride parade . He said that the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three and injured hundreds, also 'reinforced the notion that things can change in an instant, so he might as well live truthfully', according to the Associated Press. In April, 34-year-old Collins came out in Sports Illustrated, becoming the first openly-gay, active player in a mainstream U.S. sport. 'I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport,' he wrote. 'But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, ""I'm different.""' 'If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand.""

After his announcement, Collins received an outpouring of support from fellow NBA players--and even the White House. President Barack Obama said he 'couldn't be prouder' of Collins. 'The LGBT community deserves full equality, not just partial equality, not just tolerance but full equality,' he said. 'To see a role model like that, I think that's a great thing and I think America should be proud. We treat everybody fairly and everybody's part of a family. We judge people on their character and not their sexual preference.' In his 12-season career, Collins has played for six teams. He becomes a free agent next month.","Collins, 34, marched with Congressman Joe Kennedy III in the parade .

Television insiders are speculating that Katie Couric's daytime talk show 'Katie' won't make it to a third season and that the host could move to CNN. 'Katie' launched in September 2012 and was syndicated to stations in more than 95 per cent of the country, but a recent Nielsen Media Research report showed that in Mid-may, the show's ratings were down 30 per cent from the same period last year. As first reported by Mail Online, the show was renewed for a second season in January with executive producer Rachel Miskowiec on board. Veteran: Before her own eponymous show, Katie Couric was a co-host on the hugely popular Today Show, and a respected news anchor for CBS . Couric, a TV veteran of the 'Today Show' and a respected news anchor, launched the show with executive producer . Jeff Zucker, who quickly decamped for CNN to become the company's . worldwide president. Since Zucker's departure, reports of a lack of leadership and direction have surfaced, especially after his replacement, Michael Morrison, announced he too would be leaving the series after the first season wraps in July. A staff member told the New York Post, 'Jeff’s departure left a void... Then they had four co-executive producers and the staffing decisions being made were poor. Katie was left vulnerable.' Another insider said, 'There wasn’t a . figure who could keep control. It became challenging because of the way . that Jeff left. There’s been creative tension.' Morrison will be replaced by a former 'The Tyra Banks Show' producer, Rachel Miskowiec as executive producer, . but it's unclear whether she'll be able to undo the damage already . done. Abandoned ship: Executive producer Jeff Zucker left 'Katie' soon after its launch to become the worldwide president of CNN . Meanwhile, buzz inside ABC has been that Couric could leave the show after the second season and head to CNN to join Zucker. 'The show was oversold at syndication . and hasn’t lived up to expectations,' one source told the New York Post. 'Now everyone at ABC is gossiping that Katie will end up at CNN with . Jeff.' It's not just insiders speculating about the show. Critics, too, have perceived the lack of direction. 'The program has had trouble finding a hook,' wrote Laure Bennett for New Republic. 'On ‘Katie,’ Couric has seemed at times like a peppy lifestyle reporter and at times like a de-fanged news anchor…' Other . reviewers have labelled the show 'cheesily downmarket' and . 'lackluster', and many have noted Couric's apparent difficulty in . choosing an angle; she appears to teeter between hard news and daytime . puff pieces. Sources report Couric wants the show . to be news-driven, but that her staff is 'stuck on more evergreen, . formulaic daytime segments.' One insider was quoted on Fox News saying, 'Katie has a controlling interest in her show and is not afraid to remind everyone.' 'Katie has stipulated that she will . only interview Ivy League-type guests, and her blatant disregard for . producers and executives alike has created such animosity that ABC . [execs] have made it a top priority to find a replacement next season.' So . far, Couric has garnered many big-name guests, though certainly not . all Ivy Leaguers, including Manti Te'o, Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Lopez, . Sofia Vergara and the cast of Mad Men. Big guests: A recent episode of 'Katie' featured Howard Stern, who turned the tables on his interviewer, quizzing Couric about her outfit choice, her boyfriend and her previous TV shows . Despite this, the show, which screens weekdays at 3pm, has floundered. 'It’s an unmitigated disaster,' Fox News quoted one executive as saying. 'One of the biggest failures ever in syndication. Terrible ratings, no growth, shouldn’t be on the air. Where did it miss the mark? Let’s start with her, she is dreadfully boring. The show offers nothing new to the audience, nothing to say.' Ratings winner: Couric found success as co-host of NBC's Today show with Matt Lauer, from 1991 until 2006 . There are even reports that ABC is seeking to replace Couric with a new daytime talent. 'They [ABC] are desperately running . around approaching talent and offering to train them to replace her as a . new daytime talk show host,' an insider told Fox News. 'It’s a number one . priority.' But a source closely connected to Couric insisted that Couric is working closely with ABC and is still very much wanted by the network. Anchor: Couric became a CBS Evening News anchor in 2006 and interviewed high-profile guests and world leaders including Bill Gates, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . Yet another insider is skeptical that Couric’s show will complete its second season.'There is zero chance is goes to a third season,' quoted Fox News. 'It might not even finish the second.' A source close to the bubbly star told MailOnline admitted it was 'too early to tell' if Katie would be back for a third season as 'there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion premature.' It's all speculation until Couric's camp or ABC comment about the future of the show - both have remained tight-lipped on the subject.","Couric's daytime show 'Katie' has suffered fluctuating ratings since its 2012 launch and is down 30 per cent in the latest poll .

The route to the top starts at 5am in a service lift that runs right up the spine of the building to level 160, the very last concrete floor in the towering structure. After that, accompanied by two of the building's maintenance workers, Mr McNally climbed a series of zig-zagging metal staircases up several more floors until they reached a final ladder. 'Just physically climbing you're talking about going straight up for a couple of hundred metres,' the photographer said. 'You're safety harnessed to the ladder. It's kind of a ratchet system where you can actually lean back and rest when you need to. 'And that just is a straight ladder right up to the very top.

At the top of the building the workers helped Mr McNally ease himself out onto the side of the Burj Khalifa's spire, where he hung from safety ropes above a drop of more than half a mile. There he also photographed the two men who helped him reach the record-breaking point. 'You don't want to go to the top of this tower and just take a snap looking down,' he said.

And while it's commonly thought that we blink to keep our eyes lubricated, it seems a lot of the time it's because our brains need a little nap. New research suggests that the human brain uses that tiny moment of shut-eye to power down. Blink and you'll miss it: Scientists find that blinking is a chance for our brains to power down . Researchers from Japan's Osaka University found that the mental break can last anywhere from a split second to a few seconds before attention is fully restored. Scans that track the ebb and flow of blood within the brain revealed that regions associated with paying close attention momentarily go offline. The brain then goes into a 'default mode network', or idle setting. The same setting is engaged when our attention is not required by a cognitive task such as reading or speaking and our thoughts wander freely. Mini nap: blinking allows the brain to go into idle mode . During this mode we tend to contemplate . our feelings; we wonder what a friend meant by a recent comment; we . consider something we did last week, or imagine what we'll do tomorrow. While listening to another person or . reading, that usually comes at the end of a sentence and while watching a . film, we're most likely to blink when an actor leaves the scene . or when the camera shifts. Most of us take between 15 and 20 such moments of downtime per minute. The new research, published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, studied 20 healthy young subjects in a brain scanner as they watched snippets from the British comedy Mr. Bean. When subjects blinked, the researchers detected a momentary stand-down within the brain's visual cortex and somatosensory cortex -- both involved with processing visual stimuli - and in areas that govern attention. Separate studies on blinking have shown that  while telling a lie, people have been found to blink less. In the seconds after telling a lie, however, the liar will blink far more frequently than a truth-teller.","When we blink, our brains goes into idle mode where thoughts wander freely, say Japanese researchers .

More than half admit to having wrecked their homes during a failed attempt to be useful around the house, according to a new survey. And a third said they have been forced to try and cover up their mistakes after making a mess of a household job. Useless: More than half of British men admit to having wrecked their home during a botched DIY attempt . Too proud to ask for help, half also confess to having left at least one DIY project unfinished. The survey of a 1,000 men, carried out by Disney to coincide with the Blu-ray release of animation Wreck-It Ralph, found 58 per cent of men had botched a DIY job in their home. And the most troublesome area is the bathroom where 20 per cent of all mishaps take place. A tenth of men admit to having called in repairmen to correct their blunders and then passed off the results as their own work. Pride: Half of British men also confess to having lest at least one DIY job unfinished . The same number say they frequently wreck things but carry on regardless because they are too proud to ask for help. Fortunately, an older generation of British men still know their way around the house. Rather than admit their own failings, 15 per cent call on a family member, usually their fathers, to fix their DIY disaster. But all is not lost. Around a fifth of British men are competent enough to carry out DIY themselves and are often asked for advice by others. And the same number are graceful enough to accept they have no aptitude for practical skills and get someone in to do the work for them.","Survey of 1,000 men found 58 per cent admit to a DIY disaster .

The heckler who interrupted the First Lady this week to protest about discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans said she felt compelled to speak after five years of inaction in the White House. Ellen Sturtz, 56, says she feels let down by President Obama, after supporting his 2008 election campaign because of his promise to protect homosexuals from workplace discrimination. She added that despite having an executive order waiting on his desk for him to sign, President Obama has yet to act on his promises to protect the community. Campaign: Ellen Sturtz says she felt compelled to speak up about gay rights during Michelle Obama's speech . 'I don’t have time to wait another . generation for equality - it’s been almost 40 years since similar . legislation to ENDA was first introduced in Congress. And being polite . hasn’t gotten us any closer to it becoming a reality,' Miss Sturtz, who lives in Washington DC, said. Her campaign came to national attention this week, after her outburst in front of 200 people at a $10,000 a head fundraiser at the home of Karen Dixon and Dr Nan Schaffer. As Michelle Obama have a speech at the Washington DC event, Miss Sturtz interrupted her to complain that the President had not yet signed the executive order. The order was designed to protect federal employees. The President had also made a campaign promise to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which was set to end workplace discrimination by all employers. While many companies have addressed the issue, some major companies, such as Exxon Mobil, have set 'a dangerous precedent' Miss Sturtz claimed. The incident, caught in mobile phone footage, shows the First Lady walk over to the gay rights campaigner, before saying: 'Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.' Miss Sturtz told the Washington Post: 'When I blurted out my comments during the First Lady’s speech, it was a spontaneous reaction to her saying, . “Right now, today, we have an obligation to stand up for those kids"".' Confrontation: After being interrupted Michelle Obama walked into the crowd to speak to Ellen Sturtz . 'I . needed to speak up for LGBT youth, who make up 40 per cent of homeless . youth - kicked out on to the street because parents and workplaces won’t . accept them for who they are - and for LGBT parents, whose lack of . workplace protections imperils their children’s futures,' the campaigner, who divorced her wife, Barbara Zacky, last year, said. Critics have said Miss Sturtz was wrong to take her campaign to the First Lady because she is not an elected official. However, Miss Sturtz says that only days after Senate Democrats refused to include same-sex couples in their immigration reform bill, Mrs Obama had asked the gay and lesbian community to contribute to the Democratic National Committee. Initially Miss Sturtz, who says for years she felt forced to hide her sexuality from friends and colleagues, had planned to speak to Democratic National Committee officials at the fundraiser, the Examiner said. But, as Mrs Obama began her speech about protecting future generations, Miss Sturtz felt compelled to speak. Outburst: Michelle Obama had been speaking at a $10,000-a-head fundraiser when Ellen Sturtz made her stand . 'I . could no longer remain silent while standing in front of one of our . country’s most powerful political figures. I spoke up for the millions . of LGBT Americans,' she said. The retired government regulator added: 'Mrs Obama has accomplished extraordinary . things and is inarguably the conscience of the White House. She . understands injustice at a deep level, and it was that political . conscience I was hoping to stir at this week’s fundraiser.' Miss Sturtz, who helped organize the first Gay Pride festival in San Luis Obispo, California, said: 'My hope is that the First Lady sees me as . just one of millions who are desperate to participate fully in the .

Actress Jill Gascoine, who played Britain’s first female TV police detective, is battling Alzheimer’s disease. The 76-year-old star – best known for her trend-setting role as DI Maggie Forbes in The Gentle Touch – publicly revealed that she has dementia at a Beverly Hills gala raising money to fight the disease. Gascoine, who lives in Hollywood with her actor husband of 26 years Alfred Molina, was introduced to the audience at the star-studded event by her lifelong friend, the actress Millicent Martin. Devoted: Jill, who has revealed she has Alzheimer's and husband Alfred Molina out in Los Angeles last month . Accepting an award for courage, Gascoine said: ‘It’s been so dreadful, this thing, that I decided I was going to stand up and say, “Well, it’s going to happen so get on with it. I can’t think of anything else to say”.’ Appearing confused, she turned to Martin and said: ‘What do I say?’ Martin replied: ‘Just say thank you.’ Last night a friend said: ‘Jill and Alfred started telling friends about it a year ago. It is not something that has come on suddenly. ‘Jill was aware there was a problem with her memory as far back as three or four years ago, but it was only in the past year to 18 months that she was officially diagnosed. Her memory loss became more  significant and so they informed close friends because it was becoming obvious. Jill hadn’t felt like going public with the news until recently. ‘She hopes it will help raise awareness of dementia and the toll it can take on family members.’Gascoine’s dementia  may explain her surprise decision in 2010 to drop out of what was considered a major comeback role in EastEnders. Back in the day: Jill Gascoine tries out a police car phone to prepare herself for her role as Maggie Forbes in the TV detective series The Gentle Touch . She was hired to play the role of Glenda Mitchell but quit after one day’s filming. Gascoine said she felt she ‘lacked the right experience to film such a big continuing drama’. In August 2012 she appeared as a dying mother on stage in LA in a two-week run of the drama Anxiety, with proceeds going to the  Alzheimer’s Association. It was a play written for her without any lines to remember. In 2008 Gascoine had told friends she was retiring from acting after appearing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. London-born Gascoine was a West End star before starring in The Gentle Touch from 1980 to 1984 and its spin-off C.A.T.S. Eyes from 1985 until 1987, paving the way for later shows such as Prime Suspect, which starred Helen Mirren. With her curly, dark-brown hair and wide shoulder-pads, Gascoine made DI Maggie Forbes an unlikely – and sexy – feminist role model. Divorced with two children, Gascoine married Molina in 1986 and moved with him to America in the 1990s as his film career took off. He later starred in Spider-Man 2 and The Da Vinci Code. Despite him being 16 years her junior, friends say the couple are ‘devoted’ to each other. A source said: ‘Alfred has turned down roles to be near her. He is her rock. ‘She gave up a lot for him in the early days of their marriage because she was the bigger star, and she moved to Hollywood to allow him to pursue his dreams.’ Last night a spokesman for the couple said: ‘Mr and Mrs Molina are not going to comment.’","Gascoine played DI Maggie Forbes in The Gentle Touch .

The widow of a man who drowned during a weekend away with his girlfriend is 'in bits and struggling to work out what happened', it was reported today. Gurpreet Kpakiwa was said to be in shock after hearing that her husband, Komba Kpakiwa, 31, had been found dead in a hotel pool with his lover, Josephine Foday, 22, last weekend. She is said to be finding it hard to cope and barely speaking to anyone following the death of her shop-keeper husband, by whom she has two young children. Mr Kpakiwa and Miss Foday both drowned at the pool at Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield Heath, Essex, on Saturday. Mr Kpakiwa had taken Miss Foday, a nursing student, away for a surprise weekend break to celebrate her birthday on Friday. Today a family friend said that Mrs Kpakiwa was distraught. He told the Evening Standard: 'She is in bits and struggling to work out what happened to Komba on Saturday. 'She's in a bad way and is hardly talking to anyone.' Meanwhile Mr Kpakiwa's brother Sahr, who lives in Erith, Kent, said that Miss Foday was a family friend, and his brother had taken her away for a birthday weekend. He said: 'What I know about my brother is that he was a nice and loyal man and he was respectful of his family and always proud of them.' He said his family did not yet know the circumstances surrounding the drownings, and said his mother was flying to England from her family home in Sierra Leone. Josephine Newahun Foday, left, and Komba Kpakiwa, right, were found drowned at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Hatfield, Essex . They had gone out for the day, before . returning to the hotel room they were sharing and then going down to the . pool, the inquest at Chelmsford Coroner’s Court heard yesterday. A hotel guest saw the pair floating in . the ten-metre indoor pool but presumed they were playing a game and . went into the sauna, it was claimed last night. When the guest returned . to the pool he saw they were face down in the water and dialled 999. The . pair were pronounced dead at the scene. Police are not treating the deaths as suspicious and preliminary post-mortem examinations found they had drowned. A picture posted on Twitter by a hotel guest showed the swimming pool area cordoned off by police . Last night, Miss Foday’s grandmother, . Theresa Farma, 61, said Mr Kpakiwa had surprised her granddaughter with . the getaway to celebrate her birthday. She said he had met her at the corner . shop at the top of her road where he worked as a supervisor and they . started seeing each other in February. Josephine Newahun Foday and her grandmother Theresa Farma who described her as a 'loving granddaughter' Speaking from her home in Plumstead, . south-east London, Mrs Farma said: ‘She called me on Friday to say that . she had arrived at the hotel. They were looking forward to spending time . at the hotel. ‘They were supposed to come back on . Sunday but instead the police came. Everyone is upset, distraught. I . can’t believe she has gone.’ Miss Foday was a second year nursing student at Canterbury Christ Church University. She fled to England with her . grandmother from their native Sierra Leone in 2001 when both her parents . disappeared in the country’s civil war. Mrs Farma said: ‘We don’t know where her parents are, we think they are dead. I grabbed the child and left. ‘I am so sad, now my granddaughter has been taken away too.’ Abdul Conteh, a family friend, said a man saw the pair floating in the water, but thought they were just fooling around. He said: ‘According to an eyewitness, . he saw the couple in the pool, he went to the sauna and eight minutes . later he came out and saw Komba’s face in the pool and Josephine was . lying on his back. ‘He thought they were mucking around, a . couples thing, he didn’t take any notice of them. But then he came back . again and he saw the two of them going down and saw the man’s face was . underneath the water, so he raised the alarm.’ Mr Kpakiwa, who was also from Sierra Leone, lived with wife Gurpreet, in Erith, Kent. The couple, who had been married for four years had two children, a son, seven, and a daughter, six. His cousin, Teresa Kpakiwa, 52, last . night said she knew nothing of Miss Foday, adding: ‘This is so awful, . they’ve got young children.’ Mr Kpakiwa had been taking his girlfriend Josephine Foday on a surprise weekend away for her 22nd birthday .

A mother-of-two has been battling a constant feeling of travel sickness since taking a flight eight years ago. Catharine Bell, 46, was left struggling to balance, nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in Marmaris, Turkey, in 2005. Ms Bell, from Bellingham, Northumberland, thought the feeling would pass but was horrified when her symptoms worsened throughout the holiday until she could no longer walk down the hotel corridor without holding onto the wall. Even after arriving back in the UK following the two week holiday with her daughters, Jessica and Annie, now aged 18 and 13, Ms Bell’s symptoms failed to subside. She was eventually diagnosed with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS) and has suffered from incurable, and sometimes debilitating, attacks ever since. Ms Bell said: ‘I got on the plane and I was perfectly healthy, it was a perfectly normal flight. And then when the plane landed I stood up to get my bag and I felt a bit weird. ‘As soon as we landed and I stepped off the plane I felt seriously odd. The whole world had transformed into bouncy castle land and I felt as if I was walking on a giant marshmallow. ‘Throughout the holiday that feeling never went away, it was like being on the Pirate Ship at the fairground my world was moving up and down and from side to side constantly. ‘I felt sick, had a headache and felt decidedly unwell. I presumed I had an ear infection and thought I would wait it out, go home, and see the doctor.’ However, when the family’s flight home took off all of Ms Bell’s symptoms disappeared and she thought she was better. Unfortunately, the respite was short lived and the symptoms returned as soon as she stepped off the plane. Ms Bell said: ‘And so started a terrible few months of doctor visits, travel sickness pills, ear syringing, lying on the floor crying, hanging onto the bed, throwing up, and nobody finding anything wrong with me. ‘I felt like my world was constantly moving, I felt nauseous all the time, I couldn't sleep because when I lay still everything would keep moving up and down, back and forth. ‘After five to six weeks I was tired, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't read because the words would jump out of the page, and I couldn't sit still because the more still I was, the worse it was. She was left struggling to balance, nauseous and feeling permanently dizzy after she disembarked the flight in Marmaris . ‘And then one day I woke up and it was gone. I was so relieved I thought I was cured, I really thought it was an imbalance in my ear and it had settled down.’ However, when Ms Bell went to Turkey with her daughters again the following year, her symptoms returned and this time they were worse. When she returned she was left unable to sleep, read or walk in a straight line. At one point she could not stand up and was left clinging to the carpet in her living room as her world spun around her. Megan Arroll from the University of . East London, said: ‘Mal . de Debarquement Syndrome, or the ""sickness of landing"", is a condition . characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying, similar to . those of being on a boat. ‘MdDS . is usually triggered by long-haul air and/or sea travel but there have . been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion-based games and . fun fair rides. ‘Additional symptoms can include nausea, headaches, fatigue and sensitivity to light. ‘Our . research within the Chronic Illness Team at the University of East . London has shown that these symptoms can last for years and impact . significantly on individuals' lives, disrupting work, relational and . recreational activities, which in turn can lead to depression and . anxiety. ‘This is an . invisible illness - the person may not look unwell. ‘It can be very difficult to gain a diagnosis as there is still much uncertainty . surrounding MdDS; we do not know the cause of the illness at present . and it is currently a very under-researched condition. ‘There . is no 'cure' for MdDS at this time although interestingly, those with . the condition often find symptoms temporarily diminish during motion, . for instance car travel, which differentiates MdDS from conditions . concerning the inner ear.’ Despite several visits to her GP, doctors were baffled by her condition. Desperate for a diagnosis, Ms Bell turned to the internet and came across Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS). This is a neurological disorder triggered by travel, such as boat or plane journeys. The symptoms last long after the journey has finished. Instead of the usual symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, people with MdDS feel as though they are rocking or bobbing constantly. This feeling can last for months, or even years, and the only time this feeling subsides is when they are in motion again. When Ms Bell read about MdDs on the internet, she took the information into her doctor who confirmed this was what she had. However, the doctor informed her that there is no cure and so she has been forced to live with the condition ever since. She said: ‘When I got home from holiday I staggered to the doctors and I actually lay down on the floor in the doctors’ surgery and gripped onto the carpet, I felt so ill. ‘The doctor and another patient had to practically carry me into the surgery and onto the couch. I had to hold onto the wall because I was convinced I was going to fall off the couch. ‘None of the conventional vertigo tablets made any difference so I started to research and found MdDS online. I knew instantly this was what I had, I showed the research to my doctor and he confirmed it. Ms has now had the symptoms every day for the last four years. She no longer drinks alcohol as it is difficult enough to maintain her balance without a drink, she cannot dance and she finds it difficult to read. She also cannot sit still for longer than an hour at a time. But despite her condition, Ms Bell leads a normal life - she has two jobs as a school caretaker and a play leader, continues to go on holiday every year, and does everything she can to prevent the condition ruining her life. She felt unwell throughout the holiday but assumed that she had an ear infection and decided just to visit a doctor when she got home . She said: ‘I've never had it as bad as the first two episodes but I've now had it constantly for almost four years. ‘I take precautions to avoid my symptoms worsening. I don't drink, I eat well, I exercise a lot, I avoid any kind of boat journey, if I fly I walk on the plane and I try not to sit still for too long. ‘At the moment I live in a wibbly wobbly world, if I stand still or sit down I can see the world swaying slightly. It makes it hard to read or watch TV and I have a constant headache and feel sick. ‘If I'm tired or I've been on a long journey, I am worse but it's usually at its worst when I'm still. ‘Walking on a treadmill is really hard, I fall over, standing still with my eyes shut is impossible, I find myself falling backwards, almost like I'm being pushed. ‘Dancing is almost impossible, anything where I have to be spun around or do a quick turn is a big no no. The symptoms did not improve on her return to the UK and she was eventually diagnosed with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome . ‘In between work I go to the gym for up to two hours a day, and walk my dog five times a day, anything to keep me moving. ‘There is no cure, there's no medical information, no treatment, there's nothing that's going to make it better - I just have to live with it. ‘I lead a very full, happy, if slightly topsy turvey life.’ Megan Arroll from the University of East London, who is conducting research into the condition, said: ‘Mal de Debarquement Syndrome, or the ""sickness of landing"", is a condition characterised by persistent feelings of rocking and swaying, similar to those of being on a boat. ‘MdDS is usually triggered by long-haul air and/or sea travel but there have been cases where symptoms began after engaging in motion-based games and fun fair rides. ‘Additional symptoms can include nausea, headaches, fatigue and sensitivity to light.

A woman who spent nine years pulling out her eyelashes due to stress has undergone a transplant to have them replaced. The nurse, known only as Joanne, had suffered with trichotillomania (TTM), a condition that causes a person to impulsively put their hair out, from the age of six until 15. Despite having not pulled her eyelashes for eight years, she had permanently damaged the hair follicles, causing the hair growth to become sparse. Before and after: Joanne had been suffering from trichotillomania, the condition which causes people to compulsively pull their hair out, for nine years. After overcoming it, she decided to have an eyelash transplant . Despite beating trichotillomania nearly a decade ago, Joanne's eyelashes never grew back. She said she was afraid to leave the house without makeup and false lashes before the surgery . She was so distressed by her appearance that she decided to take drastic measures and undergo a new type of surgery. The £4,000 procedure was carried out by transplant hair surgeon Asim Shahmalak, based at the Crown Clinic in Manchester. After injecting a local anaesthetic into the eyelids, Mr Shahmalak took hair from the back of Joanne’s head and implanted it into her eyelid. And because the implants are made out of her head hair, they have continued to grow as if they are attached to her scalp and needs regular trimming and curling. Before the surgery Joanne's eyelashes were almost completely bald, with only a few lashes at the outer edges of her eyes. She had tried to create the illusion of eyelashes by wearing heavy eyeliner and false eyelashes. Joanne, from Manchester, said: 'From a young age I . suffered from trichotillomania which had a profound effect on my life . both physically and mentally. 'As I became older I was more aware of what others around would think and it consequently had a great effect on my confidence.' Joanne was so pleased with the results of her first transplant, she underwent a second three months later to give her an ultra-lush set of lashes. TOWIE star Sam Faiers, 21, has suffered with hair-pulling disorder TTM since the age of seven . 'When I got to the age of 13 I began to cover up the noticeable gaps with eyeliner. 'However, I was still afraid that other people would find out, especially when it came to . school because make-up was just not allowed. 'By the age of 15, I had overcome . trichotillomania but I was still left with the effects of the years of . pulling out my eyelashes, as they just did not grow back. 'I remember thinking that if there was . some procedure that could replace the missing eyelashes then my life . would be changed forever,as I wouldn't wake up in the morning . and put make-up on to cover it up before even seeing other members of my . family.' Joanne said the two successful transplants she had have ended ‘a 17 year nightmare.’ She said: 'Dr Shahmalak arranged for a beauty therapist to be present which was really useful as she was able to advise me how to care for my eyelashes and also what products to use to ensure they remain in great condition. 'Following my eyelash transplants, I am a much more confident person – saying this has transformed my life would be an under-estimation. TTM is a condition that causes a person to feel compelled to pull their hair out and often eat it. It is usually carried out in secret. The condition is thought to affect up to 248,000 British people. It tends to start in early teenagehood and is more common in girls. It is not clear what causes TTM but experts have described it as a form of addiction, self-harm or a manifestation of severe anxiety. Side-effects tend to be psychological - pulling hair and eating it brings on a sense of shame and can be disfiguring - but it can also cause balls of hair to build up in the digestive system. Current treatment usually involves psychotherapy, antidepressant medication or hypnosis. 'I am now confident enough to walk around with no make-up on and even go shopping which, in the past, I would never have done.' In total, the procedure took around four hours. Patients who undergo the procedure can go home the same day. Eyelash transplants have been common in America for years but they only reached the UK four years ago. Growing numbers of women are turning to eyelash transplants after damaging their natural lashes through repeated use of false eyelashes. Some women also want fuller eyelashes . for cosmetic reasons. Celebrities like Cheryl Cole have made big . eyelashes very fashionable. Others are seeking transplants due to trichotillomania. Sam Faiers, 21, who stars on the TV show The Only Way Is Essex, has suffered from the condition since she was seven and has no eyelashes. Dr Shahmalak has pioneered the treatment in the UK  which is also often performed on burns and road traffic accident victims who have lost their eyelashes after being injured. He said: 'There has been a big increase in referrals for two reasons. 'Firstly, because of brave women like Sam Faiers, more women are becoming aware of trichotillomania and seeking help. 'Secondly, the fashion for big eyelashes has meant that more women are wearing false eyelashes and damaging their natural lashes. The glue used to fix false lashes can pull natural eyelashes out as the fake set is removed. If repeated frequently it can stop hair growing. As with any hair follicle, eyelashes will cease to grow if they are repeatedly plucked out at the root. 'Hair transplant surgery may seem like a radical solution, but in many cases it is the only way of restoring eyelashes permanently.'","Joanne suffered with hair-pulling disorder trichotillomania from age 6 to 15 .

The Moore family, from Maple Ridge, British Columbia, had been woken by a banging outside in the early hours of Tuesday. When they looked out the window they saw a black bear climb out of the driver's seat of their pick up truck, before opening the door to the back seat.

'We saw him just open the door of the truck, just easy as anything... He was obviously used to accessing vehicles,' Rebecca Moore said. The mother said they have a lot of wildlife around their home, and usually make loud noises to scare any bears away.

When singers Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Lopez and Mary J Blige - among others - agreed to perform at Saturday’s Chime for Change concert in London, perhaps they even believed it would be, as promised, 'a feminist Live Aid'. After all, it was promoted as a good cause: to raise awareness of the need for education, health and justice for women everywhere. In the end, however, what we got was feminism, girl power and emancipation - all preached by women dressed as cheap hookers in a dominatrix theme park. Fetish feminists: Beyonce squeezed into a black leather leotard, left, while Jennifer Lopez wore fish nets and thigh-high boots . Beyonce headed the bill and set the tone, squeezed provocatively into a black leather leotard, nude fishnets and very little else. Not to be outdone, Jennifer Lopez followed the fishnet-and-leather dress code, her black seamed tights teamed with thigh-high studded boots - the stuff of a fetishist’s wildest dreams. A lithe 22-year-old Australian hip hop artiste, Iggy Azalea, wore a frock that barely skimmed her knickers, while her thigh-high boots were laced to look as if they could be unlaced in a heartbeat if the price was right. Meanwhile, Mary J Blige wore a flesh-coloured catsuit decorated with an applique design that made it look as if she was being groped by many shiny hands. Revealing: Hip hop artiste, Iggy Azalea, wore a frock that barely skimmed her knickers . Each one looked as if she’d be more comfortable manacled to a bedpost - yet they bellowed 'feminist' slogans while the screens behind them displayed images of women such as the civil rights activist Rosa Parks. Talk about mixed messages. Where shall we start? The issue here is not about betraying what these mindless dollies think they mean by 'feminist'. As it happens, I have never called myself a feminist - but I like to think I know right from wrong and I have a deep distaste for unfairness. I believe it is absolutely right to campaign against inequality in all its ugly guises, including, as our floozies on Saturday were meant to highlight, the plight of poor women worldwide. As long as women drop like flies from Aids in Africa, as long as 800 women every day die in childbirth, as long as women perform 66 per cent of the world’s work to reap only 11 per cent of the world’s income, then please, let’s speak up. But when wealthy Western women strip themselves of most of their clothing and all their dignity in the name of struggling women in developing countries, you come close to finding the good outweighed by the bad. Appropriate attire? Mary J Blige wore a flesh-coloured catsuit decorated with an applique design that made it look as if she was being groped by many shiny hands . One thing that strikes home whenever we see heartbreaking footage of famine is how even the worst-affected women hold tight to their dignity, often to the very end. You see them slumped in futile embrace, trying to suckle a dying child from empty breasts (yes, J-Lo, breasts. Suckle. It’s what they’re for). You see them bury the child carefully, quietly, knowing they will be next for the grave. What might those women think if they should ever have the misfortune to see Knowles, Lopez or Blige writhing semi-nakedly in public ‘on their behalf’? I wonder how much many of the Chime for Change performers knew or cared about the poor women in whose names they were performing . Would they think ‘Gosh, how I’d love to be a Western woman?’ Or would they think (more likely, I venture) that the whole world has gone flaming mad? In answer to critics like myself - and Twitter was chock-a-block with women decrying Saturday’s display - the cavorting songbirds would say that they only present themselves this way because that is what their fans expect - and by pleasing fans they sell tickets which, in turn, makes money for charitable causes around the world. Except that this argument was thoroughly undermined on the night of Chime for Change, by none other than music’s Queen Bee herself: Madonna. Now, as we all know, Madonna is no stranger to the outrageous, the outlandish and the reveal-all when dressing up for her fans on a concert stage. Even to the point where some suggest that ‘at her age’, 54, it might be time to, er, tone it down a bit. On Saturday she knew there was more at stake than just pleasing the regular fan club. She had the intelligence to understand the underlying issues and the discernment to dress appropriately. To the point: Surprisingly, it was Madonna who dressed demurely in black trousers and a turtle neck jumper as she gave a speech on the importance of education for girls . She appeared in a black turtle-neck sweater, plain wool trousers, hair kept simple. Thus attired, she delivered an impassioned ten-minute speech on the importance of education for girls. It was an echo of her appearance on Live Aid in 1985, where even then she understood the point of it and dressed in a trouser suit, adorned with a small crucifix. So: if one star can unexpectedly show decency and taste, why can’t others do likewise? The answer, I fear, boils down to why they are doing the show in the first place. Is it about doing good for others, or doing good for me, me, me? For many years I produced charity galas for overseas aid - sick children, in my case - and I learnt very quickly who was in it for the right reasons and who saw it as little more than career advancement; a chance, perhaps, to promote a new record or catch the eye of Hollywood. Some would have their 'people' hassle me for top billing ('Alphabetical', I always said. 'Get over it.') or the 'best' dressing room. Some acts never did catch on why they were there. Backstage at a different benefit I heard one big name ask another, ‘Which bit of Africa is Nicaragua in, anyway?’ First ladies . Hillary Clinton and Lady Gaga topped a recent poll to find the top ten modern feminists . Others, happily, were brilliant. Richard Whiteley and the comedian Bill Bailey both spent ages in a - communal! - dressing room, asking me about sick children and their needs. While some demanded limousines, Harry Hill and Graham Norton both arrived on foot. My friend Bea Arthur, of The Golden Girls, paid her own way from Los Angeles to London and proceeded to bring the house down. Her one nod to diva-ism was to say she couldn’t do her own make-up, so could her fellow star Jo Brand do it instead? Jo, one of the best, did. Mixed messages: The concert called for women to be respected and well-educated but many of the stars presented themselves as sex objects . So, while many earned my trust, others taught me to be cynical. Cynical enough to wonder how much many of the Chime for Change performers knew or cared about the poor women in whose names they were performing. No, they were more likely concerned at being seen on TV in 150 countries, by up to a billion people, which is no end of a plug for whatever they are selling this week. I can’t think of any other reason for what was, in the end, simple disrespect. Their business, I suppose; their choice. But next time they wish to tart up like Miss Whiplash in the name of 'feminism', someone should tell them: a dominatrix isn’t a woman with power. Quite the reverse. She only gets to crack a whip as long as a man pays her to do so. Your idea of progress? Mine neither.","Beyonce squeezed provocatively into a black leather leotard .

Vodafone reignited the row over firms avoiding tax today after it emerged the mobile phone giant paid no corporation tax in Britain for the second year running. The revelation was even more astonishing because the company earned revenues of more than £5billion. The company insisted it contributed to Britain in a 'variety of ways' but is just the latest multi-national to pay little or no tax despite huge incomes. Tax: Mobile phone giant Vodafone has paid no corporation tax for two years, despite earning revenues of more than £5billion in 2012-13 alone . The firm, which is based in Berkshire, claimed investment in its UK network and interest payments more than wiped out corporation tax liabilities during the year to the end of March. However the company, which employs around 14,000 of its 91,000 staff in the UK, did pay around £3 billion of tax overseas. Its annual report also revealed chief executive Vittorio Colao's total pay fell 30 per cent to £11 million due to lower share incentive rewards. The tax affairs of the company have been controversial for several years, most notably a 'sweetheart' deal struck with HM Revenue and Customs. It has been claimed the Vodafone was allowed to pay £1.25billion of an alleged £6billion tax bill – figures which are disputed by the telecoms company. Last month the former taxman who struck the deal with Vodafone, Dave Hartnett, sparked fury by switching sides to work for the firms’ accountants. He was attacked over his lucrative contract with City giant Deloitte, which . he has accepted just ten months after retiring from his post as head of . HM Revenue and Customs. Experts . said the move raises serious questions about the ‘cosy’ relationship . between the Revenue and big companies accused of tax avoidance. Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons spending watchdog, said at the time: 'It is terrible when people’s individual greed means they lose . all sense of what’s right. ‘We always called the deals he reached sweetheart deals. Maybe now we understand why.’ Row: Dave Hartnett, the former head of HMRC who struck a deal with Vodafone, was condemned by Labour MP Margaret Hodge after accepting a job with Deloitte, which counts the mobile firm as a client . Today it emerged Vodafone's UK operating profits fell to . £294 million during the year from £402 million a year earlier amid . slumping voice and service revenues. Underlying earnings in the UK fell . to £1.2 billion from £1.3 billion during the year. The . company insisted it was committed to ‘integrity in all tax matters’, . adding it paid £882 million in other UK taxes and contributions during . the year. However, the tax revelation is likely . to add fuel to a debate about multinationals' tax contributions, which . has seen bosses from Google and Starbucks called before MPs to explain . their tax affairs. Vodafone also paid no UK corporation tax in its 2011-12 financial year. It joins energy firm, online giants Amazon and Google and coffee chain Starbucks in coming under fire for making millions in Britain while contributing little to the Treasury's coffers. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao saw his pay fall by 30 per cent to £11 million . Vodafine said the UK contributed just 2.5per cent to its overall profits. Vodafone's group operating profits were 3.7 per cent higher at just under £12 billion during the year, despite sales falling 4.2per cent to £44.4 billion - its first drop in annual revenues for seven years. In a new report on tax, published alongside its annual report, it said: ‘Individuals and companies have legal obligations to pay tax; but those obligations do not extend to paying more than the amount legally required.’ A spokesman said the company paid £300 million of interest during the year on loans to fund its £6 billion purchase of 3G (third-generation) spectrum or airwaves in 2000 - which it offset against last year's profits. It also recently paid the Government £802 million for 4G spectrum which it will use to launch superfast mobile internet, and is increasing UK network spending to more than £900 million this year to prepare for the launch. He added: ‘We believe the UK tax debate should be wider than just merely looking at corporation tax, because different industries make their - in our case significant - contributions in a variety of ways.’ Mr Colao's pay packet dropped from £15.8 million a year earlier, largely down to a fall in long-term share awards vesting during the year. These decreased to £7.5 million from £11.3 million a year earlier. His pay packet included a £1.1 million salary. Chief financial officer Andy Halford's total pay dropped 37per cent to £6.5 million as his long-term share incentives also plunged. The company also froze executives' basic pay during the year and said their salaries will not rise in its new financial year.","Mobile giant claims it contributes to UK in a 'variety of ways'

A second family with a child under the age of 12 has joined in the fight to change the organ transplant policies for children in the United States. Milagros Martinez, whose son Javier Acosta, 11, is suffering from cystic fibrosis and is in dire need of a lung transplant, has filed a suit urging public policymakers to change the rules for organ transplants. The Organ Transplant and Procurement Network's policy currently states that sick children under the age of 12 are automatically placed at the bottom of the transplant list, regardless of the severity of their disease. Javier Acosta, 11, pictured here, is suffering from cystic fibrosis and in need of a lung transplant. His mother filed a lawsuit to change the organ transplant policy in the U.S. to allow children equal placement on the adult transplant list . Martinez is asking the policy be changed so that children under 12 are placed on the list according to the severity of their condition. Currently children are placed at the bottom of the adult list and are eligible to receive children's organs, but those are rare to come by. According to Martinez's suit, 'The pool of lungs donated from adults is more than 50 times larger than the pool of lungs donated from children.' She hopes that adopting this new policy would give her son and children like him more of a fighting chance. 'Javier is severely ill and if he does not receive a donated set of lungs very soon he will die,' the lawsuit says. 'Without one he will most likely die before his 12th birthday in August.' Martinez's first son, Jovan, died at 11 from cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease, according to the suit, while waiting for a transplant. Martinez's suit comes after a similar cry for policy change from the family of Sarah Murnaghan, 10, who is also suffering from cystic fibrosis. The parents of Sarah Murnaghan, 10, (pictured here with their sick child) who is in need of a lung transplant, are urging policymakers to allow chidren to receive due consideration on the adult transplant list . The Murnaghan's efforts spurned a nation-wide debate over organ transplant policy, and even caused some lawmakers to call upon U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to intervene, NBC 10 Philadelphia reported. Stephen Harvey, the lawyer representing both family's whose children are waiting for a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC, 'We're seeking that the system allocate a lung to Javier based on the severity of his condition.' 'So if there's an adult who's more severe than him, that adult gets the lung. We're not asking to jump to the front of the line.' Harvey said that right now there are 16 children, ages 5 to 10, currently in need of lung transplants across the country who have all been allocated to the bottom of the waiting list. Though no policy changes have been seen yet, last week U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson ruled in favor of the two families, granting them a temporary court order until June 14 that prevents the children from being kept at the bottom of the transplant list. However, this is not a lasting solution, and the executive committee of the Organ Transplant Network is scheduled to meet on Monday to officially review that rules. Yet, not everyone is in favor of a policy change. Many critics of this policy shift cite a fear that adding young children to the transplant list will just push deserving older patients further down it, Reuters reported. Whatever the outcome of this national debate, one person who might not have time to wait to see it is 11-year old Javier. 'We're not trying to skip ahead of anyone,' his mother said during a press conference. 'We just want him to have a fighting chance.'","Two Philadelphia families with young children waiting for lung transplants are fighting to change the country's organ donor laws .

Two math-notebook pages recently authenticated as belonging to Abraham Lincoln suggest the 16th president, who was known to downplay his formal education, may have spent more time in school than usually thought. And the Illinois State University math professors behind the discovery say the work shows Lincoln was no slouch, either. Math professors Nerida Ellerton and Ken Clements said Friday at the university in Normal that they'd recently confirmed that the two pages were part of a previously known math notebook from Lincoln's childhood. It was found in the archives of Houghton Library at Harvard University, where it remains. It had long been thought that Lincoln, who was an avid-reader, was mainly self-educated as well. However it now appears the future President did attend classes for a time over a period of three to five years. Facts: Here is one of two pages from President Lincoln's math notebook believed to be the oldest surviving document written by Abraham Lincoln. The pages are from the 1820s . The book, known as a cyphering book in Lincoln's day, is a sort math workbook in which Lincoln wrote math problems and their answers. It's the oldest known Lincoln manuscript. Based on the difficulty of the problems involved and dates on some of the pages - 1824 and, on the recently authenticated pages, 1826, when Lincoln was 17 - Lincoln likely worked in the book intermittently over several calendar years while his family lived in Indiana, the married professors said. They think he could have started as early as the age of 10 and believe his work happened while he was in school. School days: The professors say the papers from the notebook show Lincoln may have attended school during parts of several years. That's more than usually believed . 'Most people say he went to school for anything between three months and nine months' over the course of his life, Clements said. 'We think he went to school (up to) two years.' And very little of the work is wrong, he added. 'He made very few errors, and he . always knew what he was trying to do,' Clements added. 'We've studied . thousands of these cyphering books. You don't always get the feeling . that `this guy knew what he was doing.' The . professors' find suggests Lincoln may have gone to school over as many . as three to five winters, according to historian Daniel Stowell, . director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project at the Abraham Lincoln . Presidential Library in Springfield. The library owns one previously . identified page of the book. 'They . are arguing with some merit that a cyphering book would have been . created in a school setting,' Stowell said. 'It does at least open the . possibility that he may have had more formal schooling than originally . thought. Not a whole lot more, but still more.' The . pages - attached as a single leaf - include word problems that are the . equivalent of roughly eighth-grade modern work, Clements said. 'If 100 dollars in one year gain 3 1/2 dollars interest, what sum will gain $38.50 cents in one year and a quarter?' one reads. Figures: Lincoln's stepmother gave the notebook to Lincoln law partner William Herndon after the 16th president's death . Lincoln Memorial: The President is remembered as one of America's greatest, leading the country through the American Civil War, abolishing slavery, strengthening the national government and modernizing the economy . Any student doing such work in the 1820s would have been more advanced than most on the frontier in Indiana, Clements said. 'If you got to that stage, you'd sort of done well,' he said. Lincoln is known to have later studied trigonometry and geometry on his own. The . newly authenticated pages have been in the Harvard library's archives . since 1954. They were known as Lincoln documents, but their origin . wasn't known, the professors said. The two looked at the documents as . they researched a book they've written on math books from the period. A . letter from former Lincoln law partner William Herndon from 1875 that . accompanied the papers, describing them, made the authentication . relatively straightforward, Clements said. Lincoln's . stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, gave the cyphering book to Herndon . after Lincoln's death, and Herndon then gave them to other people, . Stowell said.","Two new pages from the 1820s have been found to add to the math notebook believed to be the oldest surviving document written by Abraham Lincoln .

Warning: Mark Carney, who takes over from Sir Mervyn King in July, compared the UK with basket case countries in the eurozone in a brutal assessment of the economic outlook . Britain was last night branded a ‘crisis economy’ by incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The Canadian, who takes over from Sir Mervyn King in July, compared the UK with basket case countries in the eurozone in a brutal assessment of the economic outlook. Speaking on the fringes of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings in Washington, he said: ‘The US is breaking out of the pack of crisis economies that include the eurozone, the UK and Japan.’ It came after the IMF this week slashed its growth forecasts for the UK over the next two years and warned that George Osborne is ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with his programme of tax hikes and spending cuts. The IMF could now officially recommend that the Chancellor ditch his harsh austerity package – possibly as soon as next month – in what would be a humiliating setback for Mr Osborne. The IMF last year warned that Britain would have to slow its package of cuts if the economy did not pick up pace. Mr Carney’s use of the world ‘crisis’ will not have lifted Mr Osborne’s mood after Sir Mervyn recently stressed that only a ‘gentle recovery’ is under way. The new governor also made it clear that he and the Bank of England cannot be expected to solve the UK’s economic problems alone – another warning to Mr Osborne who has placed great faith in his skills. Mr Carney, who will be the highest paid central bank governor in the world with an annual income of £874,000, including a generous London housing allowance, indicated that he was prepared to take aggressive action to support the recovery when he takes over. But he added: ‘Can central banks provide sustainable growth? No. They can help with the transition, but they can’t deliver long term growth. The new governor also made it clear that he and the Bank of England (pictured) cannot be expected to solve the UK¿s economic problems alone . 'That needs to come through true fiscal adjustments and necessary structural reforms. Sustainable growth comes from the private sector.’ Mr Carney, the first foreigner to be put in charge of the Bank of England in its 319-year history, indicated he would interpret Britain’s inflation target of 2 per cent more flexibly – suggesting he would allow it to remain high for longer. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde also said that central banks around the world ‘cannot be the only game in town’ when it comes to restoring economies to health. She said governments must also tackle deficits and implement reforms ‘so there is a mix that allows central bankers to be relieved of the weight they carry on their shoulders’. Her comments on the state of the UK economy were more measured than those of IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, who said this week that Britain was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity. The IMF could officially recommend that George Osborne ditches his austerity package . Asked whether she agreed with Mr Blanchard, Mrs Lagarde said: ‘We have said that should growth abate then there should be consideration to adjusting by slowing the pace. ‘The growth numbers are certainly not particularly good. So, in a sense, this is a continuation of the position. What has changed is clearly the quality of the numbers.’ Although she did not go as far as Mr Blanchard and say that austerity should be ditched, her comments suggested that the IMF’s health-check on the UK economy next month will make grim reading for the Chancellor. Mrs Lagarde said that the inspection team, which is expected to be led by her American deputy David Lipton, would seek ‘to really go under the skin’ of the British economy. Under the terms of its membership of the IMF, Britain must undergo a thorough inspection each year known as an Article IV review. IMF experts  will crawl over all the UK’s accounts and ask hard questions of officials at the Treasury, the Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility and other bodies. The inspection usually takes up to a month, followed by a press conference when the IMF’s advice is issued. Any formal recommendation from the IMF that a change of course is required will be seized upon by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who has long argued for a Plan B. Mrs Lagarde added: ‘I would not, and  I don’t think anybody in this institution would want to pre-judge ahead of Article IV because we spend three four weeks, discussing, debating, understanding trying to get under the skin of each economy and we will for that.’","Mark Carney compared the UK to basket case countries in the eurozone .

Richard Ramirez, who spent 24 years in prison after a spree of demonic murders in California, died Friday, but not before turning a shocking shade of green. The serial killer, who left satanic signs at murder scenes and mutilated victims' bodies during a reign of terror in the 1980s, died reportedly after 'sitting up in his bed doing stretches' just the day before at Marin County Hospital. Ramirez, 53, had been taken from San Quentin's death row to a hospital where authorities said he died of liver failure.

The source said the self-proclaimed Satanist exhibited the ghastly-hued skin Thursday and was up and moving around his hospital bed. 'He was the color green,' said the Post's source. 'He looked like a green highlighter pen.' He had been housed on death row for . decades and was awaiting execution, even though it has been years since . anyone has been put to death in California. He was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders, five . attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries, which . terrorized Southern California in 1984 and 1985. His charges included . rape, sodomy and oral copulation. Though he died of liver failure, the exact cause of the ailment has not been released due to federal patient privacy laws. At his first court appearance, Ramirez raised a hand with a pentagram drawn on it and yelled, 'Hail, Satan.' Ramirez (pictured left, 2007, and right, in 1984) was convicted . of 13 murders that terrorized Southern California in the 1980s, and . was sentenced to death .

Ramirez was finally run down and . beaten in 1985 by residents of an East Los Angeles neighborhood while . attempting a carjacking. They recognized him because his picture had . appeared that day in the news media. The trial of Ramirez took a year, but . the entire case which was bogged down in pretrial motions and appeals . lasted four years, one of the longest criminal cases in U.S. history. Because of the notoriety of the case, more than 1600 prospective jurors were called. After his conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered 'devil sign' to photographers and muttered a single word: 'Evil.'

The Wright Brothers face being written out of history after the Connecticut Senate passed a bill on Wednesday naming a German immigrant as the first man to fly. Gustave Weisskopf emigrated to America and changed his name to Whitehead, there is growing support for the long-disputed claim that he beat the Wright brothers by a good two years. Earlier this year aviation bible ‘Jane's All The World's Aircraft’ stated in its 100th anniversary edition that Whitehead was actually the first man to successfully fly after build his 'Condor' plane in August 1901. Gustave Whitehead next to his Condor No.21 aircraft. This photo was taken in 1901, the year Whitehead is said to have flown his 'flying car' model for a mile and a half at 50 feet above the ground . History rewritten: Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright on the Wright Flyer I in 1910. The Wright Brothers were said to have been the first people to successfully fly a plane in December 1903. The state’s bill, which could be passed into law as early as next week, would name Whitehead as the original aviation pioneer. 'We were surprised. Pleasantly surprised,' Whitehead's great-grandson Curtis Mitchell told the Daily News. Jane's All The World's Aircraft claimed earlier this year that after studying evidence put forward by aviation expert John Brown in support of Whitehead: ' [Whitehead's flight], it must be stressed, was more than two years before the Wrights manhandled their Flyer from its shed and flew a couple of hundred feet in a straight line. 'Thanks to the meticulous researches of John Brown - to whose website we recommend readers seeking greater detail - an injustice is rectified with only slight bruising to Wilbur and Orville's reputation. 'The Wrights were right; but Whitehead was ahead.' Although reports have both supported, and denied Whitehead's achievement since 1901, the claims in Jane's journal was the first time it has been officially recognized by such a widely-respected aviation body. Whitehead designed an aircraft in the . early 1900s that could be driven like a car, but was fitted with wings . that could be unfolded, turning the car into a plane. Whitehead then built his Condor aircraft, also known as No.21, based on this flying car model. The aircraft had two . engines; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle, and a 10 . horsepower engine used for driving. The idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle. Condor was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected. Reports in the Bridgeport Herald in . August 1901 claim Whitehead drove the Condor to a a field outside . Connecticut in the US, unfolded the wings and made two demonstration . flights. During the second flight, Whitehead is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet. Further reports claim he updated the . model, called No.22, and made another demonstration flight on 22 January . 1902 in front of 17 witnesses. Gustave Whitehead emigrated to the States from Bavaria in the 1890s. He designed a 'roadable aircraft' that was small enough to fit in a garage like a car. Whitehead envisaged owners being able to drive the car to a field, or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane.

Claims that Whitehead beat the Wright Brothers to the record first emerged in 1937. Orville Wright is said to have called the story a hoax and chief aviation historian at the Smithsonian Institute, Tom Crouch, rejects the claims. Writing in a blog for the National Air and Space Museum, Crouch said that Whitehead contradicted himself when giving evidence of his flight: 'Over the next decade, as aviators in America and Europe took to the sky following the pattern established by the Wright brothers, Whitehead would continue to built aircraft for other enthusiasts. Not one of those powered machines ever left the ground.'

A two-year-old girl nearly died from cancer after doctors repeatedly insisted she just had a cold, her parents have claimed. Danny and Zoe Stanton took little Sofia to their GP's surgery when the normally active girl started to wheeze and struggle for breath in February this year, but were told she had a cold or chest infection. They took their daughter back to the same doctor four times within four weeks but every time were sent away from Vine Medical Centre in Maidstone, Kent, with nothing more than antibiotics. Cancer: Parents Zoe and Danny Stanton took daughter Sofia, two, (pictured left with sister Ava, five, right) to their GP four times but were told each time she had a cold or chest infection . When Sofia developed a lump on her neck in March the concerned parents phoned the surgery and spoke to another GP who said the lump was not serious. But the lump grew bigger and when Sofia's left side shrank and turned blue at a family party the couple rushed Sofia to Tunbridge Wells Hospital. A chest X-ray showed there was something seriously wrong with the toddler and doctors suspected she had a collapsed lung. But when Sofia was transferred to St George's Hospital in London, where she spent two weeks in intensive care, she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Sofia was then transferred to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London where doctors told the devastated couple that her lymph nodes in her neck were so inflamed that her wind pipe had been pushed an inch to the side - constricting her breathing. Chemotherapy: After two weeks in intensive care Sofia is back home but faces another two-and-a-half years of cancer treatment . The couple, from Maidstone, Kent, who also have another daughter Ava, five, are considering taking legal action against the GP practice, but for now are concentrating on Sofia's care. Surveyor father Danny, 33, said: 'As parents you know your children really well so my wife and I noticed when Sofia was not herself. 'Sofia is a really active and cheeky child and was walking from about eight months so when she refused to walk up the stairs like she normally would we knew she was not well. 'But we are not medical experts so we had no idea what was wrong with her. She was wheezing and struggling to breathe so at first we thought she might have a chest infection. 'But after the same doctor saw us at the doctors four times in about four weeks you would expect to be sent for an X-ray. 'The GP should have sent Sofia for further tests to be on the safe side. We feel frustrated that they did not take her condition more seriously. 'When Sofia developed this lump on her neck and my wife rang the doctors they just said 'if it is not purple and pulsating then is nothing serious.' 'You have to believe the doctors, they are the experts.' Danny battled and beat skin cancer himself after being diagnosed the day before Sofia was born. He added: 'Nothing can really prepare you for being told your child has cancer. But at least now we know what is wrong with Sofia and we can concentrate on getting her better.' Zoe, 31, who works part time for a surveyors, said: 'We had no idea how serious it was. We were reassured that everything would be fine. 'I'd never want another parent to go through this.' Sofia, who is now back home, will have to undergo treatment - including chemotherapy - for two and a half years.

The NHS faces financial ruin and is no longer sustainable in its current form, doctors, managers and patients have warned. Hospitals may have to be closed and major changes to the way the health service is run should be brought in to help pull it back from the brink of collapse. The Academy of Royal Colleges, the NHS Confederation and patient group National Voices have urged politicians to 'show more courage' in dealing with the NHS's multi-billion pound deficit, The Times said. Radical plans: An alliance of doctors, managers and patients has warned that hospitals must be closed as part of a series of reforms to save the NHS from financial collapse (file picture) The alliance has set out a series of recommendations to rescue the crisis-hit service, including a major transfer of services away from hospitals and into the community, an increase in the number of GP surgeries and health centres and greater investment in district nursing and social care. Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said the NHS would otherwise 'descend into a vicious spiral of poorly planned, reactive responses resulting in unsustainable demand'. But he warned that the revolution needed would be 'like changing the engine while the car is still running'. He said: 'We simply cannot continue as we are at the moment. The problems in A&E will get worse and waiting lists for treatment will get longer. 'Emergency work has to take priority over planned work, which earns more income for hospitals. So more hospitals will find themselves in financial difficulty.' Financial black hole: The alliance warns that rising waiting times in A&E mean hospitals will have to focus on emergency care rather than planned procedures, which earn more income . Mr Farrar warned that the NHS in England was likely to be underfunded to the tune of £54bn by 2022. He referred to a report from the Royal College of Nursing, which suggested that up to 6,000 beds - the equivalent of 20 hospitals - could be lost in an effort to make the NHS sustainable. He said the proposed restructuring would mean fewer hospitals but more specialists on regular duty, improving the quality of care. 'Communities do feel strongly about their hospitals,' he said. 'But they also feel a strong bond with their GP surgeries, and people love district nurses. What I am not saying is that care will disappear from the community. 'Most people would agree if I said I could spend some of this money to help you to live independently in your own home for longer. It is up to all of us to make the case.' Warning: Mike Farrar, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said the NHS will 'descend into a vicious spiral of poorly planned, reactive responses resulting in unsustainable demand' He added: 'It is really important that politicians take stewardship of £110bn of taxpayers' money every year. But we are asking for politicians to show more courage.' Jeremy Taylor, chief executive of National Voices, said: 'Patients are not best served by the current pattern of services. For the safest, highest quality care, hospitals need to be organised differently and more services are needed closer to people's homes. 'But the changes needed are often highly controversial. The NHS has often failed to make a good case; to involve patients and communities in ways that would build trust and to follow through to ensure that the new pattern of services is better than the old. 'And the public are rightly suspicious of closures and downgrades that seem to be more to do with money than quality of care.'","Service no longer sustainable in its current form, says health alliance .

A father-of-seven is dedicating his life to showing his children as much of the world as possible - because a rare disease means they could all go blind. Jimmy Appleton’s children, Samuel, 20, Pheonix, 17, Flynn, eight, Willow, seven, Quinn, five, Eli, three, and Jim-Bob, ten-months, all carry the genetic mutation for Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. The condition, which has already caused Samuel to lose his sight, destroys the cells in the optic nerve causing blindness, usually at around the age of 21. Jimmy and Sherie Appleton's seven children all carry Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy which means they could go blind. L to R: Samuel, 20, Willow, 7, Jimmy, 39, Flynn, 8, Sherie, 37, Jim-Bob, 10-months, Quinn, 5, Pheonix, 20 and Eli, 3 . All seven children inherited the genetic condition from their mother, Sherie, 37, who carries it, the Daily Mirror reports.  She too could go blind in later life as female carriers tend to be afflicted later than male ones. However, some may be spared as the incurable condition only causes blindness in half of male carriers and three in 20 female carriers. Mr Appleton, a builder from Tadley, Hampshire, told the newspaper: ‘We want the kids to do and see as much as they can. Museums, day trips, beach holidays. Any spark of interest is followed up – music lessons, beavers, scouts. ‘For the young kids it’s all about appreciating their sight and getting out and doing it while they can. Every day is a blessing.’ He went on to explain that he tries to give his children every experience they want which means that he is unable to save for the future. Samuel was a carpenter until he lost his sight last autumn but he has retrained as a masseuse and set up a company called Blind Sensations – his father hopes that his other children will be similarly successful if they do go blind. The children inherited the condition from their mother, Sherie (pictured with husband Jimmy). In some carriers the condition causes the cells of the optic nerve to be destroyed causing blindness . Mr Appleton, 39, says that he now faces a lifetime of watching his children to see if they will lose their sight. The family only found out that they carried the disease when Sam fell ill last year. It was initially believed that he was suffering from cancer but he was diagnosed with Leber’s in August 2012, just weeks before he went blind. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is an inherited genetic mutation. Occasionally, it can occur as a spontaneous mutation in someone with out a family history of the condition. It can only be passed on by women and it causes degeneration of cells in the eye in some carriers. In the UK, the mutation is present in 12 people per 100,000 and symptoms occur in three people per 100,000. Half of men who carry the condition lose their sight, compared to 15 per cent of women carriers. Blindness usually develops when carriers are in their 20s, but can appear later in women. The first symptoms tend to be blurring of the central vision and desaturation of colour in both eyes. Most sufferers develop severe sight problems within a few months of the first symptoms appearing.","Jimmy Appleton's children all carry Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy .

A miracle baby has been born despite her mother suffering from kidney failure which should have made her infertile. Ava Anslow’s mother, Grace, fell pregnant while she was being treated for end-stage kidney failure. The condition meant she should not have been able to conceive and, left unchecked, could have killed her within six weeks. Grace Anslow, 19, became pregnant with Ava while she was being treated for end-stage kidney failure which would have killed her within weeks without treatment . The 19-year-old was told to end her pregnancy or risk dying along with her child - but she refused. The story had a happy ending when Ava was born, weighing a healthy 6lbs 7oz, in April. ‘She's my little miracle,’ said single mother Grace, a former hotel worker from Birmingham. ‘When I look at her I can hardly believe what we have both been through. ‘I was advised to terminate her because doctors thought there was a chance the pregnancy would kill me because of the risk of pre-eclampsia. ‘And, if I survived, there was a high chance she would be born very premature for the same reason. That, too, may have led to complications with her health and she may not have survived. Doctors advised Grace to have Ava aborted because they feared that the pregnancy could kill her. Pregnant women with kidney problems have a high rate of the potentially fatal complication pre-eclampsia . ‘When I told the consultants I was pregnant, they said it was very unexpected. ‘People told me: “Don't give your baby a nickname and don't get attached” as not many people have got pregnant while in my condition.’ Forced to choose between risking her own life and giving her unborn child a chance of survival, Grace said there was only one decision she could make. ‘It was all really upsetting and I was very depressed about it all,’ she said. ‘I had to think long and hard about what to do. Eventually, I picked myself up and decided to go ahead with the pregnancy. ‘I thought it would be the best thing that had ever happened in my life if it worked out. ‘The baby would give me a reason to live.’ Grace discovered she had kidney problem just two months before she found herself pregnant. Grace decided to continue with the pregnancy and Ava was born weighing a healthy 6lbs 7oz, in April. She is believed to be entirely healthy despite her precarious start in life . She had ignored small bruises all over her legs for two months, thinking they were the result of an allergic reaction. She finally decided to see her GP last July - and blood test results revealed her life was in serious danger. ‘The doctor called me in and told me . to go straight to City Hospital as he thought it was something to do . with my kidneys,’ Grace said. ‘It was a big shock. I thought I was going to die and it was very scary.’ But the diagnosis started to make sense. Grace explained: ‘I have been really pale and tired throughout my life and I used to sleep a lot. ‘But lately I had become a bit more tired and dizzy at times. Grace was diagnosed with kidney failure after developing bruises all over her legs. She had previously experienced tiredness and was very pale but had not realised that she was seriously ill . ‘I thought it was just me feeling lazy. I didn't really know anything different. But the bruises were strange and that was the reason I went to the doctors.’ Grace was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston and, there, was told about her condition. ‘I was told there was a really big build-up of toxic waste in my body and I would have died had I left it six weeks.’ She was put on dialysis and the transplant list. Grace said: ‘I had to leave my job as it was tiring. I would go to dialysis at the hospital and try to live my life. I discovered I was expecting in September. ‘I had the shock of my life as I thought, with my condition, I couldn't conceive. The doctors at the QE were pretty shocked, too.’ Throughout the pregnancy, Grace had to have dialysis for four hours, six days a week. It is believed that it was this strict dialysis regime that saved her and Ava . Grace was put on a new dialysis regime, having treatment six days a week instead of the normal three, which was thought to have helped Ava's safe arrival. ‘Every week I went for a scan and each time I was told she was developing nicely,’ she said. ‘That changed to every two weeks and again, the scans was positive. Each time I went along my heart was in my mouth. I was worried sick, wondering whether she would be OK. ‘I didn't want to get my hopes up. It was a week-by-week thing and there was a chance I could have miscarried at any point.’ But, slowly, Grace - who is still undergoing dialysis - began to experience the milestones every mum-to-be dreams of. ‘I started to feel her moving inside me and it was lovely when I felt her first kick,’ she said. ‘But I was terrified the whole way through.’ Because the pregnancy was so high-risk, Grace had to have a scan every week until it was confirmed that Ava was developing normally . Finally, on April 17, just a fortnight before her due date, Ava was delivered by caesarean section and declared a healthy baby. ‘When I held her in my arms it was the best thing ever,’ Grace said. ‘And to know there was nothing wrong was even better. ‘They told me she was perfectly healthy.’ The doctor who led Grace's treatment said it was ‘remarkable’ that she fell pregnant while so ill. Dr Clara Day, kidney consultant at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: ‘There is a very high rate of pre-eclampsia in kidney disease patients, which will often lead to premature birth. ‘If pre-eclampsia is particularly bad, the mother can die. The risks for Grace were very high and we were up front with her about that. ‘We want people to know how much she has been through and highlight the dedication of the nursing team. ‘Grace had to dialyse six days a week for four hours. It was an intense programme which gave her baby the best chance possible. ‘She also had the best antenatal care at Birmingham Women's Hospital. I am delighted with the outcome.’","Grace Anslow, 19, conceived Ava during treatment for kidney failure .

Giving evidence at her trial, Nicole Minetti, a former dental hygienist who was propelled into politics by Berlusconi, said she had felt ‘true love’ for the 76-year-old billionaire. Minetti, 28, who grew up in Rimini, Italy, with an English dance instructor mother, denies acting as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier's alleged sex parties. On trial: Nicole Minetti (right), a former dental hygienist and Lombardy councillor, has admitted for the first time that she was in a relationship with Silvio Berlusconi (left) The former Lombardy councillor said was 'fascinated ' by the former premier when she got to know him when he was having dental treatment done in 2008. She told the court: ‘He began to court me discreetly and I don’t deny being fascinated by him. 'We became friends, which turned into a loving relationship, which ended at the end of that year.’ She added: ‘My feelings for the prime minister were true love.’ 'Exclusive relationship': Former Lombardy Regional Councillor Nicole Minetti, pictured during Milan Fashion Week last year, claims that her feelings towards Mr Berlusconi were 'true love' For her, she said, it had been ‘an exclusive relationship’. Berlusconi is separately on trial, accused of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, and using his position to cover up their relationship. In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below the age of 18 for sex is seen as underage prostitution and punishable by a jail term. The media magnate who faces a possible six-year sentence in that trial, has been in a relationship with 28 year old party activist Francesca Pascale, since he re-entered politics to take second place in elections in February. He is now back in government as part of a coalition. Minetti is one of three accused of pimping for Berlusconi including former TV anchor Emilio Fede and bankrupt talent scout Lele Mora. The prosecution has requested seven-year jail terms for the three. A verdict in both Minetti's and Berlusconi's trials are expected next month.

A 91-year-old woman was left lying in her home for two days after she suffered a stroke while on the phone to an out-of-hours GP service who failed to help her. Elizabeth Youle, 91, known as Betty, collapsed while on the phone to an out-of-hours medic about a cut on her leg. She had called the service after cutting her leg on a thorn while gardening but suffered the stroke while talking to the representative of an out-of-hours firm. Betty Youle (pictured, right, before her stroke with niece Christine) was left lying in her home for two days after she suffered a stroke while speaking to an out-of-hours medic on the phone . A member of staff from the not-for-profit Nottingham Emergency Medical Services (NEMS) Community Benefit Services Ltd visited her home in Woolaton, Nottingham, but left after Ms Youle failed to answer the door. The elderly lady was unable to shout for help as a result of the stroke and was left lying on the floor of her home for two days before relatives raised the alarm. Police managed to gain access to her home through an unlocked back door and an ambulance rushed her to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. The stroke left the retired French teacher unable to swallow and she had to be fed via a tube in hospital following the incident in June 2011. After being moved to City Hospital, . in Nottingham, she stayed for three months and underwent physiotherapy . after she recovered from pneumonia, and eventually she recovered her speech. Ms Youle's family have now launched legal action against the out-of-hours service. Her niece, Christine Youle said: . 'Unfortunately the representative from the out-of-hours service did not . attempt to call the police or investigate the back of the property. 'If he had done this, he would have discovered that the back door was open and quickly realised that something was wrong. Ms Youle (pictured in May this year after her stoke) was left unable to speak and needed to be tube-fed immediately after her stroke. Her family are now taking legal action against Nottingham Emergency Medical Services . 'This could have made a significant difference to Betty who was lying paralysed due to the effects of the stroke and could not call for help. 'Unfortunately Betty lost a lot of vital time when she first suffered the stroke and the subsequent pneumonia also delayed how much the hospital team could do to help her recovery.

Ms Youle, who had lived independently in her home for 50 years before the stroke, now needs round-the-clock care and lives in a nursing home in Bournemouth. Her left side is completely paralysed and she has not been able to walk or stand since the stroke. She has been bed-bound since November 2012. A spokesman for NEMS said: 'This is a sad and difficult case for all those involved and we take this matter very seriously. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further whilst the claim is ongoing.' Sarah Stanton of Moore Blatch Resolve and the solicitor representing Mrs Youle's, said: 'The elderly can be an incredibly vulnerable group when trying to access out-of-hours medical care.

Members of the Philadelphia Orchestra found themselves stuck on the tarmac for three hours while they waited for their flight from Beijing to Macau. So four of them decided to treat their fellow-passengers to a movement from a string quartet by Dvorak. Scroll down for video . No strings attached: The quartet offered fellow-passengers 'a musical surprise' to raise their spirits after they had been stuck for hours on the tarmac . In an announcement to the rest of the passengers on a plane, a spokeswoman for the orchestra said: 'The Philadelphia Orchestra is on tour in China and on the way to Macau and our musicians would like to offer you a musical surprise.' The four then gave a rendition of the finale of Dvorak's American Quartet as their audience stood up and filmed them on phones and tablets. Despite the cramped conditions, and half way through, one passenger's phone ringing, the four raced through the movement's energetic phrases flawlessly. First class entertainment: The four played to a sea of mobile phones, one of which went off midway through the performance . Fellow-passengers held the music for them in the absence of music stands. At one point the cameraman rotated the device the four were being filmed on, and the picture did not auto correct.

She said her husband of 13 years was stunned by her transformation. Dropped multiple dresses sizes: Deborah Poxton is now a size 8-10, right, from a size 26 after losing 7st . She said: 'He couldn't believe it. He came in the door and said: ""Wow, where's my wife gone!?"" 'When we went to a party recently, one of our friends even asked Mark who his new girlfriend was. He assumed Mark had left me for another woman when he saw me, because he thought I was a different person.' The mother-of-six had piled on weight since having her first child more than 20 years ago, and gradually ballooned to 17st 5lb. Shadow of her former self: Friends didn't recognise the slimmer Deborah, right . At her heaviest: The mother-of-six's weight ballooned to more than 17st after she had her children . Deborah said she put on more weight each time she had a child and after her first husband died of cancer in 1999. 'My weight had gradually got bigger, and rather than do something about it I would just buy bigger trousers,' she said. 'I would avoid cameras, and my self-esteem was rock bottom. But rather than do a healthy diet, I would just starve myself for a few days. After that I was back to old bad habits. 'I would go round the supermarket and get a large six-pack of cream-cakes from the bakery thinking it would be a nice treat for the family. 'But by the time everyone was home in the evening there would be none left because I had eaten them all. I had no control back then.'

I thought, ""That's not me!"", and knew I had to do something about it,' she explained. Deborah joined Weight Watchers and when Mark went away on tour with the Army, she became determined to stick to their diet plan. 'I became more or less obsessed with my diet, and really started to enjoy it,' she said. 'When Mark went away in March 2012, I was about 15 stone. But by then my diet became everything to me, and was a happy distraction to Mark being away. It gave me a focus.' Success: Deborah has reached her target of losing 100lbs . Under the Weight Watchers regime, she ate three meals a day, cut down portion sizes and stuck to low-fat snacks. She also started to get more exercise after she bought a dog and took him for regular 12-mile walks. By the time Mark returned Deborah had dropped seven stone and was a size 8-10. 'When Mark came back it was really supportive and loved how I looked, which felt great. 'I am a much happier person and now have a spring in my step, which is great for the whole family,' she said. She reached her final goal of surpassing 100lbs weight loss last weekend. She said: 'I still have treats, I'm a chocoholic, but now it's everything in moderation. I never believed I could do it.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 9 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:26 EST, 10 June 2013 . The £1,500 no-risk stake in RBS and Lloyds would be the biggest privatisation ever seen in Britain . Up to 48 million taxpayers could be offered a £1,500 no-risk stake in RBS and Lloyds in the biggest ever privatisation ever seen in Britain. A blueprint published today suggests that up to £34billion of the government’s £48billion of shares in RBS and Lloyds would end up in the hands of individual voters. Every British resident over the age of 18 who has a National Insurance number and is registered on the electoral roll could apply for a share. The scheme has been devised by centre-Right think tank Policy Exchange and is understood to be being studied closely in the Treasury. An announcement of plans for a share giveaway could come in Chancellor George Osborne’s speech to London’s Mansion House in ten days’ time. Today’s report suggests that every taxpayer should be eligible to apply to be handed a ‘free’ stake in the two banks, which were part-nationalised by Gordon Brown in the banking crash of 2008 and 2009. They would keep the profits when the shares were sold. An alternative plan is for people to be able to buy shares at a discount. Senior Tories believe the move will be a moment of huge political significance as it will be billed ‘payback time’ from the banking sector, as well as creating a new generation of shareowners. One described it privately as ‘electoral catnip’. Mr Osborne is said to believe a privatisation with discounted or given-away shares could rekindle the excitement of the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign, in which five million people bought shares in British Gas -- a move which is credited with helping the Tories win the 1987 general election. A senior Treasury source confirmed the Policy Exchange proposal was ‘one interesting idea among many’, though he insisted no decisions had been taken. Today’s report, written by James Barty, former head of global equity strategy at Deutsche Bank, examines all the options available to the government and concludes that a distribution of shares in both RBS and LLoyds to taxpayers be repaid on sale, combined with a separate sale to institutional investors, is the best solution. It would mean 50 to 55 per cent of shares in RBS and 30 per cent of shares in Lloyds being distributed to taxpayers who are able to apply for them at no initial cost. They would only be paid for at the time of sale. For taxpayers, this could mean between £1,100 and £1,650 worth of shares being allocated depending on the number of applicants. The report estimates that between 20 and 30 million would apply, meaning a likely stake of around £1,500. A . floor price would be established at the original level the shares are . sold.If the share price falls under the floor, no-one would be expected . to want to sell since they would not profit at all. 30 per cent of shares in Lloyds would be distributed to taxpayers who are able to apply for them at no initial cost . One senior Tory described the move as 'electoral catnip'. It is said that the plan would be billed as 'payback time' from the banking sector . Instead, taxpayers would take the profits from any rise in the share price above the floor price but would not lose any money if the share price dropped below the floor price. If the share price never exceeds the floor price, the shares would be returned to government ownership after ten years. This gives taxpayers confidence in taking on shares as there is no downside or upfront cost. The shares would be held in a nominee account. Individuals can then transfer their shareholding into a personal account should they wish, providing they have paid the government the floor price. At the same time of the mass distribution, 25 per cent of shares in RBS and the remainding shares in Lloyds would be sold to institutional and retail investors. The Treasury could raise approximately £17-18 billion through institutional and retail sales alone. The Treasury is considering the plan. George Osborne is said to believe a privatisation of this kind would excite the electorate . The report says that by offering a large portion of its shareholding to taxpayers in this way, the government would be able to move much if not all of the banks into private ownership in one go, at a better price than through a traditional sale, while at the same time giving the taxpayer the bulk of the upside. It identified flaws in other options to privatise the banks before the general election in 2015, saying there was not enough time for a stage sale to institutional investors and the shares would have to be sold at a discount. A simple shares giveaway would increase the national debt by £50 billion and wad therefore a ‘non-starter’. ‘Any privatisation has to be done in a way that will strengthen the banks and allows them to compete on a fully commercial basis when back in private hands,’ Mr Barry said. ‘In our view that means finding a solution that moves the banks quickly from the public to the private sector, while at the same time generating a stable share price and an opportunity for the banks to raise capital. It is also key that the taxpayer still benefits from any further rise in the share price. ‘A distribution to taxpayers with the government to be repaid on sale, combined with an institutional and retail placing, is the only option that allows almost all the government’s stake in the banks to be sold ahead of a 2015 election. It also offers the most stable share price as distributed shares would not be sold below the price to be repaid to the government. This proposal will create a whole new generation of shareholders. We urge the Chancellor to take on the doubters and move ahead with this scheme.’ Labour had indicated it would fight a full-scale shares giveaway. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls declared last month that he would oppose the coalition’s moves to divest itself of the shares currently held by the government if it would adversely affect Britain’s deficit. ‘A giveaway or a loss-making firesale at the current share price would add billions to the national debt at a time when poor economic growth already means borrowing isn’t coming down,’ he said. The Treasury source added: ‘We genuinely don’t have some secret plan for bank share sales and are not in any mad rush.’ The two banks have both said they expect to be ready to return to the private sector in 2014.","All over 18s could apply, as long as they have National Insurance number and are registered to vote .

They are the tears of a desperate father, fighting to keep his condemned son alive. Solomon Davis had just given a heartbreaking plea to a board which has the power to help prevent his death row inmate son from being executed in less than three weeks. Brian Darrell Davis, 39, raped and murdered his girlfriend's mother in 2001. But with his execution date set for June 25, Davis - with the support of his devoted parents - has asked for clemency from The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. As these pictures show, the emotion became to much for his father, who broke down in tears following his appeal to the five-member board. The killer's mother, Yvonne, also begged for the life of her son. Despite his reputation as a murderer, she showed the board pictures of her son as a baby, being cradled in the arms of his loving father. The appeal appears to have worked. Yesterday, the board voted 4-1 to grant clemency to Davis. It voted to recommend that the death sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. The recommendation will now go to the Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin for approval or rejection. Davis was convicted of rape and first-degree murder in the November 2001 death of 52-year-old Jody Sanford.

Westminster could lose its status as a world heritage site because London's latest skyscrapers are set to ruin the view. Unesco has been asked by advisors to consider putting the area on its endangered list when its world heritage committee gathers for its annual meeting next week in Cambodia. Inclusion on the endangered list is the first step towards a place being delisted, which would be highly embarrassing for the UK if it were seen to be neglecting the care of one of its cultural treasures. Westminster could be placed on the endangered list for world heritage sites if towering developments south of the Thames go ahead, according to Unesco . The development of two glass towers, one hitting 400ft, at Elizabeth House at Waterloo has been singled out for criticism by Unesco, who say it ruins the backdrop of the view from Westminster (artist's impression) The United Kingdom has 28 Unesco-listed world heritage sites, chosen for their outstanding significance for culture or the natural world. There are only 962 such sites in the world. The Westminster site includes the Palace of Westminster, home to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Saint Margaret's Church - the parish church of the Commons. Unesco is concerned about building projects at Waterloo, Nine Elms, Elephant and Castle and Vauxhall in south London ruining the backdrop of the view of Westminster. The 400ft and 29-storey North tower of the Elizabeth House development across Waterloo Bridge have been singled out for particular criticism by Unesco, with the 173ft South tower standing ten storeys high. 'In some views, part of the development would appear to be visually attached to the north face of the Queen Elizabeth Tower (formerly known as St Stephen’s Tower, which houses Big Ben),' says Unesco in its agenda for next week's meeting. It repeats concerns from 2006 and 2011 over the lack of a 'buffer zone' preventing building work around the area. English Heritage has warned that the development would ruin 'views from the Westminster World Heritage Site and . the proposal would intrude heavily on views of Big Ben, one of London's . most easily identifiable and much-loved landmarks and a Grade I listed . building'. Westminster Abbey, where British monarchs are crowned, is part of the world heritage site . The 15th century Saint Margaret's Church, known as the 'parish church of the Commons', is also part of the under-threat site . Unesco also criticises the Government for not doing enough when it comes to rules and policy to make sure new developments do not ruin the sites. The meeting agenda recommends that the . committee 'consider placing the property on the List of World Heritage . in Danger in 2014, should the foreseen development projects be approved . as currently planned'. Earlier this year, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected calls to force work at Elizabeth House to be stopped. Two years ago the committee considered . putting the Tower of London on the endangered list because its 'visual . integrity' was at risk from new buildings in the area. It asked the .

A binman has spoken of his shock after a giant pothole opened up on the road in front of him and swallowed his entire rubbish truck. Marian Popescu was lucky to escape unhurt after his truck fell into the 12 ft hole when the tarmac collapsed underneath him. But he still had to be winched to safety by rescuers after he was trapped in the hole for two hours in Craiova, Romania. Disappeared: A Romanian binman has spoken of his shock after his entire rubbish truck was swallowed up by a giant sinkhole which appeared in the road . He said: One minute I was fine, the next I was falling into the earth. 'There was a loud crack and I thought I'd hit something. 'But the road just fell away underneath me and everything went black. Although Romania has escaped the worst of the flooding that has hit large parts of central Europe this week, the road's collapse has been blamed on weeks of torrential rain. Engineers say that the hole opened up because the ground under the tarmac had been washed away by powerful underground floods. Giant pothole The bin lorry crash happened in the Romanian city of Craiova, pictured . Craiova is not the first city to be ht by problem potholes opening up in roads. Huge sinkholes began appearing all over Samara in south east Russia earlier this year swallowing cars, buses and claiming at least one life.

Britons are too busy to eat with the average adult finishing all three meals in under half-an-hour, a survey has found. Most people only spend six minutes on breakfast, eight on lunch and a shocking nine minutes having dinner, making a total of just 23 minutes for all three meals. More than half rush through their meals in a matter of minutes to 'get on with other things' such as meetings, commuting or looking after children. A fifth never even sit down at a table to eat and one third eat so fast they 'barely even notice the taste of the food'. Kristina Locke, founder of Conscious Food which commissioned the study, said: ‘We are constantly surprised by the lack of time and importance that people dedicate to eating. ‘Eighty per cent of those polled understood that they should spend at least 20 minutes eating each meal but our research indicates that they are in fact eating all three meals in a third of this time. ‘This only serves to highlight the need to address these issues and educate people on the importance of eating slowly and chewing food properly. ‘Our lives have become increasingly hectic and it's clear that people are prioritising work and other commitments over taking time to sit down and eat meals. ‘In truth, most British adults are grabbing food on the run, eating it quickly and as such aren't giving themselves the time to chew and digest their food. 'This common pattern results in an increase of people suffering with digestive issues which are easily preventable.’ Rush hour: The recommended time for each meal is 20 minutes, but a majority of UK adults do not even manage half of that for any food . Work takes precedence for many UK adults, with a quarter skipping meals or preferring lunch at their desk. Another one in five skips breakfast or eats it on the go in order to get to work early, and 16 per cent will either miss a meal or carry it with them on public transport. Because of this, 33 per cent of people will eat one or more meal a day on the run, while 42 per cent think nothing of eating two of more meals at the desk. Our hectic lifestyle has also had an impact on the traditional family dinner, with . 15 per cent admitting they will squeeze meals in wherever they can . between picking the children up from school and ferrying them to and . from clubs. The study found the typical adult plans just three meals out of 28 in advance each week. Tradition lost: With the average adult spending only nine minutes eating dinner, family meals are becoming a rare occasion in many British homes . This may be one of the reasons why nearly one fifth frequently skip meals altogether because they have not had time to prepare anything. Researchers found leading a busy lifestyle and rushing meals can have negative health consequences for many. A staggering 73 per cent of people polled suffer from digestive issues, with four in 10 people admitting this might be a direct result of eating too quickly. And 44 per cent of people are prepared to cut out food groups altogether to alleviate their problems, rather than simply slowing down and enjoying their food. Ms Locke added: ‘The time we spend eating and chewing our food is incredibly important to our digestive health. ‘Sixty-five per cent of people think that each mouthful needs to be chewed ten times or less when in reality it should be between 20-30 times for improved digestion.'","Britons eat in a hurry to 'get on with other things', survey finds .

David Dickinson has quit as vicar of The Holy Trinity Parish Church in Hoghton, Lancashire, after parishioners disliked his evangelical style . A vicar has quit after elderly parishioners mounted a whispering campaign against him for introducing ’happy clappy’ hymns into his church services. The Rev David Dickinson had boosted congregations at his church in the picturesque Lancashire village, attracting dozens of young families and their children. But his efforts to modernise the church services caused a wave of resentment among older worshippers. And when he got them all to clap along to ‘He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands’ and ‘Shine Jesus Shine‘ many older parishioners felt it was beyond the pale. The final straw for the vicar, known to worshippers as Dave, came when most of the choir boycotted a recent wedding and members of the congregation had to step in to save the day. Last night parishioners said the popular vicar had been forced to quit after ruffling the feathers of more traditional churchgoers. A member of the Parochial Church Council said: ‘It’s absolutely disgusting what has happened here. We have lost a fantastic vicar because of a minority of wicked people. ‘It is pure evil. How they can call themselves Christian is beyond me. They are simply hypocrites and they are the ones who should leave, not the vicar.’ One church council member, who asked not to be named, said: ‘99 per cent of us would have him back in a second. We all love him so much. David is a wonderful man and a wonderful vicar. ‘There are lots of families who only go there because of him. To have 50 or 60 children going to services on Sunday is fantastic. He is the best vicar I have ever come across and he just has this way of communicating with youngsters. ‘It’s a sorry state of affairs when a man like this can be driven out by a very small number of traditionalists.’ Church leaders, including the local bishop, have spoken of their disappointment at his resignation. And the church choir has been temporarily disbanded as Bishop John Goddard pledged to resolve ‘issues’ within Holy Trinity Church in the village of Hoghton, Lancashire before appointing a successor. Rev Dickinson had been vicar at Holy Trinity for eight years after retiring as a religious studies teacher at St Wilfred’s high school in Blackburn. Last night parishioners said the popular vicar had been forced to quit after ruffling the feathers of more traditional churchgoers . The historic church, which was built in 1823, contains a Grade II listed organ. The village is home to less than 900 people. Villagers said Rev Dickinson, 55, who is married to Gillian, was ‘very popular’ but a minority of parishioners had objected to his evangelist style. One church-goer said youngsters were encouraged to help pick hymns and would clap along to modern favourites. She said: ‘Two Sundays of the month were family services but there were traditional communions and services too - he catered to everyone. ‘The family services were done in such a way to make it easier for the children to understand, but it still followed the church of Evangelism. ‘At every service Rev Dickinson always preached to everyone about giving their life to Christ. He thought that was part of his Evangelical mission. And if you hadn’t already let him into your life, to do so. ‘He always did that - some people liked it, some people didn’t. The choir would sing at every service so it was a shock when they walked out at the wedding.’ Parishioners say the tension between Rev Dickinson and up to a dozen long-term churchgoers - some of them members of the Holy Trinity choir - had been brewing for more than two years. Another churchgoer said: ‘His style was very evangelical - it might be that that didn’t sit well with people. ‘He would preach like that one week but the next be very high church. He was trying to keep everyone happy.’ Another said: ‘I think it is such a shame. He did a beautiful service for my daughter who died in her sleep a few years back. He supported me and my family.’ Rev Dickinson refused to comment about reasons for his resignation saying: ‘It’d be totally inappropriate for me to discuss this.’ A spokesman for the Acting Bishop of Blackburn, the Right Rev John Goddard, said: ‘We have every intention of appointing a new vicar to the parish, but will delay the matter until issues leading to the resignation have been resolved. ‘The Bishop is keen to stress that he regards Rev Dickinson as a fine priest.’","Rev David Dickinson made efforts to modernise the Holy Trinity Church, in Hoghton, Lancashire .

About 200 inhabitants of the small town near the Colquechaca municipality in the Potosi district of Bolivia's southern highlands became enraged as they mourned the death of Leandra Arias Janco on Wednesday evening and threw Santos Ramos into the grave, which was then filled with earth.

Indigenous justice: A suspected rapist and murderer has been buried alive in the grave of his alleged victim by enraged villagers, according to reports from Bolivia . Poor: Inhabitants of the Potosi district of Bolivia are often poor, scraping a living from the remains of the once-prosperous silver mine that was all but emptied by the Spanish, and lynchings are not uncommon . A local reporter for an indigenous radio station, who would only speak on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that Ramos was tied up at the woman’s funeral before mourners threw him into the grave. Lynchings are not uncommon in Bolivia, where the justice system is often corrupt and communities are known to police themselves. Also on Wednesday in Potosi, residents of the Quechua indigenous community of Tres Cruces stoned to death a suspected thief and burned his accomplice alive, Barrios said. The two had earlier robbed a car and killed its driver. Mob justice: The state has sanctioned indigenous justice in Bolivia, where there is an indigenous majority, but the line is blurred when it comes to defining jurisdictional boundaries . Earlier this year, a Bolivian police officer was lynched by an angry mob after he was confused with a thief in the city of El Alto. Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous President, signed into law in 2009 a measure extending institutional recognition of 'indigenous justice,' but it's difficult to define the boundaries between the indigenous and Western systems of justice.

MPs are demanding that the chapel, the main place of Christian worship in the Palace of Westminster, can be used for the same sex ceremonies - a controversial move which has the support of commons speaker John Bercow. But it has today been claimed that Sir Christopher Geidt, the Queen's private secretary,  is also being consulted over the possibility of allowing same-sex marriages in St Mary Undercroft. Some MPs are demanding that the chapel, the main place of Christian worship in the Palace of Westminster, can be used for the same sex ceremonies . Queen Elizabeth pictured with the Dean of Westminster, The Very Reverend Dr John Hall. It has today been claimed that Sir Christopher Geidt, the Queen's private secretary, is also being consulted over the possibility of allowing same-sex marriages in St Mary Undercroft . The Church of England is to be exempt from any new gay marriage legislation - and as such, same sex weddings will not be allowed on its properties. If the ceremonies were allowed to take place in the chapel, where the body of Baroness Thatcher was held ahead of her funeral, it would have to cut all association with the Church, the Sunday Telegraph reports. St Mary Undercroft is a popular marriage venue for MPs. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, married his wife Ffion there . But because the chapel is a 'Royal Peculiar' and therefore under the authority of the Queen, she and Buckingham Palace now appear to be involved in the issue. The paper claims to have seen emails to and from Black Rod,  Lt Gen David Leakey, the most senior official in the Lords. Labour MP Chris Bryant has proposed the area be changed into a multi-faith area, . It would mean many different religious denominations would be able to marry the gay couples in Parliament. Mr Bryant, former Anglican vicar, asked Helen Grant, equalities minister if she could write to the Queen to ask if St Mary Undercroft could be used as 'a space for multi-faith purposes' in order for it to be used as a same sex wedding venue. At the time, Mrs Grant said she would consider how the Government could assist. Mr Bryant has also written to the commons speaker to Mr Bercow asking him to help lift restrictions on the chapel. He is said to be 'seeking advice' but is reportedly 'very sympathetic'. It would put Mr Bercow in direct opposition to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who is being kept informed of the row by parliamentary officials. Mr Bryant is also said to have communicated with other figures in Parliament, Buckingham Palace and the Church . Lt Gen Leakey is said to be against Mr Bryant's proposals. In correspondence released to the paper under the Freedom of Information act, Tory MP and chairman of the Christians in Parliament group Gary Streeter,  warned there would be 'substantial opposition' to turning the chapel into a multi-faith space. It is believed that the only way to change the chapel would be to introduce legislation either originating in the General Synod or in the Commons, with the Church's permission.

MPs warned against stereotyping offenders but said a trend of Pakistani men grooming young white girls does exist . Public officials must stop ‘tip-toeing’ around race when tackling child sex gangs, MPs said last night. A dangerous trend of Pakistani men grooming young white girls does exist, according to a Commons home affairs committee report. Police, prosecutors and social workers must be able to raise the issue without fear of being accused of racism, the committee said. But it warned against stereotyping offenders because there is no straightforward link between race and child sexual exploitation. In shocking conclusions to a year-long inquiry, MPs said there were still areas where victims were being failed by the authorities. They accused councils in Rochdale and Rotherham of being ‘inexcusably slow’ to realise sex abuse was taking place on their doorstep. And they said both councils had a ‘woeful lack of professional curiosity’ and were responsible for the ‘appalling consequences of their indifference to the suffering of vulnerable children’. Writing in the report, MPs said: ‘There is no simple link between race and child sexual exploitation.’ However, as the Mail has frequently highlighted, they add: ‘Evidence presented to us suggests there is a model of localised grooming of Pakistani-heritage men targeting young white girls. ‘This must be acknowledged by official agencies who, we were concerned to hear in some areas of particular community tension, had reportedly been slow to draw attention to the issue for fear of affecting community cohesion. ‘The condemnation from those communities of this vile crime should demonstrate that there is no excuse for tip-toeing around this issue. It is important that police, social workers and others be able to raise their concerns freely, without fear of being labelled racist.’ Last month seven Oxford men, mostly of Pakistani heritage, were convicted at the Old Bailey of running an appalling paedophile sex ring. Abusers: The men who took part in a child sex . ring in Rochdale which exploited vulnerable teenage girls (Top row left to right) Abdul Rauf, Hamid Safi, Mohammed Sajid and Abdul Aziz.

Keith Vaz said protecting vulnerable children should be the 'first priority' The case followed another, almost exactly 12 months earlier, in which nine Asian men based in Rochdale were involved. In both crimes, teenage girls, most of whom were vulnerable and in care, were picked up in the street and at takeaways and groomed for sex with gifts of drugs and alcohol. The committee called on the Government to introduce special courts to ensure child sex attackers are brought to justice. It said vulnerable victims deserve better treatment and demanded the Ministry of Justice act quickly to protect them. The committee highlighted how some young victims found the trial of their abusers more harrowing than their crimes. Some vulnerable victims were subjected to marathon cross-examinations by teams of aggressive defence barristers. On one occasion bungling staff showed the face of a victim to everyone in court, despite the judge ordering only an audio link was needed. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘Protection of these vulnerable children must be our first priority.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We constantly look for new ways to support and protect  vulnerable witnesses when appearing in court.’","Report found trend of Pakistani men grooming white girls does exist .

Private CCTV systems may come under surveillance themselves, following a recent surge in complaints about spying neighbours. Homeowners using security systems to protect their properties could be subjected to a new set of rules, following a report from the Government's surveillance camera commissioner. Andrew Rennison warns that the growing trend of using private CCTV can cause ‘upset’ between neighbours where homeowners feel they are being watched. I spy: Private CCTV users may need to follow new rules after surge in complaints of snooping neighbours . Although there are no current rules for private CCTV systems, the Coalition recently introduced a ‘surveillance code of practice’ for its public counterparts, particularly aimed at police and local authorities. Ministers are also encouraging authorities to review whether the systems are ‘necessary, proportionate and effective,’ and to make information of the locations of security cameras available online. New rules: Public CCTV are already under a 'code' and private systems might have to follow . In October Mr Rennison warned of a 'public backlash' unless proper steps were taken to regulate the more advanced camera technology used for CCTV. ‘The technology has overtaken our ability to regulate it,’ he said. ‘I’m convinced that if we don’t regulate it properly, there will be a huge public backlash. It is the Big Brother scenario playing out large.’ Today Whitehall sources told The Telegraph complaints about privacy relating to CCTV systems are becoming more common. ‘People put systems up for very good reasons,’ Mr Rennison said. ‘I will probably in the next year or so be publishing guidance to help people with that because although it is outside of the code of practice I think it is an area where people do want further advice.’ Mr Rennison urged private CCTV users to consider their neighbours when setting up their security systems, taking into account where the cameras are pointing so as to not cause upset. ‘I expect to receive complaints from people about inappropriate use of CCTV,’ he added. ‘But I suspect the highest number of complaints I receive will be from private users or people who have neighbours using private systems.’","Homeowners using private CCTV systems may come under new controls .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:58 EST, 7 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:44 EST, 8 June 2013 . A sudden burst of interest in God's word has meant that the Bible has become a best-seller in Norway, overtaking Fifty Shades Of Grey. In a surprising move in what is one of the most secular nations in Europe, a new Norwegian language version of the Scriptures has become the country's best-selling book. The country's fascination with God's message has also spread to the stage, with a six-hour play called 'Bibelen,' Norwegian for 'the Bible,' drawing crowds of 16,000 in a three-month run that recently ended at one of Oslo's most prominent theatres. A new translation of the Bible is now Norway's best-selling book, having overtaken Fifty Shades Of Grey . Officials of the Lutheran Church of Norway say they see the new-found interest in the Bible as proof that it still resonates in a country where only one per cent of the 5m residents regularly attends church. Author Karl Ove Knausgaard, who helped with the new translation, said the Bible was just as relevant to us today. He said: 'Thoughts and images from the Bible still have an impact on how we experience reality.' Norwegian academics said no-one should be surprised by the success of the new edition of the Bible in a nation of taciturn Scandinavians who like to withdraw from city life and spend holidays in remote solitude in the mountains, fjords and forests. Thorgeir Kolshus, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Oslo, said: 'Church attendance is a poor measure of the Norwegian state of faith. 'Religion is a very private thing for Norwegians.' Academics say Norwegians, who enjoy holidays in solitude in the mountains, enjoy contemplative reading . Anne Veiteberg, publishing director of Norway's Bible Society, said increased immigration had probably also been a factor. More than 258,000 immigrants have settled in the country during the last six years alone, and the Church of Norway estimates that around 60 percent of immigrants are Christian, with the rest Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu. She said: 'Now that we're exposed to other faiths, Norwegians have gotten more interested in their own faith.' Released in October 2011 by the Norwegian Bible Society, the new translation replaces a 1978 edition, with the goal of improving readability and accuracy. For example, in the older version, Mary was called a 'virgin.' In the new translation she is referred to instead as a 'young' woman. The new translation of the Bible has even beaten the best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey in Norway . Norway's Bible Society promoted the new translation like a pop fiction novel, stirring anticipation by giving out teasers of biblical stories before its release. It turned to poets and authors such as Knausgard to make the text sing for a new generation, and packaged it to appeal to various age groups, targeting teenagers with pink leather or denim covers, and adults with more sophisticated covers. Helga Haugland Byfuglien, presiding bishop for the Church of Norway, said the new version was easier to read. She said.  'There is no over-interpretation of the text.' It has sold nearly 160,000 copies and was Norway's best-selling book in 2012, despite increasing secularisation as Norwegians have concentrated on other pursuits than religion. They skiing, hiking and other outdoor activities, leaving little time other than Christmas or Easter to fill the pews. Last year, Parliament unanimously decided to end the Lutheran church's status as the official state religion. But Erik Ulfsby, artistic director at Det Norske Teatret, which staged the 'Bibelen' play, said that even if Norwegians didn't go to church, they still saw the Bible as an important part of their literary heritage.","New Norwegian translation of the Scriptures sold 120,000 copies in a year .

Police in India have charged a man with the murder of British backpacker Sarah Groves two months ago. Dutch tourist Richard De Wit was arrested after 24-year-old Miss Groves was found stabbed to death on a houseboat in Kashmir in April. She had suffered 45 knife wounds, most on her fingers, hands and arms, indicating she had fought ferociously for her life. Sarah Groves, 24, from Guernsey, was found stabbed to death on a house boat in Dal Lake, in Srinigar, Kashmir . De Wit, 43, was formally charged on Monday and is due to appear in court in Srinagar on June 15 when he is expected to enter a plea. Indian police believe Miss Groves met her alleged killer during her travels in Goa. She was attacked in her room on a houseboat hotel on Srinagar's picturesque Lake Dal in the early hours of April 5. Police said De Wit swam to shore and hailed a taxi but was stopped 45 miles away and arrested. He is said to have confessed to killing her after smoking cannabis, triggering delusions that she was a Dutch spy. Detectives are also probing claims that Miss Groves, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was conned out of money before her death. De Wit is being held in the region's central jail having received treatment in a government-run psychiatric hospital. Richard de Wit, 43, has been charged with Miss Groves's murder . Miss Groves's parents Victor and Kate told the Daily Mail last month that they had begged their daughter not to go to the region. Ownership of the territory is under dispute by India and Pakistan, and the area has for many years been targeted by terrorists and militants. So fearful were Mr and Mrs Groves for their daughter’s safety that they had booked a trip to Nepal, where they were planning to meet her at the base camp of Mount Everest. The trip was arranged specifically to persuade Sarah to leave Kashmir, but tragically she died before that planned reunion with her parents. In July 2012, Sarah had posted a message . on Facebook, writing: ‘Quit your job, buy a ticket, get a tan, fall in love, never . return.’ Two days before the murder, De Wit, 43, booked onto the New Beauty houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar. Sarah had been staying on the boat for a month with her new boyfriend, Saeed Ahmed Shoda, whom she had met on her travels, and his family. Immediately after his arrest, De Wit apparently told them ‘the Devil took hold of my body’. But police revealed last month that De Wit had bought the knife with which he stabbed Sarah hours before the killing, suggesting it was a premeditated act. It had initially been believed he already had the knife in his possession when he arrived in Kashmir. Victor Groves and his son Ben wept at a press conference last month as they spoke about Sarah . Victor Groves, centre, flanked by sons Ben, left, and Tom at a press conference where he described the dawn phone call which told him his daughter had been killed . Miss Groves was born in Manchester in 1988, moving to Guernsey when she was four with her parents. She and her older half-brothers, Ben, 26, and Tom, 31, grew up in a large manor house on the island. Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools, first at Blanchelande College in Guernsey, then as a boarder at the £30,000-a-year St Mary’s College in Ascot, Berkshire. She studied at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London before returning to Guernsey, having decided to become a fitness instructor. After qualifying, she worked for two years at the five-star Old Government House Hotel, leaving last August after deciding to go travelling. In October, she arrived in Tanzania, where she climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, before flying to New Delhi in February this year. She was undeterred by Foreign Office advice that women should use caution when travelling in India; there have been a number of sexual attacks against British women in the country including in Goa, where Sarah travelled after Delhi. Crime scene: Journalists and policemen stand . outside the houseboat where Miss Groves was found dead on Saturday, on . the Dal Lake in Srinagar, India . ‘She was happy, but we were keen that she didn’t stay too long,’ Mr Groves told a press conference in Guernsey last month. In Goa, Sarah met Saeed Shoda, 25, a Kashmiri who was on holiday there. They became besotted with each other, and Saeed invited her to stay on his parents’ houseboat on Dal Lake. Sarah had been planning to go on to Sri Lanka, but was so taken with Shoda that she agreed to change her plans. ‘We tried so hard to stop her going,’ Mr Groves told the press conference. ‘It is nothing against the guy, but sadly she met someone and, instead of going to Sri Lanka, she went north.’ Sarah travelled to Kashmir in April and moved onto the New Beauty houseboat, which has a number of basic, furnished rooms for rent to tourists. Doctors said that Miss Groves's injuries revealed she fought for her life . She helped Shoda's mother, Hafiza, paint the railings on the deck in preparation for the summer visitors, calling her ‘mother’ in Kashmiri. She spoke to her parents nearly every day on the phone, but those conversations did not assuage their fears for their daughter. Victor and Kate, 66, decided to book a trip to Nepal — and persuaded Sarah to meet them there as a way of enticing her away from Kashmir. ‘We didn’t want to separate them [Sarah and Saeed] long-term, but Sarah wanted to see so many places and she got caught up in something which meant she only saw two places,’ Mr Groves told the press conference. He also spoke heart-rendingly of the close bond between Sarah and her mother. ‘The relationship between Sarah and my wife, Kate, was always very, very close. They made each other laugh all the time,’ he said. De Wit turned up at Dal Lake and booked into the New Beauty houseboat. The following day, Saeed left to visit friends for a couple of days. He says he invited Miss Groves to go with him, but she chose to stay behind. Last October, De Wit abandoned his wife Uma Rupanya and two daughters to go travelling. In a video posted on YouTube from Zurich in December last year, De Wit said he had been receiving psychiatric treatment, but believed his doctors had been acting on behalf of the security services to spy on him and others. He claimed to have been visited by intelligence agents who believed he was a far-Right republican posing a threat to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. After Miss Groves's murder, his wife said he had stopped taking his anti-psychotic medication and had begun smoking cannabis. Miss Groves had been staying on a houseboat belonging to the family of her boyfriend Saeed Shoda . Sarah was introduced to De Wit on the Friday, when they had a brief chat. According to one local who spoke to Saeed’s family, Sarah had borrowed the Dutchman’s camera and put her memory card into it, although this has not been confirmed. It seems Saeed’s mother was uneasy about Sarah staying alone on the houseboat with De Wit, and asked if she wanted to spend the night in her room. Sarah declined, saying she wanted to read her book. In the early hours of the morning, she was disturbed by the Dutchman, who forced open the door to her room armed with a 12in knife. Sarah suffered 45 wounds to her body, most of them defensive cuts as she tried to fight off her attacker. But she also received two fatal wounds, one to her neck and another to a lung, and bled to death. Anger: Miss Groves Kashmiri boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda told ITV Daybreak of the moment he came face to face with her suspected killer as both faced questioning over her death at the local police station . The Shoda family were woken by screams and what sounded like an argument. Shoda’s brother and father ran to investigate, and found Sarah lying in a pool of blood in her room. Out on the river, they saw De Wit rowing a boat towards the shore, but it capsized, and he had to swim ashore. He flagged down a taxi but was arrested in Qazigund, 50 miles away, still wet and wearing no shoes. Later, Shoda’s mother discovered a missed call on her mobile from Miss Groves, who had desperately phoned for help. A doctor from the post-mortem team who examined Sarah’s body, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Mail there was no sexual assault before she was killed.

As plenty of long-suffering women will confirm, male drivers are notorious for refusing to ask for directions – even when they’re hopelessly lost. But it seems their stubborn refusal to accept assistance behind the wheel doesn’t stop there. Chaps would rather dent their car than their pride when it comes to seeking help in improving their driving, a survey has found. Stubborn: Only 22 per cent of people signing up for a free course to improve driving are men . The AA offered 2,000 free lessons to . help ‘nervous, rusty, lapsed and dangerous motorists get back behind the . wheel with renewed confidence and competence’ – but just 22 per cent of . those who signed up were men. A spokesman for the AA Charitable Trust said: ‘We are urging male drivers not to ignore their driving fears, even though our figures show how unlikely they are to seek any help with their driving.’ Advice: AA director Edmund King said men should not let pride get in the way of improving skills . Despite the reluctance of men to take . part in training, official figures show they are more than twice as . likely to be involved in accidents. In 2011, 17,478 men were killed or seriously injured on the roads, compared to 7,544 women. AA director Edmund King said: ‘Drivers should not let pride get in the way of improving their skills. 'Everyone, no matter how long they have had their licence, can become a safer driver and we all have a responsibility to ensure our skills are up to date. ‘Males shouldn’t worry about their pride being dented as further driver training can reduce risk. 'There is nothing to lose from asking for help if there is an area of your driving you think could be improved.’ He added: ‘There is clearly a need for quality, qualified driver tuition. ‘I have high hopes that our template will also allow other organisations to roll out similar initiatives worldwide and help improve road safety on an international scale.’ The AA poll also showed that drivers aged 21 to 25 were the most likely to sign up for the free refresher course. And there was also a regional divide, with 30 per cent of participants from the South East, compared to 10 per cent from the North West .","Less than a quarter of people joining free driving course are men .

Internet firms could be taken to court if child pornography is linked to more cases of sex abuse and murder. As David Cameron told Google and other web giants to do more to remove vile images, Claire Perry, his adviser on childhood, suggested failure to do so could lead to prosecution. ‘There’s an interesting question if we have any more tragedies and internet activity is involved, whether there could ever be a case brought against one of these companies,’ she told the Mail. ‘I don’t think they want to get there, so they need to step up to their responsibilities.’ Research has suggested that more than half of those who view child abuse images go on to commit abuse themselves and concerns have also been raised over extremist material online in the wake of the Woolwich killing. Mrs Perry, Conservative MP for Devizes, said the companies were ‘starting to look culpable’. ‘That is a very uncomfortable position for them to be in. If you are a trusted brand trying to provide family entertainment – Sky, for example – you don’t want to be in that position,’ she added. As well as suggesting the families of victims of criminals influenced by child porn might take court action, she said the Government could examine making the transmission of such material – as well as making or possessing it – an offence. Mr Cameron, Mrs Perry and Culture Secretary Maria Miller are to tell internet giants that ‘enough is enough’ at a summit next week. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and other firms have been summoned to a Whitehall meeting where they will be told to consider urgent measures to limit access to harmful material. Phone companies, including Vodafone and O2, are also being asked to attend the talks because of the amount of harmful material being downloaded on mobiles. Government sources said they would include new filters to screen out ‘offensive and unlawful’ content, tighter controls on what is allowed on public wi-fi, and a new industry-wide protocol on how complaints are dealt with. Ministers want warning screens to flash up telling people who attempt to access child porn sites which have been blocked that they risk breaking the law and losing their families and livelihoods. The Prime Minister said: ‘I am sickened by the proliferation of child pornography. It pollutes the internet, twists minds and is quite simply a danger to children. ‘Internet companies and search engines make their living by trawling and categorising the web. So I call on them to use their extraordinary technical abilities to do more to root out these disgusting images. ‘That is why the Government I lead is convening a round table of the major internet companies, and demanding that more is done. ‘There are encouraging signs that the industry is willing to step up, increasing funding and technical support for organisations combating child sexual abuse imagery online. But I want more action. ‘The time for excuses and blame is over – we must all work together. The safety of our children is at stake.’ Mrs Perry claimed web firms themselves identified only around 5 per cent of illegal material which is then blocked. Mrs Perry (right) and Culture Secretary Maria Miller (left) are to tell internet companies that ‘enough is enough’ ‘I find that astonishing,’ she said. ‘Some 1.5million people see child abuse images by accident and only 40,000 report them. ‘Child porn is illegal but the system only works when consumers stumbling across it report it. Imagine if that was the case in other areas – like the drugs trade for example. ‘If the police suddenly said it was up to us to go out and find bags of heroin before they did anything about it. People wouldn’t find that remotely acceptable. ‘The companies have got to do more, whether it’s providing filters or looking more actively at content.’ The five main internet service providers – BT, Everything Everywhere, Sky, TalkTalk, and Virgin Media – have made a commitment to offer filters to protect all devices in the home and will make selecting internet controls an ‘unavoidable step’ for new customers. If customers choose not to engage – for example, if they just repeatedly click ‘yes’ to get through set-up quickly – then that will lead to protections being switched on rather than off. Harriet Harman, Labour’s shadow culture secretary and deputy leader, said: ‘The industry should be making safe search default, seeking robust age-verification systems and splash page warnings, and we should legislate if progress is not made.’ A Google spokesman said: ‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links, which we remove from our search index. ‘Whenever we discover child abuse imagery we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’","Claire Perry, PM's adviser on childhood, said failure to remove vile images could lead to prosecution .

A dog was rescued from Snowdonia yesterday, 10 days after his owner was badly injured in a 450ft fall. Black spaniel Sutty had built himself a nest on a tiny ledge about 2,000ft high and survived for 10 days without food or water. It is believed he had been scared away by the sound of a RAF helicopter that rescued his 60-year-old owner after the fall in Ogwen Valley on May 29. Sutty (pictured in the rucksack) was rescued from Snowdonia after 10 days when climbers Rob Shepherd and Sian Williams heard his whimpering . Sutty was credited with saving the man's life by attracting attention to his owner as lay unconscious after the fall near the Atlantic Slabs. The walkers who found the man from Wolverhampton said they heard the dog barking. Sutty, a 14-year-old cross breed, was discovered by Rob Shepherd, a member of the Llanberis  mountain rescue, and his girlfriend Sian Williams as they went for an evening climb on Saturday. They said they heard the sound of faint whimpering and Mr Shepherd made a difficult ascent to find the little dog sheltering on the ledge. A member of the Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team and Miss Williams helped lower Sutty into her rucksack. Posters had been placed around the trails to help find Sutty but no one had seen him until Saturday. Sutty's family were called and they immediately drove up from Wolverhampton for the 'emotional' reunion. Sutty had not been seen since he helped raise the alarm when his owner fell 450ft on the mountain . The man is still in hospital recovering from his fall but his daughter came to collect the dog today. Chris Lloyd of the Ogwen team, who . went to the scene, said today: 'As soon as the dog was found we . telephoned the owner’s daughter. 'She was delighted and came over immediately with her husband from Wolverhampton.' He said Sutty was in excellent condition considering his ordeal and had built himself a nest either for warmth or to shelter from the heat. Mr Lloyd said: 'Sutty is in remarkable condition. As . well as having to survive with nothing to eat or drink the dog would . also have to contend with the heat. 'Posters had been put up in the area so when a local couple heard whimpering as they climbed on Atlantic Slabs they knew it had to be the missing dog.

Turkey's defiant prime minister gave a speech from the top of a bus today making it clear he has no intention of backing down in the face of 10 days of anti-government protesters. Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again condemned his opponents as ‘looters’. However, he also asked his supporters not to engage in any violence, predicting that his party would defeat those who oppose it during local elections in March. Fighting back: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan greeting his supporters at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul on Friday . Tension: Mr Erdogan appealed to his supporters on Sunday: 'Don't allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so' Erdogan blamed the anti-government protests on forces that oppose Turkey’s progress. Still by far the country’s most popular politician, Erdogan has pressed ahead with government business as usual. 'My beloved brothers, we’re walking towards a better Turkey. Don’t allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so,' he told a crowd of supporters at the airport in the southern city of Adana. Three people, including a police officer, have died in widespread protests that erupted May 31, after a police crackdown of a small sit-in by environmentalists in Istanbul. Yesterday protest organisers called for demonstrations to keep up pressure on the government to sack those responsible for a violent police crackdown and to abandon plans to redevelop a central Istanbul square. Continuing unrest: Activists shouting anti-government slogans at Gezi Park near Taksim Square, in Istanbul . 'Islamist agenda': Protesters say that Mr Erdogan is becoming increasingly authoritarian . Tens of thousands of Turks massed in Taksim Square late on Saturday, where riot police backed by helicopters and armoured vehicles first clashed with protesters a week ago, some chanting for Erdogan to resign. What began as a campaign against government plans to build over Gezi Park in Taksim Square, spiralled into an unprecedented display of public anger over the perceived authoritarianism of Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party. Police fired teargas and water cannon at protesters night after night in Istanbul and Ankara last week, in clashes which have left three dead and close to 5,000 injured. Heavy-handed: Police have been criticised for their tactics against protesters since the unrest began on May 31 . The organisers of the initial protests in Taksim, calling themselves Taksim Solidarity, repeated their call for the redevelopment plans to be abandoned, police use of teargas to be banned, those responsible for police violence to be dismissed and bans on demonstrations to be lifted. “The demands are obvious. We call on government to take account of the reaction (on the street), act responsibly and fulfil demands being expressed by millions of people everyday,” the group said in a statement.","Protests in Turkey are continuing into their tenth day in Istanbul .

Flora margarine has made an embarrassing U-turn after a consumer backlash by shoppers who launched campaigns protesting at a change in the taste of their favourite spread. Brand owner Unilever is bringing back the old flavour 17 months after spending £29 million on a reformulation aimed at making the product healthier and tastier. But the new recipe sparked a surge of complaints from shoppers who took to internet forums to voice their dislike of the relaunched version of the margarine. Shoppers' favourite: Consumers seemed to shop with their feet as value sales of Flora spreads fell 12 per cent since the classic recipe was changed . Many said the new taste was ‘disgusting’ and threatened to stop buying it. Despite the protests and a slump in sales, Unilever continued to defend the new recipe insisting that consumer research showed that shoppers preferred it. But in a report headlined ‘Unilever returns to Original Flora after £29m revamp flops‘. trade magazine The Grocer reported yesterday that this week the brand owner finally relented and announced an embarrassing U-turn. The magazine says that in the past year, value sales of Flora spreads have fallen 12.4per cent to £188.8 million while volume sales have fallen 9.6per cent to 58.8 million kg. It says the launch of Lurpak Lightest by Arla in January last year could also have had an impact on sales. Healthier: The new recipe with less fat has now been abandoned as consumers did not like the flavour . Patty Essick, Unilever brand building director for spreads in the UK, told The Grocer: 'We have been listening to our consumers’ feedback and as a result we have taken the decision to return to the original Flora taste.' New packs of the Flora Original spread going on shelves now have the slogan Back to the Taste You Love. Unilever said a survey of 1,800 consumers had shown that nearly 70 per cent of Flora Original buyers would welcome the return of the original flavour. Original taste Flora is being rolled out to stores this month with an unchanged selling price. Dairy Crest faced similar protests after changing its recipe for Clover spread last year. The company 'reformulated' the margarine to reduce its fat content. But angry shoppers complained about the new taste. Rival: Lurpak's Lightest could also have knocked Flora's sales as it launched in January . Shoppers have made similar protests in the past about HP Sauce and Twinings Earl Grey changing their taste. Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer said: 'Consumer goods manufacturers know they alter a recipe at their peril.' So how will history view Unilever’s decision first to reformulate Flora and, now, its embarrassing U-turn, in which the taste of the original recipe will be recreated? 'Unilever has done its best to put a positive spin on the reversal, claiming it was ""listening to our consumers’ feedback"" although whether it was the angry posts on various website forums (including thegrocer.co.uk) or the 12.4per cent decline in value sales is moot.' The obvious question here is: why didn’t Unilever listen to consumers in the first place?”","Many shoppers said the new taste of lower fat Flora was 'disgusting'

Nature walkers are being warned to beware of 'aggressive foreign cows', following attacks on ramblers by imported cattle. Cows brought to Britain from the continent are posing a danger to ramblers who enter their fields, walkers associations warn today . They are now urging fellow walkers to take care after a number of incidents over recent months, including a fatal attack in Wiltshire where a 66-year-old man was trampled to death. Danger: Ramblers are warned to take care after several attacks on humans by cattle imported from Europe (file picture) Clive Grumett, chairman of the Sussex Area Ramblers, said the introduction of more aggressive breeds from Europe had led to the rise in attacks. He said: ‘Farmers introduced them because they wanted to improve their stock. However, they discovered these breeds were more aggressive after a number of cattle herders were attacked. ‘Dairy cows are used to human interaction because they have to be milked. However, beef cattle are not, so they can be more aggressive.’ The warning comes just weeks after a 66-year-old man was trampled to death by a herd in Wiltshire. The walker had been with a friend when the cattle charged at the pair, leaving him dead and the other with serious injuries. Ramble with care: Walkers are told to tread swift and lightly through cows fields after a man was trampled to death last month (file picture) Carl Maynard of East Sussex Council said: ‘Thankfully serious incidents involving walkers and cattle are very rare. 'However, we would always recommend walkers take steps to keep themselves as safe as possible.' Among the advice given is to move as ‘quickly and quietly as possible’, avoid getting between cows and their calves and ‘not panic or run’ as most cows will stop before reaching a human. John Archer, from the National Farmers' Union, reminded walkers that the countryside remains a working environment. He added: ‘Walkers should be mindful of their surroundings and especially vigilant on entering a field where the whole field cannot be seen. ‘Follow the advice above and be sympathetic to animals that are rearing their young - please give them space.’","Imported breeds said to be more aggressive than British dairy cows .

The 19-year-old, who became an international heroine when she . managed to escape death and survived for more than two weeks on small . scraps of food and water leaking from a pipe, has accepted a job at the Westin Hotel in Dhaka. Reshma Begum, the 19-year-old seamstress who survived for 17 days in the rubble of a collapsed garment factory, has left hospital and is preparing to start a new job at a hotel . Pictures of Miss Begum's dramatic rescue were beamed around the world last month . 'I feel great now,' Miss Begum said at a ceremony held in her honour at the military facility which has been caring for her since May 10. 'I'm recovered mentally and physically.' But she said that she still suffered nightmares about her ordeal as she cried out for help from the wreckage of the collapsed building, despite the intensive care she had received. 'I still get frightened in the night. Whenever I think of those days I feel bad and frightened. 'I've forgotten most of what I did under the rubble.' Miss Begum was lucky not to have been crushed later by a large concrete slab which had crashed into place just above her following the building's collapse. Workers had all but given up hope of finding anyone alive after 17 days but heard her cries seconds before they were due to smash the concrete with heavy machinery, which would have brought the chunks falling down on her. Miss Begum spoke briefly to the media after being released from hospital and said she was fully recovered from her injuries . The teenager, from a remote village in the western district of Dinajpur, had started her £38-a-month job at the garment factory only three weeks before the building collapsed. 'I never thought I would get my life back again when I was trapped under the rubble,' she said in her first interview since being released from hospital. After her astonishing rescue made headlines around the world, job offers poured in from hotels and charities. Asim Shah, general manager of the Westin Hotel, said: 'We're sure this young girl will be exceptional in her new job. We have made her an ambassador in the house-cleaning department.' Miss Begum vowed never to work in a garment factory again following her ordeal . Authorities at the military hospital where Miss Begum was treated said she was fully recovered from the head injury she suffered in the collapse. The garment-manufacturing industry, which produces high street clothes for stores around the world, promised to clean up its act after the disaster.

Irons' comments were savaged by activists. A spokesman from Stonewall, a gay . rights charity, told The Independent: 'Few people will agree with Jeremy . Irons’ bizarre ""concerns"" about equal marriage.' The 64-year-old actor has become prone to increasingly outspoken statements - he was recently criticised for suggesting that women were wrong to complain about being sexually harassed. The latest controversy came during a conversation with Mr Zepps on HuffPost Live, the website's online television channel. When asked his opinion about the ongoing debates in the U.S. and Britain over whether or not to legalise gay marriage, the actor pointed out that the UK already had civil partnerships for homosexual couples. 'It seems to me that now they're fighting for the name,' Mr Irons said. 'I worry that it means somehow we debase, or we change, what marriage is. I just worry about that.' Highly acclaimed: Jeremy Irons' acting career is going well with a new series of The Borgias, in which he plays the Pope, but his personal comments have caused controversy this year . He went on to suggest that the . legalisation of gay marriage could lead to unexpected consequences, . raising the possibility that family members could marry to avoid . inheritance tax, and asked: 'Could a father not marry his son?' Mr Zepps pointed out that incest laws . would prevent that possibility but Irons, who plays the Pope in The Borgias, replied: 'It's not . incest between men, because incest is there to protect us from . inbreeding, but men don't breed, so incest wouldn't cover that.' Mr Irons insisted he was not motivated . by bigotry, saying: 'I don't have a strong feeling either way - I just . wish everbody who's living with one other person the best of luck in the . world, because it's fantastic.' In another potentially controversial . comment, he added: 'Living with another animal, whether it be a husband . or a dog, is great.' Marriage debate: Jeremy Irons, pictured with his wife Sinead Cusack, said he worried that marriage was being 'debased' Feminist news website Jezebel denounced Mr Irons' comments as 'completely gross' and urged him to 'shut up'. Many Twitter users also expressed . disappointment in the former star of Brideshead Revisited and The Lion . King - @LilEsBella wrote: 'Jeremy Irons just made me sick to my stomach.

"By . Charlotte Griffiths and Charlie Lankston . PUBLISHED: . 16:03 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:17 EST, 9 June 2013 . Celebrity fan: Model Cara Delevingne wore the Squeeze This t-shirt featuring a picture of Rihanna's bottom this week . Pop diva Rihanna could be heading for another legal showdown with Topshop – after The Mail on Sunday discovered the high street chain has been selling a T-shirt featuring a photograph of her much-exposed backside. The singer is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Sir Philip Green’s company over another design that bears an unauthorised – and unflattering – image of her face. She is said to be seeking £3.5 million in that case, but is apparently either unaware or unconcerned that an image of her grabbing her own bottom has been emblazoned on to another T-shirt – along with the slogan: ‘Squeeze This!’ – which is available from the store. The picture was taken by photographer George Chin while she was on stage in denim hot pants and fishnet tights at the V Festival in Staffordshire in 2011. It was printed on to T-shirts  by the design label Worn By and sold on the website of Topshop’s menswear section Topman for £28. However, it was removed from sale on Thursday, hours after The Mail on Sunday asked the company about the design. The company then released a statement saying: ‘We can confirm that the T-shirt in question is from a concession brand and is not a Topman T-shirt.’ Intriguingly, Rihanna’s friend Cara Delevingne wore the shirt at The Glamour Women of the Year Awards on Tuesday night. The supermodel happily posed for cameras on the red carpet of the star-studded event wearing the design tucked into black pencil trousers, and even posted on Twitter a picture of herself pretending to squeeze the bottom on the T-shirt. Rihanna, who has her own fashion line with Topshop rivals River Island, has filed legal papers over the first T-shirt, describing it as a ‘low-quality image and product that would not have been authorised’. The 25-year-old star is said to be annoyed that, legally, the photographer, rather than the subject of the image owns the rights to the shot. Sir Philip is believed to have offered the singer £3,500 in compensation for using the image, but she refused. She is said to be determined to take the . case through the courts on principle, and has already spent more than . £600,000 of her own money on legal fees. Legal battle: Rihanna is suing Topshop for using her image on this t-shirt (left). It is not yet known how she will react to the news the store has been selling a shirt featuring a picture of her bottom (right) Singer: Rihanna has been touring in Europe while the legal case against Topshop continues . A source told reporters: ‘She believes they are taking advantage of artists, that it’s just exploitation and what they are doing is wrong.’ Rihanna was once a close family friend of Sir Philip and his daughter Chloe Green. She sang at Sir Philip’s 60th birthday in Mexico last year and she spent Boxing Day with the Green family in 2010. However, in recent weeks, 22-year-old Chloe has been pictured cuddling up to Rihanna’s ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, which is said to have enraged the singer. Rihanna last month tweeted a racy close-up of her backside in very skimpy denim shorts in an apparent bid to make Brown jealous.","Singer is already suing clothing chain for selling top featuring her face .

Stance: Despite earlier comments that suggested he could be softening his stand, Erdogan delivered a fiery speech on his return from a four-day trip to North Africa . Tens of thousands of protesters have . held demonstrations that have spread to dozens of cities across Turkey, . sparked by the violent police reaction last Friday to what started out . as a small protest against a plan to develop Istanbul's central Taksim . Square. Since then, three people have died - two protesters and a policeman - and thousands have been wounded. One protester is on life support in a hospital in Ankara.

Rapturous: Supporters of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan chant upon Erdogan's arrival at Ataturk International Airport . Welcome: Supporters dance and wave Turkish flags upon his arrival . Erdogan at times was almost drowned . out by his supporters, part of the base that has helped him win three . landslide elections. 'God is Great,' they chanted, and soon moved on to . slogans referring specifically to the protesters in Taksim Square. 'Let us go, let us smash them,' they shouted. 'Istanbul is here, where are the looters?' Erdogan . had initially referred to the protesters as looters and troublemakers, . while also acknowledging that excessive police force might have been . used, and promising it would be investigated. Erdogan's . speech, delivered from atop an open-air bus outside the airport . terminal, appeared at first to be an attempt to strike a unifying note. 'They . say I am the prime minister of only 50 percent. It's not true. We have . served the whole of the 76 million from the east to the west,' he said, . referring to his election win in 2011, when he took 50 percent of the . vote. 'Together we are . Turkey. Together we are brothers,' he said, adding 'We have never . endeavored to break hearts. We are in favor of mending hearts.' But he soon became more combative. Anger: Anti-government protesters gather in Istanbul's Taksim square last night . Rise: Dozens of Turkish Twitter users accused of inciting protests via the microblogging website were released from detention as the death toll from days of anti-government protests rose to four . Tension: Protesters have accused Recep Tayyip Erdoga of being authoritarian and trying to impose Islamic values . Efforts: Protesters pass bricks to each other as they try to form a barricade near Taksim square of Istanbul during a protest . Mix: Protesters from all walks of life have occupied the square and its park, objecting to what they say is Erdogan's increasingly autocratic and arrogant manner - charges he vehemently denies . 'We have never been for building tension and polarization. But we cannot applaud brutality,' he said. In his last speech in Tunisia before flying to Istanbul, Erdogan had said that terrorist groups were involved in the protests, saying they had been identified. In a twist, Erdogan implied that bankers were also part of a conspiracy that was fuelling the protests. He added that the flames of dissent had been fanned by other groups too. 'Those who call themselves journalists, artists, politicians, have, in a very irresponsible way, opened the way for hatred, discrimination and provocation,' he said. Speaking before Erdogan's return, Koray Caliskan, professor of political science and international relations at Bosporus University, pointed out that the prime minister was maintaining a hard line because 'until now Erdogan had always gained support by increasing the tension in the country.' 'Turkey is absolutely at a crossroads. Erdogan won't be able to point at Turkey as a model of democracy anymore,' he said. Prepared: Protesters pass bottles of water to each other at Taksim square of Istanbul during a protest . Outcry: What started as an outcry against a local development project has snowballed into widespread anger against what critics say is the government's increasingly conservative and authoritarian agenda . Demonstrations: Anti-government protesters shout slogans and wave Turkish national flags . Wrath: Erdogan denounced those behind a week of violent demonstrations on, causing a sell-off on the Turkish stock exchange from investors worried that his defiant rhetoric will further inflame public wrath . In his earlier comments in Tunisia, Erdogan acknowledged that some Turks were involved in the protests out of environmental concerns, and said he had 'love and respect' for them. Those comments don't appear to have swayed many of the thousands of protesters who thronged the square for a sixth day Thursday. More than 10,000 others filled a busy street in a middle class area of Ankara. 'I do not believe his sincerity,' said protester Hazer Berk Buyukturca. Turkey's main stock market revealed the fears that Erdogan's comments would do little to defuse the protesters, with the general price index plunging by 8 percent after his comments on concerns that continuing unrest would hit the country's economy. Over the past week the demonstrations have spread to 78 cities, growing into public venting of what protesters perceive to be Erdogan's increasing arrogance. That includes attempts to impose what many say are restrictive mores on their personal lives, such as how many children to have or whether to drink alcohol. So far, 4,300 people have been hurt or sought medical attention for the effects of tear gas during the protests, the Turkish Human Rights Foundation said. One person is on life support in Ankara. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said more than 500 police officers had been injured . . A total of 746 protests had erupted, causing some 70 million Turkish Lira ($37 million) in damages, he said.

Nikolai Tsiskaridze, 39, has been told he must leave at the end of the month amidst claims by Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov that he may have been involved in the attack on Sergei Filin. The acid hit, which took place in January, left Mr Filin with severe burns to his face and eyes. Mr Tsiskaridze has denied all allegations, claiming he is the victim of a smear campaign. 'Hounded': Russian ballet star Nikolai Tsiskaridze has has denied allegations that he was involved in the acid attack on Bolshoi's artistic director Sergei Filin . Mr Tsiskaridze's relationship with Mr Iksanov soured sharply after the Bolshoi director suggested that the Georgia-born dancer might have played a role inciting the attack. Mr Tsiskaridze, who has been at the Bolshoi since 1992 as principal dancer and teacher, hit back saying the manager was conducting a witch hunt against him. 'This is hounding of the sole and most famous artist of the Bolshoi Theatre,' the dancer said.

Star performer: 15- year-old Kloe won a Highland dance competition just three weeks before her death . A teenage dancer who was diagnosed with a heart complaint just months ago has died after falling ill during class. Kloe Richardson, 15, collapsed as she practised at a church hall in front of her friends, who desperately tried to revive her. However, she was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital under police escort. Last night her shocked family paid tribute to the teenager from Arbroath, Angus, who was an award- winning Highland dancer. Her mother, playgroup worker Allison Richardson, said: ‘Last night she was just her normal self. ‘She went away to her dance class and then we received a phone call to say she had collapsed. ‘We thought she might have just fainted from the heat but me and my husband Wayne got there in five minutes. ‘The ambulance was already there when we arrived. Some older girls were running the class and they had performed CPR on Kloe. ‘They’d known her the whole time she’d been dancing there. 'There were a lot of little girls there and they were very upset. ‘The ambulance workers were fabulous. They certainly could not have done any more. ‘We got a police escort to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee and got to stay with her.’ Mrs Richardson, 41, said Kloe had been diagnosed shortly after Christmas with the heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – a thickening of part of the heart muscle, which can cause sudden death in young athletes. She said: ‘Kloe was on medication but she seemed fine. She was just her usual self and carried on doing everything. ‘She had just gone into fifth year and she’d finished her exams last week.’ She said Kloe, who was a pupil at Arbroath Academy, was a talented musician and had played violin and keyboard in the school orchestra. She added: ‘Kloe was always dancing, singing and smiling. ‘She didn’t do many Highland dance competitions, but about three weeks ago in Pitlochry she won her age category and the overall medal.’ The tragedy happened during the dance class at Knox’s Church in Arbroath, shortly before 6pm on Thursday. Kloe had a twin brother, Dylan, and two older brothers, Kyle, 20 and Rhys, 16. Rhys said: ‘She was just such a happy person.’ Kloe’s uncle, Graham Mitchell, added: ‘She loved doing everything and she loved everyone.’ On medication: The 15-year-old twin was diagnosed with a condition that a thickens part of the heart muscle early this year .

Training partner: Claudia Viljoen regularly visits Oscar Pistorius for workouts to keep him focused on athletics . As Oscar Pistorius awaits his trial for the killing of his lover, Reeva Steenkamp, another attractive young blonde is constantly at his side. But there’s no danger of athlete Claudia Viljoen stepping into tragic model Miss Steenkamp’s shoes – her role with the Paralympic gold medallist known as the ‘Bladerunner’ is very different. Her job as double amputee sprinter Pistorius’s training partner is to keep his mind focused on athletics and not on the case due to be heard in August, following his shooting of 29-year-old Reeva on Valentine’s Day. Viljoen, 24, a former international 100m and 200m hurdler, is a regular visitor to the Pretoria home of Pistorius’s uncle Arnold, where a gym has been built in the pool house. The pair train together on a treadmill, bicycle and weights equipment each day, but Viljoen, an old friend of 26-year-old Pistorius, has told friends she is reporting back regularly to his coach, Ampie Louw, on the Paralympian’s state of mind as he tries to rebuild his shattered life. ‘Claudia trains with Oscar in the morning, often together with his uncle Arnold’s family,’ said a source close to the Pistorius family. ‘She’s a very good friend of Oscar.’ Viljoen, who describes herself as ‘a 100m hurdler and sports scientist’, is engaged to business consultant James Heunis, 30. She was in South Africa’s preparation squad for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but suddenly dropped out, apparently because of personal issues. Aside from her athletics, she works for her family’s plant hire business. Her looks earned her a place in the Athletics South Africa 2011 calendar as Miss July, where she appeared in a carefully-posed shot wearing only briefs and a medal. Yesterday her father, Barend Viljoen, told The Mail on Sunday that the Pistorius family were closing ranks over Oscar. Lovers: The Olympic sprinter with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp two weeks before her death . Charge: Pistorius has appeared in court charged with his girlfriend's murder and will go on trial later this year . He said: ‘They know what they are doing. They have brought in professional people to help. We would prefer to keep everything private.’ Miss Steenkamp’s mother, June, recently said she was shocked to learn her daughter was in pain after she was shot the first time while in the bathroom during the Valentine’s Day tragedy. Pistorius then fired two more bullets into the room, one of which killed her. Pistorius told the court at his bail hearing in April that he feared a burglar had broken into his apartment. He said he grabbed his gun from the table closest to Miss Steenkamp’s side of the bed and began firing. Arnold Pistorius said last week that his nephew stayed inside most of the time, surrounded by pictures of Miss Steenkamp. ‘He’s . got photos in his room, he’s got photos all over the place,’ he said. ‘What can you say if the person you love the most dies and you were the . instrument – it’s unthinkable.’ These poignant pictures of a young Reeva Steenkamp offer a rare glimpse into a beautiful life that ended far too early. In the first photograph, below left, Reeva, aged four, is seen with a parcel in the garden of her grandparents’ house at Christmas in Cape Town in 1987.

The video of the two girls - one of whom was a 12-year-old seventh-grader at Centennial Middle School in Portland - found its way to the Facebook pages of students at another middle school within the same district, where a social media-savvy teacher spotted it on one of his student's Facebook pages, recognized one of the girls as an underage student and told the school's principal.

She sticks to a tried and tested . formula which has seen her parade her incredible legs in a series of . super-short dresses on popular television programme Britain's Got Talent. But Alesha Dixon took her look in a whole new direction on Friday night as she covered up her pins in a plunging black trouser suit that won her some serious style plaudits. But beneath her stylish Alexander McQueen ensemble the 34-year-old was hiding a figure-skimming secret. Hiding a secret: Alesha Dixon donned a £55 shapewear corset underneath her Alexander McQueen suit on Friday's Britain's Got Talent show . Peeking out from underneath, Alesha wore a £55 black bodysuit, which sculpts the stomach and waist with secret surround control panels. She may be a slim size 6 to 8, but Alesha proved she is just like us mere mortals when it comes to getting a helping hand from shapewear. Her stylist Katie Greengrass uses the brand for styling so Scandale ensured she had a full set of the pieces for 'shapewear emergencies' when dressing Alesha for the national TV show, the company told MailOnline. Alesha donned a piece from the Sirène Collection, which is designed to allow women to . discover, what they call, their perfect ‘S’ curve silhouette – the ideal shape to define . and enhance the bust, waist and hip proportions. The help: She may be a slim size 6-8, but like normal women, Alesha was keen to get a helping hand when it came to looking toned on the national TV show . As well as getting a helping hand from Scandale, Alesha maintains her trim figure by following an '80/20 rule'. Speaking to the Daily Star, she said: 'I eat more when I'm on tour and cut . back a bit when I'm training less. It's that age-old thing of striking a . balance. 'Nutrition is important, but I don't get stuck into fad diets. I . probably have an 80/20 rule - 80 per cent of the time I'm careful and monitor . my intake, sticking to lean foods and fresh fruit and veg, and the other . 20 per cent? 'Well, a little of what you fancy is fine.' She explained that she works with her trainer twice a week and when she's at home alone, she tries her best to fit in some exercise like sit-ups or squats whilst she's watching TV. Alesha's favourite French shapewear brand is also a firm favourite of the likes of Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead, who opted for the brand's swimwear in a recent photoshoot. After a gruelling week at boot camp, Binky wanted to celebrate losing a stone so donned the sexy shapewear to show off her svelte figure in an OK! magazine photoshoot. Originally conceived in the 1930s, Scandale has recently made a return to the lingerie market and picked up a celebrity following along the way.

"PUBLISHED: . 18:09 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:29 EST, 8 June 2013 . We got them out in the nick of time. As the five street dogs, smuggled by The Mail on Sunday out of a notorious state-run pound in Romania, were being readied for their journey to the UK, the shelter shut its doors to charity workers, who feared the notorious ‘Butcher’ vet, Dr Avram, was killing the animals inside. Fifty demonstrators descended on the compound, but no one was allowed inside. A picture of the body of a dead dog inside an empty sack was later published in local newspapers. Six weeks ago, I travelled to Romania to highlight the terrible plight of the country’s three million street dogs, many of which are starving, targeted by drivers, and routinely kicked, stoned and beaten. Saviours: Liz Jones, right, and K-9 Angel Pola Pospieszalska with dogs Hilda and Spot, who were rescued from Romania . Reunited: Liz Jones is handed her Romanian rescue dog Hilda by Dana Puscoci from pet charity ELI for Animals . Alongside me were Victoria Eisermann, 42, Anneka Tanaka-Svenska, 39, and Pola Pospieszalska, 32, the founders of British-based charity,  K-9 Angels, set up in 2011 to help stray dogs in Eastern Europe and dogs bred for meat in Thailand. It was these three very determined women who showed me that, while life is tough for Romania’s street dogs, their fate is often much worse if they are caught by the state’s pounds. When we visited the shelter in Craiova, two hours from the capital Bucharest, the filth and the overcrowding was shocking. And when the ‘Butcher’ vet lifted an ancient, frail little grey dog up by her hind leg, I knew that I had to save her. Near death: Hilda had been dehydrated, starving, and suffering from hypothermia when Liz found her in a shelter in Craiova . We later crept out of the pound with this . sorry bundle wrapped in a sweater, along with her four cage companions: . Spotty Dog, a collie-cross puppy, Bobby, a Bassett cross, Mabel, a . gorgeous blonde, and Sad Eyes Angel, a nondescript brown scruff. At a private veterinary clinic, the little grey dog, which I named Hilda, was found to be dehydrated, starving, and suffering from hypothermia. Bobby had an open wound, while Spotty had parvovirus, which can be fatal. All have since been treated, inoculated, given passports and microchips – and a ticket to a new life. At 8.30am yesterday I, along with the other adoptive parents – all Mail on Sunday readers moved by reading about the dogs’ plights – were at Dover. Mabel is being taken by Scott and Ros Stewart, from Sheffield, while Sad Eyes Angel was being picked up by Susan and Ian Blann, from Southampton. Bobby is being fostered until he can be taken home with Pamela Gosling, also from Southampton. As they arrived, I glimpsed them in the back in their cages. They had changed almost beyond recognition; Spot has put on loads of weight, and Hilda seems to have grown some decidedly fluffy fur. Holding them  in my arms, remembering how close they had been to death, made all the hard work worth it. Happy families: Liz Jones and Hilda, centre, with fellow new owners, left to right, Ros Stewart with Mable, Scott Stewart with Spot, Susan Blann with Angel and Ian Blann with Bobby . They were tired, but no longer scared or aggressive. Their new owners were soon in tears. But it is not an entirely happy ending. On our visit to Romania, we also spotted six animals we christened ‘the dogs in the dark’. They had been kept in a cage, completely in darkness, for two years. Since my initial article was published on April 28, three have been liberated thanks to the £7,000 raised by generous Mail on Sunday readers. But there are still three dogs left behind.

The death of a Russian supergrass who was a key witness in a multi-million pound international fraud investigation is not suspicious, police said today. Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, was found collapsed outside his home in Granville Road, Weybridge, Surrey, on November 10 last year sparking a major police investigation over fears he had been poisoned. At the time of his death, Mr Perepilichnyy was involved in a fraud case involving the theft of around £140m in tax revenue from the Russian government. Surrey Police said the matter has now been formally passed to the coroner and an inquest will be held after detectives found no evidence of foul play. This was despite two post-mortem examinations carried out in November failing to establish a cause of death. Toxicology samples were also taken from both post mortems but the results have not been released. Senior investigating officer detective chief inspector Ian Pollard, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'I am satisfied that following extensive inquiries, including a post-mortem examination carried out by a Home Office pathologist, and a full and detailed range of toxicology tests, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any third party involvement in Mr Perepilichnyy's death.'

"By . Robert Verkaik, Mail On Sunday Security Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:28 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:05 EST, 8 June 2013 . Britain was warned six months ago that US snooping laws were being used to spy on our communications. The revelation comes as MPs prepare to fly out to Washington to raise concerns about US spies passing on internet data to the UK’s intelligence gathering centre, GCHQ in Cheltenham. Yesterday, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the intelligence watchdog, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), said he expected a response from GCHQ over claims that it had gathered data from US internet companies which had been obtained under a new US law. Concerns: Spy centre GCHQ, Government Communications Headquarters, in Cheltenham . Sir Malcolm said: ‘The ISC is aware of the allegations. The ISC will be receiving a full report from GCHQ very shortly and will decide what action needs to be taken.’ But a report commissioned by the European Union warned in January that the law allowed US security agencies to demand to read our emails or see social media pages if they could show that the information might be of value to US interests. The report said that the draconian powers, which apply to all US companies, are a ‘grave risk’ to the rights of EU citizens. The report authors, who included Caspar . Bowden, a former head of privacy at Microsoft, say data held by US . internet companies ‘becomes liable to mass-surveillance – for purposes . of furthering the foreign affairs of the US’. Police have stored details of 15 billion journeys made by motorists on a ‘Big Brother’ database that even chief constables admit raises privacy concerns. As many as 8,000 cameras are automatically taking photos of 26 million number plates every day in a bid to track criminals. Officers can keep the images taken on the Automatic Number Place Recognition (ANPR) system for two years. But following pressure from the Home Secretary and data watchdogs, police chiefs concede that blanket use of the cameras ‘impacts significantly on the privacy of law-abiding citizens’. Now the Association of Chief Police Officers has set out 14 ‘golden rules’ to ensure use of the cameras is lawful, which could mean fewer journeys being stored. Nick Pickles, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘If police forces are abusing their access to ANPR data by ignoring data protection law then officials have some serious questions to answer.’ The document says EU citizens should be warned that the information will be freely accessible to the US authorities and calls for EU citizens to be given the same rights as US citizens in American courts. Leaks last week claimed that GCHQ accessed data on the internet activity of Britons obtained by a US spying programme called Prism. America’s National Security Agency is able to access the internet data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendment Act which is designed ‘to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-US persons located outside the United States’. It is claimed that the NSA and the FBI have accessed the systems of nine of the world’s top internet companies including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo and Skype. According to the leaked document, ‘special programmes for GCHQ exist for focused Prism processing’ – suggesting the British agency may have been receiving material from a part of the programme specifically designed to meet its needs. MPs expressed concern. Senior Tory David Davis said it was difficult to reconcile GCHQ’s statement that it was subject to proper scrutiny with the fact that Parliament had no knowledge of the activity. ‘Since nobody knew it was happening at all there is no possibility of complaint,’ he said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘It is important for the UK intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad, particularly in vital counter-terror work. However, there also have to be legal safeguards in place.’ Shami Chakrabarti, of civil rights group Liberty, said: ‘These reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale.’ But Tory MP Ben Wallace, a former British Army intelligence officer, said: ‘I cannot see what all the fuss is about. Communications data is an essential tool in countering terrorism.

These amazing photographs show NASA astronauts hard at work training for missions in space - in the world's largest pool. The U.S. space agency has built a swimming pool 10 times as large as an Olympic pool in an attempt to prepare astronauts for the experience of weightlessness. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory contains 6.2million gallons of water, used by astronauts in full space suits to carry out the tasks they will be expected to perform in space. Scroll down for video . Training: NASA astronauts practice carrying out their duties while weightless in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in Texas . Rehearsal: The pool replicates the unfamiliar condition of weightlessness on board the International Space Station . The pool stretches for more than 200ft and in places reaches a depth of 40ft - roughly the same as four double-decker buses stacked on top of one another. Hundreds of astronauts have used the state-of-the-art training device ahead of missions aboard the International Space Station. Among those who have trained at the lab is Chris Hadfield, who shot to fame over the past few months with a series of popular YouTube videos chronicling his experiences in space. The NBL is located at the Sonny Carter Training Facility, near NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Simulation: Neutral buoyancy, where objects neither float nor sink, is close to the lack of gravity experienced in space . Hard at work: An astronaut in a full space suit trains at the NBL, which is 40ft deep and the size of 10 Olympic swimming pools . Familiar sight: Astronauts work on a capsule similar to those fitted to a rocket which transport operatives to the ISS . It consists of a large indoor pool of water in which astronauts perform simulated tasks in preparation for upcoming missions, such as spacewalks. Neutral buoyancy is the term used to describe something that has an equal tendency to float as it does sink - providing practically the same situation as being truly weightless. The walls surrounding the pool are six foot thick and support nearly 26,000 tons of water which has been filtered and heated to 86F. Since the mid-1960s, neutral buoyancy has been an invaluable tool for testing procedures, developing hardware and training astronauts. Going in: An astronaut stands on a platform prior to being lowered into the NBL for training . Taking a breather: An astronaut surfaces after spending time in the lab preparing for a future mission to outer space . Monitoring: NASA staff watch the progress of a simulated space walk in the NBL using a bank of video screens . Astronauts require preparation for weightlessness because of the difficulty of operating equipment and moving around in such an unfamiliar environment. Many people who travel outside the Earth's atmosphere suffer from 'space sickness', which leads to nausea and vertigo. When astronauts spend extended periods in space, they can suffer more serious conditions such as muscle atrophy due to the difficulty of exercising properly.","Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in Texas is the size of 10 Olympic swimming pools reaching depth of 40ft .

Eleven spectators have been injured after a motorbike crashed into the crowd during the final day's racing at the Isle of Man TT. One person was seriously hurt after Sheff Pack Kawasaki rider Jonathan Howarth had an accident on the first lap of the race. Howarth, making his debut at the event, crashed at the Bray Hill section of the mountain course, bringing out the red flags to halt the senior race. Crash scene: The Kawasaki race bike of Jonathan Howarth lies at the scene of the crash on Bray Hill where 11 spectators were hurt . The annual Isle of Man TT and Manx Grand Prix have claimed the lives of 50 racers and spectators since the year 2000. Japanese racer Yoshinari Matsushit, 43, was the most recent person to die when he crashed in a qualifying session 10 days ago. In the last 13 years, 45 riders have been killed, two spectators and three officials. The Manx Grand Prix is held in August and is for amateur riders. Last year racers Trevor Ferguson and Steve Osborne died in the August event. In 2007, two spectators and a rider were killed in the Isle of Man TT. Dean Jacob, 33, and Gregory Kenzig, 52, from Australia were both died after being hit at the side of the track. Racer Marc Ramsbotham, 34, also died at the scene. Although the 29-year-old British rider was not hurt, the Isle of Man TT official Twitter feed reported that several spectators had been injured as a result of the crash. Many of the injured were taken to the nearby Nobles Hospital. None of the people involved are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries . Bray Hill is one of the most difficult bits of the 37.7 mile race track which snakes its way round the islands. Riders have to bend to the left as they travel downhill before flicking to the right as it rises again with a bump at the bottom of the hill. The best riders tackle the section at speeds approaching 200mph. Eyewitness Phil Bancroft Tweeted that several people were badly hurt and he had been hit by bits of broken bike. He wrote: 'I'm ok. Just. Shaking like a leaf. Bike heading for me. Just ducked. Hit by bits of bike. Ok thou. 'Some people badly injured. I'm off home the long way around.' An Isle of Man police spokesman said: 'As you will be aware there was an incident in racing on the first lap of the senior at Bray Hill which involved the race being red flagged. 'A number of casualties were taken to hospital. Injuries in some cases were serious but are not believed to be life threatening. 'We are now looking at a 4.30pm start for racing, a full six laps which will take us obviously over two hours of racing. 'It looks like it will be 7pm before we get the roads open.' The crash happened today just 10 days after Japanese rider Yoshinari Matsushita was killed during qualifying at the event. Crash scene: Map shows the 37.7 mile route of the Isle of Man TT course.

Trouble: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is facing accusations that he leaked details of the 'Plebgate' affair to the press . Britain's top police officer was facing further questions last night over allegations that he leaked details of the police inquiry into the ‘Plebgate’ affair. In a letter to a senior Home Office official, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted briefing journalists about the row involving Tory MP Andrew Mitchell days before media reports claimed there was no evidence that officers lied about being insulted by the former Cabinet  Minister. The letter emerged after friends of the MP used a Freedom of Information request to Scotland Yard to obtain details of the meetings with journalists. In it, Sir Bernard also admits he failed to keep any record of what was said during the meetings. Last night, friends of Mr Mitchell said the Commissioner still had questions to answer over the handling of the investigation and what was said to journalists. One MP said: ‘It is of concern that no police note was made of exactly what was said so that we have to rely on Bernard Hogan-Howe’s own personal recollection.’ In the letter to Stephen Rimmer, the Home Office’s most senior policing official, the Commissioner says he was present at two meetings involving five newspapers and the Press Association on March 25 and 26 this year. He writes that he told journalists he was ‘concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of Downing Street on  19 September this could result in reputational damage for all concerned’. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as Chief Whip following an altercation in Downing Street in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘******* plebs’ – something he strongly denies. The force began an investigation, called Operation Alice, into the Plebgate officers and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers. Row: Andrew Mitchell was alleged to have called officer '******* plebs' The saga took a further twist at the end of March – only days after Sir Bernard’s two meetings with journalists – when it was claimed police had briefed newspapers on the investigation before a report on the inquiry was handed to prosecutors, and that it exonerated the officers. But in the letter, the Commissioner says that he had not seen the police file. He tells Mr Rimmer: ‘As Commissioner, it is not normal practice for me to see our investigative files and I can say categorically that I have not seen the file relating to Operation Alice. ‘Therefore, I was not in a position to brief on the contents. ‘I am briefed on the broad progress of an investigation, particularly the timetable and any significant resource implications.’ He adds that in the course of answering journalists’ questions: ‘I did say that I was concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of Downing Street on 19 September this could result in reputational damage for all concerned. We could therefore be left in the position of having one person’s word against another.’ But the Commissioner conceded that neither he nor the press officer accompanying him to the meetings took any notes – something he  said was ‘usual practice’ when meeting with editors for ‘non-reportable briefings’. A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said that no decision has been taken on whether any of the officers will face charges over Plebgate. Downing Street spat: Mr Mitchell is alleged to have launched into an extraordinary four-letter rant when security officers asked him to take his bicycle out through a side entrance calling them 'f****** plebs' Hitting back: The revelation came as Mr Mitchell's lawyer confirmed he has launched a libel lawsuit against The Sun which first broke the story to face 'the campaign of vilification by the newspaper against him'","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted to briefing journalist about the Andrew Mitchell row .

A family has launched a campaign to make their health insurers cover the costs of a cochlear implant for their six-month-old son after the company said the life-changing procedure was 'elective'. Nixon 'Wildcard' Hunter, from Tustin, California, was born prematurely and has battled jaundice, gastric tube surgery and open heart surgery. He also suffers from profound hearing loss. After the family's insurance company, United Healthcare, covered procedures needed to overcome his other health issues, Nixon's parents were stunned when they would not pay for the implant. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Nixon Hunter was born premature and has undergone open heart surgery and gastric tube surgery . His mother Stephanie and father Rich learned that the expensive procedure was considered an 'elective surgery' and was not covered by the policy, KTLA reported. 'The fact that my son can't hear me - it . breaks my heart,' Stephanie Hunter told KTLA. 'That I can't sing to him to soothe him - it breaks me up . inside.' They have now launched a campaign on change.org to make insurance companies cover the procedure, which doctors say would help him to hear in his right ear. They note on the page that the procedure would cost around $125,000 for each ear - which is not something Mr Hunter, an EMT, can afford, he said. Loved: He now needs a cochlear implant but insurance company won't cover it, his mother (right) said . Still smiling: Nixon needed multiple surgeries after he was born - and the insurance company covered those . A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound. It will not cure deafness, but is a . prosthetic substitute for hearing. The sooner a child receives the . implant, the less therapy will be needed to help him or her learn . speech. The device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours. It involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear. The devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve. The currents activate the nerve, which sends a signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing. In the U.S., around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received them. 'The fact that United Healthcare is calling the ability to hear an elective surgery is just unbelievable to us,' Rich Hunter said. 'When you go with a particular . healthcare plan through your company and pay for it, the expectation is . that the procedures your family needs the most are going to be covered,' Mrs Hunter added. But the insurance company said the family are best to take up the issue with their HR department. The insurance is provided through Stephanie's employer and United Healthcare said the procedure is covered only for its fully insured members. But the representative said he was looking into the case and hoped to be able to help the family. For the Hunters, it's about a wider issue - and their desire to help other people across the country in need of the procedure. 'When . we found out that more than 90 per cent of commercial health plans in . the country do cover cochlear implant surgery, we decided to start this . petition to fight for Nixon and other families like ours who aren't . being treated fairly by insurance companies when it comes to hearing . needs and services,' they write on the petition. 'This is a decision we think is best for our son and we should have the option to choose it for him. Heartbreak: Stephanie Hunter became emotional as she said she hates how her son can't hear her voice . Hopeful: His parents have now started an online petition in the hopes the company will cover the costs . 'United Healthcare should change their policy and allow Nixon, and other children like him, to have the gift of hearing. No one should have to go through what we have, especially when learning is so huge at Nixon's age.' More than 37,000 people have signed the petition so far.

A county prosecutor has been fired after admitting to posing as a murder suspect's ex-girlfriend on Facebook in a bid to get the alibi witnesses to change their story. Aaron Brockler, who formerly worked for Cuyahoga County in Ohio, insisted he had done nothing wrong as his intention was simply to get a killer off the street by revealing that the alibi was made up. 'Law enforcement, including prosecutors, . have long engaged in the practice of using a ruse to obtain the truth,' Brockler told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'I think the public . is better off for what I did.' He said that the alibi witnesses had indeed said their initial stories were not true. Tactics: Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Aaron Brockler, left, was fired after posing as a fictitious ex-girlfriend of murder suspect Damon Dunn, right, in a bid to get his alibi witnesses to reveal if their story was true . But County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty, who fired Brockler, called the actions 'unethical' and said he had brought shame on the office. Brockler, 35, was the lead prosecutor in the case of Damon Dunn, 29, who was accused of gunning down Kenneth 'Blue' Adams in May 2012 at a car wash where the victim worked. During preparation stages for the trial, Dunn provided attorneys with the names of two women he said could testify he was on the other side of the city at the time of the shooting. 'Unless I could break this guy's alibi a . murderer might be walking on the street,' Brockler told the Plain Dealer. 'There was such a small window . of opportunity, I had to act fast.' Denial: Brockler, with his wife, said he had done nothing wrong as he was trying to get a killer off the streets . Plot: He said that the women had changed their stories after speaking with the fake girlfriend . He said that he used Facebook to chat with the two witnesses, posing as a fictitious former girlfriend who he said had given birth's to Dunn's child. Brockler said the women were enraged at learning this. He met with the women the next day, but did not reveal he had been the one speaking to them. Brockler claimed that one of the women said she hadn't been with Dunn at the time of the murder after all, while the other said: 'This is bogus, I'm not going to lie for him.' He told Dunn's defense lawyer that the alibi had fallen apart and saved copies of the Facebook chats in a file, with no intention of hiding them, he told the Plain Dealer. He then left the office for medical leave for two months and, during that time, was called by the assistant county prosecutor who was filling in his role.

Brockler said they had been him and the colleague told supervisors. The Facebook transcripts were given to a Cleveland homicide detective, who traced their creation to Brockler's computer in the Justice Center. Brockler had meetings with supervisors and was open about what he had done. He was fired from the position and the Attorney General's office has taken over the case. 'By creating false . evidence, lying to witnesses as well as another prosecutor, Aaron . Brockler has damaged the prosecution's chances in a murder case where a . totally innocent man was killed at his work,' McGinty said. Kicked out: A colleague found copies of the Facebook conversations and when Brockler said they were his, he was fired from the Cuyahoga County Prosecutors office in Ohio, pictured . But Brockler insists he has been unfairly dismissed and that he had simply been motivated by sympathy for the victim's mother. 'I made a promise to her that he wasn’t going . to walk out the front door of the courthouse,' he said. 'This was a horrible killer . and I didn’t want him to get out and go kill someone else's son.'

They already own two other bars in the city - Bedlam, a straight-friendly Victorian-themed cocktail bar and Eastern Bloc, a Russian-themed gay bar, both located in the East Village. ‘Finalizing this deal was a long process and sometimes very challenging – the former tenant Vintage Bar was there for 17 years and did not want to leave,’ James Famularo, a broker representing Oxido told The New York Observer. Ninth Avenue is becoming increasingly desirable for bars and restaurants because of its location not far from Times Square and the Theater District.

A high school prank backfired after a 15-year-old boy was arrested for allegedly spiking a batch of marinara sauce with Da Bomb hot sauce. Three canteen workers had to be taken to hospital, and other students and staff at the public school in Chicago reported rashes and trouble breathing after inhaling fumes from the sauce last month. The teenager was charged as a juvenile for five counts of misdemeanor battery - and also ruined future pranks for his classmates after the school installed security cameras. According to ABC News, the teenager . allegedly sneaked into the canteen before the first lunch break and . added the Da Bomb sauce to the food. 'A student then went through the . food line and purchased spaghetti with marinara sauce, and after sitting . down and taking his first bite, found it intolerably hot,' Highland Park Police Deputy . Chief George Pfutzenreuter said. Canteen staff removed the sauce, but . when a couple of them tasted it they started to feel the side effects of . the super-hot sauce. 'Several staff and students reported . reactions to the sauce, including coughing, wheezing, shortness of . breath and skin rashes,' school spokesman Natalie . Kaplan told ABC News. Tests have not yet indicated which strength of Da Bomb was added to the sauce, but the hottest - Da Bomb Final Answer - is about the same strength as some self-defense pepper sprays. It measures 1,500,000 on the Scoville Scale. Police grade pepper spray is about 5.3 million on the scale. The Da Bomb sauce is so hot that the company sells it in a locked box. Before purchasing it online, consumers must read a waiver that reiterates the strength of the sauce, said to be more than 100 times hotter than a jalapeno pepper. Da Bomb also warns against using the potent sauce near children or pets. The website describes Final Answer as the hottest sauce in its line, adding that is radioactive in strength. It also says it should be used as a food additive, one drop at a time, before warning: 'Do NOT eat this sauce straight out of the jar! You will die.' For the canteen staff who sampled the spiked marinara sauce, that must have been similar to how they felt. They had to be taken to hospital after just breathing in the fumes from the sauce. The Final Answer sauce measures 1,500,000 on the Scoville scale. The scale for measuring the heat from peppers was invented by Wilbur Scoville in 1912. When he first started using the scale, he used people to taste peppers and chiles and then measure how many parts of sugar water it took to stop the burning sensation. The system has become more refined since, using a system to test for capsaicin in the peppers. Feel the heat: Chicago's Highland Park School has installed security cameras after lunch was spiked . The student said to be behind the prank has not been named. He was arrested and charged after the school contacted a poison control department. In an email sent to staff and students the school said that a hot sauce was 'inappropriately and deliberately' put into the marinara sauce, affecting several students and staff, according to NBC Chicago. To prevent further high school japes, the school has installed a security camera in the canteen.","Da Bomb super strength sauce dropped into marinara sauce .

He's famous for his brutal putdowns, the worst of which have been directed at Pippa Middleton, Michelle Obama and Adele among others. And now the best of Karl Lagerfeld's quotes are to be immortalised in a new book. The World According To Karl is the brainchild of Patrick Mauriés, Jean-Christophe Napias and Sandrine Gulbenkian, and will feature illustrations by artist Charles Ameline. But the star of the show is to be a hand-picked collection of Lagerfeld's bitchiest bons mots, including lines such as: 'Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants.' Brutal: Chanel Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld is famous for his catty quips and bitchy comments . Although the Chanel designer wasn't involved with writing the book, which is due to be released in September, it does allegedly have his seal of approval. In recent years, Lagerfeld has become almost as famous for his quips as he has for his design prowess, having taken a swipe at everyone from the entire nation of Greece to, yes, the younger MIddleton sister. In the days following the royal wedding in 2011, the designer gave an interview to a German magazine, during the course of which he revealed his dislike of Middleton Minor. He said: 'Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette and she is the right girl for that boy. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties. 'On the other hand, her sister struggles. I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.' He followed that rattle of invective with a critique of the fashion on show during the celebrations, saying: 'This was not a collection, this was the choices of this kind of woman for this kind of ceremony: the bad proportions, the ugly hats, the short skirts on fat legs.' Fat is a favourite topic of Karl's, who caused outrage a year later when he took a pop at British singer, Adele, describing her as 'a little too fat', although he drew the sting slightly by calling her beautiful and adding that her voice is 'divine'. Not content with upsetting Adele and the Middletons, he then went on to ask whether any part of singer Lana del Rey was real, before surpassing himself by offending the whole of Russia. 'If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly,' he quipped. 'There are a few handsome ones, like Naomi Campbell's boyfriend, but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men.' The victims: Both Michelle Obama and Pippa Middleton have been on the receiving end of a Karl quip . Another country to feel the sting of Karl's tongue was Greece, after the designer weighed into the debate on the nation's financial crisis and corruption problems. 'Greece needs to work on a cleaner image,' he advised. 'It's a big problem, as they have this reputation of being so corrupt. 'You can't be sure the money will go where it's supposed to go. Nobody wants Greece to disappear, but they have really disgusting habits. Italy as well.' He's even had a crack at the Press, most recently at Newsweek, whose editor, Tina Brown, ran a story that claimed Lagerfeld was overrated. 'First of all, Tina Brown's magazine is not doing well at all,' he riposted. 'She is dying. I'm sorry for Tina Brown, who was such a success at Vanity Fair, to go down with a s***ty little paper like this. I'm sorry.' Collection: The new book, which is out in September, includes 50 of Karl's best and bitchiest quotes . On short, unattractive people: 'Life is not a beauty contest, some [ugly people] are great. What I hate is nasty, ugly people... the worst is ugly, short men. Women can be short, but for men it is impossible. It is something that they will not forgive in life... they are mean and they want to kill you.' On people who complain about thin models: 'They are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly.' On former friend and Chanel muse, Inès de la Fressange: 'I wish her all the luck in the world, just so long as I don't have to see her anymore or hear her spoken about.' On pop star, Seal: 'I am no dermatologist but I wouldn't want his skin. Mine looks better than his. He is covered in craters.' On Heidi Klum: 'I don't know Heidi Klum. She was never known in France. Claudia Schiffer also doesn't know who she is.' On fur: 'It is farmers who are nice to the cows and the pigs and then kill them. It's even more hypocritical than hunters. At least the hunters don't flatter the animals....I don't like that people butcher animals, but I don't like them to butcher humans either, which is apparently very popular in the world.' On the Queen: 'She looks a little bit like her grandmother - a more smiley version. ""In terms of what she wears, she's come into herself a little bit more - whatever that is.' On Michelle Obama: 'I don't understand the change of hair. I adore Madame Obama, I love her. But there is a news reader at LCI which has this haircut...Frankly, this doesn't suit her. The fringe was a bad idea, it's not good.' On Adele: 'The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.' On Lana del Rey: 'Is she a construct with all her implants?'","Pippa Middleton and Adele have both been on the receiving end of Karl's wit .

This week it's one hundred years since Emily Wilding Davison died at Epsom becoming a martyr for the cause of women's rights. While her name, and that of Women's Social and Political Union founder Emmeline Pankhurst, have gone down in history, there are countless other women who fought for the cause who have since been forgotten. Without the spirit and actions of these brave females, British women today wouldn't enjoy many of the freedoms they now take for granted - from being able to vote, to being able to wear what they want. Hundred year anniversary: Emily Wilding Davison became a martyr for the cause of women's rights after she died from injuries sustained at Epsom . Votes for women: As the founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, Emmeline Pankhurst's name has also gone down in history but her great-granddaughter said the efforts of other women should not be forgotten . Now author Lucinda Hawksley is giving these women a voice again with her new book 'March, Women, March'. The . books tells the story of the women's movement in Britain from the . publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of . Women to them finally getting equal voting rights with men in 1928. Dr . Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline Pankhurst, provides a . foreword to the book in which she calls for the women's movement to be . remembered beyond her own family's contribution. She . writes: 'Too often nowadays, the complexity and multi-dimensional . aspect of the mid-Victorian and Edwardian women’s movement in the UK is . boxed into a few iconic images and words. High up on the list are the . Suffragettes, “Purple, white and green”, the Pankhursts, militancy and . the 'Cat and Mouse Act'. Influencing fashion: Models Lizzie Siddall and Janey Morris championed for the loose-fitting, long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like Rossetti to become acceptable wear . Fashion statement: The Rational Dress Movement campaigned for women to wear clothing, like that shown in this engraving from 1882, that freed women from the painful constraints of corsets and cages . WHO KNEW? The Daily Mail coined the term 'suffragette' to distinguish the militant WSPU activists from the more genteel suffragists of the NUWSS . 'These words and images have been . absorbed into the British psyche and collective memory - they define, . but in doing so, they also shrink the women’s rights movement. There . were so many other women who pioneered a whole raft of social, political . and economic changes and who are now largely forgotten. We need to . remember them.' Dr  Pankhurst calls on women such as Marion . Wallace Dunlop - who staged the first hunger strike that was to become a . trademark action for the suffragettes - and Lizzie Siddall - who . campaigned for women to be able to wear comfortable clothing - to be . remembered. Ms Hawksley . explains their contribution to the women's movement, as well as many . others who have since become a footnote in history, in her book. Fight: Suffragettes endured hunger strikes and force feeding to enable women today to have many of the rights they now take for granted . Deeds not words: Emmeline Pankhurst is arrested outside Buckingham Palace during a demonstration in 1914 . Long-term health consequences: Some of the women who were force fed in prison suffered for years to come . Pioneer: Marion Wallace Dunlop was the first to go on hunger strike . Lizzie Siddall was a model for the . famous Pre-Raphaelite painters but she had brains as well as beauty. Along with other women such as America's Amelia Bloomer who shocked . Victorians by wearing trousers (but didn't actually invent bloomers that . were given her name), she campaigned for women to be able to cast off . the restrictive national dress of corsets. Lizzie and Janey Morris championed the loose-fitting, long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like Rossetti. Ms . Hawksley writes: 'Both women made their own clothes and were . influential in creating a style commonly known as Pre-Raphaelite.' She . adds that in Victorian society, this style of dress was seen as . 'shocking and unseemly' but the women were unrepentant in what they wore . - despite often being sneered at by corset-wearing women. In 1881, the 'Rational Dress Society' was formed in London protesting against: 'any fashion in dress that either deforms the figure, impeded movement of body or in any way tends to injury health.' As medical studies began to prove that corsets could intend damage internal organs, the cage crinoline, the bustle and the corset began to fall out of fashion and was no longer required wear for women. In the early 20th century, the women's movement really began to move a pace as the WSPU began using militant tactics to get noticed including attacking both politicians and property. As the women began to be imprisoned for their actions, the hunger strikes - for which the suffragettes became synonymous - were born. The suffering of the women who went on hunger strike and were painfully force-fed is well-known but perhaps little known is the women who started it all. The artist Marion Wallace Dunlop was the first to go on hunger strike after she was arrested for 'wilful damage' in 1909 for attaching a 'bill of rights' to a wall in the palace of Westminster. Ms Hawksley writes: 'Although the WSPU had not known beforehand that Wallace Dunlop would start this form of protest, the union rapidly adopted it as its own.' Fight for justice: Lucinda Hawksley's book chronicles the women's rights movement . The book relates in shocking detail the degrading and painful form the force-feeding took for the women on hunger strikes with many suffering from long-term health problems as a result. But suffragette Annie Kenny summed up the feeling after she was released from prison for  disrupting an election rally. 'They have not tamed us,' she said. 'We have more fire in us than ever before.' In her book, Ms Hawksley fully explores the impact the Pankhursts and Davison had on the progress of women's rights but she also writes about lesser known heroic figures who fought social and political injustice. For instance, writer Caroline Norton fought the legal system to obtain a divorce from her abusive husband - and in doing so changed for the better the laws that govern divorce and child custody today. She was instrumental in the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women’s Property Act 1870; she also helped to change the laws governing working women’s rights. Meanwhile, feisty widow Dora Montefiore fought not only the archaic laws concerning the guardianship of children, but also began the hugely successful campaign: ‘No taxation without representation’. Dr Pankhurst sums up the impact all these women made in her foreword. She writes: 'The determination of a few and the persistent support of the many, despite huge setbacks, slowly but surely, led to a transformed British landscape in which “liberty and justice” became more than just a dream.

Designer department store Harvey Nichols likes to push the boundaries when it comes to getting noticed. Previous marketing activities have included a . model wetting herself with excitement at the prospect of the shop's . seasonal sale, a 'walk of shame' television advert, and beefy bulldogs being touted around . in pricey handbags. But Harvey Nichols' new campaign for the fashionable Summer Sale, is tongue-in-cheek and somewhat hilarious. Keep calm! Harvey Nichols have unveiled its new campaign for their famous Summer Sale, with a play on the famous phrase, 'run round like a headless chicken' Playing on the famous phrase, 'run round like a headless chicken', the campaign created by adam&eveDDB, features headless chickens dressed in key items from the Spring/Summer 2013 collections, alongside the strap-line, 'The Harvey Nichols Sale. Try to stay calm'. Julia Bowe, Group Press and Marketing Director at Harvey Nichols said: 'Harvey Nichols is world-renowned for its fabulous sale, with eager shoppers descending en masse to their nearest store in their efforts to lay their hands on our amazing reductions. 'In humorous reaction to the (often-irrational) excitement sale time engenders, we have developed this campaign to capture the frantic effect that the Harvey Nichols sale can have upon our customers. Cluck cluck: The tongue-in-cheek campaign, created by adam&eveDDB, features headless chickens dressed in key items from the Spring/Summer 2013 collections . 'Using the analogy of a ‘headless chicken’ for the creative concept really captured this in a fun, light hearted way. 'You can never underestimate that feeling of finding the perfect sale purchase and with discounts of up to 50 per cent off - it is enough to excite and overwhelm even the most composed shopper in us all!' Photographed by Daniel Stier, the campaign is illustrated through three different executions for womenswear, menswear and accessories, with the oh-so-stylish chickens sporting an MSGM lace dress, a Zegna sport jacket and Valentino clutch. Keep calm: The Harvey Nichols campaign tagline is 'Try To Stay Calm' and captures a chicken in full flight mode suggesting that they have struggled to do just that .

But it seems that the store have moved away from the controversy to have some fanciful fun with their advertising campaigns. Crass? The Harvey Nichols summer sale 2012 mailout was meant as a bit of 'light-hearted fun', say the store - but some sensitive shoppers took offence at the image, taking to Twitter to criticise the flyers .

The BBC has been criticised for allowing staff to mob the Queen and film her on their mobile phones as she toured its revamped HQ. Buckingham Palace sources said they were struck by ‘how chaotic’ Friday’s visit to Broadcasting House in Central London appeared. They had been led to believe that staff would remain at their desks and ‘carry on as normal’ in a professional manner – but at every turn she was met by a forest of raised smartphones and tablets. Guided tour: The Queen visited the BBC to officially open the new £1 billion studios in Portland Place, central London . Newsflash: Presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie Long turn round to find the Queen has turned up during one their bulletins . Caught unawares: The newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background . Joining in: Radio 4 presenters Sian Williams (left) and James Naughtie sit alongside the Queen . Speech: Speaking on Radio 4 and the World Service she said how she had been to the original Broadcasting House with her parents before the war and then later before her Coronation, with Prince Philip . Happy: The Queen looked relaxed as Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is 'progressing satisfactorily' after his operation . One observer said staff followed their 87-year-old visitor around  like ‘zombies’. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, said: ‘It is just depressing that these people don’t know how to behave, it is very rude and offensive. ‘The BBC should have told their staff there should be absolutely no filming on mobile phones. I’d be livid if I was the Queen. ‘The bits I saw on television looked quite bizarre and completely out of control. I think the BBC should have given their staff lessons on how to behave before she arrived.’ The Duke of Edinburgh was said to be ‘progressing satisfactorily’ yesterday as he continued to recover in hospital from exploratory abdominal surgery on Friday. Prince’s Philip’s doctor, Professor John Cunningham, visited him for 30 minutes on his third day at the London Clinic. The Prince, who will be 92 tomorrow, is expected to recuperate at the clinic in Marylebone for two weeks. The illness is not thought to involve his heart or bladder – which have caused him problems in the past. Buckingham Palace said the surgery had been pre-arranged. Not so long ago, the only things held aloft during Royal visits were flags, modestly flicked from side-to-side, often no higher than the neck. In recent years taking snaps and videos on mobile phones has become commonplace, but normally during outdoor walkabouts rather than indoors. As Princess Elizabeth, the Queen accompanied her father George VI to Broadcasting House in 1939. And during last week’s visit she recalled in an address that she ‘came again with the Duke of Edinburgh shortly before the Coronation in 1953’. Today’s BBC newsroom – with its casually attired staff and sea of smartphones – would have been a far cry from those days when decorum was paramount. ‘I think they should have shown far more respect,’ said etiquette expert Angela Marshall. ‘It must have been very disturbing for the Queen. ‘And, let’s face it, these people could have still have had photos. This was all taking place in the BBC, after all. The trouble is people want to get their own pictures on Twitter to show they were there.’She was right. No sooner had the Queen departed than staff were plastering their souvenir snaps across social media. Asked about the criticism, a BBC spokesman said the visit ‘was a  significant day for the BBC and  staff were eager to join in the  celebration and give Her Majesty a warm welcome’. Showstopper: Presenters on BBC Radio 4 do their best to maintain their cool despite their star guest . Drawing a crowd: The Queen maintained her usual calm as her appearance caused quite a stir at the BBC . On set: Her Majesty looking pleased as she walks past the Tardis during her tour . Stoic: The Queen remained utterly composed, despite not having Prince Philip by her side . Queen of the screen: Actress Jenny Agutter introduces herself to Her Majesty in front of a huge mural of Morecambe and Wise . Dutiful: Newsreader Huw Edwards bows as he shakes Her Majesty's hand . All smiles: The presenters turned around and laughed when they realised Britain's monarch was standing behind them in the studio . Chat: She spoke to lead singer Danny O'Donoghue of The Script, and they briefly discussed Glastonbury, with her Majesty saying he should be careful of the mud . Royal performance: The Script played a cover of David Bowie's track 'Heroes' which became a theme song for the Olympics . Reflection: Only on once occasion did the Queen look to have something on her mind as she sat in the BBC's Live Lounge . Famous fan: The Queen is known to be a fan of classical music but appeared to be listening intently to The Script . Nice to meet you: The Queen says hello to Sir Bruce Forsyth with Dvid Dimbleby, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman . Guest of honour: The Queen was already six when Broadcasting House first opened in 1932 . Royal welcome: Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust (centre) and the BBC's new director general Tony Hall are ecstatic to meet Her Majesty on the red carpet . Royal arrival: Crowds turned out to greet Her Majesty as she arrived at Broadcasting House, five minutes away from where Prince Philip is in hospital . Pleased to see her: Flag-waving crowds turned out to wish Her Majesty well as she came to visit the BBC's £1bn home .","Buckingham Palace describe Queen's visit as 'chaotic'

Authorities in northern Arizona say a 4-year-old boy has accidentally shot and killed his father at a Prescott Valley home. The 35-year-old man has been identified as Justin Stanfield Thomas, a military veteran who served in the army special forces. Prescott Valley police say the shooting occurred just after noon on Friday. Killed: Justin Thomas, a former military policeman, was accidentally shot dead by his four-year-old son on Friday . Great dad: Thomas was he was an Iraq War veteran and a former member of the Army's Green Beret . He and his young son were visiting from Phoenix and were at a friend's house. Police say the boy somehow found a gun in the home's living room and accidentally fired it when a bullet hit his father, who was rushed to a hospital where he died. Jeremy Hart who lives next door and knew all the parties involved explained that his neighbour kept a loaded gun for protection. The visit was a surprise which may explain why the gun was not locked up or secured. Detectives are calling it a tragic mistake.

John Dudding, of Plymouth, Devon, suffered a severe reaction after being given a penicillin-based injection at Derriford Hospital in the city - and died one week before his daughter’s wedding . Now she is suing the hospital for clinical negligence, claiming the penicillin allergy was clearly labelled on her father's medical chart - but could not be seen because there was a Post-it note in the way. Treatment: John Dudding, of Plymouth, Devon, suffered a severe reaction after being given a penicillin-based injection at Derriford Hospital (file picture) in the city and died one week before his daughter's wedding . Kim Tremaine, 54, said her father was also wearing a red wrist band to warn he had allergies - but claimed nobody rolled up his pyjama sleeve to check. Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Derriford Hospital, has admitted the ‘serious drug error’. Mrs Tremaine said: ‘In my opinion Derriford Hospital killed my father and did very little to save him. My dad didn’t go in there ill enough to die. The care he received was appalling, disgraceful.’ Mr Dudding died in February last year and his daughter said the drugs blunder happened three days after he was admitted having suffered a fall at home.

But now actor Tom Hollander is set to ditch his dog collar to play hell-raising, womanising poet Dylan Thomas in a new drama charting the weeks of drink-fuelled excess leading up to his death. Hollander, 45, will appear opposite former Shameless star Anne-Marie Duff, who plays his fiery wife Caitli, in A Poet In New York. The 75-minute drama will be screened on BBC2 next year to mark the centenary of the poet’s birth. Man of God: Tom Hollander with his on-screen wife Olivia Coleman in Rev . New angle: Now Hollander is set to portray womanising poet Dylan Thomas, pictured here back in the day with his wife Caitlin . Written by Andrew Davies, who adapted Bleak House and Pride And Prejudice for TV, A Poet In New York will focus on Thomas’s final weeks in 1953 when he was living a rock star-style existence while on a reading tour of the United States. Davies said: ‘He was like a rock god in America and attracted huge audiences for his readings. There were lots of groupies and he loved the attention. But he was so self-destructive and reckless, and would often be up drinking until five in the morning. ‘He was a terrible man in lots of ways but almost everybody who met him just sort of loved him.‘There would be one-offs with groupies. People would find women for him for the night and they would be queuing up.’ Lothario: Hollander has spoke of how women would queue up to spend a night with poet Dylan Thomas (pictured) The film will also explore Dylan’s tempestuous relationship with Caitlin and highlight his unconventional relationship with John Brinnin. The gay critic was besotted with the writer, who had an extra-marital affair with Brinnin’s assistant Liz Reitell. Actor and comedian Griff Rhys Jones, whose production company is making the drama, said: ‘There is enormous tragedy built into this. Dylan escapes into a bohemian world to get away from his problems. He went on the razzle  in a big way to try to drown out some of his sorrows.’ Thomas was admitted to St Vincent’s Hospital in New York on the morning of November 6 after he became ill following a late-night drinking session.

Video footage of a frail-looking Nelson Mandela surrounded by the South African President and other officials during a photo opportunity has provoked a storm of outrage. The footage was released yesterday and shows the respected former president sat in a chair at his home in Johannesburg. It was the first footage of the 94-year-old since he left hospital on April 6 after suffering from pneumonia. As leaders from the governing African . National Congress arrange themselves around Mandela for a photo . opportunity, an unamused looking Mandela barely moves and never smiles. Scroll down for video . Keeping positive: South African president Jacob Zuma (left) said he was 'really happy' with Mandela's progress. However, this footage caused a storm of outrage in South Africa . Icon: Mandela was South Africa's first black president and is seen by many as the father of the nation . Motionless: Mandela sat up in an armchair with the aid of a cushion, but appeared not to interact with the people around him . The stunt has caused anger in South Africa where many have accused the government of parading the anti-apartheid hero on TV for political gain. As reported by CNN, Twitter user Brent Lindeque wrote: 'After everything Madiba . has done for us this is how they treat him. Like an animal at the zoo. Shame on the ANC!' A radio station in Johannesburg added: 'The way #Madiba was paraded on SABC TV this evening was horrible! Grotesque 'journalism'. All involved should hang their heads in shame!' During the photo opportunity, South African president Jacob Zuma said Mandela was 'in good shape' and 'good spirits' The ANC today rejected criticism of the photograph opportunity. On the mend: The former president is being cared for by a large team of medical experts . Back home: Mandela spent 10 days in hospital earlier this month after coming down with pneumonia . Party spokesman Jackson Mthembu . said the party also stands by its statements that Mandela is in good health and good spirits. He added: 'South Africans are called upon to appreciate that Tata is 94 years old; . he will thus be frail and not as active and energetic as we all fondly . remember him. 'There is no reason to be alarmed by the visuals of an . elderly person who clearly is receiving the necessary care and . attention.' Mandela spent 10 days in hospital . being treated for the illness, which followed an earlier hospitalisation . in December when he developed a lung infection and gallstones. The video shows Mandela sitting . upright in an armchair, surrounded by friends, family, politicians and . medical staff at his home in Johannesburg. It is the first public image of him since Hillary Clinton visited in her role as US secretary of state in August. 'Good spirits': Zuma told SABC News that Mandela was 'really up and about' and in 'good shape' Mandela . - also known as Madiba in South Africa - appears to be virtually . expressionless and does not seem to react to those around him. He is wearing a flamboyant black and white shirt, with a white blanket covering his legs. He looks thinner than usual and pale, with marks on his cheeks that appear to be from a recently removed oxygen mask. But President Zuma insisted he was doing well. Speaking on the doorstep of Mandela's home, he told SABC News: 'The doctors gave us a report and of . course we saw him. He is looking very good, he is in good shape. We had . some conversation with him, we shook hands, we smiled. 'As you can see he . is really up and about and stablised. We're really very happy. We think that . he is fine.' In the video, Zuma jokes and laughs with two officials of the governing African National Congress, some Mandela family members and the former president's medical team, while Mandela stares straight ahead. One of his grandsons cries 'Smile, smile,' as he takes a picture on his mobile phone. He attempts a weak smile but, as the flash goes off, he closes his eyes and purses his lips. The former president is known to dislike camera flashes, as his eyes are sensitive after years of working in the glare of a limestone quarry when he was imprisoned on Robben Island. In a statement, the ANC said Mandela was 'keenly . aware of the goodwill that has been outpouring from the peoples of the . globe as befitting his status as our icon'. The Nobel Peace laureate was imprisoned for 27 years during the apartheid era became the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994.","Former South African president appeared expressionless and gaunt .

Women's leather belts sold by the fashion website ASOS have been recalled after the metal studs in them were found to be radioactive. About 50 of the belts, retailing at £28, are known to have been bought from the company. They were made using cheap contaminated scrap metal in India. The peplum leather belts, which tested positive for Cobalt-60, could injure people if worn for more than 500 hours - and are currently in a radioactive storage facility, an internal company report said. It said that one of the belts tested positive after being pulled by U.S. border control officers, which led to them being withdrawn across the world reported The Guardian. The firm issued a recall in January, but details have slipped out only now and ASOS cannot say how many have been returned. Withdrawal: The peplum leather belts, which tested positive for Cobalt-60, could injure people if worn for more than 500 hours - and are currently in a radioactive storage facility, an internal Asos company report said . But the number of studded belts - which were described in the report called Project Purple Flower as being unsuitable for ‘for public use or possession’ - that have been returned is not yet known. The report, which was produced by an external regulator, said that the incident is ‘quite a common occurrence’ and that during the refining process of scrap metal, ‘orphaned radioactive sources are sometimes accidentally melted at the same time’. This contaminates the process and ‘traps the radioactivity in the metal as an alloy or in suspension’. Haq International, the Indian group which the firm said supplied the belts, has been supplying Asos for more than a year - and allegedly sold 641 radioactive belts to them, reported The Guardian. Retailer: An Asos spokesman said the company 'continues to work with the relevant regulatory authorities and is in dialogue with the supplier and the factory workers involved to ensure a satisfactory outcome' The firm had withheld £64,000 owed to the supplier’s boss Faizan Haq, who said his factory has had to be shut for five months. 'There's no business left, I'm just sitting at home. It's bad and it’s a financial headache' Faizan Haq, supplier Haq International . He said that this has left 18 Indian . workers unemployed at the Royal Ascot Leather factory in Uttar Pradesh - . and that his car has had to be sold so he can hire a legal team. Asos has since offered to pay Mr Haq . £24,000 of the £64,000 he is owed, but he told MailOnline: ‘There's no . business left, I'm just sitting at home. It's bad and it’s a financial . headache.

No other Asos product lines are affected. ‘Asos continues to work with the relevant regulatory authorities and is in dialogue with the supplier and the factory workers involved to ensure a satisfactory outcome.’ The Guardian also reported that Mr Haq has been refused permission to inspect the goods.

Tribunal: Ashley Roberts, 30, claimed one of the airline's finance managers repeatedly made inappropriate comments towards him . A Virgin Atlantic employee was asked by a gay colleague whether he shaved his genitals or liked performing sex acts, an employment tribunal heard. Ashley Roberts, 30, of Crawley, West Sussex, claimed one of the airline’s finance managers repeatedly made inappropriate comments towards him - and even threatened his job security when he spurned his advances. The employee - identified as 'H' for legal reasons - allegedly told Mr Roberts, who is straight and claims he was the victim of sexual harassment, that he liked performing sex acts. He was also asked whether he shaved his chest and genitals, with H telling Mr Roberts that he did, the tribunal was told. On another occasion H is said to have rubbed Mr Roberts's leg while he was sitting next to him in the office and told him he took Viagra to ensure he was constantly aroused. The tribunal in Croydon, south London, heard how Mr Roberts handed a diary of 29 alleged offences to Virgin's human resources department last June. This included one incident when Mr Roberts said H told him ‘your bum looks nice in those jeans’. And as Mr Roberts bent down to pick something up from the floor, H allegedly said: ‘I like your Calvin Klein underwear’. Mr Roberts claims that the sexual misconduct began back in December 2007, at a Christmas meal out with work colleagues. It is alleged that H sat down beside Mr Roberts and asked him if he would like to sit next to him in the office. H then said he liked looking at Mr Roberts because he was ‘perfect’. Mr Roberts told the hearing: ‘He never asked other staff to sit next to him.  They were unusual comments and I thought it was because he was drinking. 'I told a table of work colleagues what he had said and some of the team members said he fancied me.’ In the months after the Christmas meal Mr Roberts said he was often invited outside into the smoking area by H for a ‘catch-up’. But he was regularly asked about his sexual orientation. Mr Roberts said: ‘He asked me if I was single, what I was up to at the weekend, that sort of thing. ‘He told me in the smoking area he was . gay. I told him I wasn't gay, but he obviously did not believe me . because he was making sexual comments towards me.’ During . these conversations the tribunal was told that H put ‘relentless’ pressure on Mr Roberts to go to Mumbai, India, to help train staff. He claims that H said the pair, who both still work for the airline, should share a room on the trip. Allegations: Mr Roberts claimed one of the airline's finance managers repeatedly made inappropriate comments towards him - and even threatened his job security when he spurned his advances (file picture) Mr Roberts said: ‘He said if you don't go to India you're going to lose your job. It was all about trying to make me go to India. When H asked to share a room with me I was mortified.’ However Mr Roberts said he couldn’t go because his mother had cancer - ‘but it was also because of the sexual remarks he made.’ It was after this that Mr Roberts claimed . that H made his time at work ‘difficult’ and often made threatening . comments, even saying he would lose his job. On one occasion H put a bin on Mr . Roberts' desk to highlight the fact he wasn't putting waste in the . correct place, the hearing was told. Another time H organised a meeting to . show staff how to open bags properly, where Mr Roberts's claimed he was . ‘humiliated’ when H told his colleagues that he had been having . difficulties opening the bags. Whilst H admitted both those incidents . happened, he denied all allegations of sexual misconduct. H's solicitor Alexander Robson said Mr . Roberts had made up the claims after his original allegations of . bullying and harassment were rejected due to a lack of evidence. 'I told him I wasn't gay, but he obviously did not believe me because he was making sexual comments towards me' Ashley Roberts . In a witness statement presented to the tribunal, H said: ‘I understood Ashley produced a number of documents together with a statement containing new allegations against me. 'These allegations were that I had made inappropriate comments and actions of a sexual nature towards him. ‘Ashley's allegations that I have treated him less favourably and harassed him on the grounds that I perceived him as gay are entirely malicious, false and have in my opinion been raised with the intention to discredit me. ‘This entire episode has caused me and my team much stress and anxiety over the past 12 months and I would like to finally be in a position to clear my name. I feel like I have been persecuted by Ashley purely on the grounds of my sexual orientation.’ Mr Roberts is claiming sex discrimination and sexual discrimination based on gender and orientation against Virgin Atlantic.

Andrew Parsons, 38, of Bicester, Oxfordshire, beat his wife Janee, 31, and plunged a large kitchen knife into her body 17 times after their marriage broke down when she began seeing another man. The horrific attack was witnessed by one of the couple's two young sons, who begged his father to stop the onslaught and call for an ambulance, Oxford Crown Court was told. Murder: Andrew Parsons (left), 38, of Bicester, Oxfordshire, beat his wife Janee (right), 31, and plunged a large kitchen knife into her body 17 times after their marriage broke down when she began seeing another man . Despite the fact that the entire murder ordeal was recorded on a dictaphone which Mr Parsons had hidden under his wife's bed, he had tried to claim that it was Mrs Parsons who had attacked him. Mr Parsons had argued that he had gone to fetch a towel and returned to find her holding the knife before lunging at him. He claimed he tried to disarm her but when she cut his hand he ‘lost control’. However, a jury of four women and eight men rejected his claims after nine hours of deliberation - and he was told he will be locked up for at least 20 years before being considered for parole. There were tears in the public gallery among both Mrs Parsons’s family - and from Mr Parsons's own relations as David Hislop QC spoke in mitigation. Some members of the jury were also in tears. House: Mr Parsons began picking fights with his wife at their home (pictured) in Bicester, Oxfordshire - with their exchanges escalating until he beat her up and fetched a large knife to kill her . Mr Parsons sank back into his chair . and put his head down as Mr Hislop told the court: ‘This was a very . tragic loss of life. No-one more than Andrew Parsons wishes he could . turn the clock back. Court staff wept and jurors were left visibly distressed as the harrowing audio was played. Parsons had fastened the recording device underneath his wife's bed in the hope of discovering details about her private life. The audio footage, lasting around 45 minutes, began with Parsons telling his wife that she looked ‘fantastic’, as she prepared for a weekend away with Mr Hansens. But the jury then heard an argument brew, with Parsons saying to her: ‘I can't believe you're going straight from me to this guy (Mr Hansens).’ Mrs Parsons is heard to reply: ‘Yes, I am seeing someone - okay? That's all you need to know. That's where it ends. P*** off.’ Some minutes later, the tape is filled with the sound of thumping, followed by screams, after Parsons demanded his wife talk to him, the court heard. Mrs Parsons, said to have been prone on the floor by this point, asks: ‘Are you going to kill me?’ The court heard her screaming, panting for breath, yelling ‘oh my God,’ and calling her husband's name. The couple's young son could then be heard yelling ‘mummy!’ hysterically, adding: ‘I don't like it!’ Mrs Parsons mumbled a few lines of prayer - asking for her sins to be forgiven - before a series of low, dull wails, grunts and coughing. ‘He . loved his wife, perhaps too much - and still does. He will forever have . to live with what he has done. He will forever have to live with the . knowledge that he did what he did in front of his son. ‘He will live every moment, whatever sentence this court passes upon him, in the knowledge that he has single-handedly destroyed not only his life but the lives of others, especially his family.’ Mr Hislop said a psychiatric report showed Mr Parsons ‘was under the most extraordinary pressure’ and was suffering with depression at the time. As he stood to be sentenced, he began to cry softly. Jailing him, Judge Patrick Eccles said: ‘First you hit and punched her to the ground. I am satisfied that the bruises to her face and defensive bruises to her hands were inflicted by you in anger.’ ‘She was petite and you are a fit and active sportsman. It's apparent that before you went down to fetch the knife she was terrified and she really was afraid that you were going to kill her. ‘You went back upstairs and within moments were attacking your wife. It's clear that you were overwhelmed by a jealous rage and stabbed her and slashed at her repeatedly.’ Judge Eccles added: ‘Nobody now can . predict the degree of emotional and psychological trauma he (Mr . Parsons’s young son) will suffer in future years but it will be . significant. ‘Whatever suffering you will go through, . it is nothing compared with that which you have caused to your children . and to your wife's family and of course to Janee.’ Judge Eccles said he was ‘heartbroken’ at the break-up, but added: ‘The failure of a marriage and . disappointment at being left for another man is relatively slight . mitigation.’ Together: Despite the fact that the entire murder ordeal was recorded on a dictaphone which Mr Parsons (left) had hidden under his wife's bed, he had tried to claim that it was Mrs Parsons (right) who had attacked him . Beautician Mrs . Parsons chose to leave him for her new man Daniel Hansens before asking . for a divorce - but had agreed to stay with her husband until after . Christmas for the sake of their sons. On the day of her death last December she . had been getting ready to go away for the weekend for an awards event . and Mr Hansens was going to accompany her to meet her work colleagues. 'It's clear that you were overwhelmed by a jealous rage and stabbed her and slashed at her repeatedly' Judge Patrick Eccles . However, that morning former football apprentice Mr Parsons began picking fights with his wife - with their exchanges escalating until he beat her up and fetched a large knife to kill her. Following the case, Mrs Parsons' parents, Mary and Phil Brady, said she was ‘a lovely, caring person’, ‘a wonderful mother, daughter, sister and friend’ and ‘a truly unique woman’. Detective Chief Inspector Joe Kidman, of Thames Valley Police, said: ‘The murder of a loved one is always a great tragedy for the victim's family and friends. ‘This case was unusual because the terrible brutality of the attack was captured on an audio recording. Hearing this has been an additional burden for the grieving family to bear.’","Andrew Parsons, 38, of Bicester, Oxfordshire, beat his wife Janee, 31 .

House prices are surging at their fastest in six years with some boom areas soaring by 25 per cent.A property shortage coupled with more accessible cheap home loans backed by the Bank of  England and the Government are driving the market. Recently gentrified parts of  London are even the scene of bidding wars as prices rocket by up to a quarter, said estate agents. In recent months, there has also been a sharp increase in sales in many parts of England and Wales, reminiscent of previous booms. Movement: Prices edged up month-on-month by 0.3 per cent in East Anglia, 0.2 per cent in the South West and 0.1 per cent in the Midlands. They were flat in the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and Wales . The rises come amid warnings that official measures to boost the housing market risk creating a dangerous price bubble. The overall drive came almost entirely from London and the South East, analysts Hometrack said. House prices in London and the South East increased by 0.9 and 0.5 per cent respectively month-on-month, while they rose more gradually by an average 0.1 per cent across the rest of Britain. Prices edged up month-on-month by 0.3 per cent in East Anglia, 0.2 per cent in the South West and 0.1 per cent in the Midlands. They were flat in the North East, the North West, Yorkshire and Wales. Meanwhile Mr Markey said Brixton demand is so strong that Haart now has an ‘open house’ strategy where potential buyers are invited to group viewings of properties, which are usually sold on the day. He told the Financial Times: ‘It's boom time. Prices have gone up at least 25 per cent here in the past year. We say to people: “If you want to get in before the open house, you have to pay top dollar”.’ Changing: Paul Markey, an estate agent for Haart in the gentrifying neighbourhood of Brixton (pictured), south London, said it was 'boom time' and he had seen prices rise by 25 per cent there in one year .

We say to people: ""If you want to get in before the open house, you have to pay top dollar""' Paul Markey, Haart in Brixton, London . But Hometrack said the main reason for the price increases is a lack of housing for sale as home owners remain cautious due to the tough economic environment. It said the signs of an improved market for sellers could spell more ‘unrealistic’ sellers coming to market in the next few months with inflated prices, which would lead to a sales dip. Evidence that sellers are finding it easier to stand firm on their prices was shown by the percentage of the asking price achieved - 94 per cent on average this month, the highest since July 2010. London prices are being hiked by a supply and demand gap at its widest since 2009. Demand grew by 15 per cent in six months, and the supply of homes coming up for sale has dipped by 0.6 per cent.","Overall prices rose by 0.4 per cent month-on-month in May, report finds .

Splattered with blood, this is the face of a crazed madman who allegedly  battered a betting shop manager to death with a hammer. The suspected killer was caught on CCTV leaving a branch of Ladbrokes in Morden, south London - which is just next door to a police station - after a botched robbery attempt. Andrew Iacovou, 55, of North Cheam, Surrey, who had worked for Ladbrokes for 20 years, suffered a fractured skull in the attack at 8am on Saturday and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police appeal: The blood-splattered face of the man who allegedly bludgeoned a bookmaker to death . The father-of-three was believed to . have been tricked into opening a door, allowing the suspect to force his way . behind the counter where he produced the hammer and carried out the . attack. Several customers are understood to . have gone into the shop after the attack, but did not notice Mr . Iacovou's body. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as . blunt trauma to the head. Mr Iacovou, who lived with his wife Anita, had two sons aged 10 and 13 as well as an older son from a previous relationship. Paying tribute to Mr Iacovou, his . neighbour Margaret Murray, 61, said: ‘It is terrible - Andrew was very . well liked and did a lot for people.  He worshipped his wife and . children and they adored him. ‘It is such a terrible thing and I . can't get my head around it.

Lee Rigby will be handed a posthumous tribute normally reserved only for soldiers killed on active duty, it was reported today. The 25-year-old British soldier, who was hacked to death on Wednesday afternoon in Woolwich, south-east London, will have his name carved onto the stone walls of the Armed Forces Memorial. Defence secretary Philip Hammond and military chiefs have decided that Drummer Rigby should be remembered on the roll of honour at the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield, Staffordshire. In remembrance: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, of Middleton, Greater Manchester, will have his name carved onto the stone walls of the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield, Staffordshire . Decision: Defence secretary Philip Hammond (left) and military chiefs have decided that Drummer Rigby (right) should be remembered on the roll of honour at the National Memorial Arboretum . ‘It is only right that Drummer Rigby . should be accorded the same recognition as those who have fallen in the . line of duty,’ a senior defence source told The Sunday Times. The . memorial already holds the names of the 11 soldiers killed by the 1982 . IRA bombings in Hyde Park and Regent’s Park in central London. Also . remembered on it are the two off-duty soldiers who were fatally shot . four years ago outside Massereene Barracks in Antrim, Northern Ireland. The . decision to commemorate Drummer Rigby on the 140ft-diameter memorial . comes because he was killed in a terrorist attack, reported the . newspaper. The soldier, who . joined the Army in 2006 and was a Manchester United fan, had served in . Helmand province, Afghanistan, where he was a member of the Fire Support . Group in Patrol Base Woqab.

It also emerged this week that a tour Rigby was on in Afghanistan had to be cut short two months early after he developed kidney stones and had to be evacuated, reported The Sunday Times. When he arrived back in Britain he visited the mother of Simon Valentine, a fellow soldier who died in Afghanistan during heavy fighting with the Taliban in summer 2009. Carol Valentine, of Bedworth, Warwickshire, told The Sunday Times: ‘They might have gone out there as boys but they came home as men.’ Drummer Rigby was later pictured at a charity ball in full ceremonial uniform with Sgt Valentine’s baby nephew - named Simon in his honour. Service of remembrance: Southwark Cathedral, London's oldest cathedral, may host Lee Rigby's funeral . Meanwhile it emerged that Drummer Rigby may be honoured with a funeral at Southwark Cathedral. The . young soldier’s brutal death has brought calls for the celebration of . his life to be a fitting tribute, and it is expected that hundreds of . his friends and comrades will want to bid him farewell. Southwark, . because of its size and proximity to Drummer Rigby’s barracks in . Woolwich, would be ‘an appropriate and fitting venue for such an . occasion,’ said a church source. Such a large ceremony would provide a poignant illustration of the nation’s support for the soldier. With . so many of his comrades, friends and relatives wanting to attend his . funeral, a large church will needed and 1,500 mourners could fit inside . Southwark Cathedral, believed to be the capital’s oldest, dating back to . 606AD. Prayers were said for murdered Drummer Lee Rigby today at church services in the community he lived in and the rest of the country. The Sunday service at St Mary Magdalene . Parish Church in Woolwich, just a few streets away from where he was . brutally attacked was dedicated to the young father. Paying tribute: The Sunday service at St Mary Magdalene Parish Church in Woolwich was dedicated to the young father . The Reverend Jesse van der Valk offered reassurance to the 50-strong congregation and spoke of the hope that had come out of the tragedy. He likened the effect the attack has had on the community as to when Stephen Lawrence was killed in Eltham, just a few miles away from Woolwich. After the hour-long service, where prayers were said for the soldier and his family, Mr van der Valk said: ‘I feel there are a number of feelings that have been coming out during the week. ‘There is certainly a feeling of rage and anger about what's happened, both locally and nationally, especially against those who've done this. But that's not the only feeling. ‘Clearly there's a great sense of sadness about what happened to Drummer Rigby. Everyone is very sad and upset, both here and all around the country. 'The local people here feel he was a member of their community and there has been a real outpouring of love and concern, as can be seen by the flowers. ‘He was a young father with a partner and a child and they identify with that, and there is a very obvious sense of sympathy with his family and friends and comrades. ‘We've also seen real acts of love and heroism this week, especially from the lady who stood up to the killer and the two ladies who prayed for Lee as he was lying on the ground.’ He also spoke of the sense of community as people from all faiths have come together to support one another. 'We've seen real acts of love and heroism this week, especially from the lady who stood up to the killer and the two ladies who prayed for Lee as he was lying on the ground' Reverend Jesse van der Valk . Mr van der Valk said he had felt ‘privileged’ that many of Drummer Rigby's fellow soldiers at the barracks at had come to the church on Thursday evening, the day after the attack, for a quiet period of reflection and prayer. Churchgoers spoke of their shock at the killing, with one saying he feared the backlash that has happened as a result of it. Fred Okine, 62, said: ‘I think that what happened is not a reflection of somebody's faith, it's because they have something psychologically wrong. ‘The people who are stirring up trouble now are from outside the community, people here just want peace. They want revenge but who do they take revenge out on - Muslims? Black people? ‘I've lived in Woolwich for more than 25 years but this is frightening, and my daughter worries about me going out.’","He will be remembered at National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire .

Plans have been unveiled for a memorial centre to honour the pilots and crews who died at RAF Westonzoyland in Somerset, which was used as a training base for flying early jets like the Meteor. The base, located between the villages of Westonzoyland and Othery, was in operation from 1926 to 1958 - but only some patches of land covered in concrete and abandoned buildings now remain.

A memorial centre will honour crews . Remembered: The village of Westonzoyland in Somerset has 13 graves of those who died at the airfield . Historian Robbert Turner is hoping to . build a permanent centre in Westonzoyland, which will also look at the use of the airfield. He . said: ‘After the First World War and the inception of the RAF, this . would have been the earliest days of that new organisation, and they . were scouring the whole part of the southern region of the country . looking for a suitable site. ‘After . they came to Westonzoyland they didn’t look any further - back in those . days there weren’t many trees to worry about, no electrical overhangs. It was a pilot’s dreamland, really.’ The . village of Westonzoyland has 13 graves of those who died at the . airfield and, according to Mr Turner’s research, another four pilots . lost their lives at sea during sorties over the Bristol Channel.

Airfield today: Only some patches of land covered in concrete and abandoned buildings now remain there . Soaring: A 1960s Air Atlantique Gloster Meteor T7 in her RAF training scheme above Duxford, Cambridgeshire . It is believed up to 800 pilots lost their lives during the early years of the jet age across the country. Frank Whittle, of Coventry, West Midlands, worked on combining gas turbines and jet propulsion while at the RAF College Cranwell and filed his first patent in the 1930s. With the threat of war towards the end of the decade, the Government began to back his idea to give the Allies more strength in the air. The first aircraft to fly with a Whittle gas turbine was the Gloster E28/39 in 1941. Its technology was shared with the U.S. to help the war effort. The first ever jet airliner took off in 1952 from London to . Johannesburg, with five stops. The BOAC Comet G-ALY was hailed a success, but had . three fatal accidents in its first few years. It was later realised that a major design flaw resulted in an area of the aircraft constantly . weakened at high altitude until air burst through a small gap. All of the planes were grounded and redesigned, before they . went back into commercial service in 1958. But many airlines then opted for the new . American Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8. ‘We’re talking the early 50s,’ Mr Turner said. ‘Although people don’t realise it, these jets - or the early versions of them - were flying in 1951, 1952. They were doing a lot of low-level flying here with sorties out over the Bristol Channel. 'Some of these were not ejector-seat installed, so really there was no chance of escape if something went wrong at low level. ‘A friend of mine, Ian, was as a young boy offered a flight in one of those but he turned it down, as they were known as flying coffins.’ The aim is to collect more stories from people who worked or lived near the base to compile a history of the airfield. This project will also run in tandem with fundraising efforts for the new centre.","RAF Westonzoyland in Somerset was used as a training base for jets .

Jailed: Elliott Short, 26, of Chester, Cheshire, lived a fabulous lifestyle, splashing out on a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and staying in plush hotels . A greedy gambler who boasted that he was the ‘King of Betfair’ after convincing family friends to sink £400,000 into his bogus betting system was today jailed for five years. Elliott Short, 26, of Chester, Cheshire, lived a fabulous lifestyle - splashing out on a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, staying in plush hotels and being a regular at exclusive London nightclubs. Short went on holidays around the globe, spent thousands of pounds on designer clothes from Ralph Lauren and Christian Louboutin in Harrods in Knightsbridge and went to Eclipse nightclub in Chelsea, south-west London. He even managed to dupe the News of the World into running a story about his apparent success, convincing the now-defunct newspaper that he was a former City trader who netted more than £21million from his betting system. Short had an impressive office in Knightsbridge and dazzled potential investors with his boasts of huge returns, insisting on paying for expensive items to show off his supposed wealth. One investor was told he would get monthly dividends of £70,000, but they never materialised. He claimed he could make ‘extremely high returns’ using a system on gambling website Betfair, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. But the system had never worked and the tabloid was forced to print a retraction after Betfair said the returns Short had quoted were impossible. A jury convicted him of nine counts of fraud and one count of making or supplying an article for use in fraud, after a five-week trial. Victims James Crawford - who met Short via his mother and step-father, Rosemary and Tom King - and Christopher Antoniou were each fleeced out of £200,000. Short was acquitted of four further counts of fraud relating to another £200,000 from Mr Crawford, together with £20,000 invested by Melinda Barrett - a long term friend of Short’s mother. Betting: Short claimed he could make 'extremely high returns' using a system on gambling website Betfair . Sentencing, Judge Peter Testar said Short ‘lied shamefully through his teeth’, adding that he was ‘potentially dangerous as far as the financial interests of others are concerned.’ The judge said: ‘The question is why did these intelligent people with the experience of the world allow themselves to be taken in by you? ‘You proved yourself to be a very accomplished confidence fraud trickster. You left a profound impression of someone who is deeply dishonest and shamefully mendacious. You deployed your charming personality to exploit that instinct in people to trust their fellow human beings. ‘Having conned others you simply poured their money away on hiring helicopters, taking expensive holidays, spending thousands in bars, nightclubs and restaurants and thousands more in shops. ‘You may not have wanted to cause harm to others and through your betting, you wanted to win. Who doesn’t? But the fact of the matter is that of the £400,000 that was paid, very little was actually spent by investing in Betfair.’ Short bowed his head as the sentence was passed, before being led out of the dock. Prosecutor Mark Hick said he had ‘no assets and had some liabilities in relation to utility bills’. Jailed: Short bowed his head as the sentence was passed at London's Southwark Crown Court (pictured) He had been living in rented accommodation until he was convicted and remanded in custody. Mr . Hick said: ‘Despite his claims, Elliott Short did not have a successful . betting scheme, and over the period of several months he lost all his . investors’ money, either on his unsuccessful gambling, or on funding his . lavish lifestyle. Outside court: A jury convicted Short of nine counts of fraud and one count of making or supplying an article for use in fraud . ‘Throughout this time, Mr Short continued to reassure his investors that he was making huge profits.  Mr Short would celebrate his victories, dancing and chanting things such as ‘Who is the Betfair King?’ ‘However, none of his investors received any money back, and it eventually became apparent that Mr Short had been lying to them all along.’ Mr Crawford was told he would receive monthly dividend payments of £70,000, but the cash never materialised. Mr Antoniou lost £200,000 given to him by his mother, Helen. He too never saw any return on his investment and became suspicious after reading the newspaper article about the scam, although Short managed to fob him off with excuses. ‘Mr Antoniou recalls Mr Short telling him that most of his investors didn’t have a contract for months, if at all, and since he was friends with all of them he would never dream about ""f***ing them"",’ Mr Hick said. Mr Antoniou told how Short would insist on paying for everything, shelling out for bills in excess of £1,000, to show off his supposed wealth. Bank statements revealed he spent more than £4,500 on a room at a Hilton hotel and almost £2,000 at Brinkley’s Wine Gallery in Chelsea. The third victim, Melinda Barrett, a long-time friend of Short’s mother, ploughed £20,000 into the scheme, without ever receiving a penny back. Short denied the charges against him.","Elliott Short, 26, regularly went on holidays and bought designer clothes .

In that time, 38 UK ticket-holders have matched five numbers and two Lucky Stars to win the jackpot, or a share of it. The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to sixth place on the National Lottery Rich List. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bumper prize, Camelot said. Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began: . 1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000The husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink' after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011. Married for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo Starr and Sir Tom Jones. Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion. 2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000Children's nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when they won in August last year. Adrian joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he celebrated the win. 3. Anonymous: £113,019,926One British ticket scooped the massive prize in October 2010 but decided not to go public. 4. Dave and Angela Dawes: £101,203,600Dave Dawes, 47, a shift supervisor for Premier Foods, and Angela Dawes, 43, a volunteer for the British Heart Foundation, hit the EuroMillions jackpot in October 2011.

It was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his bumper win. 8. Anonymous: £46,432,285 . One British ticket scooped the massive prize in February last year but decided not to go public. 9. Les and Sam Scadding: £45,570,835Unemployed mechanic Les Scadding, 58, and his wife Samantha Peachey-Scadding, 38, from Caerleon, South Wales, bought one of two winning tickets which shared a £90million jackpot in November 2009. Grandfather Mr Scadding was £68 overdrawn on his bank account on the day he bought his lucky ticket and had also beaten testicular cancer. The other £45million-winning EuroMillions ticket was bought by a syndicate of seven office workers based in Merseyside. The winners - dubbed the Magnificent Seven - were employed by Hewlett Packard to carry out IT work at a BT office in Liverpool. John Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked £6.5million. 10.

These are the first pictures of the victim of the South Wales measles epidemic, which has so far infected 808 people and left 77 in hospital. A 25-year-old from Swansea, named locally as Gareth Williams, died at his home on Thursday morning. Health officials confirmed yesterday that he did die from measles. A statement released said: 'Public Health Wales laboratory tests have today confirmed a diagnosis of measles in a 25-year-old male from Swansea who died on Thursday 18 April. Gareth Williams (right), from Swansea, South Wales, who was suffering from measles when he died . Mr Williams is the first victim of the measles epidemic which has seen 808 confirmed cases in the Swansea outbreak . The Port Tennant house in which a 25-year-old man named locally as Gareth Williams died yesterday morning. He becomes the . first to die from the measles outbreak in South Wales . 'The tests confirm only that the deceased had measles at the time of his death. 'Further investigations are being undertaken by the Swansea Coroner to establish the cause of death.' The victim lived in Port Tennant Road area of the city, which is in the middle of a measles epidemic. Confirmation of the cause of death will not be known until the results of a post mortem examination are released - possibly not until next week. Latest figures revealed there are 808 confirmed cases of the disease in the Swansea outbreak which is starting to spread countrywide. Health officials are investigating the death in an epidemic which has already infected more than 800 people in South Wales . The news comes as two million children risk catching  measles as a result of the MMR scare, doctors have warned. They said the outbreak in Wales could spread to London, where nearly half of the capital’s children are not vaccinated. The disease has already infected around 800 children in Swansea. Dr Helen Bedford, of University College London’s Institute of Child Health, said: ‘There are about two million children who are susceptible because they haven’t been vaccinated. London is a particular case of point.’ Ten years ago, 45 per cent of five-year-olds in London failed to have the required two doses of vaccine. Last year the figure was 81 per cent. Teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are more likely to be susceptible to measles because of the controversy over the since-discredited report about MMR jabs being linked to autism in the late 1990s. Dr Bedford told a science conference . in London: ‘There’s a simple message that parents need to be encouraged . to find out if their children have been vaccinated and if not, go out . and do it.’ Today Dr . Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection, said: 'Public Health Wales . is aware of a death being investigated by the Swansea Coroner. 'A . diagnosis of measles has not yet been confirmed. Testing the deceased . for measles is forming part of the investigations being overseen by the . Coroner. Epidemic: Doctors are urging parents to get their children immunised as a matter of urgency . 'My sympathies are with the family at such a tragic time. We should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths in Wales. 'Measles is a potentially fatal disease and around one in every 1,000 people who contracts measles in developed countries will die.' Neighbours on the Swansea estate where Mr Williams lived in a flat learned of the potential measles link to his death this afternoon. 'I think people were under the impression that he died from an asthma attack, that is what I heard,' said one female neighbour, who did not wish to be named. Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash. Complications are quite common, even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles sufferers experience them. These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders. 'He was somebody you rarely saw, to be honest. He often used the back way into his flat so you would not even see him coming or going. 'But it was only when the police and TV cameras turned up that and it was reported on the news that anybody heard anything about measles.' Earlier in the week, Meirion Evans a consultant epidemiologist, expressed her fears over the outbreak and said: 'There is a very real concern that we might get a death.' She added that the number of measles cases is expected to double in the coming weeks. Extra clinics are expected to be opened at hospitals around Swansea this weekend with health officials anticipating a rush of parents and children wanting the jab. Health workers have also visited local schools to immunise hundreds of children. Health officials said over 1,700 jabs were administered in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area, which includes Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot and Bridgend. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 77 people have been hospitalised because of the contagious disease. Many of those being treated are babies and teenagers, with the latter said to be most at risk. The Government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, said it was ‘vital’ parents vaccinated their children against measles. Referring to the scare over the safety of the triple MMR jab he said: ‘Frankly that was about a piece of extremely bad science. It is an example of how people forget the danger of diseases such as measles, they become complacent when it appears to have disappeared. ‘But it’s just, I think, very clear evidence of the huge importance of vaccination. It was and has been one of the major interventions in public health and it’s absolutely vital that people vaccinate their children.’","Man lived in Port Tennant area of Swansea, where measles is rife .

This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle . to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on . the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London . Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some . officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of . shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in . organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on . Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark  Cavendish at the Help . the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police . Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but . comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for . purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes . officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month . ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could . face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards . set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail . regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style . assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male . officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese . and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review . some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot . complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment . should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just . because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very . fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1.    Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.    A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull).   You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine. PRE Scale – As you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20. Number 6 being very, very light and 20 being exhausting. Aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15, which should feel like a HARD run. If you feel you have exceeded number 15, then slow down as you could be running too fast.","Sergeant Andy Sharp was snapped escorting protesters in central London .

Danger to the public: Opemipo Jaji (pictured) was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11-year-old girl while he was on probation . A dangerous teenage paedophile was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11-year-old girl while he was on probation. Opemipo Jaji, 18, from Edmonton, north London, had just left his probation officer when he spotted the child going home from school on a bus before following her and dragging her into a park to subject her to a three-hour rape ordeal. Mr Justice Singh at the Old Bailey told Jaji that he had given careful consideration to whether he could impose a lesser sentence than life, for example a determinate sentence combined with an extended term. 'However, in all the circumstances of this case, I do not believe that the public would be adequately protected from you if you were the subject of any sentence other than a life sentence,' he said. The judge told Jaji that the eight-year minimum was not the actual term he would serve, but the minimum before he could be considered for release by the Parole Board. 'The Parole Board will only direct your release on licence if it is satisfied that you are no longer a danger to members of the public,' he added. Jaji had been given an 18-month supervision order six months before for making indecent images of children. A year earlier, he had sexually assaulted and robbed a 12-year-old schoolgirl on a housing estate. Later, he was given a 10-month detention and training order which he went on to breach. He was found guilty of rape following a trial at the Old Bailey in April after he had denied raping the girl in Jubilee Park, Enfield, north London, in November, last year. The child gave evidence against him on videolink during the trial. The judge told Jaji: 'You got off the bus at the same stop as her and you then followed her. You dragged her into Jubilee Park and subjected her to a horrific ordeal for the next three hours. 'Not only did you rape her at least twice. You stuffed one of her gloves in her mouth. You threatened her and said that you had a knife although you did not in fact produce one. 'You told her not to tell anyone about what had happened because you would stab her. Even the risk of being seen by a member of the public did not deter you from carrying on with your vicious attack on your lonely and vulnerable victim. Scroll down for video . Police search teams in Jubilee Park in Enfield looking for clues at the time of the rape in November 2012 . 'When a passer-by walking his dog was nearby, you told her to curl up and keep quiet so that she would not be noticed. 'At . one point you even told her that the incident was being filmed and that . you would send the video to her school where people would laugh at . her.' The girl suffered . injuries which meant she had to go to hospital where she had to be . examined under anaesthetic and needed stitches. 'Perhaps . even worse, you have left her with terrible emotional scars. One can . only hope that, with the courage that she has already shown in giving . evidence at this trial, and with the support of her family and friends, . she can begin the process of recovery.' The . judge said that until recently Jaji had shown no remorse for the . terrible offence he had committed. 'Since your conviction you now accept . that you did commit this offence.' A . psychiatric report stated that he had 'a small insight' into his . offence 'but this does provide a platform for you to work within a . sexual offenders treatment programme'. The . judge added: 'However, I approach the degree of your apparent remorse . with some caution. I had the opportunity to observe you when you gave . evidence at your trial. It is clear to me that you are well capable of . lying and of manipulating others around you to suit your own interests.' Jaji was 'an intelligent young man who had potential'. Mr Justice Singh . But the judge added: 'It is also clear that you have an unhealthy interest in little girls.' He . had told both a probation officer and a psychiatrist that he 'had been . planning to rape a girl for about two months before the offence, . although the offence itself was committed on impulse'. It was not disputed by Jaji’s counsel that he was dangerous, the judge added. Scotland . Yard said in a statement that forensic samples found on Jaji’s . trainers, white bag strap and underwear all directly linked him to the . victim. His fingerprints were also found on the victim’s Oyster card . holder. Cell site analysis of his mobile phone also placed him in the vicinity of the park at the time of the attack. 'An unhealthy interest in little girls': CCTV shows Jaji boarding the bus where he spotted his victim . The paedophile, carrying a white bag, walks to a seat: He told authorities he had been planning to rape a youngster . Detective Chief Inspector Adam Lowe, . who led the investigation, said: 'Jaji posed a great danger to young . girls and despite the great weight of evidence against him, refused to . accept his guilt and forced the victim to give evidence in court. 'This . was a particularly brutal but unusual attack on an innocent 11-year-old . schoolgirl who will no doubt continue to suffer the emotional scars of . what happened to her for a very long time. I would like to take this . opportunity to praise the bravery of the victim and her family.' Mr . Lowe also told reporters at the court: 'His offending escalation and . lack of victim empathy is a clear indication of his dangerousness.' The risk he posed had been registered by the police and its partners. 'The offence itself was committed on impulse': It was not disputed by Jaji¿s counsel that he was dangerous . Evil intent: Jaji walks towards the bus's exit, following his victim to where he would rape her . Officers raised their concerns with a multi-agency public protection forum or Mappa which planned imminently to apply for an order which would establish some control over the risk he posed, but unfortunately Jaji committed this offence before this could happen. Mr Lowe said a case review was going on into what happened. 'My organisation has done more than its statutory obligations,' he said. A Probation Service spokeswoman said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the victim and their family following this horrific crime. 'A Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (Mappa) Serious Case Review into what happened in this case has been launched. It would be inappropriate to comment further until this is completed.'","Opemipo Jaji, 18, pounced on girl moments after seeing probation officer .

Jailed: Philip Gaisford, 64, a former Scotland Yard chief superintendent, was found guilty of 27 offences against nine boys and girls . A retired top police officer who set up a scuba diving business so he could groom young boys for sex has been jailed for life. Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home. The former Scotland Yard chief superintendent enticed dozens of children with scuba lessons and pool parties. But he abused his trusted position to single out potential victims who he plied with sparkling wine as he enforced a ‘no trunks’ policy. The case raises worrying questions about how he was able to prey on young people for so long without being stopped. The pervert was arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused after Gaisford organised work experience for him at the Met. But the investigation was dropped, leaving Gaisford free to continue running his seedy scuba diving business for another decade. During that time hundreds of young people visited his home in Crowborough, East Sussex, for group lessons and private tuition. Lewes Crown Court heard how Gaisford was finally brought to justice after an acrimonious divorce from his wife Susan, 62. The couple moved to East Sussex after she twice caught him naked with young men at their previous home in Caterham, Surrey. She gave him a second chance but tipped off police about child abuse images on his computer when he admitted having sex with a 15-year-old boy. Officers arrested him and discovered a stash of handcuffs and flick knives which Gaisford had confiscated during his 30-year career with the Met. Suspicious detectives began contacting potential victims as they examined paperwork from the scuba business. Among them was the victim from the 2000 case. They discovered Gaisford was at the centre of a horrific web of abuse which took place around pools at both properties. Locked up: The former police officer retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record . He used the scuba diving business as a front to create opportunities when he could be alone with the most vulnerable young people and abuse them. Gaisford also attracted dozens of scouts by renting out a large field beside his sprawling rural property. Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said Gaisford encouraged his pupils – many of whom saw him as a ‘father figure’ – to remove their swimming trunks . He said Gaisford held ‘pool parties’ at which he molested boys and girls who ‘did not want to be touched in that way’ and nick-named him 'paedo-Phil'. He added: ‘He was able to manipulate these young people and persuade them and himself that there was nothing wrong with it.’ The court heard Gaisford organised scuba diving trips to Egypt during which he was ‘very touchy feely’ and set up reunion parties when they returned. Jurors were shown pictures of him in a pair of speedos drinking and encouraging young people to wax his chest hair off. Sex attacker: Gaisford encouraged his pupils 'many of whom saw him as a 'father figure' to remove their swimming trunks . In one image the words ‘insert here’ were written on Gaisford's back with an arrow pointing downwards, alongside a lewd drawing. In emotional evidence, one victim told the court he was raped and abused for three years after falling under Gaisford’s spell as a scout. The man said he was made to wear ‘tight swimming trunks’ which he was ordered to remove for a sauna after scuba lessons. He said the sexual abuse started with Gaisford ‘massaging’ him naked. It then progressed from naked swimming to kissing and sex. At one point Gaisford claimed to give him a ‘medical examination’ by inserting a finger into his body, which he said he was doing to check his prostate. The man, who was 16 at the time of the abuse, said: ‘I was scared of him telling my parents about all of it. Sex attacker: Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home . ‘I didn't know what he was capable of, although he was nice to me I have seen him be not so nice to other people.’ The victim finally went to police when he tried to cut off Gaisford and the former police officer threatened to tell his family about what had happened. Jailed: Gaisford was first arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused, but the investigation was dropped . Gaisford, who retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record, served in Soho and Mayfair. He then went on to work for another Government agency before being sacked in 2003 on his conviction for assaulting police officers after being caught drink driving. The pervert admitted to police that he had the ‘Gaisford curse’, meaning he had a high sex drive, which he found hard to ‘keep in check’. He blamed child abuse images on his computer, many of which had a ‘spanking’ theme, on being sent boarding school as a child. Gaisford, who has been in custody since August, was convicted of 27 sexual offences against nine victims – including four boys and two girls – between 1997 and 2008. His youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy. He was also convicted of raping an adult woman and 10 offences of possessing indecent videos of children. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years before he can apply for parole when he was jailed last Friday. Det Insp Rob Morland, of Sussex Police, said the former police officer was only brought to justice thanks to the courage of his victims. He said: ‘Gaisford systematically and cynically abused trusting young people who had become involved with him in his capacity as a scuba diving instructor and the court clearly found his conduct to be a gross breach of trust.’","Philip Gaisford, 64, enticed children with scuba lessons and pool parties .

A millionaire footballer was arrested yesterday along with his cousin and a friend amid claims they were involved in a champagne-fuelled gang rape. Loic Remy, a 26-year-old French international striker who earns £80,000 a week playing for Queens Park Rangers, was held by Scotland Yard's sex crime squad with the other men. Yesterday it emerged that the alleged victim was a 34-year-old woman who claimed the trio raped her on May 6, Bank Holiday Monday, in a £2million flat in Fulham, West London. Footballer: Queens Park Rangers striker Loic Remy (pictured), 26, is being held by Scotland Yard's sex crime squad with two other men. A 34-year-old woman alleges three men raped her last Monday . After the alleged assault, it is . understood the woman travelled to Kent where she reported the attack to . police the following day. They in turn passed on the details to the . Metropolitan force on May 8. It is claimed the woman visited . Remy's rented home at Marina Point, Imperial Wharf. The plush £2million . three-bedroom flat is owned by Pippa Lister – nicknamed Miss Network – . who is president of the Synergy Matchmaking business. Arrested: Loic Remy remains in custody with two other men . Remy, who has denied the claims, is believed to be paying £6,000 a month to stay in the fourth-floor flat after moving to London from France in January. The alleged victim was said to have been offered champagne once she was inside the flat. A friend of the alleged victim – who . works in a 'skilled profession' – said yesterday she was left extremely . upset by her ordeal. She said: 'The two of them had been . in touch for some time. They met a couple of months ago. He has been . keeping in touch with her by phone and text since then. 'She confided in a friend who . encouraged her to make a complaint to police. They interviewed her . earlier this week and arrested him this morning. They have taken . evidence from his flat.' Two uniformed officers with the Met Police answered the door of his fourth-floor apartment yesterday. One said: 'This is a crime scene. We are waiting for the forensics team to get here. Mr Remy is not here.' Neighbours spoke of their shock at . the arrest, with one saying: 'I sometimes see him at the gym or going to . training. He seems like a cool guy from what I can tell.' A spokesman for the Met Police said: . 'Officers are investigating an allegation of rape which happened on May 6 . in the West London area. Luxury: Remy is paying £6,000 a month to rent the Fulham flat . The victim alleges she was raped by . three men. Three men, aged 26, 23 and 22, were arrested at an address in . Fulham on suspicion of rape – they remain in custody at a West London . police station.' Remy joined QPR in January for a . club-record fee of £8million from Marseille. He has scored six goals but . could not stop the team from being relegated from the Premier League. He has 18 caps for France. Remy is also facing a legal battle in . France over a paternity suit brought by a former girlfriend. The . striker is said to have fathered a boy called Adrian – who is now 18 . months old – with 26-year-old  Toulouse student Valentine Mini. Lawyers in Marseille have issued a summons calling for Remy to admit that he is the father. 'This is not a sordid financial affair,' said Laurie Delclos, Miss Mini's lawyer. French striker: Remy joined the west London club in January for £8million from Marseille but was unable to help them avoid relegation from the Premier League, and is expected to leave this summer . 'It is not a question of money, and it never will be – just a quest by a young mother who insists that her son has a father.' Remy insists another player is . Adrian's father. Earlier this year his spokesman said: 'Loic does not . deny having had a relationship with the young woman. He simply says that . he was not alone.' Remy is the product of a broken home . and was born in Lyon, where he was brought up on a tough council estate.

Remy is expected to leave QPR in the . summer with top-flight clubs such as Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and . Liverpool reported to be interested in signing him.

More than 40 ‘predatory’ foreign rapists were able to enter Britain in a single year undetected, police have revealed. Scotland Yard said the dangerous criminals were only uncovered thanks to a drive to discover the backgrounds of overseas suspects. Officers said improved checks revealed a previously undiscovered stream of foreigners with a history of serious crime. Staggering: Scotland Yard has found that there are more than 40 'predatory rapists' living in London who have already been convicted abroad of sex crimes . As a result police have pledged to . throw hundreds of foreign suspects out of the country every week, even . when they have not been convicted of a crime. Immigration judges will be asked to . deport rapists, thugs and thieves on the strength of ‘intelligence . dossiers’ collected by investigators. Serious offenders can be thrown out . even when they have not been convicted if an immigration tribunal deems . them a danger to the public. In one recent case a 46-year-old . Jamaican drug addict rapist was thrown out of the country after being . linked to a string of sexual offences in South London. Despite remaining unconvicted, an immigration tribunal ruled Lincoln Farquharson was a danger to the public and deported him. One in three arrested in the capital – around 70,000 people every year – is a foreign national. Metropolitan Police Commander Steve . Rodhouse said police are working with immigration officials to . investigate the past of all foreign suspects. He said: ‘Our work gives us much . better knowledge of those people in the UK and how they are offending. We have identified more than 40 predatory rapists convicted overseas in . the UK who we would otherwise not been aware of. ‘These are people who are getting arrested for low level crimes like shoplifting and are exposed after further checks.’ Kicked out: Jamaican Lincoln Farquharson had been charged with multiple rape and has been deported and banned from returning to the UK for at least 10 years. Top officers at Britain’s largest . force are concerned that a quarter of those arrested for serious crimes . and links to gangs are foreign. They are stepping up their efforts to . deport foreign criminals and hope to increase the number from between 30 . and 50 a week to ‘three figures’. Police have set up a 100-strong squad, . including officials from the UK Border Agency, to target foreign . nationals committing crime in the capital. They have also won funding . for up to eight Romanian and Polish liaison officers. Assistant . Commissioner Mark Rowley said the Met is ‘determined and creative’ about . protecting the public. He said immigration laws are a . ‘powerful way’ of kicking out criminal suspects who escape deportation . because they are not successfully prosecuted. He added: ‘When we are able to . prosecute that is what we do but in many cases prosecutions are not . possible for a range of reasons or have failed. ‘What we are able to do through this . method is present a case to an immigration tribunal that will show their . lifestyle in the UK and the threat they pose.’ Last year just over 72,500 foreign . suspects were held by the Met and questioned about crimes including . murder, rape and robbery. The figure was up almost a quarter on three . years ago when 58,870 non-British suspects were arrested in London. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: . ‘We will use the full force of immigration powers on those who seek to . abuse the system, commit crime and damage our communities. The success . of this operation proves foreign nationals who continue to offend and . pose a threat to the public will be arrested and removed from the UK.’","100-strong unit launched to target serious 'criminals from overseas'

Police should help identify high-profile suspects to end inaccurate speculation on the internet, the Government's top lawmaker said last night. It would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested, said Attorney General Dominic Grieve. He added that police have the 'discretion' to reveal the identity of suspects, but warned journalists not to launch 'fishing expeditions'. Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said it would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested . His comments come after Scotland Yard made yet another arrest as part of Operation Yewtree, which was launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Dozens of Twitter users inaccurately named the 72-year-old suspect as various celebrities, including a veteran pop star and a businessman. However, sources said the latest arrest – the 13th since the inquiry began – was not a well-known figure. Mr Grieve said: 'Clearly, if the Press have got to know who somebody is who's been arrested and are publicising that, then clearly it might be very sensible for the police to confirm that fact. 'But equally, I don't think we should end up with a process in which the police are being subjected to fishing expeditions with dozens of names being reeled out to them and an obligation to pick one of them. That seems to me to be a matter which must be within the discretion of the police.' Asked if he was concerned that well-known figures could be inaccurately named on social media, Mr Grieve said 'public interest' could free the police to say the wrong person is in the spotlight. 'Under certain circumstances that might be a good reason why the person under arrest should have their name publicised,' he added. The comments come after Scotland Yard made yet another arrest as part of Operation Yewtree, which was launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal . He also highlighted the 'odd' situation in which the names of suspects are widely known to the public, but only confirmed by police days later. For instance, the identities of the two suspects in the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby were reported worldwide – but it was up to ten days before Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were named by the Met. The Attorney General is the latest senior Government figure to step into the row over new police guidelines that promote a policy of 'secret arrests'. Following the Leveson report, forces have been told to identify suspects only when it is in the 'public interest' or when it could help prevent or detect crime. Alex Marshall of the College of Policing said the guidance aims to 'strike the correct balance' between privacy and 'open and honest' relations with the media.","Dominic Grieve said police have 'discretion' to reveal identities .

"By . Keith Gladdis In Mombasa, Kenya  and Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 17:33 EST, 27 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 27 May 2013 . MI5 faces growing questions over the Woolwich murderers after it emerged that Michael Adebolajo was left free to return to Kenya despite the fact the country had deported him as a terrorist. Adebolajo, seen wielding a knife with his hands covered in blood after the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, was booted out of the African country in 2010 after he was caught attempting to enter Somalia to fight with extremists. Kenya warned Britain that he was a ‘dangerous radical’ intent on waging war on the West – but he was free to return at least once last year to meet with fellow jihadists, the Daily Mail understands. Radicalised: Michael Adebolajo brandishing bloodied knives after the murder of Lee Rigby last week . Arrested: In 2010 Michael Adebolajo, second from right, was among nine suspected members of the Al-Shabaab movement captured by Kenyan police . Sources in Africa say the 28-year-old was seen in Kenya as late as last November, in the company of a radical cleric who was also being monitored by security forces. Adebolajo is also suspected of making a third visit to the country, which has become a gateway for young radicalised Britons wishing to fight alongside jihadists in Somalia. The British police and security services now face questions over why they did not do more to stop Adebolajo and his accomplice, Michael Adebowale. Despite a string of warning signs stretching back ten years, Adebolajo is said to have been considered to be ‘low-risk’ by MI5. Police may have known about his extreme beliefs as early as 2003, when he joined Al-Mahajiroun, an extremist group which was monitored by the security service and later banned. Known to police: Adebolajo was part of a mob that attacked an EDL March in Harrow in 2009 . From yesterday's Daily Mail . He was photographed at high-profile protests – even standing next to hate preacher Anjem Choudary – and was arrested in 2006 after an ugly scuffle at the Old Bailey.Seven years later, the Kenyan authorities returned Adebolajo to Britain, warning that he was a dangerous terrorist intent on waging war. Sources in the Kenyan capital Nairobi claim Adebolajo may have gone on to enter Kenya on two occasions in 2012 using false passports. It is claimed that he was arrested with five others last February, as he tried to reach Somalia once again. Instead of being taken to court, he would have been put straight on a flight to the UK, under a new policy which sees all foreigners attempting to cross the border removed from Kenya. A second claim is that Adebolajo entered Kenya even later, again using a false passport, to meet with a cleric named Hassan Makbul. The pair are understood to have realised their cover had been blown, and fled to Tanzania in November. The Mail understands the security forces were aware Adebolajo had left for Africa on at least one occasion, and may have allowed the journey to monitor who he would meet. MI5 chief Andrew Parker is set to present a report to a Parliamentary committee on the case this week. Kenya claims the British security services ‘ignored’ warnings about Adebolajo. An immigration official said: ‘This man had a mission to complete so we work on the assumption that he would have come back.’ Court documents seen by the Daily Mail reveal how determined Adebolajo’s gang were to join the Al Qaeda linked al-Shaabab in 2010. When they were arrested police also found al-Shaabab flags and uniforms. The Kenyans also discovered Adebolajo had been radicalised by Sheikh Aboud Rogo, a cleric who was also close to Samantha Lewthwaite, the ‘white widow’ of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay.

A Chicago jury found on Thursday that the billionaire reality TV star did not deceive Jacqueline Goldberg as part of a $6million condo deal in his glitzy Trump International Hotel & Tower in downtown Chicago. In closing arguments, Goldberg's lawyer blasted Trump and claimed he lied on the witness stand during the trial to protect himself. Shelly Kulwin claimed that Trump only took the stand 'to lie, evade and spout infomercials.' Victory: Billionaire Donald Trump will not have to pay a Chicago grandmother $6million after jurors found he did not deceive her about a condo investment deal . Furious: Attorney Shelly B. Kulwin escorts his client Jacqueline Goldberg out of the federal courtroom after Goldberg lost her lawsuit against Trump . 'It’s called a bait and switch. Here’s the bait. Here’s the switch,' he said. 'The measure of your conduct is not, should not and cannot be ""I know what I’m doing is wrong but can I get away with it? ... And if I do get caught, can I spin it?""' Goldberg herself showed little emotion after the verdict but her attorney, Kulwin, slumped over and buried his head on a courtroom table. Trump's attorney Stephen Novack smiled and nodded his head in gratitude at the jury. The case pitted the suburban Chicago woman against a New Yorker who revels in his image as a big talker with big ideas. Many know him best for his catchphrase on his 'Apprentice"" TV show: 'You're fired!' In sarcasm-filled closings, Kulwin described Trump in stark, extreme terms , as villainous and greedy. Trump wasn't in court, but Kulwin displayed a giant photograph of Trump. 'The thought of my grandma being in the same room with that guy. Yuck!' Kulwin boomed. Grand: The lawsuit centers on a 2006 deal that Goldberg made to buy two $1million condos in the Trump International Hotel & Tower . The dispute centered on the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago, one of several showcase towers Trump has named after himself elsewhere, including New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii. Goldberg accused Trump of wooing her into buying two condos at $1 million apiece in the mid-2000s by dangling a promise of share in building profits, then reneging on the promise after she committed to buying. At trial, Novack grappled with the portrayal of Goldberg as a former waitress and hat-check girl who learned her values living through the Depression and working her way through college. He told jurors in his closing he also loved grandmothers, saying, 'I happen to be married to one.' But, he added, Goldberg was also a sophisticated, detail-oriented investor who signed a contract stipulating Trump could do what he did: cancel the profit-sharing plan anytime he saw fit. An often-scowling Trump spent two days testifying himself, bragging about the quality of his developments, verbally sparring with an opposing attorney and drawing rebukes from the judge. Trump took the stand earlier this month to defend his company. He went on the offensive and claimed the 87-year-old woman was trying to 'rip him off' On the stand, Trump denied he ever cheated anyone. Off it, he blasted the woman who brought him there, telling reporters he was the victim, not her. He declared, 'She's trying to rip me off.' Goldberg isn't the first to complain about a Trump development. Dozens of investors in the Las Vegas' five-year-old Trump International Hotel & Tower sued Trump, alleging he manufactured 'a purchasing frenzy' to get them to buy in before the property market collapsed. An arbiter, though, sided with Trump in 2011, and U.S. District Judge Gloria M Navarro in Las Vegas later refused the disgruntled investors' request to nullify the arbitration finding. When Goldberg took the stand herself after Trump, she told jurors she initially had qualms about suing such an influential figure. But she added, 'Somebody had to stand up to him.' Goldberg told jurors it was Trump's very star power that initially drew her toward investing with him. But it was the profit-sharing proposal that, for her, sealed the deal, she said. Goldberg said she filed the lawsuit in an effort to 'stand up to' the reality TV star billionaire . During his testimony, Trump kept talking over Kulwin while Kulwin kept rolling his eyes at Trump's answers, prompting Judge Amy St. Eve to order both men to 'stop boxing each other' and behave. Trump's testimony offered a rare inside look at the business style of the 66-year-old who scrutinizes the competence of contestants carrying out management tasks on his TV show. He told jurors that he signed every business check in his organization. He also said he couldn't remember when key business decisions were made because he and his top executives aren't in the habit of taking notes. City pride also intervened at one point in closings when Kulwin made an unfavorable reference to executives in New York. 'Judge, he's mocking New York,' Trump's attorney said, standing to object. 'I can't mock New York?' Kulwin shot back. 'I thought it was every Chicagoans right to do that.'","Jacqueline Goldberg sued Trump, claiming he reneged on a deal to share profits if she bought two $1million condos in his Chicago tower .

Principal Simpson praised her teachers for their bravery and courage during the tornado . Principal Simpson said her teachers 'covered themselves in debris' which helped ensured that so many students survived . ‘The teachers covered themselves in debris while they were covering their babies. And I believe that is why so many of us survived that day, because the teachers were able to act quickly, stay calm and take literally the weight of a wall onto their bodies to save those that were under them,’ said Simpson, a native of the city of about 56,000. The tornado was on the ground for 40 minutes and left a 17-mile path of destruction. Its victims at the school were ages eight and nine. ‘These kids are close. They grew up in one neighborhood. They play in the streets. They play in the creek. They have their own little community, even more so in the classroom,’ second-grade teacher Emily Eischen said.

Simpson said that, having been born and raised in Oklahoma, she knew what it meant to deal with tornadoes. The state, in the heart of Tornado Alley, has averaged more than 50 tornadoes per year since record-keeping began in 1950. ‘Not one parent blamed us because they're Oklahomans, too, and they know what a tornado means and they know what it means in school,’ Simpson said. ‘We practice our procedures.

When Simpson got to her office, a fifth-grade teacher told her the storm was just southwest of the school. ‘I got on the intercom and said, “It's here,'"" Simpson said. She rode out the storm in a bathroom. ‘You feel things trickling down on you from the ceiling, then those things become chunks of things,’ Simpson said. ‘I yelled and said, “In God's name, go away!” I yelled it about four times.

I got out of the bathroom and the whole neighborhood was gone.’ She quickly tended to the younger students then saw that students in grades 4, 5 and 6 were heading to a nearby church.

Mirror image: The image bears striking resemblance to the start of the iconic opening sequence of a Universal film . Commander of the International Space Station, Chris has gained an army of followers on Facebook and Twitter with his daily updates from space which feature beautiful pictures and news on the progress of the various missions he and his colleagues carry out. Hadfield has been taking the Twitterverse by storm from aboard the ISS, which orbits the Earth at 8km a second, since he arrived back on December 21. The collection of images he has posted from space feature locations as diverse as San Francisco's glittering lights and breathtaking cloud formations over Africa. He has also captured large parts of the UK from space including Manchester, London and Bournemouth. But his latest shot of the US at dawn is perhaps his best post yet. Snapper: The stunning image of the Earth at dawn was the latest picture from space captured by Commander of the International Space Station Chris Hadfield . Beautiful: Chris Hadfield has posted dozens of pictures from space online since he arrived at the ISS in December including this taken over Africa . Bright lights: As well as aerial shots from all over the Earth, Commander Hadfield has taken pictures of much of the UK. This image shows Birmingham at night . Unmistakable: The Thames can be clearly seen snaking its was through the giant urban sprawl of London in this picture . The astronaut, who has also posted a variety of amusing videos showing what it is like to shave, vomit and brush your teeth in space, uses a long lens camera to capture the stunning detail of the Earth. Among his favourite places to photograph is the Sahara in Africa and he explains that he waits until the sun is directly over the desert to get the best shot. He says: 'The beauty of space station, though, is if it's not here this time, tomorrow it might be, or maybe a month from now. 'There's not a race to get a picture. You can be patient, like a hunter.' He says that it’s not Instagram, it’s 'Space-a-gram' and that the key steps are: 'Focus, frame, and fire'. Ferry cross the Mersey: Among Commander Hadfield's images taken in space and posted online is this night time shot of Liverpool . Seaside shot: Most of Commander Hadfield's pictures of the UK were taken at night, but this one shows the beautiful blue sea surrounding the coast of Bournemouth in Hampshire . Emerald Isle: The silhouettes of Ireland and Wales were captured in this beautiful picture taken from the ISS by Commander Hadfield . Green green grass: It may look tiny, but this expanse of UK land encompasses Exeter and Cornwall all the way to Land's End . He added: 'We orbit 400km above the earth, so if you want to get a good detailed picture of something you need a long lens. I have one velcroed to the wall.’ Chris uses a special setting on his camera to deal with the bright glare of light from the Earth against the pitch black backdrop of space. He takes pictures in as high a resolution as possible, so his camera's memory card gets full very quickly. The first Canadian to walk in space, Commander Hadfield, 53, a former air force fighter pilot, has previously flown two Space Shuttle missions in 1995 and 2001. Hadfield has amassed 226,000 fans on Facebook and 740,000 followers on Twitter. He announced that his 'fiery fall' to earth will commence on May 13 after the arrival of a new Russian commander.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:48 EST, 24 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:54 EST, 24 May 2013 . Parents charged with murder after they allegedly chose prayer over medical care for their sick son have been denied bail by a Philadelphia judge. Herbert Schaible, 45, and his wife Catherine, 44, were charged  with third-degree murder earlier this week after their seven-month-old son Brandon died of bacterial pneumonia in April. If convicted, the Schaibles face seven to 14 years in prison or more. The couple had previously been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2009 for failing to prevent another son, two-year-old Kyle, from dying from pneumonia. Catherine and Herbert Schaible arrive to turn themselves in at police headquarters in Philadelphia in May 22, the couple who believe in faith healing over medicine have been charged with third-degree murder . Basic medical care could have prevented his death, but instead the Schaibles chose to pray. ‘We tried to fight the devil, but in the end the devil won,' they told homicide detectives at the time. They received probation in that case, but the terms included ensuring their additional eight children - ranging in age from 7-months to 17-years-old - would get regular medical checkups and go to the doctor when there was any sign of illness. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said the care was never given and decided to bring murder charges against the couple. Their remaining seven children have been placed in foster care. The Schaibles were ordered held without bail Friday, two days after their arrest, although defense lawyers argued that they were neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Herbert and Catherine Schaible had previously had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter after another child, 2-year-old Kent, died in 2009 . ‘He is incarcerated because of his faith,’ said lawyer Bobby Hoof, who described client Herbert Schaible's mindset as resolute. ""He's strong willed,"" Hoof said. ""(Yet) he's mourning this son. He's hurting as any dad would."" A judge acknowledged that the couple had never missed a court date in the first case but said he worried that might change amid the more serious charges. And he feared they may have supporters who would harbor them. ""Throughout this country ... there are churches like the Schaibles' whose members and leaders probably don't think they did anything wrong, and might be willing - to paraphrase the Schaibles' pastor - to put their interpretation of God's will above the law,"" Common Pleas Judge Benjamin Lerner said. Following the ruling, Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore was pleased with the judge's decision. ""Somebody is dead now as a result of what they did or didn't do,"" she said. Faith-healing: First Century Gospel Church, where the parents are members, says using medicine is a sin . After their two-year-old son died of untreated pneumonia in 2009, the Schaibles had promised a judge they would not let another sick child go without medical care. But now they've lost an eight-month-old to what a prosecutor called ‘eerily similar’ circumstances. ‘We believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power,’ Herbert Schaible, 44, told Philadelphia homicide detectives after their ninth child, Brandon, died in April. Medicine, he said, ‘is against our religious beliefs.’ About a dozen children die each year in the U.S. when parents turn to faith healing instead of medicine, typically from highly treatable problems, said Shawn Francis Peters, a University of Wisconsin lecturer who has studied faith-healing deaths. In Oregon, four couples from a faith-healing church have been prosecuted, the most recent in 2011 when a couple was sentenced to more than six years in prison for manslaughter in the death of their newborn son. Justice: Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, announced Herbert and Catherine Schaible, who believe in faith healing over medicine have been charged with murder after a second child died of pneumonia . The state legislature that year removed faith healing as a defense to murder charges. The Schaibles are third-generation members and former teachers at their fundamentalist Christian church, the First Century Gospel Church in northeast Philadelphia. At least two dozen children from First Century Gospel and its mother church First Tabernacle Congregation have died since 1971, reports NBC10. Their pastor, Nelson Clark, has said the Schaibles lost their sons because of a ‘spiritual lack’ in their lives and insisted they would not seek medical care even if another child appeared near death. He did not return phone messages this month, but he told The Associated Press in 2011 that his church is not a cult, and he faulted officials for trying to force his members into ""the flawed medical system,"" which he blamed for 100,000 deaths a year. Beliefs: Pastor Nelson Clark of the First Century Gospel Church tells followers to shun 21-century medicine for the power of prayer . It is estimated that around a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases each year, a handful of which spawn criminal charges, according to experts. The First Century Gospel Church of Philadelphia’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past. In 1991, eight children died in a measles epidemic. All the parents were members of either First Century Gospel Church or the nearby Faith Tabernacle of Nicetown which also preaches faith-healing. The tragedies are not isolated to Pennsylvania. In Oregon, Jeff and Marci Beagley, were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 for the death of their 16-year-old son. The couple refused to use medicine for their son Neil, who was suffering from a preventable urinary tract blockage. Instead, they prayed and used anointing oils in the hope of divine intervention. 'Too many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full,' Judge Steven Maurer said at their sentencing. 'This has to stop.' ‘These are people who have been . brought up in these communities; their beliefs are reinforced every . day,’ Peters said. ‘They're not trained intellectually to question these . doctrines, where the rest of us might engage in critical inquiry, . weighing the benefits of medicine versus the benefits of prayer.’ A . handful of families, including one in western Pennsylvania, have lost . two children after attempts at faith healing, according to Peters, who . wrote ‘When Prayer Fails: Faith Healing, Children and the Law.’ Peters . isn't sure that courts have the means to prevent the problem, since . such people don't fear legal punishment, only Judgment Day. Some believe . death ‘is a good outcome,’ given their belief in the afterlife, he . said. ‘They don't want . to harm their children. They're just in this particularly narrow - and . very, very dangerous - way misguided about the potential of medical . science,’ he said. He . believes that ‘empathetic’ intervention, through dialogue between church . and public health educators, could help some ‘get to a point where they . allow their beliefs and practices to evolve.’ But there's also a risk that could backfire, and drive these communities further underground, he said.","Parents Herbert and Catherine Schaible denied bail two days after being charged with third-degree murder .

Nine leading British companies have been ordered to hand over nearly £200,000 in fines and payouts to interns who had been working for free following a crackdown by Revenue and Customs. Overall, more than 26,000 workers nationwide denied the minimum wage shared £4million in payments in the last financial year. Fashion giants Arcadia, run by billionaire Sir Philip Green, paid dozens of former interns hundreds of pounds each in back payments last year after a public outcry. Under the law, people who are given set hours and defined responsibilities are classed as employees and must receive a wage. Hundreds of companies regularly . recruit graduate workers without pay and only give them expenses or a . small allowance for their efforts. HMRC looked into 40 cases where employers were accused of using interns as full members of staff in 2012-13. They took action against nine firms . who were ordered to pay £192,808 in back payments and fines.The maximum fine which can be levied on an individual . company is £5,000. HMRC have refused to identify any of the nine companies involved. However, Arcadia confirmed they have 'worked with HMRC' about payments made to interns. Sir . Philip's Arcadia, owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, run Topshop, . Miss Selfridge, Burtons, BHS and Dorothy Perkins, and recruited interns . in their London head office. Emily Wong, 23, a Royal Holloway University graduate spent a month working at Miss Selfridge in 2011 doing administrative tasks in the PR department. Payout: Retail giant Arcadia - who run Topshop - paid out hundreds of pounds to dozens of workers who worked in their London office without pay . She was given a London Travelcard and a £2.50-a-day lunch allowance as payment – but later received a cheque for £851. Sir Philip, who bought the group in . 2002, has not paid himself a dividend since 2005. However, that year it . emerged the company had paid his Monaco-based wife £1.2billion. He . faced questions over his company's tax arrangement's last year until he . revealed the company had paid £2.3billion to Revenue and Customs in the . decade after he acquired them. A spokesman for Arcadia said: 'Arcadia have worked with HMRC on this issue and have no further comment.' Separately, Harrods paid £1,800 to a 21-year-old graduate intern who worked in their Knightsbridge store for three months unpaid work. The University of Westminster marketing graduate, from Ealing, west London, received a cheque which equated to 276 hours at the minimum wage. Payouts: In total, nine firms were ordered to hand over £192,808 . Overall there are thought to be around 100,000 people a year working as ‘interns’ to gain valuable work experience so they can take the first step on the career ladder. The minimum wage currently stands at £6.19 per hour, but rises to £6.31 an hour in October. Gus Baker, co-director of campaigns group Interns Aware, said unpaid internships discriminated against the poorest graduates who lived outside London who are unable to work for nothing to get on the career ladder. 'We have employers who think they can get something for nothing,' he said. 'We have young people who have worked hard at college or university, who play by the rules and often have large debts. 'Then they are told they have to be able to work for free at the end of it. 'It disadvantages people not living within the M25 because they can't get to London to do these internships. If you are hard-working and from Cheshire or Scotland the door is slammed in your face. 'This is bad for employers too because they end up recruiting their workers from a narrower pool.' Michelle Wyer, assistant director of HMRC’s National Minimum Wage team, said: 'Unpaid interns can provide valuable opportunities. However, we are clear that employing unpaid interns instead of workers in order to avoid the National Minimum Wage is wrong. 'That is why we are cracking down on it. When an intern makes a complaint to the Pay and Work Rights Helpline about their pay conditions that case is prioritised within HMRC to ensure their employer is complying with the law. Where that's not the case, HMRC will not hesitate to take action. 'Paying the national minimum wage is the law not a choice, and the rules apply to all employers equally.' Overall, last year HMRC investigated 1,693 complaints against employers for breaking minimum wage rules. This resulted in 708 companies . receiving automatic penalty charges of up to £5,000 and 26,519 employees . receiving an average of around £150 in back pay, topping up wages that . had previously been below the legal minimum rate.","Companies ordered to pay £192,808 in fines and payments to 167 interns .

But like the characters in the movie – who also ended up serving lengthy jail terms – the law was already onto them. Nicholas Rowland, prosecuting at  Bristol Crown Court, said an . undercover policeman, known as Amin, had built up a working relationship . with Yasir Mahmood and Ershane Hussain and was supplied with . increasingly large amounts of cocaine. The dealers later used a boy of ten on six occasions to supply police with heroin worth £64,000.

Officers procured a further £41,000 worth of heroin in just one deal – . and uniformed officers swooped just as Hussain was counting the money. Bundles of cash, drugs and paraphernalia were seized from a number of properties belonging to the defendants in Bristol. Detective Chief Inspector Richard Kelvey said: ‘This case should send a . strong message to organised criminals that we are committed  to . disrupting and ultimately destroying their networks.

George Osborne today called on the Labour party to pay £1.5million in tax allegedly avoided on a donation. The Chancellor entered the row over shares given to Labour by businessman John Mill, who claimed it was a ‘tax efficient’ arrangement agreed with senior Labour Party officials. Labour leader Ed Miliband also faced questions about the affair, insisting the party would pay tax on any dividends it received. Demand: Chancellor George Osborne called on Labour to pay the tax owed after John Mills revealed his £1.65million donation to Labour in January this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company . Mr Mills revealed his £1.65million donation to Labour in January this year was made in the form of shares in his shopping channel company JML. He said the ‘tax efficient’ arrangement was agreed with senior Labour Party officials. Tax experts said he would have had to pay almost £1.5million in tax if he had made the donation in cash. They suggested Mr Mills would have had to earn £3.1million before tax to afford to make his donation in cash, with £1.46million going to HM Revenue & Customs. Alternatively, if he had made the donation via a single cash dividend it would have attracted dividend tax at 30.5 per cent, leaving a bill of almost £725,000. The revelation is deeply embarrassing for Ed Miliband who has attacked the Government over its failure to take robust action to tackle tax avoidance by wealthy individuals and corporations. In a letter to Mr Miliband this morning, Tory Mr Osborne challenged him: 'Can you confirm that the Labour Party advised Mr Mills on how to avoid tax on his donation? 'Most importantly, will you now pass the amount of tax that has been avoided to the Exchequer?' The Chancellor said the actions appeared to be 'directly at odds' with Mr Miliband's public statements, adding that the money was 'needed to fund vital public services such as the health service and our schools'. However, Mr Miliband insisted Labour would pay tax every year on dividends from the shares. Speaking in Newham, he said: 'My understanding of this is the reason John Mills gave us the money in this way is that he wanted us to have a steady stream of income. 'The Labour Party itself will be paying tax on these dividends. We are not avoiding tax. We are paying tax.' Write caption here . Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said the donation deal demonstrated the Labour leader’s ‘rank hypocrisy’. He . added: ‘In public he slams tax avoidance, yet behind closed doors he’s . happy to rubber-stamp whopping donations from tax avoidance schemes.’ Mr . Mills told the Daily Telegraph he would have had to give far more to . provide Labour with the same level of assistance if he had used . conventional means for making his donation. ‘To . be honest with you, it is the most tax efficient way of doing this,’ he . said. ‘Otherwise you get no tax relief on donations to political . parties for understandable reasons. ‘If you donate to a political party out of a tax-paid income, up until April it was 50 per cent and now it is 45. That means if it is £100,000, the Labour Party gets £55,000 and the Government gets £45,000.’ Mr Mills’s donation – by far the biggest private donation received by Labour this year – is thought to be the first ever made to a political party in shares. He said the decision to use the controversial method had ‘emerged’ during discussions with senior Labour figures. ‘It emerged… came out of a discussion I had with them about the best way of doing it,’ he said. ‘It is a good model (for donating). Labour has got people who deal with compliance and the legal side of all this. They are very sensitive nowadays.’ Under the terms of the deal, Labour is reported to be the owner of the shares, which will be valued each year by the company’s auditors. The party will receive an annual dividend payment on its shareholding. A Labour Party spokesman last night insisted the donation complied fully with electoral laws. He added: ‘This donation has been declared in full to the Electoral Commission in line with party funding rules and it appears on the Commission’s public register. It is standard practice to discuss donations’ permissibility with the Electoral Commission.’","Chancellor calls on opposition to hand money over to HMRC .

Australian scientists claim to have found a crystal clear lake that has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years. ‘It's like God's bathtub,’ Dr Cameron Barr said about the area named Blue Lake. ‘It is beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful.’ The lake, which is one of the largest on . North Stradbroke Island off the south Queensland coast, is so pure that . you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom. Blue Lake, which is one of the largest on North Stradbroke Island off the south Queensland coast, is so pure that you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom. Scientists say it has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years . Researchers studied the lake's water . discharge, water quality and comparisons of historical photos over the . past 117 years, as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand . its history. The discovery was made as researchers were studying former lakes in the same area that have dried up over the past 40 years. 'We didn't realise just how unique and unusual this lake is until we started looking at a wide range of environmental markers,' said Barr. 'We know that there have been variations in climate in the region . including North Stradbroke Island over recent decades, but during that . time the depth, shoreline and water chemistry of Blue Lake has displayed . little variation. 'We also know that the region experienced a significant shift towards a . drier climate around 4,000 years ago. Again, Blue Lake has demonstrated . little variation over this period. This is in stark contrast to other . changes in the region due to shifts in climate. Blue Lake is in North Stradbroke Island, 18 miles off the coast of Brisbane. Its lakes are classed as one of the world's most ecologically important wetlands . According to Barr, Blue Lake has remained unchanged because its waters drain into a nearby swamp and are replaced by an aquifer. ‘It appears that Blue Lake has been an important climate ""refuge"" for the freshwater biota of the region, and is in the same condition now as it was 7500 years ago. 'With appropriate management, the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds, possibly thousands of years to come,’ added Barr. Project leader  Dr John Tibby, said the results of this research could affect decision making about utilising the freshwater aquifer of North Stradbroke Island as a source of fresh water for the mainland. The results have been published online in the . journal Freshwater Biology. North Stradbroke Island lies 18 miles off the coast of Brisbane - and its lakes are classed as one of the world’s most ecologically important wetlands. As well as Blue Lake, the waterways include Brown Lake, the Keyholes, Eighteen Mile Swamp and some small lagoons. The Aboriginal name for Blue Lake National Park is 'Kaboora', which means 'silent pool'. A haven for wildlife, the area attracts forest birds, goannas (a type of monitor lizard) and other reptiles. Blue Lake is also home to soft-spined sunfish. The lake is not accessible by car, and the nearest car park is 1.5 miles away.","Blue Lake is in North Stradbroke Island off the south Queensland coast .

That’s what Atomic Floyd claim their latest creation, the PowerJax, has in spades. And thankfully, within seconds of putting them in your ears, it’s clear that they’re every bit as monstrous as expected. Raw power: There are few earphones of similar price that deliver such smooth low-end thump . The PowerJax take some of the best elements from the existing Atomic Floyd headphones and wraps them in a £99 package. The result is a pair of earphones packed with the latest soundproofing technology, world-class audio components and exquisite build quality. Sharp, crisp sound is achieved through their 13.5mm dynamic drivers, while a metal voice coil enriches the sound. The oversized 5mm angled nozzle injects the music straight into the sweet spot, too. There’s a strong depth of sound, perhaps slightly weaker than the more expensive SuperDarts, but instrument distinction is wonderful. There’s enough bass available through most amplitudes, but is at its best through the mid-range. Vocals cut through the low-end thump brilliantly, although at higher volumes become slightly overpowered. Distortion, though, is kept at a minimum, and coupled with excellent noise insulation, ensures a wonderfully immersive experience. As much time has been spent on the PowerJax’s aesthetics, too. The enlarged acoustic chambers are a result of injection-moulded steel – further enhancing sound quality, while reinforcing their aggressive character. There’s more than a hint of SuperDarts about their design – albeit slightly less flashy, but the overarching sense of clinical efficiency is impossible to ignore in the PowerJax’s crisp, sharp curves. The cable is manufactured from high-performance Kevlar with a low-friction TPU coating to stop tangling. While a stainless steel remote allows you to answer phone calls with a touch of a button. To ensure a snug fit, with SoftSeal eartips in three sizes – Small, medium and large. Pound for pound, the PowerJax earphones punch well above their weight.

Nasa's $2.5 billion rover has found evidence that as much as 90% of the original . atmosphere there has dissipated into space over the planet's lifetime. Curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds. The high-resolution image of Mount Sharp where scientists plan to send Curiosity. The rover has revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds . Rover team members revealed the readings at the European Geosciences Union 2013 General Assembly, in Vienna. Curiosity’s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument analyzed an atmosphere sample last week using a process that concentrates selected gases. The results provided the most precise measurements ever made of isotopes of argon in the Martian atmosphere. Isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights. 'We found arguably the clearest and most robust signature of atmospheric loss on Mars,' said Sushil Atreya, a SAM co-investigator at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. SAM found that the Martian atmosphere has about four times as much of a lighter stable isotope (argon-36) compared to a heavier one (argon-38). This removes previous uncertainty about the ratio in the Martian atmosphere from 1976 measurements from NASA’s Viking project and from small volumes of argon extracted from Martian meteorites. The ratio is much lower than the solar system’s original ratio, as estimated from argon-isotope measurements of the Sun and Jupiter. This points to a process at Mars that favored preferential 'leaking' of the lighter isotope over the heavier one. A Picasso-like self portrait of NASA's Curiosity rover was taken by its Navigation cameras, located on the now-upright mast. The rover has now sent back the first detailed analysis of the Martian atmosphere . The team also revealed the result of curiosity's weather monitoring. Curiosity measures several variables in today’s Martian atmosphere with the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS), provided by Spain. While daily air temperature has climbed steadily since the measurements began eight months ago and is not strongly tied to the rover’s location, humidity has differed significantly at different places along the rover’s route. These are the first systematic measurements of humidity on Mars, Nasa said. Trails of dust devils have not been seen inside Gale Crater, but REMS sensors detected many whirlwind patterns during the first hundred Martian days of the mission, though not as many as detected in the same length of time by earlier missions. 'A whirlwind is a very quick event that happens in a few seconds and should be verified by a combination of pressure, temperature and wind oscillations and, in some cases, a decrease is ultraviolet radiation,' said REMS Principal Investigator Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid. This illustration shows the instruments and subsystems of the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite on the Curiosity Rover of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project, which the rover used to analyse the Martian atmosphere . Dust distributed by the wind has been examined by Curiosity’s laser-firing Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument. Initial laser pulses on each target hit dust. The laser’s energy removes the dust to expose underlying material, but those initial pulses also provide information about the dust. 'We knew that Mars is red because of iron oxides in the dust,” said ChemCam Deputy Principal Investigator Sylvestre Maurice of the Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie in Toulouse, France. 'ChemCam reveals a complex chemical composition of the dust that includes hydrogen, which could be in the form of hydroxyl groups or water molecules.' As the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite of instruments on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover heats a sample, gases are released (or ""evolved"") from the sample and can be identified using SAM's quadrupole mass spectrometer. Here are its first readings. For the rest of April, Curiosity will carry out daily activities for which commands were sent in March, using DAN, REMS and the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD). No new commands are being sent during a four-week period while Mars is passing nearly behind the Sun, from Earth’s perspective. This geometry occurs about every 26 months and is called Mars solar conjunction.","90% of the original .

It's the most fearsome  creature that ever lived and could have devoured a Tyranosaurus-Rex for breakfast… and it is called Kevan. The Pliosaurus kevani, to give it its proper name, ruled the oceans 150million years ago. Equipped with a massive jaw studded with 12in teeth, the ‘sea rex’ had the biggest bite in history. The sea monster has been named Pliosaurus kevani after Kevan Sheehan, the retired café owner who spent five years painstakingly unearthing it . Dr Richard Forrest assembling the giant skull. Experts have hailed the fossil find as one of the most significant in the world and one of the most complete and best preserved skulls ever uncovered . The colossal creature has been named . after fossil hunter Kevan Sheehan, who described the honour as ‘a great . day for Kevans all over the world’. Mr Sheehan, a cafe owner, unearthed . fragments of the creature’s 8ft-long skull after they fell from cliffs . on the World Heritage Jurassic Coast in Dorset. It took him five years to collect the pieces during daily walks along the beach. Every time he found a new fossil, he put it in his rucksack and hauled it to his clifftop home. The largest piece weighed more than 12 stone and he believes his hobby cost him two knees and a hip. British scientists have identified a new species of a huge pre-historic sea monster. It is believed to have been the most powerful creature on earth . Now his efforts have been  officially acknowledged. Mr Sheehan, 68, from Osmington, near Weymouth, said: ‘This has been a real labour of love for me, but it was all worth it. ‘I guess it’s my legacy and it’s a great day for Kevans all over the world.’ The four-flippered pliosaurus would have weighed 12 tonnes, could have swallowed a great white shark whole and had a bite powerful enough to rip a car in half. Mr Shhehan said: 'I stumbled across the remains thinking they were fossilised wood and only picked them up because I thought they had a nice grain' Dr Richard Forrest assembles the giant skull measuring 19.9 5cm along the cranium and with a length of 20.45cm (left) Kevan Sheehan with the pliosaur on display at Dorset County Museum, Dorchester (right) The 60ft-long monster had a large head, short neck and a teardrop-shaped body. Two sets of powerful flippers and a thrashing tail allowed it to rapidly propel itself through the water in pursuit of prey. Although remains of other pliosaurs have been found before, the . ‘Kevan-asaurus’ is distinct enough to have been declared a  new species. Dr Roger Benson, of the University of . Oxford’s earth science department, said: ‘This pliosaur was much larger . and stronger than other pliosaurs and had more teeth. ‘Its lower jaw was very long from front to back whereas other species of pliosaurs had shorter ones. ‘Its teeth grew upwards and outwards compared to other pliosaurs’ teeth that went straight up. ‘This discovery is very significant for British palaeontology. ‘Several other pliosaurs have been found since the 1820s, but they are fragmentary compared to this one.’ Mr Sheehan sold his find to the county council for £10,000. The reconstructed skull, which is 95 per cent complete, is now on display at Dorset County Museum  in Dorchester.","Kevan Sheehan discovered the fossils of the pre-historic marine reptile pliosaurus -  believed to be most powerful creature ever .

A company boss who took 800 workers on a dream trip to Disney World in Florida is facing a £2.5million bill – because the  taxman ruled it was a perk. Malcolm Walker treated managers from Iceland supermarkets across Britain to a five-day company conference at the home of Mickey Mouse. But HM Revenue and Customs officials say the trip was a ‘benefit in kind’ for the staff and are demanding that Iceland pays £2.5million in tax. Wish you were here? Iceland staff enjoy a day out at Disneyworld in Florida during a 'conference' paid for by the company which HMRC now claims must be taxed to the tune of £2.5million . Mr Walker is furious and refusing to . pay up, arguing: ‘We did it because it’s an investment. Disney is the . No 1 in the world for customer service. We’re exposing our staff to . world-class customer service, and if just 10 per cent of it transfers . back home, it will be worth every penny. ‘It was fun and I’m not apologising  for that. Having fun has been a key factor in driving what we’ve achieved  at Iceland.’ Mr Walker, 66, flew his team of . managers to Florida for a £4million conference, including shows and . day-trips to the Disney resorts, in 2009. But four years later the . taxman insists the trip was little more than a free holiday for his . workers. Mr Walker, who set up Iceland in . Deeside, North Wales, argued that the £5,000-a-head theme park tour was a . business expense designed to give his senior staff an insight into the . heights of customer service at Disney World. But HMRC officials say the . trip was actually a reward for staff, and therefore a taxable benefit. Refusing to pay up: Iceland boss Malcolm Walker (left) argues that the five-day your, which included rides at the theme park (right) and visits to the Kennedy Space Center, was a business expense and should not be taxed . Mr Walker added: ‘At Iceland, our . biggest single strategic decision has been to focus on looking after our . colleagues, ensuring that they are happy and motivated. The logic is . that they, in turn, will look after our customers well and that will . drive sales and profits. ‘At Iceland, we believe in fun. We . must be doing something right because we were named by The Sunday Times . as the Best Big Company to Work For in the UK.’ Iceland has 776 stores employing . 23,000 staff across Britain – taking on the big supermarkets such as . Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. Proud: Mr Walker addresses his 800 staff on the trip which he described as the 'highlight of his career' Benefits in kind are goods and services provided to an employee for free or at greatly reduced costs. They are sometimes called 'perks' or 'fringe benefits' and can include company cars, private medical insurance paid for by the employer or free loans. Some will be taxed only for people who are not in lower paid employment, while others are applicable to everyone. The tax is based on the cash equivalent value of the benefit. The employer will pay National Insurance on these, while the employee will pay income tax.Source: HMRC/ Citizens' Advice Bureau/ TaxAid . Mr Walker – who says Iceland has paid . £513million in tax over the past eight years – added: ‘We have invested . millions over the past seven years in giving our store managers and head . office staff the best conferences money can buy. ‘These are unique, mind-blowing events that bring them back to the business buzzing and hungry for more success. ‘You might think that the Government . would be keen to learn from this success. Instead, they seem determined . to do their utmost to snuff out the fun in business by taxing as a . benefit any  kind of corporate event that might be considered . enjoyable.’ HMRC refuses to discuss individual tax affairs, but offers advice to companies on staff outings. It says overseas trips ‘variously . described as conferences, conventions or seminars are often no more than . incentives intended to reward past performance or to motivate employees . for the future’. On its website, HMRC warns that tax . collectors will look out for trips where ‘the itinerary will consist . largely of social occasions, excursions and leisure activities’.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:18 EST, 24 August 2011 . A 16-year-old boy who tried to incite a riot on Facebook has been told he faces jail after his anonymity was taken away by a judge. Johnny Melfah posted messages on a group online called 'Letz start a riot'. After a judge lifted his right to keep his identity secret yesterday he admitted the offences today - and was warned he would face jail. Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, were last week jailed for four years after creating Facebook . pages that urged rioting in their home towns. Accused: Johnny Melfah, 16, left, allegedly posted messages on the Facebook group 'Letz start a riot' which Danny Cook, 21, right, is accused of creating . Melfah, from Droitwich, Worcestershire, is thought to be the first child in the country charged in connection with rioting to be publicly identified even though he had not entered a plea. Today he pleaded guilty to intentionally . encouraging or assisting the commission of widespread thefts and . criminal damage, in a 20 minute hearing at Worcester Youth Court. He was warned by Magistrate Linda Griffin: 'I will be asking that the pre-sentence report looks at all possible options, including a custodial sentence.' Yesterday at Worcester Magistrates' Court a JP lifted an anonymity order and ruled identifying Melfah is in the public interest. An alleged looter was arrested after police officers followed a 'Hansel and Gretel' trail of sweets from a smashed-up corner shop, a court heard. The 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is said to have taken handfuls of goods from the store which was broken into just before midnight on August 9. Gregor McKinley, prosecuting, said two teenagers, including the youth, were arrested a short distance from the food and wine store in Beckton, east London. Mr McKinley said there was a 'trail of small confectionary items between the two men and the shop', just like the Brothers Grimm fairytale. 'Police also found a TV-DVD combination machine close to where they were detained,' the prosecutor told Inner London Crown Court. The boy, who denies burglary, will stand trial before Newham Youth Court on October 4. An application for bail was refused by Judge Roger Chapple. The Crown Prosecution Service issued new guidance urging prosecutors to try and persuade judges to identify youth defendants in more serious cases. Home Secretary Theresa May has also urged the courts to name youth defendants named in disturbances, where possible. The names of children on trial aged between 10 and 17 cannot be revealed unless an order is lifted. It is usually only in the most high-profile cases - such as the killing of two-year-old James Bulger - that child defendants are named. Matt Dodson, prosecuting, told the court that Melfah had posted messages . about arranging a riot in Worcester city centre. He was detained by . police outside a branch of McDonalds with a group of youths on the night . of August 9. 'He was arrested outside McDonalds,' said Mr Dodson. 'It cannot be clear as to what exactly he was doing there on that night.' Danny Cook, 21, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, also appeared before a court yesterday accused of founding the Facebook group. On the page information Cook allegedly posted: 'I started the group for people who want to riot but are sat at home. 'I wanted to start a riot in Worcester, like many young people in Birmingham have, free iPads available.' He also apparently wrote: 'There's . loads of people who just want to get involved, that is why I started . this group, LMAO.' The group had 44 members by August 9. Cook is charged with intentionally encouraging or assisting . the commission of widespread thefts and criminal damage via the social . networking site during the recent riots. He was also bailed and will appear before Worcester Magistrates' Court on October 8. Accused: Hollie Bentley, 19, allegedly told people to riot in Wakefield . In a separate incident, another teenager appeared in court accused of trying to incite a riot on Facebook. Hollie Bentley, 19, is alleged to have created an event on the popular site entitled ‘Wakey Riots’, which invited people to meet in the centre of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on August 13 and 14, the court heard. It is alleged that the event, created on August 9, also contained the phrase “Who’s up for it?” Richard Ogden, prosecuting at Wakefield Magistrates Court, said that the event was posted to 700 people. The teen, who spoke only to confirm her age and date of birth during the five-minute hearing, gave no indication of her plea to the charge of encouraging violent disorder. She will appear at the same court on September 21 where the case is expected to be committed to Crown Court. A £3million fund was launched today to help businesses hit by rioting and looting. A coalition of businesses, supported by London mayor Boris Johnson, announced a High Street Fund offering cash support to smaller firms hit by the disturbances. Firms including Barclays, BP, Lloyds Banking Group, Deloitte, RBS, Capita and Santander will contribute to the fund, with half a million pounds put in by the mayor. Sir William Castell, chairman of the High Street Fund and chairman of the Wellcome Trust said: 'This fund is about providing real help to businesses who need help now. 'Everyone was shocked at the damage caused by the riots, and for numerous small businesses the hardship is still being felt.' The London Mayor said: 'I have seen at first hand businesses showing remarkable resilience and true fighting spirit. 'However, it is no secret that many high streets in the capital are still suffering as a result of the appalling events earlier this month. 'Small businesses need urgent help to repair damage and get goods back on the shelves and the High Street Fund will help to do just that. 'I have absolutely no doubt that if we pull together and give our support to the fund, we can ensure that London emerges as a stronger and even more prosperous city than before.'

I couldn’t believe that Jorge was the Pope!' said his old girlfriend, now a white-hair pensioner with spectacles. Scroll down for video . Amalia Damonte, who Pope Francis proposed to as a 12-year-old. They were childhood sweethearts in Buenos Aires . It was either 1948 or 1949 when the future Pope wrote her a letter declaring he would like to marry her. 'We were 12, 13 years old. No more than that,' she said. 'He was wonderful. He was a proper guy.' 'There was only one letter and it cost me a smack in the face from my father,' she said. Pope Francis celebrates his inaugural Mass with cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican yesterday . The Pope used to play on the streets with Amalia and proposed marriage in letter at 12 . Bergoglio decided to take religious orders in 1958 when he was 21 but he wasn't ordained until 1969 . Today at 11:00am in the Clementine Hall he will meet with the full College of Cardinals, electors and non-electors, in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace. On Saturday at 11:00am in the Paul VI Hall, the Pope will hold an audience with accredited journalists (permanent and temporary) and those who work in the media. On Sunday, 17 March at 12:00pm, he will recite the first Angelus of his papacy from the papal apartments overlooking St. Peter's Square, as is customary. 'It said we were going to get married and I am going to buy you a white house. So the two of us could live together.' 'He said that if I didn’t say yes, he . would have to become a priest. Luckily for him, I said no!' said Ms . Damonte, who stills lives four doors up from Bergoglio's childhood home. 'He had a crush on me, you know. We . used to play on the streets here. It was a quiet neighbourhood then, . and, well, he was very nice.' She said she the he 'is a good man, the son of a working-class family,' she said. 'I hope he can achieve all the good that he holds in his heart.' It is quite possible that Ms Damonte wasn’t the only love in his life, despite what the future Pope told her. In a 2010 interview, he admitted he . had a girlfriend with whom he loved to dance the tango - probably not a . pastime for a 12-year-old. He said: ‘She was one of a group of friends with whom I used to go dancing with. ‘Then I discovered my religious vocation’.

Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979. The new Pope is an ardent fan of an Argentinian football team nicknamed the 'Saints.' Just in case their rivals were in any doubt, the club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, tweeted a photo of Pope Francis with the team's colours yesterday. The Buenos Aires club  - one of the country's top sides - owes its name to a Catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104-year-old team find a place to play in its early days. Father Lorenzo Massa became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram. There was just one condition - that they must attend mass on Sundays. In honour of his contribution, the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman.

A giant sunspot that is at least six times the diameter of Earth has formed on the Sun in less than 48 hours, Nasa has announced. Sunspots are dark spots on the surface of the Sun which appear as turbulent magnetic fields in its surface rearrange and realign. The massive sunspot, which formed over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, quickly evolved into an unstable configuration, and could lead to solar flares, which can interrupt our radio communications. Scroll down for video . Rapid formation: The bottom two black spots on the sun, known as sunspots, appeared quickly over the course of February 19-20. These two sunspots are part of the same system and are over six Earths across . Nasa scientists spotted the huge sunspot forming through instruments on the agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory, one of several spacecraft that monitor the Sun's weather. 'Over the course of February 19-20, 2013, scientists watched a giant sunspot form in under 48 hours,' said Karen Fox, a spokesman for Nasa. 'It has grown to over six Earth diameters across but its full extent is hard to judge since the spot lies on a sphere not a flat disk.' The sunspot identified by Nasa is formed of several dark blemishes on the surface on the Sun which have evolved rapidly over the past couple of days. The Solar Dynamics Observatory contains a suite of instruments that will provide observations leading to a more complete understanding of the solar dynamics that drive variability in the Earth's environment. This set of instruments: . Sunspots are caused by intense magnetic activity and are actually cooler than the rest of the Sun, which leaves them clearly visible as dark spots in the photosphere. In reality, if the sunspot were isolated from the surrounding photosphere it would be brighter than an electric arc. Ms Fox added: 'The spot quickly evolved into what's called a delta region, in which the lighter areas around the sunspot, the penumbra, exhibit magnetic fields that point in the opposite direction of those fields in the center, dark area. 'This is a fairly unstable configuration that scientists know can lead to eruptions of radiation on the sun called solar flares.' The observation comes as the Sun is gearing up for the most active phase of its 11-year solar cycle. The Sun's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles. This causes large numbers of sunspots appear, and the Sun's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent. The increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns. The solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next, with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle. Large solar flares often occur during a maximum. For example, the Solar storm of 1859 struck the Earth with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as Rome. The last solar maximum was in 2000. In 2006 NASA initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011, and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958. However, more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906.","The sunspot quickly evolved into an unstable configuration and could lead to solar flares, Nasa warns .

Anas Iqbal who is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court along with four others accused of grooming young girls . A gang of men groomed young girls from troubled backgrounds before sexually assaulting them and forcing them into prostitution, a court heard today. Naeem Ahmed, 25, Nabeel Ahmed, 24, and his brother Jameel, 24, Anas Iqbal, 25, and Hassan Raza, 23, allegedly targeted six girls, three of whom lived in care homes, between January and December last year. They were given drugs and alcohol before being passed on to other men for sex, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. One girl claims she was pinned down on a bed by one of the men so another two could rape her. The same girl, who was 17 at the time, claims Naeem Ahmed, promised to be her boyfriend if she let him sell her to other men for money. The court heard she did it ‘because I thought I was in love with him and wanted to make him happy.’ In the following months Naeem, known as Ricky, pimped her out to his pals sometimes for just £20 a time, a jury heard. The gang tried to recruit other girls from the care system but when they refused to have sex with them they told Ricky’s girlfriend she would have to do it instead to ‘show him she was his top girl,' prosecutor Kate Bex said. The court heard that the gang told a teenage girl she could work for them if she had a threesome. A teenage girl was allegedly told: 'It’s just a bit of fun, we’re all friends here.' The court also heard how Raza forced the 18-year-old to strip while he took pictures of her on his mobile phone. He attempted to tear her clothes off and shouted 'Why aren't you f**king smiling,' it is claimed. The gang’s activities only came to light after the girls confided in care workers at the home who were concerned they may have become involved in prostitution. It took time to identify them because the victims did not know the full names of the men and they often used English pseudonyms. It then emerged they had been questioned by officers in May 2012 after they were accused of raping an 18-year-old girl who they picked up after seeing her row with a friend. Two more girls, aged 16 and 17, later came forward claiming they had also been abused by the gang after being offered a lift by them. The younger girl alleges she was raped five times by Iqbal after being plied with booze and cocaine while her friend claims he also tried to rape her. The five men now face 17 charges between them including sexual assault, rape, inciting child prostitution, paying for the sexual services of a child and controlling a child prostitute. The alleged offences mostly took place at a house in Chadwell Heath, east London, but the girls say they were also taken to hotels in Ilford and Barking for sex. On trial: The men, all from Essex and east London, denied the charges at Snaresbrook Crown Court . The girls, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claim on many occasions the men did not use any contraception. Two of the girls were also forced to pose for nude pictures which the gang took on their mobile phones, jurors were told. Opening the case, prosecutor Miss Bex said: 'This case is about the sexual exploitation of young girls by the defendants. 'All of these girls are from difficult, troubled backgrounds and are vulnerable young people. 'They share many of the same characteristics; the majority have no concept of self worth, they have been deprived of material possessions, love and often both. 'The men concerned in the grooming of such young people pray on this. They are fully aware that they have been starved of affection and use this as a way to feed their own criminal means and as a tool to exploit them.' Referring to a report made by a care worker to the police Miss Bex said: 'He describes how these young people have never received any therapeutic intervention or help and that as a result they struggle emotionally and may be incapable of giving or receiving love, making them vulnerable to predators and manipulators. 'From the work he has done in the past 10 years he is able to say that these vulnerable people have not experienced warmth and affection and that because of their past experiences sexual contact is often viewed as affection.' Under the law girls are classed as children if they are forced into prostitution before they are 18. The men, all from Essex and east London, deny the charges. The case continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The men on trial are Naeem Ahmed, 25, Nabeel Ahmed, 24, and his brother Jameel, 24, Anas Iqbal, 25, and Hassan Raza, 23 .

Nicole Kelly took the crown Saturday after a 3-day competition in Davenport, Iowa. She will go on to compete for the Miss America crown in September. Kelly, 23, hails from the Hawkeye State town of Keokuk. She intends to use the coveted platform of the Miss America competition to discuss overcoming disabilities. Uplifting: Nicole Kelly, born with no left forearm, was crowned Miss Iowa Saturday after a three day competition . Unexpected: The shocked beauty queen said she never expected to become a 'pageant girl' ‘As I grew up I learned to counterbalance the initial stares I received from people with an outgoing personality that would not give into ""no,”’ writes Kelly in her official Miss Iowa biography. ‘This means that I tried everything. ‘From baseball, to dance, to diving - there is nothing I would not try. I found my passion within a world where I was giving people permission to stare: the stage.’ Kelly took her passion to the next level when she enrolled at the University of Nebrask-Lincoln and began studying theatre. She graduated in May 2012 and now hopes for a career as a Broadway stage manager. Going places: The 23-year-old is gunning for a career on Broadway and already works for Tony-nominated show The Assembled Parties. She sang Defying Gravity from the show Wicked as part of the talent showcase . She performed the number Defying Gravity from the musical Wicked for the talent portion of the Iowa competition. Now living in New York, Kelly is working toward that goal. For the past year, she interned at theaters in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere and is now working for Tony-nominated The Assembled Parties. ‘So for now,’ she writes, ‘in between pageants and appearances, I spend my nights on the Great White Way.’ Performer: Kelly finished college in May 2012, where she majored in theater . Despite her obvious strength and initiative, Kelly’s new role as Miss Iowa is as big a surprise to her as it is to anyone. ‘If you would have told me a year ago that ""pageant queen"" was in my future I would have laughed,’ she writes. ‘So maybe I didn't see this path coming my direction, but now that I am here I can see it is a perfect fit and I feel so blessed to have been surrounded by people who have encouraged my steps.’ Another first occurred at last year's Miss America pageant when Alexis Wineman became the first autistic contestant on the hallowed stage. In 1994, Heather Whitestone of Alabama became the first deaf woman to win the title of Miss America. Kelly will get her shot at the crown September 15, 2013 at the Miss America 2014 pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world . Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world, experts said yesterday. The Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing. In a report commissioned by Parliament, it is warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work. They concluded that the World . Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as . suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so . poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’. And . they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of . Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which . famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834. The . report into the ‘looming crisis’ put forward four options for dealing . with the mess - although MPs have already rejected the nuclear option of . moving out of the Palace altogether, turning it into a museum and . building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in London. Other ideas include continuing with piecemeal repairs costing £26million a year, and spending 10 years on a boosted programme of repairs during weekends and recesses. The most likely option is to move MPs and peers out of the neo-Gothic edifice altogether, housing them in new temporary buildings on the Parliamentary estate or in facilities such as the nearby Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre or Church House. Although they do not put a final cost on the work, they say it will be at least £1.6billion. The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy was ordered by the House of Commons Commission. It warns: ‘While the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown, investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the Palace. Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’: . ASBESTOSThe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk. ELECTRICSMuch of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power . VENTILLATIONMany original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable. HEATINGMany boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months . FLOODINGFfaulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained. LEAKY ROOFSA problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life. DANGEROUS CEILINGSSeveral pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber . DRAINAGE Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected. FIRE SAFETYOut of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily. LIFTSOldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations. SUBSIDENCEAlthough the report did not consider this, another problem is that the Palace is sinking into the Thames, with Big Ben already leaning 18 inches. ‘If the Palace were not a listed building of the highest heritage value, its owners would probably be advised to demolish and rebuild.’ There has been no renovation to the . spectacular building, rebuilt along designs by Charles Barry in the . 1850s, since the late 1940s, following the destruction of the Commons . chamber by Nazi bombs. The . report goes on: ‘Considering the age of the Palace of Westminster, the . 60-plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment, . the long-term under-investment in the fabric and the intensive use to . which the Palace is put, it is remarkable that it continues to function. ‘The . signs of wear and tear, the number and frequency of relatively minor . floods and mechanical breakdowns, the high cost of maintaining . obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent . on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible . evidence of the looming crisis. ‘A . growing body of surveys, consultancy reports and risk registers point . to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that . could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely. ‘It is hard to imagine how the Palace will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul.’ Among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics, clapped-out boilers and leaking roofs. Asbestos, which is ‘present throughout the building’, is identified as a ‘risk to all persons within the Palace of Westminster’. Water . penetration is a particular problem in the belfry of the Big Ben tower. They warn that if a heating pipe were to snap near the Commons chamber, . the escape of steam would distribute asbestos, putting the chamber out . of commission ‘for months’. Many parts of the Palace are in a . ‘shabby condition’. Several pieces of timber fall from the . fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, endangering . tourists; and a boss once fell from the roof of the Lords chamber. Fire . safety is another concern. Fire alarms are old, the coverage of . automatic fire detection systems are incomplete, and there is little . ‘compartmentation’, meaning fire can quickly spread round the building. The . report warns: ‘Fortunately there have been no major outbreaks of fire . in the Palace in recent years. Forty minor fires have been recorded, . however, since 2008. All have been quickly dealt with. ‘Although . these have been minor incidents, there has been some evidence of smoke . travelling through architectural voids, confirming that current . compartmentation is unreliable.’ The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy, pictured, was ordered by the House of Commons Commission . It currently costs £26million a year merely doing patch-up jobs in Parliament. The report estimates that at least £1.5billion would be needed for work on the Palace, plus £100million for temporary accommodation required in the meantime. An option of modernising the building in halves - with the Commons moving into the Lords while work was going on there, vice versa - is frowned upon because ‘the security challenge would be almost insurmountable’. It concluded: ‘These factors strengthen the case for a complete emptying of the building once alternative accommodation is ready to be brought into use.’ The House of Commons Commission will decide which option to go for over the next year or so after receiving full costings of the work. No renovation will start until after the next election in 2015.",It is warned MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building .

The mother of a gunman who fatally shot five people during a chaotic spate of violence last week said the shooter's father threatened to kill her on at least two occasions during their tumultuous marriage, according to court records obtained Monday by The Associated Press. In a 1998 request for a restraining order, gunman John Zawahri's mother, Randa Abdou, wrote that her husband once told her: 'If I had a gun it would be over.' Abdou also said her husband had threatened to take their two young sons to Canada after the couple separated at the time, and that he once punched her and stole her jewelry, purse and divorce papers she had started filling out. Authorities said John Zawahri, 23, shot his father, Samir Zawahri, and his brother, Christopher Zawahri, on Friday, leaving their home in flames before shooting at strangers in cars and at Santa Monica College during a 15-minute rampage. Pictured: John Zawahri, 23, in his Santa Monica High School yearbook. Zawahri killed five and was himself killed by police after a 15 minute shooting spree Friday that ended at Santa Monica College .

Abdou cut short a visit with family . in Lebanon to return to Los Angeles on Sunday and had spoken with . investigators, who hoped she could provide clues to what sparked the . violence. Neighbor Beverly Meadows said Abdou told her by phone Monday that she was in mourning and concerned about those who were hurt. 'She is very, very fragile right now, and at this point in time, everybody else is gone,' Meadows said. Abdou has not spoken to the media. 'Please respect the fact that this . woman is devastated,' Meadows said. 'She is absolutely overwhelmed and . she doesn't know how to process it. She sounds like she's done nothing . but cry. ...

Deadly: Police say the shooter had 1,300 rounds of ammunition in his possession during the rampage . When Zawahri was 9, his now-separated mother sought the restraining order. In the 1998 document, Abdou said she . left Lebanon and joined her husband in the U.S. five years after their . wedding, and the couple 'have had marital troubles ever since.' Her husband had been 'verbally . abusive and controlling,' she stated, adding that she was afraid he . might do something 'drastic because he seems to become increasingly . angry and frustrated over our separation.' Abdou said her husband has 'followed . me, struck me, taken the children without telling me, and entered my . apartment without my permission and removed photographs.' He once came to the apartment and told her that he was going to take the children to Canada, she said. 'The defendant said that he would do . anything to make my life miserable and that he could kill me and no . restraining order can stop him,' she said. Her husband waited for her at work . once, and when she pulled up in a car with a friend, he struck her in . the arm, pulled her hair, took gold bracelets, her purse and divorce . papers she had not completed, she said.

Abdou asked the court to order the . return of her property, including her green card, and to grant her . custody of the couple's two sons pending a court hearing. Her request . for a restraining order requiring Samir Zawahri to stay 100 yards from . his wife and the kids was granted for a couple weeks.

The murder trial of a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, opened today. Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot by George Zimmerman as he walked to meet his father in a gated housing estate in Sandford, Florida, after buying a soft-drink and sweets in February 2012. Zimmerman claims he used his 9mm handgun in self-defence after being attacked by Martin but prosecutors argue he racially profiled the teenager. Protestors stood outside the courthouse today at the opening of the trial and experts said it is one of the most polarizing cases in Florida's recent history. George Zimmerman, pictured in court, left, claims he shot Trayvon Martin, right, in self-defence . Zimmerman, pictured with his co-counsel Don West, has been charged with second-degree murder . Martin's death sparked demonstrations across the U.S. amid anger that police waited six weeks to arrest Zimmerman. It also fanned a debate about race and Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' gun law. Jury selection began today as the first group of 100 . potential jurors filled out questionnaires about their knowledge of the . case. Six jury members and four alternates will be chosen to sit on the . trial, which is expected to last about six weeks. They will be asked to decide if Zimmerman shot the teenager in self-defence. Under Florida's 'stand your ground' law, Zimmerman, 29, could shoot Martin if it was . necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claims he shot Martin with his 9mm pistol in self-defence after the teenager broke his nose in a fight. However, prosecutors will argue that . the volunteer neighbourhood watch captain shot Martin at the Retreat at . Twin Lakes gated community after racially-profiling him. They say Zimmerman pursued and confronted the teenager after reporting a 'suspicious male' to police. Thousands of people across the country joined rallies and protests with many wearing a hoodie like Martin was when he was shot. Trayvon Martin's parents Tracy Martin, second right, and Sybrina Fulton, said they have faith in the justice system . The death of the teenager, who was unarmed, sparked protests across the U.S. The Rev Al Sharpton said at the time that activists were planning a ‘wave of civil disobedience' and said it is important to show ‘sustained indignation’ over Martin's death. Black Panther Party also offered a $10,000 reward for Zimmerman’s ‘capture'. Elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of dollars was donated to Zimmerman to pay for his defence. Florida officials were braced today for scores of protestors outside court, but fewer than expected turned up. The teenager's father Tracy Martin said he was relieved the trial was starting and called for calm during proceedings. He said: 'We . seek a fair and impartial trial. We ask that . the community continue to stay peaceful as we place our faith in the . justice system.' The family unsuccessfully tried to get the state's stand your ground law changed. Zimmerman's . brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr, said his family was confident that . prosecutors would not meet the burden of proving the neighbourhood watch . volunteer was guilty of murder. He called the charge 'improper' and said charges were filed for political reasons. Protestors gathered outside Seminole County Courthouse for the opening of Zimmerman's trial . Relatives of Oscar Grant, who was fatally shot by police in California, were among the demonstrators . He said: 'You . don't charge in this country simply to assuage the concerns of masses. 'Unfortunately, a political calculation was . made, centred around the politics of race and the law was defiled.' The case has split the local community and extra security has been put in place around the courthouse. A number of attempts to diffuse racial tension have also been implemented. Local pastors from various faiths will sit in on the trial to report back to the community. Dr Vibert White, an associate professor of history at the University of Central Florida and an expert in African American studies, told The Guardian: 'This is one of the most polarising cases Florida has seen in recent memory.' Judge Debra Nelson today denied a request by the defence to delay the trial. The judge has said she will keep the . identities of the selected jurors anonymous but she rejected a defence . request to hide the identities of the entire jury pool of 500 residents. Zimmerman, pictured at court today, left, and at a hearing in April 2012, right . Zimmerman's wife Shelly was at court for the first day of proceedings alongside the family security guard .

His defence team do not want the experts to testify. Neighbours called 911 during the fight and cries for help can be heard on the recordings. Martin's family claim the cries came from the teen while Zimmerman's father has testified they were those of his son. About a dozen people protested outside the Seminole County Courthouse in Sandford, Florida, at the opening day of the trial. Relatives of Oscar Grant, a man who was fatally shot by police officer in Oakland, California, were among the demonstrators. Cephus .

"By . Joshua Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 11:33 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:36 EST, 10 June 2013 . While the country’s largest breast cancer charity, Susan G. Komen, announced it was cancelling half its 3-day races nationwide next year, CEO Nancy Brinker’s compensation package has increased considerably in the past two years. And at $684,000, the pay itself is enough to raise eyebrows,  not to mention Brinker’s 2012 announcement she would be stepping down as Komen CEO. Her announcement came in August in the wake of the early 2012 controversy over the charity’s short-lived decision to pull funding from Planned Parenthood to provide breast cancer screenings. Brinker has remained listed as the organization’s CEO in the ten months since. The cause? Susan G. Komen founder Nancy Brinker is under fire for her $684,000 paycheck as her organization cancels events nationwide due to flagging turnout . According to NBC News, Brinker has received a 64 percent raise since 2010 despite a steep drop in donations made to the organizations and in participation in Komen’s signature races nationwide. Komen says Brinker’s raise came prior to last year’s defunding debacle. Komen spokesperson Andrea Rader told NBC News Brinker ‘did not receive a pay increase in 2011 and did not accept one in 2012, nor will she receive one in 2013. ‘Our CEO pay reflects the comprehensive and global nature of our work,’ Rader continued.  ‘We're active in breast cancer programs in 30 countries.’ 'Difficult to sustain': The group's 3-Day Walk, once a national event in 14 major cities, has been canceled in 14 of those cities for 2014 as participation and giving drop . The Daily Beast reported last week that Brinker took the raise in November of 2010, before which she took in $417,000 per year. Despite the reach of the charity she founded, Brinker’s pay may not be in be in synch with its revenue. Pound for pound, hers outweighs CEO pay at some of the largest American charities. At United Way, listed as the largest charity in the U.S. by Forbes in terms of donations received, total revenue was over $4.1 billion as of October 2012. Charity Navigator, a website billed as ‘Your guide to intelligent giving,’ lists United Way CEO Brian A. Gallagher’s pay as $763,394. Moving on? The rankling over Brinker's pay stands out after the Komen CEO said she would soon move in August 2012 but has remained in the position since . Charity Navigator lists the pay of Vicki Escarra, CEO of Forbes’ #4 charity Feeding America,—which had a revenue of $1.2 billion as of October 2012—at about $408,000. Meanwhile, Susan G Komen for the Cure is listed at #40 by Forbes in terms of donations and had $327 million in revenue as of October. Though her organization brings in about a third of that raised by Feeding America, Brinker makes hundreds of thousands more than the Chicago-based charity’s head honcho. ‘This pay package is way outside the norm,’ Charity Navigator’s CEO Ken Berger told NBC. ‘It's about a quarter of a million dollars more than what we see for charities of this size, . Though Brinker took a lot of heat after yanking funding to Planned Parenthood for breast exams and all but resigned in 2012, the CEO is still benefiting from a giant bump in pay she took in 2010. Below is Brinker's pay compared with that of CEO's of America's far larger charities: . Brian A. Gallagher, CEO United Way Worldwide, which had $4.14 billion in revenue as of October 2012. Compensation: $763,394 . Gail J. McGovern, CEO American Red Cross, which had $3.65 billion in revenue as of October 2012. Compensation: $501,122 . Vicki Escarra, CEO Feeding America, which had $1.18 billion in revenue as of October 2012.Compensation: $408,958 . Nancy Brinker, CEO Susan G. Komen, which had $327 million in revenue as of October 2012. Compensation: $684,717 . ‘This is more than the head of the Red Cross is making for an organization that is one-tenth the size of the Red Cross.’ Berger’s site lists American Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern’s pay at just over $500,000. More in line with her pay are Brinker's reportedly lavish lifestyle and taste. In 2012, a Daily Beast report titled 'Nancy Brinker: A Socialite, a Scandal, and a Mysterious Expense Report' questioned Brinker's previous earnings (which the report listed as 'over $400,000 at Komen) in light of a huge expense bill she sent the organization. According to the report, 'Brinker billed the foundation for $133,507 in expenses from June 2007 to January 2009, according to her filings with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.' Over that  time period, Brinker was doing more than working at Komen, however. Under George W. Bush, Brinker was the Chief of Protocol for the U.S. State Department, a full-time position. Brinker--who was also ambassador to Hungary from 2001 to 2003--returned to full-time work as Komen CEO at the conclusion of her time with the White House, at which point some of her employees said things began to change. 'It was like suddenly she expected someone to carry her purse,' said one Daily Beast source for the 2012 report, which sourced from 'a half-dozen former Komen employees who held a range of jobs at the charity.' ‘An imposing figure who flies first class, prefers five-star hotels, and generally exhibits an entitled air...Employees don’t call her “Nancy,”’ said the sources, ‘They are expected to call her “Ambassador Brinker.”’ Brinker started the Susan G. Komen foundation at the start of the 1980s to honor her sister, who lost her battle with breast cancer and for whom the organization is named. In her personal biography on the Komen website, Brinker credits ex-husband Norman Brinker for her ability to grow the company so successfully. Norman Brinker, who Nancy calls 'a brilliant entrepreneur who mentored and encouraged me' made millions as founder of Brinker International, a pioneer in casual dining that housed such restaurants as Chili's, Maggiano's, T.G.I. Friday's, and Bennigan's. Nancy Brinker, a resident of posh Palm Beach, Florida, divorced the man who America can thank for the now-ubiquitous salad bar in 2003, but the two remained business allies until his death in 2009. Previously held in 14 cities, the 3-day walk, billed on its Facebook page as ‘a 3 day, 60-mile walk for women and men who want to make a personal difference in the fight against breast cancer,’ will be held nationwide as planned in 2013. However, the event has been cancelled in 7 of those cities for 2014 and Komen blames a drop in participation. Via the Facebook page: . ‘We are saddened to share that the 3-Day will not be returning to the following markets in 2014: Arizona, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, San Francisco and Washington, D.C…While the 3-Day has brought great awareness to the breast cancer cause, participation levels over the last four years have made it difficult to sustain an event of this magnitude in 14 cities.’ The race will continue as planned in Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Michigan, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle and the Twin Cities. As participation and donations to the Dallas, Texas-based charity flag—whether due to economic troubles or anger over the 2012 Planned Parenthood controversy or some other reason—Berger says news of Brinker’s salary will only make matters worse for Komen. Drop in numbers? The breast cancer awareness foundation took major heat in 2012 after pulling funding from Planned Parenthood, which some now blame for flagging participation in the group's races . ‘When donors realize that her salary is so high and so out of comparison to what it normally would be,’ he told NBC, ‘I am certain there are going to be some donors who are no longer going to support this organization because they have lost trust in its decision-making.’ Lisa Bonchek Adams, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 and has raised over $20,000 for Komen through her participation in races and other events, also believes Brinker, and not poor participation, is the organization's problem.'If Nancy Brinker were smart, she’d say, ""Gee, I took $685,000 in salary last year. Whatever we need to make these events go on, how about I give up my salary for a year,""' Adams told the Daily Beast. 'She is their biggest liability.'","CEO Nancy Brinker's took a big pay raise from $417,000 in 2010 and continues to benefit from the bump in pay despite announcing in 2012 she planned to step down from the job .

Internet giants are to be told 'enough is enough' by ministers as they come under fire for failing to prevent a tide of pornographic and extremist material online. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has summoned Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and other firms to a Whitehall summit where they will be told to consider urgent measures to limit access to harmful material. Government sources said they would include new filters to screen out ‘offensive and unlawful’ content, tighter controls on what is allowed on public wi-fi, and a new industry-wide protocol on how complaints are dealt with. Phone companies, including Vodafone and O2, are also being asked to attend the talks because of the amount of harmful material being downloaded on mobiles. The fresh call for action comes after Mark Bridger was given a life sentence for the murder of five-year-old April Jones last week. He had collected a ‘library’ of sickening images from the internet in the weeks before the abduction. Concerns have also been raised over extremist material online in the wake of the Woolwich killing. In a letter to Dan Cobley, UK managing director of Google, Mrs Miller said: ‘Recent horrific events have again highlighted the widespread public concern over the proliferation of, and easy access to, harmful content on the internet. ‘Whether these concerns focus on access to illegal pornographic content, the proliferation of extremist material which might incite racial or religious hatred, or the ongoing battle against online copyright theft, a common question emerges: what more can be done to prevent offensive online content potentially causing harm? ‘It is clear that dangerous, highly offensive, unlawful and illegal material is available through basic search functions and I believe that many popular search engines, websites and ISPs could do more to prevent the dissemination of such material.’ Measures to be discussed include an industry-wide protocol governing how they would respond to concerns around content when they arise and how they deal with complaints . The letter does not contain any threats of sanctions if the search engines fail to come up with an acceptable solution. But the Culture Secretary insisted that the fact the solutions were complex was ‘not an acceptable reason for the current situation to persist’. ‘Greater efforts need to be made to prevent the uploading, downloading and sharing of harmful material. Effective technological solutions have to be developed - and deployed -to minimise the harm done to businesses and consumers.’ Mrs Miller said Google played a ‘key role in terms of how individuals access online content - and has serious public responsibilities as a result of this position’. ‘A relatively small number of organisations wield a great deal of online power - and I believe that with that power comes a great responsibility. Given the grave concerns that have been raised it is right that we now consider what more could and should be done in this area,’ she added. Google and the other firms - Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, Virgin, Talk Talk, Vodafone, Sky, O2, EE, Three - have been asked to attend talks in Whitehall on June 18. Measures to be discussed include an industry-wide protocol governing how they whould respond to concerns around content when they arise and how they deal with complaints. Significant progress has been made on pornography filters but Mrs Miller wants them introduced to block other harmful content, and suggests an agreement on banning porn on public wi-fi available in coffee shops and other areas should be extended. The industry will also be urged to form a group that meets regularly to focus on the issue. On porn, the five main ISPs - BT, Everything Everywhere, Sky, TalkTalk, and Virgin Media - have made a commitment to offer filters to protect all devices in the home and will make selecting internet controls an ‘unavoidable step’ for new customers. If customers choose not to engage - for example, if they just repeatedly click ‘yes’ to get through set-up quickly - then that would lead to protections being on rather than off.","Culture Secretary Maria Miller summons Google and other firms to a summit .

Police aren't expected to seek charges in the death of an Arizona man who was accidentally shot by his four-year-old son, authorities said. Special Forces veteran Justin Stanfield Thomas, 35, was fatally shot on Friday after he and his son traveled from Phoenix to a friend's home 90 miles away in the northern Arizona community of Prescott Valley for a surprise visit. The boy found the loaded gun in the home within minutes of arrival, asked a question about it and pulled the trigger, Prescott Valley Police spokesman Brandon Bonney said. Killed: Justin Thomas, a former military policeman, was accidentally shot dead by his four-year-old son on Friday . Great dad: Thomas was an Iraq War veteran and a former member of the Army's Green Beret . Thomas was rushed to hospital but later died. The child has been with his mother since the day the shooting occurred.

'They're processing everything to see . where they stand with the interviews and the crime scene investigation . and see if everything is matching up,' Bonney told The Prescott Daily . Courier.

Slain: Anthony Lee, 49, also known as drag queen South Beach Wanda (left), was shot dead in Tampa, Florida. Deandre Tolliver (right), 23, has been arrested for first-degree murder and armed robbery . According to Tampa police Tolliver, 23, was one of three suspects who arrived in a dark colored Dodge Magnum at 3911 East Genessee St where Lee was staying to care for a sick friend. Consummate performer: 'I'm a comedian. Don't sit in the front row if you don't want to be picked on. I'm different. There's nobody on the Beach like me,' Anthony Lee told the Miami New Times in '98 . The Miami New Times said Lee was . cooking dinner at his friend's house the night of May 28 when a suspect . knocked at the door. Lee opened the door and was shot five times at . point blank range. Police believe it may have been a case of mistaken . identity. According to Bay . News 9, police think the house was targeted, but it is unclear if the . bullet was meant for someone else, or if the case was a botched home . invasion. A neighbor heard the commotion and ran to help, but Lee's injuries were too grave and he died at the scene. 'I [saw] him fighting for his breath. I was trying to help him breathe before the police came,' Jeremy Judkins told Bay News 9. Tolliver is already on probation . after serving six months in prison for assault with a deadly weapon. Police aren't saying exactly what Tolliver's role in the shooting was, but he is . facing charges of murder in the first degree and armed robbery. At Hamburger Mary's, a Ybor City . institution where Wanda was a regular performer, owner Kurt King, . employees and friends of Lee gathered to hold a fundraiser on Thursday . to help pay for his funeral. Crime scene: Lee went visit an ailing friend at 3911 East Genesee in Tampa when he was gunned down by a stranger who came knocking on the door . Towering personality: At six-foot-six without heels, when Anthony Lee became his alter-ego Wanda, people couldn't help but take notice . 'I was just shocked,' King, who had known Lee for 22 years, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'I heard about it 20 minutes after it happened. I . didn't believe it until a friend called me and said it was true.' As Wanda, Lee would often take the stage at Hamburger Mary's resplendent in his favorite blond wig and sequinned gown to lip sync to Whitney Houston. King said investigators told him that Lee was cooking dinner at his female friend's house when the suspects arrived. Larger than life: Sadly, South Beach Wanda, or Sobe Wanda, has something else in common with her idol Whitney Houston - they both died too young in tragic circumstances . 'It was just like Wanda to be cooking for somebody,' said James Bailey, . a friend and bartender at Hamburger Mary's. 'She was always cooking for . us.' The funeral was held on Saturday at the Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Tampa. 'Today we laid him to rest and GOD answered my prayers and TPD did their job,' Lee's sister, Barbara Lee-Thomas, wrote in a Facebook post. 'My GOD will answer prayers.' Beloved: Wanda was famous for her balloon-filled bust-line and comical drag performances . Wanda performed her swansong at Hamburger Mary's the Thursday before last. King said Wanda's career was long and successful, with gigs up and down the country. She first worked for King in 1991, and the two formed a close friendship over the years. Wanda was known for her Whitney Houston obsession, snarky one-liners and outrageous antics including donning a dress made of tampons and jumping into a pool. Fabulous: Wanda was known for her high-necked, long-sleeved, sequin-encrusted gowns . 'She was very funny, hanging from the . rafters and swinging, having fun. She impersonated Whitney Houston, . wore balloons instead of a bra. When she was in the show, it was a show . of her own,' said King. At . Thursday's fundraiser, a dozen fellow drag queens performed. Each began . their performance with their fondest memory of Wanda, which was often of . a memorable insult Wanda had thrown their way. 'We just want justice to be done,' said Power Infiniti, a fellow drag queen whose first meeting with Lee involved being laughed at. 'He thought I looked a hot mess,' said Infiniti. Head and shoulders above: Friends and colleagues of Wanda are mourning her loss as Deandre Tolliver, 23, faces murder charges for the shooting death of Anthony Lee . 'We’d been friends for, like I . said, 17 years and we actually got to know each other when I was first . starting out as a club kid in South Beach,' he recalled to Bay News 9. The pair were together just over a week ago in Ybor City. 'The next thing I hear is that he is dead was a shock to say the least,' he said. He and Lee had exchanged text messages just hours before. Kind words: One of Lee's sisters remembered her brother as a warm person who genuinely loved people . 'He was very strong,' Power Infiniti . said. 'He told it like it was and he was very forthright. If he loved . you, he loved you fiercely and he was an amazing friend.' 'She was in my wedding, she caught the bouquet. And then took her wig off, and went for the garter,' wrote South Beach nightlife impresario Eric Milon's wife, Stacy of Wanda, in the comments section of the Miami Herald. Police . records show Tolliver has a violent history with a string of offenses . to his name, beginning in 2004 when he was arrested on drug charges by . Polk County deputies. Other . arrests include aggravated assault with a firearm, aggravated assault, . battery, burglary, marijuana possession, grand theft, resisting arrest . and failure to appear in court. He was in state prison from July 2011 . until January 2012 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, was on . probation at the time of his latest arrest. Anthony Jerome Lee is survived by three sisters and four brothers and numerous nieces and nephews. According to his friend King, the siblings' mother died just a few weeks ago.","Anthony Lee, 49, was gunned down in Lakeside while at a friend's home .

Edmonton's Oilers team has lost its third coach in as many years after head coach of one year Ralph Krueger was fired during a Skype call on Saturday. Winnipeg native Krueger, 52, who served as associate coach for two seasons before his ascendance to head coach, was unceremoniously let go during the chat session with manager Craig MacTavish while on vacation with his family. MacTavish had requested Krueger accept him as a contact on Skype, the program that allows you to make face-to-face calls from anywhere in the world, so that he could call Krueger while he vacationed in Davos, Switzerland. Ralph Krueger (left, standing) during a game against the Vancouver Canucks, one of only 48 games he had as head coach of the team before Craig MacTavish (right) fired him during a Skype call on Saturday . 'When the conversation began he got right to the message that he felt it was necessary to hire a new head coach. That’s the way it went. The conversation was short,' Krueger said. 'We spent the better part of a week together at the [IIHF World Hockey Championship in Stockholm, Sweden] and I never saw it coming.' 'I don’t know the details. I didn’t see it coming at all,' he told NBC Sports. At least there was eye contact: Ralph Krueger was fired via Skype, popular with people far from family and friends - and some bosses - for its video chat capabilities . Krueger, a motivational speaker whose book, 'Team Life: Over Setbacks to Success' found success in Germany, is philosophical about the situation. 'I need to very quickly find another hard road. I took this one and it was worth it. I need to not burn any cells trying to analyze why this happened. I wasn’t told why and why should I think why?' The 2012/13 season Ralph Krueger was . given to prove himself as head coach was a truncated season, with only . 48 games instead of the usual 82 due to a labor dispute. Edmonton . finished 12th in the Western Conference and missed the play-offs for the . seventh straight year. 'Until . three days ago, I was 100 per cent an Oiler and was fully engaged in . doing the off- and on-ice planning for the season,' Krueger told the Edmonton Journal. 'I can move forward as quickly as anybody, but I would be kidding you if I said it doesn’t sting. It definitely stings.' Swiss miss: Krueger was holidaying with family in Switzerland when he received the Skype call that would end his tenure as head coach of the Edmonton Oilers after just one season . General manager Craig MacTavish has admitted the Skype dismissal was harsh. 'I don't think this was in any way fair to Ralph. This wasn't about being fair to Ralph,' he told the Edmonton Journal. Writer Joe Yerdon for NBC's ProHockeyTalk tweeted, 'Well, that seems cruel' in response to the news. 'Better than via message in game of Words with Friends?' suggested @davidgisaac. 'Firing someone by Skype lets everyone in organization & NHL community know what a classless organization Edmonton has become,' said @joefrohlinger.","Head coach of the Edmonton Oilers was on holiday with his family when he received the fateful call from manager Craig MacTavish .

Grotesque, but informative: New medical photo-sharing app Figure1 lets health professionals share images of medical conditions for informational purposes . There are amputated feet, surgically removed tumors and lacerated arms about to be diced by surgeons. It's not hit U.K. reality TV series Embarrassing Bodies, but a new mobile phone sharing app created for medical professionals. Like an Instagram for doctors, the Figure1 application lets practitioners quickly upload unusual, informative and shockingly grotesque images to share with colleagues. But . co-founder Dr. Josh Landy, a Toronto-based critical-care specialist, . said the network was not designed for voyeurs but to provide . time-stretched health workers with an additional information resource. 'An image with a story goes a long way,' Landy told the National Post. 'There is . no question in my mind, educating doctors saves lives. 'Having someone who has . easier, more efficient access to information, who learns something more about a . patient they are currently seeing, is going to improve the care of that . patient. Scroll down for images, but be warned - they're gruesome . Hundreds of pictures have already been uploaded since its launch . just two weeks ago, mostly from U.S. posters. From mundane diseases like rashes and spots to the amputated, gangrenous foot of a diabetes patient, the images are not for the fainthearted. And the app is not just for medical professionals - anyone can download it. Like Instagram for doctors: Figure1 co-founder Dr Josh Landy said the new app will help improve patient care . When you open Figure1, you are shown recently added photos but you can search for particular ailments. You can also 'favorite' images you are particularly drawn to. For the creators, the most important feature is the ability of community-members to comment or share their knowledge of particular diseases. According to Gizmodo, the app 'does try its best' to maintain patient privacy and confidentiality, with consent forms for patients to sign before pictures go live. Consensual: Patients are de-identified before images of their weird diseases are shared on Figure1 . Information sharing: Medical professionals who use Figure1 can upload pictures of puzzling diseases which other doctors can comment on . Some of the more startling pictures include a finger with a piece of metal attached by a screw, a penile implant removed due to leaking saline solution and a large cataract. Dr. Kendall Ho, a University of British Columbia emergency-medicine . professor who specializes in using technology to educate, said Figure1 is a good tool for sharing medical 'pearls', according to Gizmodo. Dr. David Maslove, a critical-care specialist asked to beta-test Figure1, said the app could 'expand the horizons' of some medical professionals.

Community members have been sending in pictures of funnel clouds to local news stations and papers, with damage reported in western Woodbine, and additional sightings in bay-side Locust Point and Brooklyn. While many of these pictures and video look unmistakably like tornadoes, the National Weather Service still hasn't defined them as such. Christine Schifkovitz, who works at a yacht service on the bay said in a video on The Baltimore Sun's website that she observed a funnel cloud at about 3:30 p.m. Monday. Scroll down for video . Baltimore tornadoes: A screen shot from the video Christine Schifkovitz recorded Monday afternoon when a funnel cloud formed near her work . Strong winds: A YouTube video posted shows the tornado near Locust Point in perspective . Schifkovitz and her coworkers went outside when they heard on the radio that a tornado was forming near them. She recorded video as the sky above them turned black and a funnel formed over the water. Then the tornado started causing damage: 'We heard this loud ripping noise and it actually ripped a roof off and we saw debris fly up in the air,' she said. Roof down: Schifkovitz and her coworkers heard a ripping noise as they witnessed the roof being torn off of a local building . On the opposite side of Baltimore, in rural Woodbine, there was more damage. Bill Davison and his parents had just finished dinner when they heard the storm hit, and the power cut off. Davison says he heard 'a loud wind' and saw cardboard flying around outside. 'I was like, ""Dad, come look at this."" He goes out to the garage and calls me a says, ""The garage is gone,""' Davison told WJZ 13. Davison's father said,'[I saw] what I thought was [a funnel], yeah. It just came right back down black, swirling, picking up material, so to me, it looked like the closest thing I've ever seen to a tornado.' Garage gone: The Davison family in Woodbine, Maryland believe that it was a tornado that demolished their garage . Touchdown: The Davison's had just finished dinner when the tornado hit, and they saw debris floating in the air . A car parked in the garage was moved seven or eight feet, some things are completely missing, while they found some items far away. 'My tires in the shed landed half a mile down the street. It's something you only see in the movies,' Bill Davison said. 'I can't believe it; I'm still in shock.' The severe weather warnings are now over in Baltimore, but officials are saying Baltimore residents should remain cautious. 'Just be very careful in this area. We have a lot of down trees, a lot of downed wires, a lot of standing water, so we are encouraging people not to drive through it and really just exercising caution over the next few hours,' said Jacqueline Cotei, representative of Howard County Fire and Rescue.","Residents have sent in videos and images of funnel clouds near the bay, and images of damage in western Woodbine, Maryland ."

Oblivious to passers-by, lost in their own amorous bubble, the pair gaze into each others’ eyes and then move in for a kiss. She slips her hand round his waist and he clasps the world’s best known behind... On the evidence of this very public display of affection on a London street after they had played tennis at the weekend, Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson simply can’t keep their hands off each other. So, just who is the beau with the bright blue eyes? Well, it seems Her Royal Hotness has finally landed a man who might just prove to be a keeper. Couple: Pippa Middleton and her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson embrace after playing tennis together . Smooch: The couple kiss passionately in London's summer sun before going their separate ways . Nico Jackson, a 35-year-old grammar-school educated stockbroker working in the London office of Deutsche Bank, is tall, handsome, sporty and solvent. And while most Englishmen cringe at the thought of a public hug — Alex Loudon, Pippa’s most recent significant ex, was said to be miserable in the spotlight and certainly always looked it — Nico appears not to care who sees him kissing Pippa. Indeed, he seems to revel in walking around arm in arm with her, or even hand in hand, suggesting he is both very keen on her and cheerfully unbothered by publicity. Perfect match: Pippa with Jackson after a game of tennis . The fact that he’s not titled or aristocratic has surprised some, given Pippa’s previous boyfriends have had rather grand connections. Some observers maintained that the 29-year-old — whose Edinburgh university friends were known as the ‘Castle Crew’ because their families all owned one — was after a big country house and a title to compete with her sister. After all, she did share a flat at . university with two Dukes’ sons: George Percy, heir to the Duke of . Northumberland, and Edward Innes-Ker, son of the Duke of Roxburghe. In for the kill: The pair share an amorous moment in a London street . And recently there was Vicomte Arthur de Soultrait, the clothing entrepreneur for whose party she dressed as a saucy Marie Antoinette and was photographed the next day in a car in which a friend of the Vicomte was brandishing a gun (fake, as it turned out). Column: Pippa has recently started writing for Vanity Fair . But her relationship with Nico certainly seems to be serious. Nico was born to retailer Martyn Jackson and his second wife, Austrian-born Ulrike, a former au pair for whom Jackson, 64, had left his first wife Antoinette. Ulrike, known as ‘Ulli’, has declared herself to be ‘very pleased’ with the relationship between her son and Pippa, describing it as ‘perfect’. Ulli and Martyn run a fashion and sportswear shop, called Landau, in Folkestone, Kent, and live nearby in a mock Georgian terrace where Nico was raised with his sister Nina. Landau sells high-end skiwear and Ugg boots, among other things — the whole Jackson family, like the Middletons, are mad about skiing. Nico went to a local Catholic primary school and then the selective Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone. He played football, cricket and tennis for the school and then read business at Kingston University, winning a place on the advertising agency M&C Saatchi’s graduate trainee scheme before moving into banking. One fellow financier says: ‘Nico is funny, sharp, oozes charm and never loses his cool. I think he’s very ambitious but he wears it lightly.' Nico has made money at Deutsche Bank. Last summer he sold a flat in London’s leafy, white stucco South Kensington square for £1.56 million. Before that, he lived in the Sloane stomping ground of Parson’s Green in West London. Nico has already been to Mustique with the Middletons and Kate and William — surely the ultimate sign of approval. They flew from Mustique to Zermatt in Switzerland, where they were seen ‘aggressively snogging’ in a bar, according to an onlooker. Then, in March, there was more very public smooching in St Moritz at a ski marathon in which both competed. And at 35, Nico is the age at which even bachelor bankers start to think about marriage . . .","Nico Jackson put a cheeky hand on Pippa's behind as they kissed in London .

The yoga clothing company that made . headlines earlier this year for its see-through pants snafu said Monday . that CEO Christine Day will step down as head of the company after a . successor is named. Day has held the CEO spot for more than five years. CEO Christine Day: She insists her departure is entirely her decision and unrelated to the problem with the black luon, the fabric from which the transparent pants were made . Scandal: Lululemon CEO Christine Day is stepping down after a costly, offensive scandal in which her company failed to do what it does best: make workout pants that people feel comfortable in . Yoga clothing retailer Lululemon just reported earnings and although the numbers weren't bad the shares tanked after the CEO announced she will step down dipping to $72 a share from $82 . Lululemon Athletica Inc. shares dropped nearly 14 percent in after-hours trading following the news. The time is right to bring in a new . CEO to drive the next phase of Lululemon's growth, Day said in a . statement, given that the company has laid plans for the next five years . and crafted a vision for the next 10. Day will continue to lead the . company while the board searches for a new CEO. The Canadian company made the . announcement as it reported a slight increase in its fiscal . first-quarter profit on higher revenue. Lululemon earned $47.3 million, or 32 . cents per share, for the quarter that ended May 5. That's compared with . $46.6 million, or 32 cents per share, in the first quarter last year. Costly: Lululemon pulled its Luon pants from stores over the weekend in March after the company determined that the pants' fabric was too sheer and revealing . Revenue increased 21 percent to $345.8 million from 285.7 million. That beat market expectations for the . quarter. Analysts, on average, were anticipating earnings of 30 cents . per share on revenue of $341.4 million, according to FactSet. Its revenue from stores open at least . a year increased 7 percent. This is considered a key indicator of . financial performance for retailers, because it strips away the impact . of recently opened or closed locations. Lululemon said the past quarter has . been one of the most important in its history, as it coped with the . fallout from pulling a line of its black yoga pants in March for being . too sheer. The company ended having to pull its Luon pants from . stores over the weekend of March 16 and 17, after the company determined . that the pants' fabric was too sheer and revealing. Career: Day has been the head of luxury yoga-wear maker Lululemon since 2008. Before that, she worked as an executive at Starbucks . At . the time, the company said on its website that it first began to . understand the extent of the problem on March 11, as part of its weekly . call with store managers, who voiced worries about sheerness. The company blamed the see-through . nature on a style change and production problems. It hired a new team to . oversee the making of the pants. The company previously said it anticipated losing $57 million to $67 million because of the pants issue. Dropping faster than their leggings: Shares fell nearly 14% in after-hours trading once the announcement had been made . Day said it was able to get the . product back into stores within 90 days of having pulled it, all while . keeping customers happy with the brand. Lululemon's performance does not seem . to be hampered by the issue. The company forecast fiscal second-quarter . earnings between 33 and 35 cents per share on revenue between $340 . million and $345 million. Analysts, on average, were forecasting . earnings of 33 cents per share, on revenue of $329.6 million. For the full fiscal year, the company . said it expects to earn between $1.96 and $2.01 per share, on revenue . between $1.65 billion to $1.66 billion. Analysts were predicting earnings of $2 per share for the year on revenue of $1.65 billion. Lululemon also said that it plans to . delist its stock from the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 24, saying that . the minimal trading volume there didn't make it worth the cost of . maintaining both that listing and its stock on the NASDAQ exchange. Its . shares will continue to trade on the NASDAQ. Shares of Lululemon fell $11.38 to . $70.80 in after-hours trading as the management change overshadowed the . otherwise strong quarter and forecasts.

Former NFL player Chad Johnson was about to get off on a probation violation with a slap on the wrist—but then he slapped his lawyer's butt. Johnson, nicknamed 'Ochocinco' for his old football jersey number, was sentenced 30 days in jail for a domestic violence probation violation by a judge because he slapped his male lawyer's butt in court Monday, according to the Associated Press. Florida's Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh was about to sign-off on  a plea agreement the former wide-receiver had reached with prosecutors calling for community service and counseling instead of jail, but McHugh said she didn't think he was taking the proceedings seriously. Shocked: Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh, right, reacts to Chad Johnson slapping his lawyer on the behind in court . Rejected: Lawyer, Adam Swickle, guides his client, Chad Johnson, out of court for break after Broward Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh rejected the plea deal when Johnson playfully slapped his lawyer on the butt in court . No joke: Former NFL player Chad Johnson was sentenced 30 days jail when his judge refused to accept the plea deal after he slapped his lawyer's but in court. He last played an official game for the New England Patriots . McHugh asked Johnson, 35, if he was satisfied with his attorney Adam Swickle and in response Johnson reportedly smacked Swickle's backside, causing the court to erupt in laughter. But McHugh wasn't amused. 'I don't know that you're taking this whole thing seriously. I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?' McHugh said. 'The whole courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations. This isn't a joke.' Johnson tried to apologize. 'This is your courtroom. I have no intent to make this a joke. It's not funny,' he said. 'My life is in a shambles right now and I try my best to laugh and keep a smile on my face.' Unamused: Broward Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh didn't think it was funny when former NFL star Chad Johnson slapped his attorney's butt in court, so she sentenced him 30 daysin jail . Slapped: Chad Johnson, center, leaves Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. in August 2012. He will serve 30 days in jail after violating probation in a domestic violence case . As Chad Johnson discovered Monday, slapping, spanking or otherwise hitting someone's behind is not appropriate courtroom behavior - however commonplace it is on football fields and in locker rooms of most American sports. No one really knows when the practice began, but congratulatory butt slapping between male athletes - as well as female athletes - has long been used to say 'job well done'. Kind of like a fist-bump or more old fashioned high five, the butt slap shouldn't be considered sexual. Johnson turned himself in on May 20 . for failing to meet with his probation officer and attending an . intervention program. In September, the ex-Miami Dolphin pleaded no . contest to a misdemeanor domestic battery charge a month after being . arrested for headbutting his new wife, reality star Evelyn Lozada, . during an argument. McHugh wouldn't head his apology. 'It's not the first time he's behaved that way in my courtroom,' she said. Swickle, the subject of the offensive slap, tried to reason with the judge as well. 'He has suffered. He has lost everything,' Swickle said. Johnson was handcuffed in court and taken to jail. His probation, which would have been over in September, was extended through the end of the year, according to TMZ. In addition to jail time , Johnson also has to serve 25 more hours of community service and complete more therapy. While his future now seems a little uncertain, in court Johnson expressed hopes that he might sign with another football team this year. When Johnson was arrested in August, the Miami Dolphins released him and he hasn't played in the NFL since.","Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson had already reached a plea agreement with prosecutors for a domestic violence probation violation .

Former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez tried to commit the perfect murder when he shot his wife in 2007 with his department-issued handgun and made it look like suicide, prosecutors said Monday.""What is the perfect murder?"" prosecutor Bryan McKay asked during opening statements in Chavez's trial. ""It's one in which people are convinced it's not a murder.""Chavez is accused of killing his 26-year-old wife in the couple's home in Los Lunas, about 25 miles south of Albuquerque.

Tera Chavez died from a single gunshot wound to the mouth. Jurors on Monday saw crime scene photos, including one that showed the woman slumped in bed, the handgun that was found next to her and one of her husband's police uniforms in the bedroom armoire. The less-than-perfect crime: Tera Chavez was killed when her husband allegedly shot her in the mouth and tried to make it look like a suicide . Chavez and his estranged wife both were having extramarital affairs, prosecutors said. And they were arguing about divorce and Tera Chavez's discovery that her husband had allegedly staged the theft of their truck for insurance money. Levi Chavez was never charged in the theft.""It all comes together on that weekend when the defendant comes home and puts the gun he has with him in Tera's mouth and pulls the trigger,"" McKay said.Serna argued Tera Chavez was having a difficult time with the troubled marriage and had left dozens of voice and text messages on her husband's phone in the days leading up to her death.Prosecutors questioned why Levi Chavez had deleted all the messages except for one in which his wife said she was sad and afraid that she might hurt herself. They also pointed to Tera Chavez's journal, in which she said in the last entries that she had turned the corner and was ready to move on with her life. The OTHER side of the law: Former Albuquerque police officer Levi Chavez seen here in his mugshot after allegedly murdering his wife . Serna told jurors they would get to hear the 911 call Levi Chavez made after the October 2007 shooting.""It is very difficult to listen to,"" Serna said. ""But it is the sound of a man who is in anguish.""Chavez sat quietly in the courtroom and wiped his eyes as Serna recalled that night for jurors.The trial is expected to last for several weeks and bring attention to alleged abuses in the Albuquerque Police Department, which is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for an increase in police shootings.Chavez had been an Albuquerque police officer for nine months when the Valencia County Sheriff's Office started investigating him a month after his wife's death.He remained with the department and collected around $155,000 in salary in 3 1/2 years while on administrative leave, desk duty and working for Albuquerque's Animal Welfare Department. He also received two contract-required raises.Chavez was fired after a Valencia County grand jury indicted him on a murder charge in April 2011.Serna vowed again Monday to counter ""point-by-point"" what he says are false allegations and lies made about his client.","Both Levi Chavez and his wife were having extramarital affairs at the time of the shooting .

Hundreds of women in India are believed to have been forced to take virginity and pregnancy tests ahead of a mass marriage ceremony. Witnesses say around 450 women had to undergo the testing in the district of Betul which was organised by the Madhya Pradesh government. The Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojna wedding ceremony is paid for by the government and helps women from poor families to marry. But according to the Times of India, women were made to have the tests allegedly on government orders because it believes women are taking part in the ceremony to receive gifts. Nine women were reportedly found to be pregnant and banned from the ceremony. But government officials deny virginity tests took place. They said the tests had been to ensure the women were not pregnant. In India, a bride's virginity is highly prized and pre-marital sex is frowned upon. India's National Commission for Women is now calling for the Madhya Pradesh government to explain itself. Girija Vyas, chairperson of the Indian National Commission for Women, said: 'Such a shameful act where girls had to reportedly undergo tests to prove their chastity to avail the government's financial aid were sinful and could not be tolerated in a sane society.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:01 EST, 10 June 2013 . Perhaps call that taxi after all - new research has has found that more than one in three designated drivers have had a drink and most had blood-alcohol levels high enough to affect their driving. The study also revealed that 18 per cent drink more than is safe before driving home from a night out. Researchers from the University of Florida interviewed and breath-tested more than 1,000 party-goers at a bar in America. Concerning: A new study has found that more than one in three designated drivers have had a drink and most had blood-alcohol levels high enough to affect their driving . They discovered that of all of the designated drivers who had consumed alcohol, half recorded a blood-alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drunken driving in the U.S. The researchers recruited volunteers as they left the bar between 10pm and 2.30am on six different Friday nights. The average age of the participants was 28, and most were white male college students. Professor Adam Barry, lead author of the study, said: ‘If you look at how people choose their designated drivers, oftentimes they're chosen by who is least drunk or who has successfully driven intoxicated in the past—successful meaning got home in one piece ... that's disconcerting.’ Results: Half recorded a blood-alcohol level higher than .05 per cent which is a recently recommended new threshold for drink driving in the U.S . Professor Barry said he didn’t know why a designated driver would consume alcohol, but factors could include group dynamics or the driver’s belief that one or two drinks won’t impair his skills if he is an experienced drinker. It was also tricky to measure your own sobriety after a drink, he said, adding: ‘That’s the insidious nature of alcohol - when you feel buzzed, you’re drunk.’ At .08 per cent, the U.S. and UK currently have one of the highest allowable legal limits of any developed country. Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Greece use the .05 level, Russia and Sweden are at .02 per cent and Japan has a zero tolerance policy. While most experts recommend that people who intend to drive do not drink anything, there are things you can do to reduce the amount of alcohol in your blood after drinking. Dr Bhaskar Punukollu, a specialist addiction psychiatrist at the Clinical Partners practice, and at Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust in London said: ‘Roughly, you absorb about one unit of alcohol an hour, but drink after some food and the rate it enters your bloodstream is slowed. ‘Food absorbs some of the alcohol, and while the gut is absorbing key nutrients from the food, it’ll be far less efficient in absorbing the alcohol.’ Despite having the same number of drinks, someone who starts on an empty stomach can have three times more alcohol in their blood compared with those who have eaten a small meal beforehand, he says: ‘Alternating alcoholic with soft drinks can also slow down the effects.’ Male drivers are also able to consume more alcohol before they find themselves over the legal limit. Dr Martin Prince, a heptologist at BMI The Alexandra Hospital in Cheadle, Cheshire, explained that, as a general rule, if you’re larger or male, your body can process alcohol faster. However, women also have the additional disadvantage that their bodies are made up of more fat and less water than men’s - they carry 52 per cent water, compared to the 61 per cent in men. This means a man’s body will automatically dilute the alcohol more than a woman’s, even if they weigh the same. Women also have less dehydrogenase, the liver enzyme that breaks down alcohol.","Researchers interviewed and breath-tested more than 1,000 party-goers .

Veteran cricketer Cecil Wright is still racing in to bowl at the age of 79, after bagging an amazing 7,000 wickets in an illustrious 65-year career. Fast bowler Cecil Wright may be one of the oldest players in Britain but he is refusing to be sent back to the pavilion because of his age, proved by the six batsmen he dismissed for his club side just last week. Known as 'Cec' to his friends, he moved to Oldham in Greater Manchester in the 1950s to play league cricket and also represented Jamaica, but he still remains the scourge of batsmen. Still racing in: Cecil Wright, who turns 80 in December, remains the scourge of batsmen, taking 7,000 wickets in 65 years . Icons: Cec, as he is known to his friends, played alongside greats of the game including legend Viv Richards . In his last four games for his local league side he has taken 15 wickets, including six in one game, and said that even though his opening bowl is not as fast as it once was he is still a force to be reckoned with on the pitch. In his heyday he played alongside legends of the game including West Indies cricket legends Sir Viv Richards, Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Gary Sobers and Joel Garner as well as England's Denis Compton. And he said that despite being old enough to be most of his opponents' grandfather he can still teach them a thing or two about the game. Cecil who has a son and two grandchildren and who lives in Royton, near Oldham, said: 'I've been playing since I was a young boy and I was a professional for over 50 years so I don't want to finish yet. 'I've been lucky with injuries and I have always kept fit so I will keep playing. 'Some of the lads I play against might not expect much from an opponent who is approaching 80 but I'm still good enough to get anyone out, even if my fast bowl is a bit of a medium bowl nowadays.' Top player: Cecils pulls the ball in a match vs Rochdale in 1962, having come to Britain to be a professional . Still got it: More than 50 years later Mr Wright celebrates taking another wicket this season . He is set to play up to 40 games this season including matches in the Saddleworth and District Cricket League in Oldham, Greater Manchester, for his side Uppermill. Last week 'Cec' took six wickets in a match against Friarmere, bowling 10 overs in helping Uppermill's second XI to a 16-run win. Instead of putting his feet up he then played again the next day, this time taking three wickets. Cec first arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1959 after signing as the Crompton professional in the Central Lancashire League. He had already made a First Class appearance for Jamaica. After three summers playing in the Lancashire leagues he decided to stay in the UK. During one spell he took 538 wickets in five seasons, averaging one every 27 balls in the days of the eight-ball over. Action man: Cecil Wright is believed to be one of the oldest cricketers in Britain, and is sure to be the most successful of that age . Celebrated Cecil: The 79 year old with his trophies and awards, he was even painted for a portrait by artist Mark Whyatt, given to him when he retired . He met Enid, who he has now been married to for 50 years. As well as playing cricket he also worked in a cotton mill, before starting work for Mars in a distribution warehouse in Manchester for 29 years. He said the secret of his long playing career is his love of Lancashire food including hot pot and pie and peas as well as his favourite fruit and vegetables from the West Indies including yams, sweet potatoes and green bananas. He has even taken up Crown Green Bowls and has had to get used to bowling underarm and keeps fit by playing cricket with his two young grandchildren. One of the boys: Cec (centre) with his Uppermill CC teammates. he continues to take wickets for them . Winner: Cecil part of a championship winning squad in 1981, where his bowling drove the side on to victory . More trophies: Cec in the Lancashire over 50s team in the 1990s, after yet another win . He said: 'To be honest I eat anything that's going but I don't drink much, just the odd beer. And I keep fit, although these days I use my age as an excuse to miss training. 'I find keeping active helps to ease aches and pains. I don't like to sit still and watch TV, I would rather have a walk or potter about in the garage. 'If I have a bruised finger or a sore leg I don't worry about it, I just keep going and don't complain. 'I've thought about retiring but I can't. I've no idea how many games I have played now in my career - probably about two million. 'As long as I feel okay and I'm selected I'll continue to turn out.' A spokesman for the 'cricket bible' Wisden said although some amateur cricketers had played into their late 80s Cec's effort was 'pretty good going'.","Fast bowler Cecil Wright played for Jamaica during his 65-year career .

Three U.S. soldiers were killed in Afghanistan on Saturday when a man in an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on them in the eastern province of Paktika, a provincial government spokesman said. So-called insider attacks by Afghan soldiers on their NATO-force allies have become an increasing problem over the past year or so, threatening to undermine already waning support for the war in Western nations sending troops. Last year, a surge in such attacks prompted NATO to temporarily curtail some joint operations with Afghan government forces. On Patrol: US soldiers, part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), stand guard on the outskirts of Laghman . Dual effort: The Afghan army and police have grown rapidly in a multi-billion international effort to build up the country's security forces, which now number roughly 350,000 . The Paktika provincial governor's spokesman, Mukhlas Afghan, said an Afghan soldier had killed three American soldiers. Afghanistan's NATO-led forces said three of its soldiers had been killed by a man in an Afghan army uniform but did not give nationalities. Insider attacks accounted for one in every five combat deaths suffered by NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and 16 percent of all American combat casualties, according to 2012 data. The toll has alarmed Afghanistan's Western allies and raised troubling questions about the unpopular war's direction as most international forces prepare to withdraw by the end of next year. Betrayal: Three Americans have been killed by a man wearing an Afghan uniform, in the latest apparent example of an insider attack . Afghan policemen (pictured) have been trained by their American counterparts. Afghan forces take over most security responsibility ahead of most foreign troops' withdrawal next year .

'A brave, heroic 11-year-old Afghan child hurled a hand grenade at dismounted Italian troops in Farah city,' the Taliban said in an English-language statement. The four deaths on Saturday bring to 16 the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan this month, and come two days after seven Georgian soldiers were killed in a suicide car-bomb attack in the southern province of Helmand.","An argument between the Afghan soldier and his trainers appeared to have led to Saturday's shooting .

Citizens in Xalapa, Mexico have quite a decision to make July 7, when they cast their vote for mayor. One of their choices is a cat who vows to 'rid the city of rats.' Literally, but also in the sense of corrupt politicians. In response to politics as usual, two students in the eastern Mexican city have nominated a cat named Morris for mayor. If elected, they say Morris will eat, sleep, yawn and continue other cat activities as usual, which is what makes him a good candidate. El candigato himself: Morris the cat was nominated for mayor of Xalapa, Mexico by two students who now run his 'campaign' The contender: Morris has over 70,000 likes on his Facebook, far outpacing the human frontrunner of the mayoral race, Americo Zuñiga . 'Candidates here almost never . fulfill their promises,' said Jair Cueves, one of the students behind . the Morris campaign to ABC News. 'Out candidate promises to sleep, eat, . yawn and play in the dirt and that is what he will do if he wins the . election.' The students . set up a Facebook page and Twitter account for Candigato Morris, both . of which have gone viral, becoming popular not only in Xalapa, but also . across Mexico. If . Facebook likes are any indicator of popularity, then Morris is actually . the lead in the race - by a lot. As of Saturday evening, Candigato .

Cat got your vote?: Officials in Xalapa say that write-in votes for Morris will not be valid, but Morris' campaigners say writing him in anyway will make a point . Local journalist Melina Zurita believe that Morris' popularity is due to wide-spread disappointment in Mexican politics. 'The feelings [of frustration with politicians] are not just shared by people in Xalapa,' Zurita told ABC. While Morris can't actually hold the office of Mayor of Xalapa, his campaign are urging people to write him in on election day anyway to make a statement about the city's politicians. While votes for Morris won't be valid, according to Xalapa officials, campaign officials believe continuing to vote for the cat will be a symbolic win. Surprisingly, this isn't the first time a cat has won a mayoral election. In 1997, Stubbs a part-Manx cat was elected mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska, as a write-in candidate. While Stubbs was not allowed to officially hold the position, he was given the title of honorary mayor. Stubbs continues to hold that position today.

A senior lifeguard spotted a dorsal fin about 150 yards off Nauset Beach in Orleans at 10:15 a.m today which looked like a great white. In a 2013 summer first, the beach was shut down and swimmers were ordered out of the water. Other beaches in the area were also notified. Sighting: Nauset Beach is open again after being closed for an hour this morning following the sighting of what officials say is a 12-13 foot great white shark 150 yards off the beach and heading south to Chatham . Orleans Harbormaster Dawson Farber told the Cape Cod Times that the shape and color of the dorsal fin led the lifeguard to believe that it was indeed a great white shark, which are slowly returning to the Cape Cod area to feed as the seal population increases. Jaws: A man was bitten by a great white shark less at Truro in Cape Cod last year, not far from the most recent shark sighting . 'You can understand why they’re here,' Farber told CBS Boston, adding there are tens of thousands of seals in the harbor right now. Lifeguards estimate the shark was between 12 and 13 feet long. On May 28, state officials confirmed the first great white shark sighting of the summer season off Cape Cod. Beware: Officials at Nauset Beach in Cape Cod have recently installed new signs with information about great white sharks to warn beach-goers from potential danger . The 13-foot female, which had been tagged with a transmitter by Massachusetts scientists two years earlier, was detected off Monomoy Island near Chatham. Greg Skomal, a scientist at the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries, said Nauset Beach was reopened about an hour after the sighting. 'It's that increase in the gray seal population that we've seen over the last four decades that's now drawing these sharks closer to shore. The café is open and these sharks have come here to feed,' Skomal told WCBV. Feeding frenzy: Great whites are repopulating the waters around Cape Cod thanks to the area's burgeoning seal population . Meanwhile, at an actual Cape Cod café, patrons seemed unconcerned by the sighting. 'I’ve had hundreds of people here at the restaurant today and not one has expressed fear of the sharks being out there today,' owner of Liam's Cafe at Nauset Beach John Oman told CBS Boston. 'There are a lot of people down here, a lot are taking pictures of the newly constructed beware of the sharks sign,' he said. The beach was reopened at 11:15 am, following state protocol that the beach be shut down for one hour pending further shark sighting.","A lifeguard spotted a dorsal fin believed to belong to a 12-13-foot-long great white shark .

Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross admitted he would 'probably' watch child pornography after provoking outrage last month by appearing to suggest women could 'aggravate' their risk of being raped . Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross has admitted he would 'probably' watch child pornography to 'see what all the fuss is about'. Mr Ross, 65, provoked outrage last month among campaigners against rape and on social networking sites by appearing to suggest women could 'aggravate' their risk of being raped. He has now admitted his views were likely to get him into 'hot water' again after making comments about child pornography, as well as suggesting some cultures were more likely to commit certain crimes. Speaking at The Telegraph Hay Festival yesterday, he said: 'I had never seen, until I started working on Crimewatch, child pornography. 'I . think if someone came to me and said: ""Would you like to see what all . the fuss is about?"", I’m sorry, I probably would say yes.' He . also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on . links to extreme pornography even if that had not been what they had . searched for. He said he did not believe this meant 'we're all awful'. He also courted further controversy when he said certain crimes were more likely to be committed by some cultures more than others. He . claimed there was no evidence of institutional racism in the police . force but said some West Indian communities were more likely to mug people. Today, Mr Ross hit back at the reports, saying: 'Once again, I am being made to sound as though I am making outrageous comments.' In . a statement to MailOnline, he said of his comments on child pornography: 'This was in the context of an . academic experiment that showed, against expectations, most people do . look at pornography if they stumble across it, even if they were not . seeking it. 'My book quotes many examples of how we believe we are personally immune from things for which we blame others, but that temptation and opportunity are dangers for us all. 'For the record, I have been shown photos of child pornography by police in the Crimewatch office, so I cannot say I have never seen such images. 'I have never looked at child pornography in any other context and nor would I wish to. Mr Ross also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on links to extreme pornography even if they had not searched for it . 'Any report that I said, or think, that it is acceptable to view child pornography is entirely false and defamatory. 'All such images are crimes against children and any circulation of them perpetuates a dangerous problem. 'I . have devoted much of my career professionally and privately trying to . protect people of all ages from crime, and it is highly offensive that . anyone might be led to believe I would do anything to endanger children, . let alone in indulge in child pornography.' Referring to his views on crime, he added: 'Today, as a result of a talk at the Hay Festival yesterday, the impression has been given that I have said different races are likely to commit different crimes. 'This is wholly untrue. I said that different cultures tend to favour different crimes. Any connection with skin colour is entirely incidental.' 'I think if someone came to me and said: . ""Would you like to see what all the fuss is about?"", I’m sorry, I . probably would say yes' - Nick Ross . Mr Ross, who presented Crimewatch from 1984 to 2007, caused a storm of protest last month over comments about rape in his new book. He . likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing . cash by the front door, or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of . their cars. He insisted he was not blaming . victims – saying ‘No amount of temptation can excuse rape’ – but . questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because . they felt partly responsible. In . an extract from his new book, published in the Mail on Sunday, he said: . ‘Rape victims were once treated appallingly, as though it was all their . fault, but have we now gone too far the other way? ‘Many . of the victims seem to think we have. The main argument of my book is . this: we can aggravate crime by tempting fate, and we curb it by playing . safe. ‘We have come to acknowledge it is foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car. We would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door. We would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security measures. ‘Our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement. Mr Ross is famous for presenting Crimewatch with the late presenter Jill Dando . ‘Not even in the licentious days of . Charles II in the 17th Century was it acceptable for women to dress as . provocatively as they have done in Western culture since the 1960s. Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out . late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go . to bed with one-night stands.’ Mr . Ross said the Mail on Sunday had misquoted him in its headline, which . said ‘Not all women are victims and not all rape is rape’, but said the . edited extract was fair. Mr . Ross said the book was ‘serious, carefully researched and . evidence-based’ and an attempt to have a reasoned debate about a . sensitive subject. He . told the Daily Mail: ‘Of course I do not compare a woman to a laptop. That is nothing short of misrepresentation of my message. ‘What I am saying is that opportunity . and temptation are key factors in all crimes, and so far as the . evidence goes sex crimes are no exception. ‘Far from blaming people my book says . we are too quick to blame, and that it tends to distract us from finding . solutions to crime.’ Speaking yesterday Mr Ross urged . critics to read his book 'Crime and How to Solve It, and Why So Much of .

Extraordinary: The squad are preparing to launch a civil claim against Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured last year leaving Number 10 Downing Street . The royal family’s armed bodyguards are threatening to sue Scotland Yard in a furious row over pay. The highly-trained squad which shadows royals around the globe is in open revolt over changes that slash their lucrative overtime. In an extraordinary move they are preparing to launch a civil claim against Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. It comes ahead of the Queen’s annual summer break in Balmoral, a trip which has traditionally substantially boosted pay packets. But officers may soon receive a lump sum instead of hourly overtime, a system which in the past has seen some triple their pay. The squad of close protection officers said they are being singled out and should be paid fairly for all the work they do. But one former head of royal protection said he was ‘appalled’ by the decision, as protecting the monarch should be a ‘privilege’. Retired Chief Superintendent Dai Davis said: ‘This is yet another example of challenging everything legally. ‘It is a privilege to guard the monarch of this country and I get very cross when I hear about this kind of attitude. ‘In my day, joining the police service was a vocation and something you did because you believed in it. I’m sad at the way things are going.’ Members of Scotland Yard’s SO14 royalty protection team claim they are being treated differently to other officers. They are being offered up to £15,000-a-year to ‘buy out’ their overtime, meaning they only receive the lump sum no matter how much work they do. The changes apply to several hundred plain-clothes close protection officers who shadow members of the Royal family. Protection: Protection officers, one pictured intervening when a fan tried to hug the queen, said they are being singled out and should be paid fairly for their work . It does not apply to uniformed guards or their counterparts who guard the Prime Minister and other senior politicians, diplomats or other VIPs. The changes were the result of a review of police pay and conditions undertaken by former rail regulator Tom Winsor in 2010. In the past Royal protection officers have earned huge sums in overtime, especially those responsible for globe-trotting royals such as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. They are regarded as being on duty around the clock, so in some cases received three day’s pay for every day they are abroad, something known as ‘treble bubble.’ Royal protection officers have also been told they will not receive overnight or hardship allowances, which are worth around £50 and £30 respectively. Suing? It is not known if the Duchess' bodyguard Sgt Emma Probert, pictured in the front of the car on the royal couple's wedding day, is party to the threatened legal action over pay . The princess was given her own bodyguard after she became engaged to Prince William, in 2011 . But they can continue to claim substantial expenses, details of which were revealed three years ago after a leak. Internal documents revealed protection officers were claiming for everything from luxury hotels to swimwear and petty items such as sweets and cookies. Royalty protection representatives have been locked in talks with the Police Federation and the Scotland Yard leadership for months. One source close to the negotiations said officers have consulted a lawyer on taking legal action against Sir Bernard. He said: ‘The hierarchy have been kicking this around for months and we are fed up. ‘Officers should be paid for what they do, including if they are away overnight and suffering hardship as a result. ‘These officers cannot have a life because they are living somebody else’s. To some it might sound wonderful. 'Appalled': Retired Chief Superintendent Dai Davis said officers should consider their jobs protecting the royal family as a 'privilege' ‘But if you were to actually doing it yourself, staying in the kind of accommodation they do, getting your head down for just four or five hours a night, you might think differently. ‘It is because we do not have the manpower, we do not have the resources. The Home Office does not fund the amount of protection that is required. ‘They want people to work overtime but it does not appear they are prepared to pay for it. ‘If any of this was voluntary, if they were saying you can pick and choose, it would be more fair. But they are not. ‘The officers have urged the Police Federation to take legal action. We have got as far as getting legal advice.’ The Met spends more than £300,000 every day protecting high-profile people from Royals to senior politicians and visiting dignitaries. The huge bill has been a source of friction between a series of commissioners and the Home Office. Police claim the Government does not provide enough money to meet its costs and London taxpayers end up paying to meet the gap. There have been a series of reviews about who gets bodyguards and when, leaving some minor royals with ‘slimmed down’ protection. Among them were Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie who were stripped of their 24-hour protection, estimated to cost £500,000 a year. Mr Davies said officers must do what the commissioner tells them ‘provided his orders are lawful’. He added: ‘If they do not like that they can go back to real policing which arresting people in the street and catching burglars and paedophiles. ‘They are all volunteers. No-one forces them to be on duty. One of the motivations should be that this kind of work is a privilege.’ A Met spokesman confirmed the proposed changes are a result of the Winsor review of pay and conditions. He said: ‘As a result of recommendations in that review, overtime and allowances across the protection command are being considered. ‘No decisions have been made at this time and officers will continue to be consulted throughout the process. ‘Like all public services the Metropolitan Police Service has to deliver value for money.’","Officers soon to receive annual lump sum instead of claiming overtime .

'I never felt like I had hardships until . senior year when I reflected on my whole life and tried to figure out my . life story,' Lloyd told KCRA. In a touching display of humility, after learning of his nine scholarship offers, Lloyd sent Ms Sato a message which read: 'This is our success.' In his college applications, Lloyd wrote: 'Throughout my life, I've learned to grow up without luxuries.' 'I don't need fancy clothes. I don't need expensive SAT classes. I don't even need a father.' 'I have something more valuable than luxuries: the foundation to grow and prosper. My circumstances have not brought me down, but instead, have made me stronger.' Being offered the opportunity to go to Harvard is the perfect reward for the 17-year-old. 'It's been my dream since I was 8 years old,' he told the Sacramento Bee. After Harvard, Lloyd plans to go on . and earn a masters degree. And, thanks to a Gates Millennium .

Here is a yacht that will give any owner that sinking feeling - because it is also a submarine. Austrian-based yacht design studio Motion Code: Blue developed it as a design study of a six deck, 115 metre long private white yacht, called Migaloo and named after an albino whale. The studio came up with an extraordinary design concept to satisfy the ever raising demands from super-rich yacht owners who want to stand out from the crowd. The yacht that's also a submarine: The Austrian-based yacht design studio Motion Code: Blue developed it . The studio came up with an extraordinary design concept to satisfy the ever raising demands from super rich yacht owners who want to stand out from the crowd . The hull of the 11 metre wide Migaloo is identical to current submarines. Only the tower is custom designed, which means it is longer and wider to host a light flooded main room followed by a wide staircase including a centered , round elevator shaft. The enormous aft deck allows for lounge areas, sun beds, a bar, an 8 metre by 3 metre pool as well as a helicopter pad. When Migaloo is submerged, all furniture is put away in large storage areas underneath the granite decking while the pool's bottom raises up to the main deck level. The foredeck is fully dedicated to the owners' privacy, hosting a full-beam private lounge. More lounge areas, a private bar and access to the two-level-owners' suite are directly underneath the foredeck. A telescopically extendible roof provides shade and follows perfectly the contour lines of the hull when closed. The hull of the 11 meter wide Migaloo is identical to current submarines . The company says it's very likely to travel amongst school of whales heading into the deep while having a cup of tea and a good chat in the main saloon . The hull and tower are equipped with large windows of special pressure-proof glass to offer a breathtaking view especially when Migaloo is submerged . A spacious sun lounge on top of the tower completes the common amenities onboard a super yacht. The lounges are accessible via two wide stairways from the main deck or from all interior deck levels via the lift. The telescopically extendible roof provides shade and will also be closed when the owner prefer to dive with the yacht. For the crew, the design studio has planned an outdoor helm station on the forward top of the tower when the vessel travels above the water line. Otherwise the spacious bridge and all necessary technical rooms hosting the equipment to control the submarine are right underneath the tower in the hull. The hull's design and dimensions are inspired by existing submarines. They are aid to offer extra ordinary space for the owner and his guests, which are accommodated in eight VIP-suites on sub-decks two and three.

The spacious bridge and all necessary technical rooms hosting the equipment to control the submarine are right underneath the tower in the hull . The owner has his or hers private-full-beam-quarters over two decks on sub-deck one and sub-deck two. Other luxury appointments include a cinema room, a library, a gym and a gaming room. Four wide side hatches two on each side, can be transformed into enormous beach terraces. A spacious dining area next to the saloon on sub-deck one and the adjoining beach terrace give luxurious access to the water. Lounges and a Jacuzzi enhance this area while a comfortable ladder connects the beach club with the main deck above for easy access to the water on these two decks. Removable sun sails on each deck guarantee pleasant sun protection. All tenders and toys can be stored in the beach club or on the deck below, so the transport of a wide range of additional vehicles is possible. Sub-deck four is entirely reserved for the crew quarters including crew mess, laundry and crew gym while the main galley is positioned on sub deck two underneath the dining room. The hull and tower are equipped with large windows of special pressure-proof glass to offer a breathtaking view especially when Migaloo is submerged. All windows are surrounded with underwater lights to provide stunning views when the yacht goes deeper. Communication and especially navigation is provided by common and well tested technologies and the hull is designed to reach a maximum depth of 240 metres. The company says it's very likely to travel amongst school of whales heading into the deep while having a cup of tea and a good chat in the main saloon. A spokesman for Motion Code:Blue said: 'Migallo was the result of intense research and the firm's excellent knowledge of the current yacht market. 'An increasing number of clients have exactly such special demands on the design as main points in their briefing for their designers, so the studio's intention was to offer a stunning design concept especially for people who are willing to expand the borders of imagination.' Managing directors Christopher Gloning and Christian Gumpold had the original idea which was, to transform the well known and tested shape of current submarine designs into a private yacht. They wanted it to offer state-of-the-art luxury experience of same sized super yachts while having the huge benefit to submerge the whole vessel to travel and/or stay secretly and in total privacy underneath the waterline without any external disorders. The studio has recently completed several projects featuring both production yachts and super yachts currently under construction and has worked for yachts in Asia, Europe and the USA.","The vessel has been named Migaloo after an albino whale .

Peter Chester, who was jailed for the rape and murder of his niece in 1977, has been granted tens of thousands in legal aid for his battle to gain the vote . A killer who raped and strangled his seven-year-old niece has been given tens of thousands of pounds in legal aid to demand the right to vote. Peter Chester’s lawyers argued in the Supreme Court yesterday that the UK’s ban on prisoners voting breached his human rights and EU law. The case in the country’s highest court was given the go-ahead despite the Prime Minister’s insistence that the voting ban will remain in place. The case has already been heard twice in two other courts, costing taxpayers thousands. Seven Supreme Court justices are conducting a two-day hearing that will finish today, with a judgment expected later this year. Chester raped and strangled Donna Marie Gillbanks in Blackpool in 1977. He was given a life sentence the following year and has served 35 years behind bars. A Scottish killer, George McGeoch from Glasgow, is also demanding voting rights in the same case, and has received legal aid amounting to £7,280. He was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 13 years, for the 1998 murder of Eric Innes in Inverness. In an unprecedented move, the Government’s most senior law officer, Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC, will personally argue against the killers’ case. He is expected to tell the court today the decision on prisoners’ voting rights should be left to Parliament, not judges. MPs have voted overwhelmingly to keep the ban in place, making clear their opposition to a European Court of Human Rights ruling that it should be overturned. That dates back to 2005 when John Hirst, a convicted axe killer, won his Strasbourg case on the grounds that the ban on voting breached his human rights. The Government is to respond to that case with a Bill that will be considered by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament, but David Cameron has said the idea of giving convicts voting rights makes him ‘sick’, and told the Commons last year: ‘No one should be in any doubt: prisoners are not getting the vote under this Government.’ Innocent: Donna Marie Gillbanks, who was raped and murdered at the age of seven at her home by Chester . Chester’s case was dismissed by the Administrative Court in October 2009 and again by the Court of Appeal in November 2010. Then, Lord Justice Laws said the issue was a matter for ministers: ‘It is a political responsibility, and that is where it should remain.’ When details of the case first emerged, Chester’s sister and his victim’s mother, June Gillbanks of Blackpool, said: ‘He gave up the right to vote when he strangled and raped my daughter. Prisoners have enough rights and victims very little.’ Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, warned the case could be a ‘backdoor’ legal route to prisoners voting. EU law, which both men are citing, is, unlike Strasbourg judgments, enforceable by British courts. He said: ‘This is a dangerous backdoor attempt to use EU law to impose a left-wing doctrine of human rights, and we must resist it at all costs.’ Yesterday, Aiden O’Neill QC, for McGeoch, told the court that although the case was not a ‘class action’, it ‘may have implications’ for others. It is feared that if the case is successful, taxpayers could be hit with compensation claims from inmates denied the vote. The Legal Aid Agency said: ‘Peter Chester was only granted legal aid after the Supreme Court gave permission for his case to be heard. ‘Anyone who applies for legal aid must pass strict financial means and legal merits tests. ‘The funding is being managed by a specialist team to ensure costs are carefully controlled.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘The Government has made its position absolutely clear – we believe prisoner voting is a matter for national parliaments to decide. ‘The Attorney General will strongly defend that position at the Supreme Court.’","Child killer Peter Chester gets tens of thousands in legal aid .

The draw of Britain as a magnet for migrants from across Europe gathered strength last year, official  figures showed yesterday. Numbers of EU citizens coming to take jobs in this country went up – even though Germany and other major economies opened their doors for the first time to workers from Poland and Eastern Europe. And nearly one in four of all the international migrants who found work in European countries came to take jobs here, nearly  double the numbers of immigrants who went to work in Germany, the analysis found. It is estimated that more than 700,000 people from Romania could try to find work and settle in Britain . The count carried out by the EU statistics arm Eurostat is powerful evidence of Britain’s continuing status as the preferred destination for workers from elsewhere in Europe and from around the world. It adds further weight to the argument that Romanian and Bulgarian workers will put Britain top of their list of potential destinations when labour market restrictions that prevent them taking jobs here are lifted at the beginning of next year. At the weekend the Romanian think-tank Ires projected that a quarter of the country’s population of young workers aged between 18 and 35 would pick a job in this country when the barriers are removed. The estimate means that more than 700,000 people from the country could try to find work and settle in Britain. The wave of migration from Poland and seven other Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004 has brought more than a million of their citizens to Britain. According to the new count from Luxembourg-based Eurostat, which is based on national labour force surveys, slightly over 216,000 EU citizens working in Britain in 2012 said they had arrived over the previous two years, an increase of over 10 per cent on 2010 levels. Around half of these workers are likely to have come from Eastern Europe. Their numbers now look certain to have been greater than numbers of Eastern European  citizens who took the opportunity to work in Germany after Berlin opened its labour market to people from Poland and the other Eastern European EU members in May 2011. Numbers of EU workers moving into Germany doubled to 166,500 over the two years prior to 2012, going up from 80,500 recorded in a similar count in 2010. The figures suggested that the end of restrictions on Eastern European labour brought in around 80,000 new workers. Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said: ‘What these figures say is that over the past two years nearly twice as many foreign workers came to Britain than to Germany. ‘This is despite Germany’s opening of its labour market to Eastern Europeans in May 2011 and despite the lower growth in the British economy. This is a further pointer towards a significant inflow of Romanian and Bulgarian workers into Britain next year.’ The increase in numbers of European workers in Britain came at a time when Coalition immigration curbs were first beginning to take effect. This meant the numbers of workers who said they had come to this country from outside Europe, and who do not benefit from EU freedom of movement rules, fell slightly, from 184,000 to 183,000. EU countries worst hit by the eurozone crisis, such as Spain and Ireland, showed major falls in numbers of immigrant workers. The Eurostat figures also showed that workers from other EU countries are less likely to be unemployed in Britain than native  British workers.","Numbers of EU citizens taking jobs in Britain went up from last year .

The Director of National Intelligence responded Saturday to the disclosure of classified government surveillance programs, saying these measures kept Americans safe and are 'authorized by Congress'. Hoping to 'dispel some of the myths' after leaked documents published by The Guardian and The Washington Post shed light on two top-secret government surveillance programs, James R Clapper said in a statement the purpose of the programs is 'to obtain foreign intelligence information, including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies'. This week, The Guardian published a classified document that detailed how a division of Verizon was ordered to give cell phone records to the NSA. The Guardian and The Washington Post also reported that another program, called 'PRISM', was used by U.S. intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. In statements, those companies denied providing the government with special access to their files. Defensive: Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper said in a statement Saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were 'reckless' Both the phone-records program and . PRISM were approved by a judge, but PRISM allowed government agencies to . gain access to various Internet conversations, including email. In his statement, Clapper said PRISM, which was authorized in the Patriot Act, has been in place since 2008. The Associated Press reported Saturday that earlier this week the NSA filed a criminal report with the Justice Department in relation to the leaks. Clapper called the disclosures 'reckless'. 'In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context–including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government–to these effective tools,' he said. 'In particular, the surveillance activities published in The Guardian and The Washington Post are lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress.' Clapper's statement came as a new Guardian report revealed more information on the NSA's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence. Documents obtained by the Guardian reveal the government uses a data mining tool, called Boundless Informant, to map information the agency collects. The Guardian reported the agency collected 'almost 3 billion pieces of intelligence from US computer networks over a 30-day period ending in March 2013'. 'The tool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata volume and select details about the collections against that country,' according to an NSA fact sheet about the program obtained by The Guardian. In his statement, Clapper said the agency is limited in discussing their intelligence gathering practices by the NSA's need to protect their methods and sources. Informant: The Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper, left, released a statement on PRISM, which is reported to have been used to gather information from the data centers of Internet companies like Facebook, one of which is pictured left . 'Necessary': The top intelligence official, James R Clapper, said the NSA's intelligence measures disclosed in recent reports were 'used to keep Americans safe' 'Disclosing information about the specific methods the government uses to collect communications can obviously give our enemies a ""playbook"" of how to avoid detection,' Clapper said. Clapper added the recent disclosures have caused 'significant misimpressions', adding he could not correct all 'inaccuracies' without revealing even more classified information. In order to 'dispel some of the myths', the NSA also released a three-page fact sheet on intelligence collection as outlined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The fact sheet noted the government 'does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers' but only through court approval with provider's knowledge. Congress also authorized the use of PRISM, which the fact sheet called an 'internal government computer system' and 'not an undisclosed collection or data mining program'. The fact sheet also tried to dispel many Americans' concerns, noting the government cannot target anyone's computer or phone records without 'an appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition (such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber activities, or nuclearproliferation) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. National security: Top intelligence official James R Clapper said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are 'necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies' The fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government. 'Finally, the notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches,' the fact sheet said. In the fact sheet, Clapper also highlighted how intelligence gathered using these programs has provided 'insight into terrorist networks and plans'. 'For example, the intelligence community acquired information on a terrorist organization's strategic planning efforts,' he said in the fact sheet. 'Communications collected under Section 702 have yielded intelligence regarding proliferation networks and have directly and significantly contributed to successful operations to impede the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies.' President Barack Obama also noted the importance of the intelligence programs in an event in California Friday. 'I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,' he said according to multiple reports. 'My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly–we actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going have to make some choices as a society.'","Surveillance programs have 'proven vital to keeping the nation and our allies safe' said Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper .

"PUBLISHED: . 18:38 EST, 10 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:39 EST, 10 June 2013 . Britain should mark the centenary of the First World War without being too patriotic – or causing offence to the Germans, ministers declared yesterday. Commemorations would simply ‘set out the facts’ rather than making a judgment on who was to blame for the conflict, Culture Secretary Maria Miller said. And Communities Secretary Eric Pickles also warned against memorial events turning into ‘an anti-German festival’. Faces of war: Two British soldiers on the Western Front during the First World War . The announcement came as Mrs Miller revealed that two children from every state secondary school will be sent to the former battlefields of the Western Front as part of a four-year, £50million programme to mark 100 years since the outbreak of hostilities. She said a range of national events would highlight the sacrifice and lessons of the Great War of 1914-18, which left more than 900,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers dead and affected ‘every family, every village, every town’. The programme will include a candlelit vigil at Westminster Abbey on August 4 next year – a century after Britain declared war on Germany – and a remembrance service near Mons, Belgium, where the first and last British soldiers to be killed in the war are buried. Write caption here . Major battles, including the Somme, will also be commemorated. But there was criticism that ministers are reluctant to recognise the importance of the UK’s victory over the Kaiser’s armies for fear of offending the Germans. Military historian Professor Sir Hew Strachan, a member of the advisory board for the commemorations, said the events should symbolise the reasons Britain went to war – to fight for freedom. ‘At one level it is completely accepted in Germany that Germany was responsible for causing the war, though I think it’s actually debatable,’ he said. ‘But with a possible British referendum on the EU, they are worried about the centenary being used  for Germany-bashing by the British Press. For understandable reasons, given Germany’s history, just using the word ‘krieg’ [war] is very difficult.’ Mr Pickles said it would be a ‘tremendous tragedy’ if the occasion was used to bash Germany and its Great War ally Turkey. ‘Equally, it would be a tragedy if we forgot what happened, if we forgot why we fought, if we forgot we won,’ he added. Some £5.3million will be spent sending two ‘student ambassadors’ and a teacher from every state secondary school to sites of battles including the Somme, Verdun and Fromelles from spring next year. Around £10million of Lottery money will help fund a series of cultural events, while £1million will go towards securing the future in Belfast of HMS Caroline, the Great War’s last surviving warship. Mrs Miller said: ‘Every day of the conflict saw extraordinary acts of courage, ingenuity and valour both on the battlefield and on the Home Front. ‘It is right we remember and mark the centenary, bringing its importance alive for younger generations and remembering the price that was paid by all involved.’ Andrew Murrison, the minister asked by Downing Street to coordinate commemorations, said he had consulted officials in Germany, Austria and Turkey about the anniversary. He added: ‘They are fully apprised of the need to engage, and the discussions I’ve had with the countries leads me to suppose they wish to commemorate this.’","Culture Secretary Maria Miller said commemorations would 'set out facts'

The French may have the reputation for being expert wine makers, but they learnt everything they know from the Italians, new research suggests. Chemical analysis of two . large-handled pots used to transport produce around 2,400 years ago, found on the site of ancient French port Lattara by researchers from Pennsylvania, show they were imported from an old civilisation north of Rome. The pots - also known as amphoras - are the earliest evidence of wine-making in France and suggest that the French relied on Etruscan . merchants from Italy to deliver the first batches of wine before making their own. An ancient wine pressing platform found on the site of ancient French port Lattara. The discovery was made by researchers from Pennsylvania and is the earliest known evidence of the French wine-making industry. The spout of the press was used for drawing off the wine and the press was raised off the courtyard floor by four stones. Masses of grape remains were also found nearby . Scans also showed a limestone platform that was later used as a wine press for crushing transplanted, domesticated grapes - the first time wine-making is known to have been carried out on French soil. The findings suggest the wine-making industry in France was fuelled by imported wine from the Etruria region of Italy as early as 525 BC. The Gauls were then lured into the Mediterranean 'wine culture' and began making their own as early as 425 BC, reports Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. French wine making and the country's association with fine wine have long held global fascination, but little is known about how and when the domesticated Eurasian grape and wine-making arrived in France. Dr Patrick McGovern said: 'France's rise to world prominence in the wine culture has been well documented, especially since the 12th century, when the Cistercian monks determined by trial-and-error that Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were the best cultivars to grow in Burgundy. 'What we haven't had is clear chemical evidence - combined with botanical and archaeological data - showing how wine was introduced into France and initiated a native industry. These are remains of the foundations of the Etruscan merchants' quarters in Zone 27 of Lattara. They date back to 525-474 AD. The amphoras, or large handed pots, shown in the top right-hand corner, were imported from Italy and are some of the earliest evidence of French wine making. 'Now we know the ancient Etruscans lured the Gauls into the Mediterranean wine culture by importing wine into southern France. 'This built up a demand that could only be met by establishing a native industry - likely done by transplanting the domesticated vine from Italy - and enlisting the requisite wine-making expertise from the Etruscans.' Masses of domesticated grape seeds, . stems and grape skins found near the press which had a spout for running . off the wine and was raised on four stones reveal the inhabitants were . eventually producing their own. Two large handled pots were found at the site of the ancient French port of Lattara. Chemical analysis revealed they were imported from a civilisation north of Rome about 2,400 years ago. They are the earliest evidence of wine-making in France suggesting that the French relied on Italian merchants to deliver wine from Italy before they started making their own. The findings suggest the wine-making industry in France was fuelled by imported wine from the Etruria region of Italy as early as 525 BC. The Gauls were then lured into the Mediterranean 'wine culture' and began making their own as early as 425 BC. The researchers also found evidence of herbal and pine resin additives - revealing a medicinal role for wine. Dr McGovern said his study is a key step in understanding the ongoing development of the 'wine culture' of the world that began in the Turkey or Iran about 9,000 years ago. At the archaeological site of merchant quarters inside the walled settlement of Lattara were numerous Etruscan amphoras dating back to between 525 and 475 BC. There were selected for analysis because they were whole, unwashed, found in an undisturbed, sealed context and showed signs of residue on their interior bases where solid compounds of the wine collected. Judging by their shape and other features the transportation vessels were of a specific Etruscan type and probably manufactured at the city of Cisra - or modern Cerveteri - in central Italy during the same time period. State-of-the-art microscopes found . all the samples were positive for tartaric acid - the chemical . fingerprint of the Eurasian grape and wine in the Middle East and . Mediterranean - as well as compounds deriving from pine tree resin.

Its function had previously been uncertain. Tartaric acid was detected in the limestone demonstrating that the installation was indeed a winepress. Masses of several thousand domesticated grape seeds, stems and even skin dug up nearby further attest to its use for crushing transplanted, domesticated grapes and local wine production. Dr McGovern, who has been investigating the birth of wine for two decades, observes a common pattern for the spreading of the new culture. He said: 'First entice the rulers who could afford to import and ostentatiously consume wine. Next, foreign specialists are commissioned to transplant vines and establish local industries. 'Over time, wine spreads to the larger population, and is integrated into social and religious life.'","Pots found on site of ancient French port were probably imported from Italy .

Mrs Woods said: ‘I went to the loo and I could hear scratching. I jumped up and thought - this time I’m going to watch.

Thames Water apologised for delays in conducting a probe of the sewage network - which was finally carried out two weeks ago. Following a similar incident of a rat found in a New York City toilet in January 2011, Brooklyn Pest Control exterminator Eddie Marco said it was a problem he had often dealt with. He told Gothamist: 'The pipe is empty, the rat crawls through the pipe and up over the hump and into the porcelain. And he can’t get back out. What I do? I flush it down.' Experts recommend squirting dishwasher liquid around the inside of the toilet bowl if you spot a rat inside, and to flush the lavatory many times.

With tips such as using an airtight tin to stop cakes going stale, her first foray into publishing was much derided for stating the obvious. But apparently that hasn’t deterred Pippa Middleton from putting pen to paper – or from giving advice. The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has been appointed a ‘contributing editor’ for Vanity Fair, signing a lucrative deal to supply the respected US magazine with her thoughts on ‘classic British pastimes’. Family ties: Pippa Middleton joins the Duchess of Cambridge in the royal box on Centre Court during the men's final last year . And to start, she’s serving up a personal guide to the Wimbledon Championships, which begins on June 24. Among her snippets of Wimbledon wisdom are such pearls as leave enough time to get to the tennis, avoid walking long distances in stilettos and don’t plan to go for dinner with friends afterwards in case the matches run over. ‘There’s nothing worse than having to leave Rafael Nadal’s athleticism for a routine pizza with friends,’ she advises. There are also positive observations on the Wimbledon pigeons and suggestions for what to eat after the match – as well as recollections of trips to the tournament with her sister, whom she joined in the royal box for the men’s final last year. Pippa describes how the pair queued from 5am on ‘People’s Sunday’ to secure £35 tickets for Centre Court in 2004, during the early years of Kate’s courtship with Prince William.

Police reviewing the deaths of patients at the NHS trust have identified up to 300 cases of suspected criminal neglect. Detectives have spent weeks poring over patient deaths, and found horrific failures of care and unnecessary suffering. Inquiry: Police and a multi-agency review believe as many as 300 patients may have died as a result of criminal neglect . Up to 1,200 patients are thought to . have died needlessly at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust between . 2005 and 2009. Four doctors and 16 nurses are under investigation by . regulators, but no NHS managers have been disciplined for their role in . the scandal. The Daily Mail has campaigned for . justice for the victims – and for Health Service bosses to be held . accountable. As well as shocking neglect by nursing staff, the newspaper . has also highlighted the failings of NHS chief executive Sir David . Nicholson, who headed the regional health body overseeing Stafford . hospital until 2006. Sir David finally announced last month that he would stand down from his current £210,000-a-year post. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the police to investigate in February . Police announced yesterday that they . will re-examine dozens of suspicious cases in the coming months to . determine if doctors, nurses and hospital management are guilty of . criminal offences. These could include breaches of the Health and Safety . Act, which carries a maximum two-year prison term and an unlimited fine . for the hospital. In extreme cases, staff could be charged with willful . neglect, which can result in sentences of up to five years. Corporate manslaughter laws passed in 2008 could apply to managers who were warned about negligence. Last night MPs and victims’ families . welcomed the police review – but urged officers to probe NHS managers . and government officials who knew about the deaths. Charlotte Leslie, MP for Bristol North . West, said: ‘We are not going to get justice and hold people to account . if it just focuses on the frontline staff who always carry the can – it . must go right to the top. ‘We know people were raising the alarm . a long time before those in government and management positions claim . they knew about it. Achieving justice for the families means getting to . the root of who knew what.’ Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died . at the hospital in 2007 after she was admitted for a routine hernia . operation, said: ‘If we don’t hold people to account this will continue . to happen. ‘These cases are the tip of the . iceberg but at least we are getting somewhere, and while it won’t give . any comfort to the families for what we have lost, it will give us the . comfort that this will help stop it happening to other people.’ She too stressed that the review ‘must . not scapegoat the frontline and let management off the hook’. ‘This is . not just about nurses and doctors,’ she added. ‘We know from the . evidence to the public inquiry that they raised concerns, they filled in . incident forms and nobody listened. Although if they didn’t speak out, . we need to know why.’ Campaigner: Julie Bailey, founder of the 'Cure the NHS' group holds a . copy of Robert Francis QC's report on the Mid-Staffordshire NHS . Foundation Trust, outside the Houses of Parliament (left). She started the campaign after the harrowing death of her mother Bella at Stafford Hospital . Staffordshire police began reviewing . deaths at Stafford and Cannock hospitals in February, after the public . inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC published its report. Along with representatives from the . Crown Prosecution Service and medical regulators, they examined . patients’ post-mortem examination and medical notes, complaints from . families, and five major reports into care at the hospitals. Assistant chief constable Nick Baker . said: ‘Between 2005 and 2009, there were 4,253 deaths at Stafford . Hospital. However, we’ve identified between 200 and 300 cases where . alleged neglect may have contributed to a patient’s death and they are . being thoroughly reviewed.’ Victims: Arthur Deakin (left), 77, who was admitted to Stafford Hospital with a broken hip. He died of heart failure after a catalogue of failures. Ellen Linstead (right), 67, died after catching Clostridium difficile and MRSA . He said the force and the Health and . Safety Executive ‘are examining whether or not there’s any new . information which has come to light which could lead to a previous . criminal investigation being re-opened, or to an entirely new . investigation’. He continued: ‘Our next step will be to establish if there’s any realistic potential for criminal charges and prosecution. ‘This is a complex, large-scale review . which needs to be detailed, thorough and sensitive. At this stage we . cannot be clear about timescales, but we do anticipate that this will . take many months.’ Emma Jones, a solicitor at Leigh Day – . a firm representing more than 100 victims’ families – said: ‘That there . is enough evidence for possible charges in 200 to 300 cases is serious, . as neglect is very difficult to prove. ‘It is our understanding that charges . will be under the Corporate Manslaughter Act, and that means the people . who formed the trust board at the time would be looked at and have to . give evidence and explain why, under their watch, such a number of . deaths could have happened unnecessarily. The Francis report described the . scandal as a ‘story of terrible and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of . people’. It said they were ‘failed by a system which ignored the . warning signs of poor care, and put corporate self-interest and cost . control ahead of patients and their safety’. It has also emerged that hundreds of NHS staff who tried to blow the whistle over poor care were paid off for their silence.

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 23:40 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:25 EST, 5 June 2013 . A 3,000-year-old burial site has been found to contain the remains of migrants from as far away as Scandinavia and the western Mediterranean. Archaeologists conducting a study of Bronze Age residents found three distinct groups in the burial pits at Cliffs End Farm, near Pegwell Bay, Kent. Using analysis of oxygen and strontium isotopes in tooth enamel the researchers found while one group had been born locally, the other two groups came from much further afield. Research at the burial site in Kent found migrants from Scandinavia and western Europe had been buried there . A total of 25 people, aged between 6 and 55 at the time of their death, were found in the pits, according to The Times. The isotopes, which are derived from drinking water, can be used to identify where the individual was living at the time their tooth enamel formed. The researchers found a group of nine spent their lives in the local area, while eight were believed to have been born in what is now southern Norway or Sweden. Another five came from the western Mediterranean, possibly Spain or even North Africa. Mike Pitts, editor of British Archaeology, which will publish the research today, said: 'This is the first burial site of its type that we’ve found and it reveals that Britain was always part of a bigger landscape that includes most of Europe.' Mr Pitts said the site at Cliffs End Farm was unusual as the majority of Bronze Age burials were cremations. A total of 25 people, aged between 6 and 55 at the time of their death, were found in the pits at Pegwell Bay . The burials at this site however, which range from the early Bronze Age to the middle Iron Age, a period of 900 years, had seen people buried with animals in carefully posed positions. One woman, in her 50s, is thought to have been a 'willing sacrifice', killed by sword blows to her head. Pippa Bradley, from Wessex Archaeology, which carried out the excavation, said: 'With seven of 13 late Bronze Age individuals analysed, two of five early Iron Age and five of seven middle Iron Age, all showing evidence for immigration, this could be characterised as a mortuary site dominated by migrants.' Last month, MailOnline reported how the first recorded case of child abuse in history was believed to have been uncovered in Egypt. Archaeologists said the 2 to 3-year-old child, known only as 'burial 159', showed signs of having repeatedly had her bones broken, and being shaken repeatedly. The find is believed to be the oldest record of child abuse. Experts said it may stem from an Egyptian belief that children had to be 'toughened up' as they grow.","Researchers discover migrants in Bronze Age burial site in Kent .

Ex-BBC boss Mark Thompson was dramatically accused of misleading MPs yesterday over a doomed computer project which cost licence fee payers £100million. The former director general was said by a senior Labour backbencher to have failed to ‘tell the truth’ about the Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped last month after the corporation admitted it was ‘throwing good money after bad’. Yesterday the BBC Trust member who was supposed to oversee the project suggested there had been a failure to admit to the fiasco because of a belief that the corporation ‘could walk on water’. BBC Director General Mark Thompson may be summoned to Westminster to answer questions over the DMI fiasco . Anthony Fry branded DMI a ‘complete catastrophe’ and ‘probably the most, seriously embarrassing thing I have ever seen’. Mr Thompson could be summoned from his new job at the New York Times to answer questions in Westminster about evidence he gave to a Parliamentary committee two years ago. It is claimed he said then that ‘DMI is out in the business’, adding that there were many programmes being made using it and it was ‘already working’. He left the BBC last year and was replaced by George Entwistle. Mr Entwistle quit in November and it was his successor, Lord Hall, who scrapped DMI last month. The revelations emerged during a Public Accounts Committee hearing in Salford yesterday. Mr Fry said the BBC continued to defend the disastrous project at a time when there was a feeling that the corporation could ‘walk on water’ following the success of the iPlayer and the Olympics. The five-year DMI project was supposed to allow BBC staff to access its audio and video archive from computers instead of transporting tapes between offices. 'Embarrassing': BBC Trust member Anthony Fry branded the DMI project a 'complete catastrophe . Referring to Mr Thompson’s evidence in 2011, Margaret Hodge, the Public Accounts Committee chairman, said: ‘The thing that really shook me was we were told there were bits of the system working, you were using and running programmes with them – that wasn’t true. It just wasn’t true.’ Tory MP Stewart Jackson said he now felt embarrassed to read a press release from the committee in 2011 which had praised the BBC handling of DMI. ‘That shows the extent to which we were misled,’ he said. The corporation has already suspended one executive, chief technology officer John Linwood who was hired from Yahoo! on a salary of £280,000 a year, but MPs have suggested others should also be held accountable. BBC trustee Mr Fry told MPs: ‘If I was in your shoes I would not just feel furious on behalf of licence fee payers, which I do very strongly, but I also feel you went out there with a report that was very favourable to this [DMI].’ He admitted everyone thought DMI was going to work ‘not least because of the comments made by Mr Thompson’. The hearing was also told that concerns made by whistleblower Bill Garrett in a letter sent to BBC chairman Lord Patten in 2012 were not examined properly. Mr Garrett said he believed the Trust, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the PAC ‘may have been misled’ and that a previous National Audit Office report had provided ‘false confidence’ in the progress of DMI. Accountants Price Waterhouse are to carry out a review for the BBC Trust into the fiasco. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC takes seriously its responsibility to provide the NAO and Public Accounts Committee with the most accurate information at all times. As has been made clear, the BBC will now be doing all it can to assist the independent review of the DMI project.’ Mr Thompson said last night: ‘When I appeared in front of the PAC, I answered all of the questions from committee members honestly and in good faith. I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project.’ The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers, doing away with the need for video or audio tapes .","Digital Media Initiative was scrapped last month after BBC admitted it was ‘throwing good money after bad’
