"It is more than five months since George Groves left Wembley Stadium having been knocked out by Carl Froch. The Londoner had been felled by his bitter rival, who landed a huge punch to fell Groves, and left the ring that night devastated having lost to Froch for the second time. Many wrote the 26-year-old's career off there and then - but much has happened in those intervening months to revitalise the Brit's career, including an extremely impressive victory over Christopher Rebrasse. VIDEO Scroll down to watch George Groves on Douglin, Dirrell and DeGale . George Groves (right), pictured during his win over Christopher Rebrasse in September, believes that it is 'inevitable' he will become a world champion at some point during his boxing career . The Londoner also believes a third fight will happen between himself and Carl Froch once he is champion . Groves was promoting the launch of computer game Far Cry 4, which will be released on November 18 . Not only did that win ensure Groves became European super-middleweight champion, it also elevated him to  mandatory challenger for the Anthony Dirrell's WBC world title. And that prize, a reinvigorated Groves insists, will soon be around his waist. 'It's an inevitability that I will be world champion - it will happen,' he told Sportsmail while promoting the launch of the new Far Cry 4 game, due to be released on November 18. 'I want to achieve the dream I have held since I was a child and I will, no doubt about it at all. 'We'll plough on through this next fight and then the dream could become a reality sooner than many ever thought it might.' And that next bout is only a week away, with American Denis Douglin facing Groves at Liverpool's Echo Arena on November 22. Groves (left) and Froch face up to each other following their rematch back in May . Groves, pictured after his win over Rebrasse, believes it is only a matter of time before he is world champion . Groves is extremely confident for the fight, though not complacent, and is adamant he will get the second rematch with Froch he so craves if - or more important in his words 'when' - he keeps on winning. 'I'm in great shape and I just can't wait to get out there so we can strut our stuff,' he added. 'Douglin's a southpaw and I have never been defeated by a southpaw so the confidence is flowing. 'After the loss to Froch last time it felt like life or death - as boxing does at times - but I've come back well and he is back on my radar. 'I would love a Froch III to happen and I think I would beat him. 'He is being indecisive about the whole thing, delaying who he will fight next, and we all know he doesn't like me. 'If I win a world title fight, which I know is going to happen, then I am almost certain, almost certain, that a third bout will happen.' Froch (right) knocked Groves out at Wembley in May but a third fight could happen in the future . Groves is the mandatory challengers for American Anthony Dirrell's world title and believe he will win it . But Froch is not the only potential future British opponent being touted for Groves, with James DeGale smarting for a chance to avenge his solitary defeat back in May 2011. Groves is coy about the possibility of an alternative British superfight but admits it is not totally outside the realms of possibility. He continued: 'If we both keep winning then our paths will cross again, that much is clear. I'm not thinking about him right now but he may come around again as a potential opponent in the future. 'If he wins a world title, and when I win my world title, then a huge unification fight could happen. Groves (right), pictured beating James DeGale back in 2011, thinks they could face each other again . Front cover of Far Cry 4, released on November 18 . 'We both have big personalities and there is an atmosphere between us as everyone know, so there would be nothing bigger than if we had a unification fight in the future.' Talk of British superfights are for the future, however, and Groves is concentrating on the present. Douglin is up next, with Dirrell to follow, and Groves is adamant he will improve on his current record of: 22 fights, 20 wins, two losses (both to Froch). 'I'm ready for the fight, and to be honest ready for the next one, but I will concentrate on winning in Liverpool first. 'The hard work is already banked so the next couple of weeks are slightly frustrating as it is all about having time to chill and having more time to myself. 'We always mean business and that means I intend for there to be a stoppage against Douglin. I won't go gung ho, it will be controlled, but I intend to knock him out.' And, if he does, Groves will be well along the road to finally achieving his dream. Groves is set to take on American boxer Denis Douglin in his next fight on November 22 .

"Dereck Chisora has revealed he plans to climb Ben Nevis before conquering Tyson Fury when the two finally fight on November 29. The new dad, in public for the first time with baby daughter Angelina, convincingly lost to Fury when the rivals first met in July 2011. Chisora entered the ring that night weighing 261lbs, the heaviest he has been, but is today significantly lighter and plans to conclude his preparations for the undefeated Fury by scaling Britain’s highest mountain. ‘I’m going to go and climb Ben Nevis,’ said Chisora, the European heavyweight champion. Dereck Chisora (right) says he will climb Ben Nevis before his rematch against Tyson Fury . ‘It’s something me and my friend want to do. We’ve done it before. It’s something we do before every big fight. ‘Last time when we were boxing for a world title (against Vitali Klitschko in February 2012) me and my friend went skiing, people didn’t realise. ‘I took him to a mountain and it took us 20 minutes to get to the top. But we didn’t have the goggles or the gloves, we only had tracksuits. Everyone had all the gear and I said to my mate John: “You go first and I’ll follow you”. Chisora with his daughter Angelina during his open workout at London's Malmaison Hotel . ‘I sent him down the mountain then thought “F*** this s*** – I’m going back in the car”. After 45 minutes he came back with scratches all over his face. ‘I told him we have to go to Ben Nevis this time and walk up it then back down. He can go first. ‘I want to go there and finish my runs – the weather is quite nice and they’ve got beautiful fresh air up there.’ The November 29 date with Fury, incidentally also for the vacant British title, represents the first time Chisora will enter the ring as a father. Chisora suffered a heavy defeat against Fury in the pair's first contest in 2011 . His past antics, which include spitting and a press conference brawl with David Haye, means he is far from considered a role model, but he on Wednesday described fatherhood as ‘the best thing in the world’ and even joked that not only does he want Angelina to one day box, but also that Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger rejected his offer to be her godfather. ‘I love being a father,’ he said. ‘I think it’s the best thing in the world to be a dad and I hope she follows in my footsteps. ‘When you’re a dad you get guys who say “I don’t change nappies” but really and truly everyone changes nappies. If our own prince can change nappies then I can change nappies. Fury (right) in training at his gym in Bolton ahead of his rematch with Chisora . ‘Has is softened me? No because I like the good things in life. I prefer to not be soft. She does it to me sometimes but I have to put it in check sometimes as well. ‘She’s six months old, her name is Angelina Viola – we named her after my mum and my other half’s mum and after the Rolling Stones song. I tried to get Mick Jagger to be the Godfather but he turned me down. ‘I get sleep don’t worry about that. I’ve got a big house and they (Chisora’s partner and daughter) sleep at the bottom.’","Chisora to fight Fury for a second time on November 29 .

"Former two-weight world champion Ricky Burns claimed his legal battle with Frank Warren had 'seriously affected' his boxing after the case ended with both sides declaring victory. Burns, who is managed by Alex Morrison, was ordered to pay Warren unpaid commission over a manager agreement following a High Court hearing. But the judge ruled that Warren was not entitled to anything for the Scot's decision to end their promoter agreement despite claiming lost profits of at least £1.8million. The judge, Mr Justice Knowles, also ruled that Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns £102,000 purse money but said the Coatbridge fighter was unlikely to receive a penny from the liquidated company. Ricky Burns said that his legal battle with Frank Warren 'seriously affected' his boxing . Burns joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing on March 11, 2013, amid frustration over two postponed fights and unpaid earnings from his WBO lightweight win over Kevin Mitchell in September 2012. After two unconvincing defences, he lost his title to the classy Terence Crawford and has failed to impress in his comeback fights. In a statement, Burns said: 'The pressure that this case has put on me over the last 18 months has been immense and seriously affected me in and out of the ring.' The written judgement stated that the judge would decide how much Burns owed Warren for the management fees if the figure was not agreed. Matchroom claimed the figure was £73,000 while Warren described the amount as 'substantial'. Burns left Warren (above) to join up with a new promoter in Eddie Hearn in 2013 . The judge ruled that the now liquidated Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns £102,000, but not Warren personally. He added in his written judgement: 'From what I heard in evidence about about FWP and its liquidation it is unlikely that any sums will actually be paid by FWP to anyone, including Mr Burns.' However, Burns has vowed to pursue that sum with the British Boxing Board of Control, with Matchroom calling for the promoter's licence to be suspended. 'I will now be actively pursuing the BBBoC and Frank Warren to make sure that my outstanding fight purse gets paid in full,' the 31-year-old said. Warren's claim for £1.8million damages was described as 'fanciful' by the judge, who said that any lost profit would have been less than the amount owed to Burns for the Mitchell fight. The judge added that 'even though Mr Burns was not entitled to terminate the promoter agreement on March 6, 2013, I am quite clear he would have been entitled to shortly after that'.","Ricky Burns has been in a legal battle with former promoter Frank Warren .

"Tyson Fury has been warned he won't get away with fighting dirty on November 29 against new dad Dereck Chisora. European heavyweight champion Chisora, in public for the first time with baby daughter Angelina, convincingly lost to Fury when the two met in July 2011.

Chisora, who lost his first fight against Fury back in 2011, lifts little Angelina above his head . 'When this fight was announced, all I said to Frank (Warren), ""Get us a fair referee, a referee who's not gonna allow any nonsense that Tyson brings"", said Charles. 'Because he brings a lot of dirtiness into his game. We will box fair, we will fight fair. A referee who's going to be fair is all we ask. 'The first fight Dereck had with Tyson Fury I was going to put in a complaint. He won, but he was allowed to get away with a lot of nonsense. 'In the rules meeting I will insist that the referee does his job professionally.' Charles also revealed he had seen positive changes in Chisora since he became a father, and is also pleased he has a daughter instead of a son.

'The daughter, daddy's girl, and trust me – every morning before every session, the first thing he does when he comes to the gym, he will do his hands, and then he will bring his phone, and say, ""Have you seen what my daughter did last night?""

"Ross Barkley thinks one thing protected him from too many comparisons with Wayne Rooney as he first started to progress through the Everton youth ranks: he played in central defence. ‘My ambition was always to be a ball-playing centre half, like Rio Ferdinand,’ said Barkley, the 20-year-old Liverpudlian seen as one of the long-term successors to Rooney’s England No 10 shirt. ‘Rooney came through as a striker. I came through as a midfielder, but when I was younger, I was a defender and I enjoyed it. I played there until Under 14s. So, I was never really compared to Rooney. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ross Barkley: Beckham and Rooney were my inspirations . Ross Barkley (right) wanted to be a ball-playing centre half like Rio Ferdinand (left) Everton and England midfielder Barkley (centre) is dreaming of winning a trophy with his country . ‘At the moment, I see myself as a No 10. Because I’m young, I’ll play anywhere but in the future, hopefully in the middle of the park.’ It was Neil Dewsnip — an academy coach at Everton until he left last year to become the FA’s technical lead for the U17-21 age groups — who decided it was time for Barkley to step forward into midfield. ‘I was playing up an age and I was told, “You’re in centre-mid today, just enjoy it”,’ said Barkley. ‘I think it was because I was constantly running out with the ball from the back. Sometimes I’d make a few mistakes on the edge of the box and the strikers would score. I had to simplify things.’ It chimes with his experience in Miami before the World Cup in Brazil, when he produced a terrific performance in a friendly against Ecuador, only for Roy Hodgson to criticise him for losing possession in dangerous areas. ‘Obviously, I’m the type of player who takes risks, so now and then I’m going to give the ball away,’ said Barkley. ‘I just have to learn not to give it away in silly areas of the pitch. ‘I learned a lot at the World Cup, from being around the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. That it’s not a kids’ game any more. A year or two ago, I was playing reserve-team football. It’s a big step. I’ve still got a lot to learn. ‘From a personal point of view, it (playing in a World Cup) was a good experience. I always grew up hoping to play in a World Cup for England — and I did and hopefully there will be more in the future as well. To lift a trophy for England is what every player wants to do.’ Barkley, pictured in action for Everton against Sunderland, is back fit after a serious knee injury . Barkley has praised the influence of captain Wayne Rooney (centre), who is set to win his 100th cap . Barkley, pictured  against Costa Rica at the World Cup, is in his first England squad since the trip to Brazil . Last year was a breakthrough for Barkley, initially making Everton’s first team, and then selection for England and earning a place in Hodgson’s 23-man squad for Brazil, where he played a part in all three games. The last 12 months have brought reward and relief after the serious injury in October 2010 which set his development back years. Barkley broke a leg in three places in a freak collision with team-mate Andre Wisdom during an England Under 19 game in Belgium in 2010. The Belgian doctor who first treated the injury feared the teenager might not play again. ‘I came back and did well initially and made my Everton debut but after that I struggled for a bit, just getting my confidence back and my leg in tackling-wise,’ said Barkley. David Moyes, then Everton boss, visited to offer personal encouragement and support, and as he recovered Everton purposely selected tough loan moves to Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds, so he would experience the pressure of performing in front of big crowds, although he played only four times for Leeds. ‘He did help out a lot,’ said Barkley of Moyes. ‘I was at home after my operation and he came around to my house, which he didn’t need to, to speak to my mum and reassure me that everything was going to be OK. ‘I went out on loan and it was like going from being a kid to manning up; going into a man’s game and getting games every week. At Leeds I was working really hard . . . when I came back I got on at Everton. Things started to change as I was getting on the pitch more. I started against Arsenal and Tottenham.’ England boss Roy Hodgson gave Barkley playing time in each of England's World Cup group games . Barkley admits that winning a trophy with England in the future would be 'a dream come true' Those starts came in April 2013. Five months later, at the age of 19, he made his England debut, in a 4-0 win against Moldova at Wembley. A pre-season knee injury has prevented him adding to his caps since the World Cup but as Rooney prepares for his 100th international appearance, against Slovenia tomorrow, Barkley hopes for his 10th. Still, he is not 21 yet, and young enough that his first memory of watching England came this century: David Beckham’s free-kick against Greece in 2001. ‘I was celebrating on the couch,’ he said. ‘At that moment, I really wanted to play for England.’ These days, he can barely move for flattering comparisons. Hodgson likened him to Paul Gascoigne, whom Barkley never saw play. ‘I was only, like, three, when he was playing at Everton but I’ve seen clips on YouTube,’ he said. ‘Everyone knows how talented he was.’ And then, of course, there’s Rooney. He may have escaped comparisons in his schoolboy days, but there are similarities: Scousers, Evertonians, identified for great things at an early age, with pace and power to accompany their raw talent and imagination. ‘Wayne has helped me a lot since I came into the squad,’ said Barkley. ‘He’s been giving me advice about getting in the box when the wingers have the ball — not on the edge of the box but in the box — and that with my movement I will get loads of goals that way. ‘There are still loads of pictures of Wayne at the Everton academy . . . he said he coped with it all easily, that it just came naturally. That’s the way I look at it. I don’t want to get big-headed. I don’t feel pressure. I don’t see there’s much expectation on me. Maybe in the future. ‘I think, because I’m young, every time I get on the pitch, I just enjoy playing football. I’m not scared when I’m on the pitch. I don’t see anything to scare me.’","Ross Barkley played in defence until he was 14 .

"There is no reason why Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley couldn't one day play for Barcelona, according to Xavi. The pair are shining examples that the domestic game in England can develop players who are as accustom to the technical rigours of modern football as their European counterparts. Constant severe criticism has been levelled at the Premier League that their academies are incapable of producing youngsters able to compete at the highest level. Raheem Sterling (pictured in England training on Tuesday) could play for Barcelona, according to Xavi . Ross Barkley - who has impressed for Everton over the last year - also has what it takes, says the Spaniard . That has been brought sharply into focus after Roy Hodgson's side were found wanting when up against teams who are more advanced during the last two major international tournaments. But Xavi's endorsement - during an interview with Squawka - serves as a boost for English football. 'I think that they could [make it at Barcelona],' the Spanish midfielder said when speaking of Sterling and Barkley. 'They have incredible physical capabilities and they are good technically. 'In Spain, we prioritise players who are technically gifted but both things are very important in football.' Both players look likely to form part of England's next generation as they move on from the disappointment of the summer's World Cup in Brazil. Xavi (pictured playing against Celta Vigo at the beginning of this month) also praised Louis van Gaal . The Manchester United boss was Xavi's manager at Barcelona when he was a youngster . And Xavi stressed the importance of playing under the right manager as well, reserving special praise for Louis van Gaal. 'He had great impact on me [at Barcelona]. I really enjoyed having him as a coach at such young age,' he added. 'He would expect a lot from a player in training but at the same time he was very human. He had a lot of confidence in me and I owe him for that. 'Sometimes I would even ask myself why. He trusted immensely in me and maybe that is why I always wanted to show him how good I was on the pitch. I believe that he is a great coach for any team.'

"Jamie Redknapp described Manchester City's Champions League performance against CSKA Moscow as 'diabolical', claiming the players are putting Manuel Pellegrini's job under pressure. Speaking after City's 1-2 home loss on Sky Sports, Redknapp did not hold back in his criticism of the Premier League champions. 'At times they were diabolical. World class players, and they have not won one game in this Champions League,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'It's beyond belief. This is after a weekend when they've beaten Manchester United. Yaya Toure looks at the referee in shock after being sent off in the second half of the match .

"Mesut Ozil is fighting hard to get back firing on all cylinders for Arsenal. The German playmaker posted a picture of his leg in a brace as he did sit-ups in the gym, alongside the message: 'no, this is neither a red carpet nor a magic carpet. it is just the place where I'm working for my comeback.' It followed another snap with the star's knee strapped up. Mesut Ozil performed sit-ups in the gym as he continued his recovery from his freak knee injury . Mesut Ozil posted a picture of him wearing a large air compression support wrapped around his leg which helps improve blood circulation. The support is used to stimulate the pumping action of exercise. Ozil applied the support to his leg which is there to release the muscle pressure around his knee and it helps ease aches, pains and stiffness. The Arsenal star has been missing in action for Arsene Wenger's side with a knee ligament injury since the 2-0 defeat at Chelsea at the start of the month. And now it looks like the playmaker, who has drawn criticism for his performances since his record £42.5million move to the Emirates last summer, is hell-bent on a speedy recovery. Arsene Wenger revealed the freak injury Mesut Ozil picked up against Chelsea was merely from passing the ball with the outside of his left foot. The German posted a picture of his leg surrounded by a knee support and is out for the rest of 2014 . Ozil discovered a 'partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint' which he suffered during Arsenal's clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Wenger said on the injury: '(Do) you know how Ozil did the injury? Passing the ball with the outside of his left foot. He must have done that a million times. 'Ozil was on his own. He told me he just wanted to give the ball like that (flicked with the outside of his foot) and heard a little crack.'

Wenger added that the German's knee problem is just the latest in a long line of 'coincidental injuries' rather than down to any failing in the club's medical support. He also allayed any suggestions he went against the advice of both the player and Arsenal's own medical staff by sending Ozil out for the second half at Stamford Bridge on October 5, as his side were chasing a two goal deficit.","Mesut Ozil is out with a knee injury for the remainder of 2014 .

"They were worthy World champions, sweeping aside the likes of Portugal, France, Brazil and Argentina to lift the greatest prize in football. And after their triumph, everyone else was desperate to know the secrets of Joachim Low's Germany team - why exactly were they so successful? Well, a new film about Die Mannschaft's journey to World Cup glory in Brazil could answer that question. Thomas Muller is seen wearing a pink Dirndl during breakfast at the team hotel in an upcoming film about Germany's World Cup triumph in Brazil . Bastian Schweinsteiger practises golf on the beach close to the German team hotel . Germany captain Philipp Lahm lifts the World Cup trophy after theitr 1-0 win over Argentina in the final . Combining behind-the-scenes footage from the German camp with highlights from those epic matches, 'Die Mannschaft' promises to lift the lid on how it was done. The trailer for the film, which premieres in Berlin on November 10, shows the togetherness and camaraderie that carried Germany to victory - and a few rather bizarre moments. For example, Bayern Munich striker Thomas Muller, who scored five goals at the World Cup, is seen wearing a bright pink Dirndl - the traditional Bavarian female dress - at the team's breakfast. In other scenes in the sneak-peek, the players are seen lounging around the pool in the Brazilian sunshine, playing golf on the beach and singing and dancing on the team bus after their final win at the Maracana. The film features behind-the-scenes footage that has not been shown before, including from the celebrations . Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil are shown on the training ground practising the elaborate free-kick routine used against Algeria in which the striker falls over .

"Teenage sensation Martin Odegaard showed why he's being billed as Europe's hottest property by inspiring Stromsgodset to a 2-1 league victory. The 15-year-old, who has been linked with Liverpool and Manchester United, scored both goals against Lillestrom on Sunday. Odegaard opened the scoring with a superb run and shot in the 21st minute and grabbed his second in the 41st minute by starting and finishing a move with a clinical strike. Norway's Martin Odegaard comes on as a sub against Bulgaria to become the Euros' youngest every player . Odegaard became the youngest player in the  history of the European Championship when he came on as a substitute in Norway's 2-1 victory over Bulgaria. Aged 15 years and 300 days, Odegaard replaced Cardiff's Mats Moller Daelhi in the 63rd minute, as goals from Tarik Elyounoussi and Havard Nielsen either side of a Nikolay Bodurov equaliser saw the hosts run out winners at the Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo. The European Championship has been running since 1960 and Odegaard beat the previous record held by Sigurdur Jonsson of Iceland, who had held it since playing in a Euro 1984 qualifier aged 16 and 251 days.

The appearance of Odegaard in the Group H Euro 2016 qualifier will have been noted Europe's biggest clubs, who have already been hot on the tail of the wonderkid likened to Lionel Messi. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid lead the hunt, while Odegaard has been to England to train with Manchester United and has spent time in Germany with Bayern, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool are also keen on the Stromsgodset star, aware that Martin and his father Hans-Erik are lifelong Reds supporters. Odegaard made his debut for Norway on August 27 in a friendly against United Arab Emirates and came on against Bulgaria in Oslo with his side pushing for a winner. The record for the youngest player to actually appear in the European Championship finals is Jetro Willems, who at 18 years and 71 days came on for Holland in their Euro 2012 group stage match with Denmark. So another record could be in Odegaard's sight should Norway's positive start in qualification continue and take them to France for the 2016 finals.

"The casinos like to call it The Grand Arrival when the protagonists for the big fights they are hosting come to town. Manny Pacquiao more than lived up to that description as he flew into Macau from the Philippines aboard one of the two passenger jets he hired to bring more than 350 of his nearest and dearest to his fight here this weekend. By contrast the challenger for his world welterweight title, Chris Algieri, took a scheduled flight from his Los Angeles training camp in the company of his six-man team. VIDEO Scroll down to get a first look at Pacquiao training in Macau . Manny Pacquiao trains in the Philippines ahead of his world welterweight bout with USA's Chris Algieri . Pacquiao will bank at least 25 million dollars for the fight, then a minimum of another 100 million dollars if he wins and gets his eagerly-awaited bout against Floyd Mayweather . At least the New York-based Argentinian travelled half-way round the world in business class. Pacquiao’s journey from home took a mere 90 minutes and his entourage form the advance guard of more than 5,000 of his countrymen who will help pack the 15,000-seat Cotai Arena here. They include trainers, sparring partners, business advisors, allies in his political career, assistants at his pro basketball club, family, friends and poor Filipinos to whom he Is giving an outing. This is a generous superstar. Generous to a fault say some who worry about the rate at which he spends money. But he will bank at least another 25 milllion dollars for this fight – then a minimum of another 100 million assuming he wins and Floyd Mayweather takes the mega-bucks bait for the Fight of the Century. Hopefully this century. Preferably next year. Algieri, a pleasant young man, accepts his role in the shadow of the PacMan without resentment, working hard to do what he can to promote the event as well as himself. Fans try and get a picture of Pacquiao after he arrives in Macau with his 350-strong entourage on Tuesday . Pacquiao revels in the spotlight and has appreciated the enthusiasm of the Chinese public since his arrival . His fast-rising career has overtaken his studies but if he can amass a more modest fortune quickly he intends returning to medical college. There was bedlam as they both made their entrance to the Venetian Hotel and Casino, along with China’s national boxing hero Zou Shiming. While the thousands of Chinese pouring into Macau are fascinated by Pacquiao, they are loudly patriotic about Shiming. Algieri enjoys a spin-off from all the attention, as will all the undercard fighters. Pacquiao revels in the spotlight and appreciates the knowledge and enthusiasm of the Chinese public. This is his second appearance in the Cotai Arenas and he says: ‘The biggest difference between fighting in Las Vegas and fighting in Macau is that virtually all the fans are in their seats before the first bout begins. They really love their boxing here.’ So much so that they will be in those seats by 8am on Sunday morning, local time. Pacquiao: 'The biggest difference between fighting in Las Vegas and fighting in Macau is that virtually all the fans are in their seats before the first bout begins. They really love their boxing here' Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late Saturday night.","Manny Pacquiao flew in ahead of his bout against USA's Chris Algieri .

"Great English Football Managers of the 21st Century. As one of the world’s shortest football books it would be right up there with Popular ground-sharing schemes and England’s penalty shootout successes. No English manager has won the Premier League (Howard Wilkinson was the last to win the top flight in 1992) and none have won the European Cup since Joe Fagan in 1984. In last year’s Champions League not a single English boss featured in the last 16 and this season will be no different. But there will be one 42-year-old coach in the mix who hails from south-west London. A man who finds himself No 2 at the No 1 club in world football at the moment; although how long he stays as an assistant manager will depend on him. Paul Clement (left) celebrates winning the  Champions League with Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti . Assistant manager Clement chats with Madrid star Gareth Bale (left) before a match . Paul Clement was a PE teacher in Sutton in 2000 when he got the chance to coach part-time at Chelsea’s youth academy. He took his UEFA coaching badges while still working full time as a teacher and moving slowly up the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, at Fulham’s academy, and then back at Chelsea again under Carlo Ancelotti, winning the Premier League. The Italian coach who last May became only the second manager in history to win the European Cup three times saw something in Clement, whose dad Dave played for QPR and England and brother Neil for West Brom, that made sure he took him with him to Paris Saint-Germain and then to Real Madrid at the start of last season. Clement has no playing background but that never stopped Arsene Wenger, Rafa Benitez and Jose Mourinho and maybe it’s time England's search for great homegrown managers went beyond those who have played the game at a high level. Although football fans below a certain age might struggle to believe it England has managed to produce decent international teams in the not too distant past with the so-called Golden Generation of 2002 and two Paul Gascoigne-inspired sides in1990 and 1996 that both reached big semi-finals. Clement has previously worked for Ancelotti at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain (above) But from those three sides not a single top manager has emerged with Stuart Pearce, Terry Butcher, Tony Adams and Paul Ince all at least having given it a go and verdicts still pending on the likes of David Platt, Gary Neville and Gareth Southgate. Clement told Sportsmail in an interview last year that as a player: 'It’s only natural to think about yourself first and foremost but that when you are learning to be a coach you think about the bigger picture all the time'. He has had that bigger picture in mind for over a decade now and the rise from Chelsea’s Under-16s coach to the man who found himself scribbling down the list of potential Real Madrid penalty takers in last season’s Champions League final has been extraordinary. The way he has won the trust of Ancelotti and the respect of some of the biggest names in the game, from Didier Drogba and Ashley Cole to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cristiano Ronaldo, has some of the Premier League’s biggest clubs monitoring his situation. The 42-year-old listens in as Italian boss Ancelotti gives instructions to former Tottenham winger Bale . Clement, alongside Lucas Moura (left) and David Beckham, celebrates winning the Ligue 1 title . With every season that passes his name seems to be linked with a bigger team. Last year as he helped guide Real to win the Copa del Rey the whispers started that Brighton and Fulham wanted him. Last May as he helped guide Madrid to Champions League final glory in Lisbon, his name was mentioned as a possible long-term QPR manager. West Brom also emerged as a candidate for his signature after the club decided not to continue with Pepe Mel. The QPR link will not go away because of his late-father’s playing career that included 470 first team appearances. The club won promotion back to the Premier League on the same day Madrid won their 10th European Cup last May and he described the double triumph as “the perfect day”. Two weeks ago it was even suggested that Arsenal are considering turning to Clement to replace Arsene Wenger at the end of next season. 'I think it’s soon,' he said last May when asked about when he would be making the step up to becoming a number one. 'A few opportunities have come my way. But this [Madrid] is a difficult place to leave. It’s a great club, a great city, a great tradition and it gives you the opportunity to win things.' The former Chelsea No 2 puts the Galacticos through their paces ahead of a La Liga match in March . Replacing Wenger in two years would certainly make sense in terms of timing. While currently very happy and successful at Madrid, managerial cycles at the Santiago Bernabeu rarely last longer than three years so it would be time for Ancelotti and his team to move on. Clement would have spent another two seasons alongside one of the most successful coaches in history and with some of the current crop at Real Madrid two years older some might even be ready for a Premier League swansong. Asked last season if he would take a couple of Galaticos with him when he finally jumped ship he joked: 'That’s what managers do, isn’t it?' Arsenal could probably do with a Pepe and a Sami Khedira right now without having to wait until the end of next season. Brilliant No 2s don’t always make top No 1s but Arsenal have shown they are willing to take managerial risks in the past – they plucked Arsene Wenger from the J-League two decades ago after all. And there will be other clubs ready to take the gamble. Clement has worked with some of the biggest names in football, including Zinedine Zidane (right) Clement will not be holding his breath a phone call – from Arsenal or from anyone else, he has plenty on his plate with the aim of becoming the first team to retain the Champions League the club’s big aim. After last season’s post-Champions League final chat with reporters sparked stories of his imminent departure Sportsmail got in contact with the 42-year-old coach to see how far down the line exit plans were and the 'it’s Madrid for me' was the brief but to the point answer. It looks like being that way for the foreseeable future, but he will not be there forever, and as one of Europe’s most wanted managers-in-the-making there will be no shortage of suitors when the time comes.

"Former Tottenham director of football Damien Comolli has revealed Harry Redknapp decided to deploy Gareth Bale on the wing rather than at left back after analysing data. Tottenham were reportedly considering the possibility of selling Bale to Birmingham for a mere £3million before deciding to convert the Welshman into a midfielder. The north London side eventually sold Bale for a world record £86million when La Liga giants Real Madrid came calling in 2013. Gareth Bale failed to impress at left back but turned into a superstar when he was deployed in midfield . The Welsh winger is now considered to be one of the best players in the world for club and country . Bale strikes one of his trademark free-kicks against Belgium on Sunday night, as Wales earned a vital point . Bale, pictured holding the Champions League alongside Luka Modric, was sold to Real Madrid for £86million . Harry Redknapp helped Bale transform into one of the world's best players during his time at the club . Comolli, who worked at Tottenham for three years, also stated in a recent interview with Newstalk that Daniel Levy decided to sign Rafael van der Vaart over an unnamed player because of data statistics. 'I’ve got to say, I’ve been working with data since 2005 or 2006 in terms of recruitment,' said Comolli. 'We did it at Spurs. We used data in terms of team selection. 'Spurs actually told Harry Redknapp where to play Gareth Bale, because he wanted to get rid of him.

'Data was showing Bale would be an outstanding left winger when they were playing him at left-back [because of his running and skill].' When asked about Tottenham decision to sign Van der Vaart from Real Madrid in 2010, Comolli added: 'Spurs have never come out publicly saying it, but I am saying it because I don’t work at the club anymore. 'Spurs had the choice between signing Van der Vaart and another player, and Daniel Levy said we are going for Van der Vaart because data is telling us to. 'I won’t mention the other player who did nothing after that but Van der Vaart had a great two or three years at Spurs.' Comolli went on to work for Premier League rivals Liverpool but left the Merseyside outfit by mutual consent in April 2012.","Former Tottenham director of football Damien Comolli has revealed Spurs were prepared to cash in on Gareth Bale .

"What to do with a problem like Angel di Maria? The Argentine could probably play in as many as five different positions in a 4-3-3 and at least three in a 4-4-2 but at times his versatility becomes his own worse enemy as coaches fail to settle on his best position. Ask Carlo Ancelotti where he is best suited and he’ll say on the left of a middle three in a 4-3-3 where he excelled for Real Madrid last season. Ask Argentina coach Gerardo Martino and he will say he’s best in a front three where he caused havoc against Germany in a friendly earlier in the season. His versatility was his salvation at the Bernabeu. He had established himself as a right winger but when £86million man Gareth Bale came in to take that position, Di Maria reinvented himself as a box-to-box midfielder and finished the campaign as arguably Real’s best player. Angel di Maria will line up for Argentina on Tuesday night in their friendly against Portugal at Old Trafford . The £60million winger shares a joke with Manchester City and Argentina defender Martin Demichelis . He still has all the attributes to play on the right wing; to hug the touchline and then come inside and shoot with his left foot. He can also play on the left wing and Jose Mourinho even had him down as a potential emergency left back such is ability to gallop up and down the flank. But last season with Bale breathing down his neck for the right-wing position and Di Maria slotted into a more central berth for Carlo Ancelotti and was a revelation playing on the left of a three that also included Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric. Ancelotti’s decision to use him in midfield was bold. Di Maria had operated there before for Benfica but there were questions over whether he had the tactical intelligence and the positional discipline to work in the position. The doubts soon disappeared. He knew exactly when to cover the forward forays of Fabio Coentrao or Marcelo – Real’s two left backs – and he also knew when, instead of covering the overlapping full back, he himself needed to overlap. Di Maria exploded on to the scene at United, pictured here celebrating his goal against Leicester in September . But the winger has gone off the boil in recent matches and has failed to score in his last four outings . Di Maria has played further forward in recent games for United and hasn't had the same effect as he did in the early part of his career at United - here he is pictured celebrating against Leicester in September . Cristiano Ronaldo started games on the left flank but was never going to stay there for 90 minutes and Di Maria had to know that he could sprint into that unoccupied space down the left when Ronaldo was in a more central position. He did exactly that in European Cup final when his cross-shot led to Gareth Bale’s goal. The midfield transformation worked better than anyone, even Ancelotti, could have dreamed. Di Maria was that modern football marvel – two players in one. Much like Dani Alves in his prime at Barcelona, who appeared to be playing as a right winger and a right back at the same time, Di Maria was playing as a back-tracking left-sided midfielder in a middle three and a left winger in a front three. When Manchester United signed him at the start of the season it was no surprise that Louis van Gaal slotted him straight into that same position. And his first performances for United were evidence of just how well he plays the position. Di Maria was up and down the left wing during his first United start, against QPR . He had less of an impact in United's last match against Crystal Palace and was taken off after 71 minutes . Di Maria played more than 50 times for Real Madrid before representing Argentina at the World Cup in Brazil . Following Gareth Bale's arrival at Real Madrid, Di Maria switched flanks and enjoyed great success . Di Maria was one of Real's best players last season . But there is always the temptation to put such a Road Runner-style player further forward where he can play without the defensive responsibilities of a winger. In Argentina’s friendly against Germany earlier in the season he roamed with intent across the front three and scored in a man-of-the-match performance in a 4-2 win. His country are likely to use him in a similar position on Tuesday. If he’s a success for Argentina in the front three and was Real’s best player last season in a middle three where does that leave Van Gaal? The Dutch coach also has one other nagging doubt at the back of his mind: is it not the case that more than positional confuse Di Maria is suffering from fatigue? Few players go through the gears so intensely out on the pitch and the Argentine has been playing ‘pedal to the floor’ since the start of last season. He needed a super-human effort to keep himself in the team and he delivered it. He ended up playing in 52 of Real Madrid’s 60 matches last season. He then followed it up with a physically exhausting World Cup and was then thrown straight into a move to a new country and a new league with all the physical and mental demands that that brings. It maybe that as well as a little dazed and confused from switching positions, he’s also just plain tired.","Record signing Di Maria started the season well but has gone off the boil .

Goal: Kroos, 89. Referee: Stefan Johannesson (Stockolm) Spain started with just four of the players that helped them win the World Cup four years ago and Germany fielded only three of their starters from the victory over Argentina in the Maracana in July. The host's first real chance came on 11 minutes when Celta Vigo forward Nolito almost scored on his debut in his home stadium. He let-fly from distance only for former Northampton Town keeper Ron-Robert Zieler to turn the shot around the post. The Hannover 96 goalkeeper had gone on loan at Northampton and played two games for the Cobblers in the 2008-09 season. Spain were playing the better football with Isco pulling the strings against Real Madrid team-mates Kroos and Sami Khedira. With three Real Madrid midfielders on the pitch and the driving rain making for rapidly deteriorating playing conditions coach Carlo Ancelotti will have had a nervous eye on the match having lost Luka Modric for three months when he injured a tendon in his thigh against Italy at the weekend. When the injury scare came it was for Germany manager Joachim Löw and for Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola as Thomas Müller was taken off after 23 minutes with a bruised back. His last contribution was to play a part in the best move of the first half. It was the first glimpse of the kind of football that wins World Cups from Germany as Kroos, Muller and Mario Gotze combined brilliantly. Iker Casillas – playing his 160th game for Spain – got down well to make the save. Del Bosque took off three of his World Cup winners at half time with Sergio Ramos, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique all replaced and then brought on Kiko Casilla in goal for the last 15 minutes.

Rooney is determined to make sure England secure a sixth successive victory to end the year on a high against a fast improving Scotland. England captain Wayne Rooney said playing in such an intense atmosphere at Celtic Park will benefit the younger players . Arsenal trio (from left) Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott were out the pitch at Celtic Park . England manager Roy Hodgson was out to inspect the Celtic Park pitch with his players ahead of Tuesday night's clash . Rooney said that even though the game is just a friendly it will be a big test as England play Scotland away for the first time since 1999 . Former Celtic keeper Fraser Forster, who played at the ground for four years, could start against Scotland in place of Joe Hart . Rooney, who is just six goals short of becoming England's record scorer, speaks to the media alongside his manager Hodgson . The squad looked relaxed ahead of the game but Rooney knows the atmosphere will play a big part the next time they take to the pitch . VIDEO Rooney expecting fiery atmosphere in Scotland . The forward, who will win his 101st England cap this evening, said: ‘I have spoken to the younger players because it can take you by surprise. It will be a big test. ‘I am excited to play in it. It will be a good game, Scotland are doing well and getting some good results. ‘I have played here before in the Champions League and the atmosphere is really loud andintense. It’s a stadium with a particular atmosphere you want to experience as a player. ‘We have to play the game within the rules. I don’t think it will be like the games 20 years ago. ‘There will be an edge to it, but that’s what you expect from this kind of fixture. Everyone knows this stadium, the fans here have a great reputation of making it an intimidating place to come. I want to make sure they (the younger players) are ready. I wanted to pass on my experience.’ Gary Cahill, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Rooney could be the only survivors from the side that won England’s previous game against Scotland, a 3-2 victory at Wembley last August. Rooney added: ‘Our next game is in March so we don’t want to come off a bad result. We went to end the year on a high.’ Scotland boss Gordon Strachan is fully aware of the significance of the fixture to his players and when asked about the strength of his team said: ‘Nobody wants to be rested, that’s for sure. If we were playing some team 70-odd in the rankings, we would not be as excited.’ Hodgson expects a ‘strong’ Scotland to test his side. He said: ‘I’m not looking for excuses if we don’t win. If we don’t, it’s because we haven’t played well enough or they have been better.’ ‘Our approach to the game is exciting, it is a big game and we will be given a tough test.’ An empty Celtic Park may not look too intimidating, but England will find themselves in a hostile environment on Tuesday . England's younger players, including Ross Barkley and Nathaniel Clyne (both centre) will be in for a big test, according to their captain . More experienced players like Phil Jagielka (centre) and James Milner (2nd right) will have to help their younger team-mates .

"Luis Suarez scored to help Uruguay recover from a half-time deficit against Costa Rica in Montevideo, but the hosts were beaten 7-6 on penalties after Johan Venegas denied them a friendly victory with a late equaliser. The match may have been officially an international friendly, but one look at the badly ripped shirt Suarez wore suggested otherwise. Suarez, for once, was the man who had a chunk taken out of him. A large piece of his jersey was torn off after a tussle with Costa Rica defender Giancarlo Gonzales. The Barcelona striker wriggled free of his marker, who desperately tried to grab hold of his man as he fell to the floor just outside the penalty area.

Suarez scored early in the second half after Alvaro Saborio's strike had given the visitors a half-time lead. Bryan Ruiz then restored Costa Rica's advantage within a minute of Suarez's equaliser, but two goals in three minutes from Jose Gimenez and Edinson Cavani looked to have Uruguay on course for victory. That lead held until the 91st minute when Venegas equalised for the visitors and took the game to penalties. Suarez scored the first spot kick to give Uruguay the lead in the shootout, but Celso Borges missed for Costa Rica. After six successful penalties in a row, Arevalo Rios had the chance to win it for Uruguay, but his kick was saved by Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas. With the scores level at 6-6 in the shootout, Guzman skied his penalty and gave Costa Rica the chance to snatch victory, which Cristian Gamboa accepted gratefully to seal a 7-6 win.

"Click here to see more of our brilliant Match Zone, including the move for Ayoze Perez's opener . Is it really only a month since Alan Pardew headed into the last international break looking every inch a dead man walking, castigated by Newcastle fans campaigning for owner Mike Ashley to axe their manager? On Sunday at The Hawthorns, two minutes from the end of his fourth consecutive Premier League win – and fifth in all competitions – Pardew gazed up into the directors’ box looking for Ashley and gave him an emphatic thumbs-up. ‘You can imagine everyone was pulling at him when we weren’t winning and he stuck with me and was very supportive,’ said Pardew afterwards. ‘You have to have that as a manager. You’ve got to have faith that you’re doing the right things. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Premier League Big Match Stats: West Brom vs Newcastle .

It bought me just enough time on this occasion.’ The last time Pardew won five games in a row, Newcastle finished fifth in the Premier League and he won the Manager of the Year award in 2012. While that might be too much to ask this season, they are up to eighth place (check) following a quite spectacular transformation. It has been built on the back of stubborn defence – Pardew’s side have not conceded in the last 342 minutes – and the emergence of a new Geordie hero in Ayoze Perez. The Spaniard had already repaid the modest £1.5million transfer fee Newcastle spent to take him from Tenerife to Tyneside in the summer by scoring the winning goals on his previous two appearances against Tottenham and Liverpool. Yesterday he conjured up a quite sublime finish to set his team on the road to another victory over West Bromwich Albion. A disappointing first half was petering to a close when Newcastle moved the ball out to the right and Daryl Janmaat picked out Perez’s run with a low ball into the box. The youngster still had plenty of work to do and he produced a fantastic piece of skill, flicking the ball with the inside of his trailing right foot across Ben Foster and into the far corner. ‘That goal was worthy of winning any game,’ said Pardew. ‘The cross was good but he had to add a little bit of pace with the flick, and that’s outstanding. ‘We worked hard to bring him to the club. He was courted by some big clubs, in particular Porto, but he genuinely loved the way we were so determined to bring him, and 54,000 Geordies every week is a big magnet.’ Coloccini powers a header past Foster in the West Brom goal, after breaking free from West Brom defender Craig Dawson .

The Toon Army were jubilant yesterday and had even lit a green flare to match the colour of their team’s rather questionable change kit just moments before captain Fabricio Coloccini claimed their second goal just after the hour mark. West Brom failed to clear a corner and the ball was once again played to Janmaat on the right. The full-back took Youssouf Mulumbu one way and then twisted back inside him before curling a fantastic cross to the edge of the six-yard box where Coloccini had stayed up and was waiting to power a downward header inside Foster’s near post. After winning just once in 15 Premier League games before the last international break, Pardew can go into this one satisfied that he is beginning to win over at least some of his harshest critics. ‘Newcastle supporters are an extreme of any fan,’ he said. ‘When they win, they go mad and when they lose, they go mad too. We weren’t winning games and that is my job, to win games. I am not going to get carried away. These young players have a lot to learn but so far so good.’ For West Brom boss Alan Irvine, however, this was a depressing step backwards after taking five points from his last three games. There was a significant lack of threat from his team despite enjoying plenty of possession, and their best chance fell to Andre Wisdom 11 minutes from time when the full-back miscued horribly wide. Irvine wondered whether Saido Berahino’s first England call-up last week might have somehow contributed to a strangely subdued performance from his top scorer.

"So it turns out at least one Barclays Premier League team is capable of making smooth, stylish progress in Europe. While many of their rivals have struggled this season, falling down when not expected or shooting themselves in the foot, Everton have gone from strength-to-strength. Thanks to another impressive night at Goodison Park, a point separates them from the Europa League’s knockout stages. Roberto Martinez, of course, will take nothing for granted. But after swatting Lille aside 3-0, thanks to goals from Leon Osman, Phil Jagielka and Steven Naismith, the only question up for debate is whether Everton finish top of Group H or as runners-up. Steven Naismith celebrates scoring Everton's third goal as they beat Lille 3-0 at home in their Europa League tie on Thursday . Naismith (right) crashed home Everton's third into the top corner following a pass from Leighton Baines . Everton: Howard, Hibbert, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, McCarthy (Besic 85), Barry (Gibson 67), Osman, Naismith, McGeady (Atsu 66), Lukaku. Subs not used: Robles, Eto'o, Barkley, Pienaar. Booked: Barry .

Subs not used: Elana,  Meite,  Rozehnal,  Traore. Booked: Mavuba, Balmont . Referee: Bas Nijhuis (Holland) Yet for one of the scorers, another poser needed to be considered. ‘We are thoroughly enjoying the European experience,’ said Jagielka. ‘We are determined to stay in the competition for as long as possible. Can we win it? Why not? Did anyone think Fulham would get to the final a few years ago? No. There’s a long way to go but we are in this competition to win it.’ The issue of who finishes top will be decided in Wolfsburg on November 27 but if Everton play with the panache that helped them dismantle the first French visitors to Goodison Park, it will be theirs with a game to spare. How a few of Martinez’s managerial peers would like to be in such a position. Initially Everton took time to find their stride. Though Romelu Lukaku had a chance after 24 seconds, when his drive beaten away by Victor Enyeama, they couldn’t build up a head of steam and, for a period, there were some anxieties. Yet with Gareth Barry, James McCarthy – the game’s outstanding performer – and Naismith all involved, Everton kept the ball moving and, eventually, their persistence paid off. The breakthrough arrived just before the half-hour. It was a fine goal, too. Lukaku found McCarthy who swiftly sent Aiden McGeady marauding down the right; McCarthy carried his run into the area but his compatriot picked out Osman, who applied a thumping right foot finish. Osman is not a player who courts the spotlight but he has had a career of which he can be proud. He has devoted his life to Everton, squeezed every last ounce of ability from himself and always been there to do a job. It is why he has been awarded a new 12-month contract. From the moment that drive nestled in the back of Enyeama’s net – it was Osman’s first goal since March – there was never any doubt Everton would go on to run out authoritative winners and they put clear light between themselves just before half-time thanks to Jagielka.

This was a more direct effort – McGeady’s outswinging corner finding the captain at the back post, who stooped to guide his header beyond Lille captain Rio Mavuba on the back post – but there were no complaints on the touchline from Martinez, who celebrated with an arm aloft. Lille briefly threatened to make a fight of things and in the first attack of the second period, Divock Origi – who will join Liverpool next summer – tried to show why Brendan Rodgers believes he is a “world class talent”, with a skipping, jinking run into the area. That was to be as good as it got for Lille. Everton quickly went back through the gears and Lukaku was denied the third goal of the evening when Enyeama plunged to his left to prevent the Belgian’s dipping free-kick nestling in the Gwladys Street net.

Had they gone through the gears, there could have been more but that was a minor complaint. Everton’s grand ambitions have momentum. ‘We are a football club that is expected to win things,’ said Martinez. ‘Europe is in our DNA. I thought we played really well. What pleased me most is every player is ready to embrace the opportunity of playing in Europe.’ Everton boss Roberto Martinez (left) will be delighted with his side's performance as they close in on qualifying for the knockout stages .

"Alex Tillinghast is clearly not a man to waste his time with the simple shots when on the basketball court - it's spectacular or nothing. The first-year student at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa won himself a truck after making a miraculous half-way line shot on the buzzer during a half-time challenge at a College Basketball match. The odds were stacked against Tillinghast when he was picked out the crowd at Drake's Bulldog Madness event on Tuesday night. Drake University first year student Alex Tillinghast won himself a truck by completing a basketball challenge . The student sank a miraculous shot from half-court with just one second left on the clock to win the prize . Tillinghast was mobbed by Drake players and fans after achieving the incredible feat . He had to score with a lay-up, a free throw, a three-pointer and then the half-court shot - all within 30 seconds - to win the Ford F-150 worth £32,000. And it's fair to say things didn't start too brilliantly for the mop-haired, cargo pant-wearing fresher as he missed the lay-up shot, the easiest of the lot, not once but twice. He finally did it and then nailed the free throw on the first attempt, giving himself plenty of time to sink the three-pointer. Just as well because Tillinghast, clearly not a baller, needed quite a few goes to make the shot count. Things had not started too well for the student, who needed three attempts to make a simple lay-up shot . The third part of the challenge was to score with a three-pointer and Tillinghast needed quite a few goes . Everyone wanted to join Tillinghast in his celebrations after completing the challenge . Then, against all the odds with just five seconds remaining, he somehow summoned all the good fortune in the world to score from half-way with a once-in-a-lifetime shot, sparking delirious scenes as the Drake team and fans ran over to mob him. As Tillinghast proves, it's sometimes better to have Lady Luck on your side than actually be good at something.","Alex Tillinghast sunk a half-court shot with one second left to win a £32,000 Ford truck during half-time challenge at Drake University match .

"The third match of Rangers’ pre-season tour of North America had a theatrical start on Tuesday morning as the Victoria Skydivers parachuted in to drop the match ball onto the centre circle. From then on in, however, a second string Rangers side failed to scale any great heights themselves as they narrowly edged past Canadian part-timers Victoria Highlanders. Ally McCoist had made 10 changes from the side that beat Sacramento Republic 2-1 on Saturday night in northern California, with only Marius Zaliukas keeping his place in the starting line-up. Goal: Rangers beat Victoria Highlanders 2-1 during their pre-season tour of North America . Rangers . (4-4-2): Simonsen; Faure (McKay 46), McGregor, Zaliukas (McCulloch 90), . Smith; Gallagher (Murdoch 75), Hutton, Black, Crawford; Clark (Boyd . 61), Shiels (Templeton 61) Subs not used: Bell, Mohsni, Aird, Wallace, Law, Macleod, Miller, Foster, Kelly . Rangers goals: Gallagher 9, Clark 29. Victoria Highlanders goal: Hundal 11. Ian Black was the only other name from the strong team that lost 3-1 to Ventura County Fusion last week. But in Centennial Stadium, the venue that hosted the 1994 Commonwealth Games, the Ibrox fringe players largely failed to prove to their manager they can be worth their weight in gold in the upcoming Championship season. Youngster Calum Gallagher was arguably the pick of the bunch, scoring one, nearly adding another, and setting up a strike for frontman Nicky Clark. But after a decent first-half performance, levels dipped against a semi professional outfit that play in the fourth-tier of the US soccer pyramid, although Rangers did hold out to record their second win of their visit to California and Canada. It’s certainly fair to say there has been more than a touch of the bizarre about this tour. None more so than when Rangers waltzed past Sacramento Republic in a stunning stadium in front of the California State Fair on Saturday night. In Sacramento, free chicken sandwiches were dished out to fans to ‘celebrate’ the first booking for a Rangers player, while supporters won free pizza when Sacramento scored. Looking on: Rangers manager Ally McCoist (right) and Ian Durrant during their pre-season training . On Tuesday morning, the surreal quotient was fulfilled in the form of the skydivers landing one-by-one on the pitch, to the booming soundtrack of ‘It’s Raining Men’ by The Weathergirls. It literally was raining men and when the last skydiver delivered the match ball onto the centre circle, the majority of the 5000-capacity crowd hooted and hollered their raucous approval. There were a few raised eyebrows among the travelling Scots, however. Rangers were then serenaded onto the park by the Victoria Pipe Band, with the whole hoopla causing the match to be more than 20 minutes late kicking off. But the Ibrox side did not waste any time taking the lead when Black – who scored the late winner against Sacramento - rolled the ball across the goalline and young Gallagher was there at the back post to stab home. For Victoria Highlanders, there was a familiar name up front in Blair Sturrock, the son of former Dundee United winger and ex manager Paul Sturrock. But it was his strike partner Cam Hundal who equalised just 120 seconds after Rangers had gone ahead, capitalising on slack defending to roll the ball past keeper Steve Simonsen from 16 yards. Rangers edged back in front when the lively Gallagher’s shot was beaten away by Victoria keeper Elliot Mitrou, only for the alert Clark to turn home the rebound from a position prone on the ground. It then took a terrific point-blank save by Mitrou to prevent Gallagher adding a third before half time. Nice surroundings: Rangers' pre-season tour of North America is in full swing ahead of the new campaign . But there was a blow when Rangers lost Faure after he appeared to twist his knee. Fellow right back Richard Foster has already damaged his hamstring on this tour, meaning Barrie McKay was introduced with Robbie Crawford dropping to right back. Zaliukas would later add to McCoist’s woes by hobbling off injured in the second minute of 'Wilson Transportation Added Time', as it was called by the Stadium announcer. The second half saw McCoist seek goals by throwing on David Templeton and Kris Boyd for Clark and Shiels, then teenager Andrew Murdoch for Gallagher. Templeton very nearly grabbed a third, but was thwarted by the latest heroics by Mitrou. But Victoria had a few decent shots at Simonsen’s goal themselves as Rangers limped dismally over the line. For McCoist, a consolation will be that most of the players on show won’t be starting the first league match at home to Hearts later this month. But the Rangers manager will surely be demanding improvement when his side wraps up their North American tour when they face Ottawa Fury on Wednesday night out here in Canada.

"Huddersfield Town are looking to beat Newcastle and Crewe to non-League sensation Che Adams. The 18-year-old Ilkeston winger, who was called up to the England C squad last week, has a number of clubs interested in his signature including Nottingham Forest, Burnley and Norwich City and is out of contract in the summer. However, Huddersfield are understood to have discussed a £100,000 offer ahead of the January transfer window to fend off their rivals. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell could be set to snatch non-League sensation Che Adams . Ilkeston chairman Dave Mantle said: 'It would be wrong of us to stand in his way if a good opportunity arises for him to move to a higher level.' The former Coventry City trainee has taken the Evo-Stik Premier Division by storm since breaking into the first team last season scoring some vital and spectacular goals. Talking to the Ilkeston Advertiser, Adams said: 'Playing under pressure is good for me but at the same time I don’t want to make any mistakes when the scouts are watching. 'It’s really important I stay disciplined and keep concentrating because that’s helped me so far and I feel both the team and I have benefited. It’s hard to believe some of the clubs I’ve been linked with but it’s obviously a massive thrill and exciting as well. Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew is among those interested in the 18-year-old non-League starlet . 'It’s a tough level to come in at as you’re being kicked everywhere every week but that physical side of it is good as it toughens you up. 'I think it’s been better to play first team football here than, for example, to have stayed at Coventry where lads my age are being released without having played a competitive game. 'I just want to play football and keep working hard for Ilkeston. That’s the way I’ve always been, and whatever will happen in the future will happen.'","Che Adams, an 18-year-old winger for Ilkeston, is wanted by higher clubs .

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg head into the last round of the Formula One season in Abu Dhabi separated by just 17 points. Ahead of the season finale, Sportsmail charters five key moments from a pulsating duel which has caught the imagination both on, and off, the track. Bahrain Grand Prix (Hamilton 1st, Rosberg 2nd) After Lewis Hamilton’s early retirement at the opening race of the season in Australia, and his dominant victory in Malaysia, the Battle in Bahrain – dubbed the ‘race of the century’ – gave us our first real taste of the incredible pace of the Mercedes. It also marked the first on-track battle between the pair as they went hammer and tong for 57 thrilling laps. Nico Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton (right) battle it out side-by-side in Bahrain, but the Brit won . Hamilton is sprayed with champagne after his win in Bahrain; Rosberg finished second . Rosberg, who started on pole, was the faster of the two drivers but was unable to make a move stick on his resilient team-mate. Hamilton won and landed the first psychological blow of the season. The team-mates playfully sparred in parc ferme after the race but it was an opportunity missed for Rosberg, and he knew it. On the podium, he said: ‘I do not like coming second, especially to Lewis.’ Nicole Scherzinger greets Hamilton before his testing in Bahrain, on the way to a vital victory over his rival . Monaco Grand Prix (Hamilton 2nd, Rosberg 1st) Hamilton’s triumph in Bahrain was the second of a four-race winning streak. Victories in China and then Spain, albeit finishing only six tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg, followed, seeing the Briton leapfrog his team-mate in the drivers’ standings. The momentum was firmly with the 2008 world champion. Hamilton looked set to capture pole in Monte Carlo until he was forced to abort his final run after Rosberg went off the circuit at Mirabeau in the closing stages of qualifying. Hamilton felt that Rosberg had parked his car deliberately in a bid to botch his best lap. He was livid but the race stewards found no evidence to support his claim. Rosberg started from pole and won the race. Of his relationship with his team-mate, Hamilton said, ‘We’re not friends, we’re colleagues’. Hamilton comes through the chicane at Monaco; he eventually finished behind Rosberg in second . Hamilton looks less than impressed as the Rosberg lifts the trophy after winning in Monaco . Belgium Grand Prix (Hamilton retired, Rosberg 2nd) Rosberg spent the four-week summer break stewing over Hamilton’s failure to acknowledge a team instruction to allow him to pass at the previous race in Hungary. Mercedes’ refusal to publically address Hamilton’s apparent wrongdoing had also riled the German and his anxieties came to a head on lap two in Belgium. He started the race on pole but lost the lead following a poor start. In an attempt to overtake Hamilton he made contact with the Briton’s rear-left tyre. Rosberg was left with a damaged front wing and Hamilton a debilitating puncture. Hamilton and Rosberg walk their oppiosite ways in Belgium... it turned out to be a weekend to forget for Lewis . Rosberg recovered to finish second but Hamilton retired before firmly laying the blame for the collision at his team-mate’s door, claiming he’d crashed into him on purpose. The team’s failure to keep the fall-out behind closed doors resulted in a farcical fine for Rosberg, despite the stewards deeming the accident to be a racing incident, while he was also booed on the podium. Debris flies in the air as Rosberg and makes contact with his Mercedes team-mate Hamilton . Italian Grand Prix (Hamilton 1st, Rosberg 2nd) Hamilton and Rosberg were thrown together at the pre-race press conference at the next grand prix in Italy. While Rosberg was downbeat and apologetic, Hamilton appeared to revel in his role as victim. Hamilton then secured pole some two tenths of a second ahead of his team-mate. A technical glitch at the start saw him slip down the pack but he went on to claim victory after Rosberg made two mistakes at Turn 1. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso of Spain is flanked by Rosberg (left) and Hamilton in an Italy press conference . The conspiracy theorists claimed that Rosberg had deliberately gone off the track under instruction from Mercedes as further punishment for the incident in Belgium. Their voices gained credence when three-times world champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said: ‘I thought “hello, what’s going on here?” in reference to Rosberg’s gaffes. While Rosberg and Mercedes flatly dismissed the claims it marked the first of five straight wins for Hamilton. Rosberg drives off the track while his team-mate Hamilton overtakes; the Brit eventually won in Monza . Brazilian Grand Prix (Hamilton 2nd, Rosberg 1st) Hamilton’s emphatic run of results saw him move an emphatic 24 points clear of Rosberg with two races remaining. The German appeared down and out, low on confidence and seemingly unable to stop the Hamilton juggernaut. But he responded in superb fashion in Brazil topping every session of practice and qualifying before claiming his first victory since July’s German Grand Prix. It means that if Rosberg wins again on Sunday, Hamilton must finish second in order to win his first championship. We’re all set for a thrilling conclusion. Rosberg grins as he prepares to pick up the Brazilian Grand Prix title, with Hamilton finishing second . Rosberg locks up in front of Hamilton in Brazil, but the German went on to claim a huge victory .","Just 17 points separate Lewis Hamilton in first and Nico Rosberg in second .

"Lewis Hamilton’s bid to win his second world championship got off to the best-possible start in Abu Dhabi after he topped the timesheets in first practice. The Briton was just over one tenth quicker than Nico Rosberg with the Mercedes pair separated by 17 points heading into the season finale. Rosberg needs to win and hope Hamilton finishes third or lower to beat his team-mate to the tile, but Fernando Alonso was best of the rest, a mighty 1.7 seconds down on the Mercedes duo. Lewis Hamilton set the pace in the opening practice session for the season finale in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton holds a 17-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg heading into the final round . 1.

Will Stevens, on his Formula One bow, was seven seconds slower than Hamilton and three seconds behind his Caterham team-mate Kamui Kobayashi. Whilst the Mercedes duo were lapping in the one minute 43s range, no other driver could even get into the one minute 44s, such is the advantage that has been carved out by the Banbury-based marque. It already appears clear only a mechanical issue or a collision can deny Hamilton the title. Even with double points controversially on offer this weekend, he only has to finish in the top two to secure his second crown. McLaren's Jenson Button, potentially competing in the last race of his 15-season career as his future remains in limbo with McLaren not deciding on their driver line-up until after December 1, found the situation amusing. With his car in the garage due to a technical fault, watching from the sidelines, Button tweeted: 'Great to see @MercedesAMGF1 have got a lot of competition here in Abu Dhabi!! 1.7second gap!' Behind Alonso came the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel, now confirmed as replacing Alonso at Ferrari, and Daniel Ricciardo, but with both 1.8secs off the pace. Hamilton is bidding to win his second world championship after his maiden triumph in 2008 . Fernando Alonso, in his final race for Ferrari, was best of the rest, albeit almost two seconds down on Hamilton . Title contender Rosberg enjoys a spot of keepy-up ahead of the first practice session in Abu Dhabi . Toro Rosso duo Jean-Eric Vergne and Daniil Kvyat were sixth and seventh on the timesheet, but more than 2.2secs behind Hamilton. Williams' Valtteri Bottas was next up in eighth, but the Finn only managed eight laps after the sidepod bodywork ripped off his car at one point early on in the session. The team also discovered the sidepod was loose on team-mate Felipe Massa's car, with the Brazilian only managing seven laps before being consigned to the garage whilst mechanics worked on both cars. The Force India pair of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10, with McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari down in 11th and 12th respectively.

There were three debutants on track, with Lotus giving a run out to Esteban Ocon who acquitted himself well by finishing 16th and 3.590secs off the pace. Adderley Fong for Sauber was 19th and 4.793secs adrift, sandwiching the Caterham pair of Kamui Kobayashi and another newcomer in Stevens. The Leafield-based team are back on the grid after being allowed to miss the last two races due to falling into administration. With the team in the shop window, 23-year-old Essex racer Stevens had to wait until 15 minutes from the end of the session before finally savouring his first taste of F1 after encountering technical issues.

"When Richie McCaw leads the All Blacks out for the 100th time on Saturday it will cement his status as one of the greatest sporting captains to have lived. McCaw, who led New Zealand to the 2011 World Cup, has been captain of his country since 2006, and led the All Blacks out on several occasions before being given the full-time job aged 25. Now 33 and in the twilight of his career, questions of McCaw's legacy are becoming increasingly poignant, especially ahead of Saturday's landmark clash against Wales in Cardiff. Richie McCaw - seen here parading the World Cup in 2011 - will lead the All Blacks for the 100th time . One such question is: where does he rank among the greatest international sporting captains of all time? Well, Sportsmail has come up with a top 10, which unsurprisingly includes the All Black great. You're sure to disagree with some of the names on the list and certainly the order, so feel free to leave a comment below... 10) Allan Border (Australia, cricket) Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting led Australia through a period of utter domination of world cricket through the 1990s and 2000s but none of that would have been possible without Border. Inheriting a side in utter disarray in the mid-1980s, by the time Border had retired in 1994 Australia were playing the brand of dogged, determined cricket that has brought them so much success since. The Baggy Green are made in his image. Australia captain Allan Border embodied his team's battling spirit in the late 80s and early 90s . 9) Willie John McBride (British and Irish Lions, rugby union) To describe the Ulsterman as a Lions legend would not do his impact on the 15-man game in the British Isles justice. The big second row toured with the Lions five times between 1962 and 1974 and still holds the record for number of appearances in the famous red jersey at 17. McBride captained the Lions on their most successful tour to date - a 3-0 whitewash of South Africa in 1974. Willie John McBride in action against South Africa and returning home from the successful tour . 8) Douglas Jardine (England, cricket) Scourge of the Aussies, Jardine was the mastermind behind the infamous 'Bodyline' tactic which saw England nullify the threat of the peerless Don Bradman and regain the Ashes Down Under in 1932-33. A fierce competitor, the ultra-competitive Jardine reportedly ordered his players to 'hate the Australians' and to refer to Bradman as 'the little bastard'. He lost just one of 15 Tests as captain. Douglas Jardine (left) and his Australian counterpart William Woodfull ahead of the third Test in 1933 . 7) Bobby Moore (England, football) On to the first of our footballers and England's 1966 World Cup-winning captain Moore. A calm, assured presence at the back, Moore became England's youngest ever captain when first handed the armband in 1963 aged just 22. A year later, he was handed the full-time role and would retain it until the last of his 108 caps in 1973. Ninety of those caps came as captain - an English joint-record held with Billy Wright. Bobby Moore (right) kisses the Jules Rimet trophy after England's World Cup triumph in 1966 . 6) Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany, football) Beckenbauer just pips his great rival Moore by virtue of the fact he led his country to two major trophies, rather than one. Like Moore, Beckenbauer was a stylish defender, perhaps even more comfortable with the ball than without it. On the losing side as Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966, 'Der Kaiser' would have his time. Made captain in 1971, he led his country to the European Championship in 1972 and, his crowning glory, the World Cup in 1974. Franz Beckenbauer (left) guided Germany to the World Cup two years after winning Euro 72 . 5) Richie McCaw (New Zealand, rugby union) Sorry Richie, but we can't get you any higher than No 5. One hundred Tests as captain and a World Cup triumph speak for themselves, but that choke against France in the 2007 quarter-final when the All Blacks looked destined for glory is the one blot in his copybook as captain. McCaw will have the chance of redemption next year at the World Cup on these shores and should he lift the Webb Ellis trophy again, he may just find himself at No 1. McCaw's All Blacks delivered New Zealand their first World Cup since 1987 three years ago . 4) Diego Maradona (Argentina, football) A controversial choice. Those football aficionados among you may wonder how Maradona is above Beckenbauer and Moore. Sure, Maradona is arguably the greatest footballer of all-time but his leadership qualities are not immediately obvious, especially compared with those two stalwarts - the argument goes. But it is exactly that prodigious ability which carried an otherwise average Argentina team to World Cup glory in 1986. Maradona led by the most supreme of examples that summer. Diego Maradona was in sensational form throughout the 1986 World Cup . 3) Sir Viv Richards (West Indies, cricket) Back to cricket, and with it one of the most iconic figures the game has known. Like Jardine, Richards was a prickly figure as skipper, never shirking a confrontation and doing everything in his power to win (and he wasn't bad with the bat either). Under Richards' captaincy, which lasted for 50 Tests from 1984 to 1991, West Indies never lost a series. Sir Viv Richards was the leader of an iconic West Indies team in the 1980s . 2) Iker Casillas (Spain, football) The name 'Casillas' doesn't scream out at you when asked who the greatest sporting captains of all-time are, especially in the wake of Spain's and his dismal World Cup this year. But just look at his record: Casillas captained Spain to three consecutive major trophies - Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. A feat unrivalled in national football captaincy (although Beckenbauer came within a penalty shootout of doing the same at Euro 1976). Iker Casillas - seen here lifting the World Cup in 2010 - captained Spain through a period of dominance . 1) Martin Johnson (British and Irish Lions and England, rugby union) We've seen three types of criteria that make great sporting captains: trophies, such as Casillas; character, such as Jardine; and skill, such as Maradona. All 10 of the sportsmen on these list have elements of each, but none have all in such an abundance as did Johnson. Johnson's leadership and motivational qualities were second to none during his playing career and he was unrivalled as the greatest lock on the planet until his retirement. And he has the medals to go with it: a World Cup in 2003 and a British and Irish Lions series win touring South Africa, who were then-world champions. He captained both sides, of course. Martin Johnson captained both the Lions (left) and England (right) to memorable successes .","Richie McCaw captains New Zealand for the 100th time on Saturday .

"It started with Owen Farrell asking George Ford for help with his French homework so the pair of rugby-mad schoolboys would be let out to kick a ball around. That was the beginning of a childhood journey that resumes on Saturday when the Lancashire-born duo start alongside one another at Twickenham. Ford has been given his first England start at fly-half and Farrell, the regular incumbent at No 10, has been moved to inside centre. It is the first time the partnership has been tested at senior level, although it is a combination that lit up the junior England ranks between the Under 16 and Under 20 age groups. Bath's George Ford (right) will start at fly half against Samoa with Owen Farrell moving to inside centre . Ford (left) watches on in training as Farrell lines up a shot at goal at the team's Pennyhill Park base . England skills coach Mike Catt (left) has a word with the team's new 10-12 pairing ahead of Saturday's Test . Farrell (right) and Ford played for England in the final of the Junior World Cup in 2011 . 2008 . England Under 16 teammates. Farrell captained the side, Ford had just turned 15. 2008-09 . England Under 18 team-mates. Toured Argentina together in 2008. Toured South Africa in 2009. Finished the season unbeaten. 2011 . England Under 20 teammates. Won U20 Six Nations Grand Slam. Lost 33-22 to New Zealand in U20 World Cup final. 2014 . Ford made senior debut off the bench at Twickenham as a replacement for Farrell against Wales in the Six Nations. After England’s below-par performances against New Zealand and South Africa, the promotion of Ford to the starting XV is one of six changes for the line-up that will face Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday night. The former neighbours will attempt to kick start England’s campaign and potentially solve the long-term problem in their country’s midfield. ‘We went to the same school and lived literally 10 metres away from each other,’ said Ford. ‘All we wanted to do was go outside and kick a ball around. Owen used to come home and be like, “C’mon mate, we need to go outside and have a mess around, do a bit of my homework for me”. I’d start doing a bit of his French or whatever it was, then we could go out and kick a ball around. Stupid of me when you look back on it.’ Their mutual understanding should hopefully lead to a seamless transition in the back-line. The inclusion of two natural kickers will help improve the territorial game and should also make England’s gameplan more difficult for the opposition to break down. Billy Vunipola has been left out of Stuart Lancaster's match day squad ahead of England's clash with Samoa . James Haskell has been rewarded for his form for Wasps this season as he pushes for a back row place . Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees (left) and Saracens' Richard Wigglesworth will get their chance on Saturday . Ford has been given goal-kicking responsibilities and Lancaster has told the 21-year-old to go out and ‘be the boss’. It is a rare chance for the Bath No 10 to make a claim for the starting jersey, despite numerous calls for his selection since he was named IRB Junior World Player of the Year in 2011 — the first Englishman to receive a global award since Jonny Wilkinson. ‘I am massively proud to start my first game for England at Twickenham, having played four times off the bench now,’ said Ford. ‘I have not got a great amount of game time but I am really looking forward to it. It’s exciting. As a 10 it is in your job title to organise and lead people around the park and that is what I will try to do.’ Ford was also the designated kicker at age-group level, when he often found himself the target of practical jokes by his team-mates — such as having the contents of his room perched on the flat roof of a team hotel and replaced by 200 cups of Ribena before the 2011 Junior World Cup final. Danny Care has been dropped after making his 50th Test appearance against South Africa . Kyle Eastmond suffered a concussion late in the match against the Springboks . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: Season 5, Episode 3 . After losing to New Zealand in the showcase match of the Under 20s game, Ford moved from Leicester to Bath, where he now plays under the guidance of his father, Mike. Farrell has also experienced life working under his father, Andy, who is England’s defence coach. It is a world of coincidences for the former rugby league players, who used to represent rival clubs Wigan St Patricks and Waterhead Boys and also went to St George’s School in Harpenden together when their fathers moved south to coach at Saracens. ‘Having dads who played and coached in the professional game could only benefit us,’ said Ford. ‘To have someone you constantly talk to about the game — Mum gets sick of it — is brilliant.’ On Saturday Ford will start alongside Leicester scrum-half Ben Youngs, who was his team-mate at Welford Road when he got his first break into senior rugby. The new half-back combination provides two of those new faces from the side that lost to South Africa. Bath hooker Rob Webber has pushed Dylan Hartley to the bench, while Ben Morgan and James Haskell have displaced Billy Vunipola and Tom Wood in the back row. There are new combinations all round, but none will catch the imagination quite like the two Lancashire lads. Starting XV: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Anthony Watson (Bath), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester), George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Rob Webber (Bath), David Wilson (Bath), Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), Ben Morgan (Gloucester). Replacements: Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Kieran Brookes (Newcastle), George Kruis (Saracens), Tom Wood (Northampton), Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Marland Yarde (Harlequins).","England face Samoa in their next QBE Autumn International on Saturday .

"Samoa's players are planning a black-armband protest during Saturday’s clash with England after being warned they could be thrown out of next year’s World Cup and the 2016 Olympics for boycotting the match. Senior players wrote to the International Rugby Board last month threatening to go on strike in protest at a lack of financial transparency within Samoa’s rugby union, whose chairman Tuilaepa Sailele - also the country’s prime minister - labelled them ‘little children’. The strike appears to have been averted following intervention by the IRB. The Samoa players will perform the Siva Tua at Twickenham but will wear black armbands too . Lock Fa'atiga Lemalu will be hoping Samoa can end the year on a high at Twickenham . It's not just the Samoans who earn far less per game than England - South Africa, New Zealand and Australia all do, too. England - £18,000* . South Africa £6,700* . New Zealand £5,900* . Australia £5,600* . Samoa £505* . *Approximate fee per game . But it emerged on Tuesday that Samoa’s players were told they would suffer serious consequences if they went ahead with the strike, including potentially losing a lucrative Test against the All Blacks in Apia next July. This left the tourists planning an alternative protest on Saturday against the governance of their sport. Samoa’s Toulose prop Census Johnston said: ‘We’re voicing our concerns. I’ve seen people saying it’s just about money for us but it isn’t.’ They are paid just NZ$1,000 (£505) per match while on tour in the UK. England players earn £18,000 per match before win bonuses. Prime minister Tuilaepa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi has angered players by accusing them of 'childish behaviour' Tourists have ruled out the possibility of strike action as their European tour comes to an end .

Samoa's players had considered boycotting the game due to their concerns over the mismanagement of their union and while that threat has been withdrawn, they are eager to make a statement at England's expense. England coach Stuart Lancaster instructs his squad in training ahead of hosting Samoa on Saturday . 'We're expecting physicality, pride and passion from Samoa. This game is their cup final. It's a great opportunity for them and they'll be hugely motivated,' head coach Lancaster said. 'I watched them beat Wales in Cardiff a couple of years ago (29-16 in November 2012) in a similar fixture. They are very difficult opposition, so we need to be at our best. 'It will be incredibly competitive right from the start. Just look at the Wales v Fiji game last weekend.....Fiji almost won it (losing 17-13). 'We know it's not a game we can take lightly whatsoever because they'll be putting us under pressure.' George Ford will be under the spotlight as the Bath fly-half comes into the starting line-up at Twickenham . Owen Farrell, during kicking practice, has been displaced by Ford (left) to inside centre for the Samoa Test . Starting XV: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Anthony Watson (Bath), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester), George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Rob Webber (Bath), David Wilson (Bath), Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), Ben Morgan (Gloucester). Replacements: Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Kieran Brookes (Newcastle), George Kruis (Saracens), Tom Wood (Northampton), Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Marland Yarde (Harlequins). Lancaster has made five changes in personnel to the team defeated 31-28 by the Springboks as he seeks a reaction to an alarming slump just 10 months out from the World Cup. The performances of George Ford at fly-half and Owen Farrell at inside centre will be under the microscope as the former school friends reprise the partnership that served England well at age group level. Ben Youngs has been brought in at scrum-half and Rob Webber is given a chance at hooker because of Dylan Hartley's brainless yellow card against South Africa, while the return of flanker James Haskell and number eight Ben Morgan completes an overhaul of the back row. James Haskell has been recalled to the back row as England aim to end a run of five successive defeats . Lancaster, who has made six changes from the South Africa loss, observes a team talk during training . Ben Youngs is one of the six changes to face Samoa, coming in at scrum-half on Saturday . 'Certainly we need to improve the quality of our performance. The players have been told that and we have made changes to create that,' Lancaster said. 'You get to a point around this time of the week when your work is done and the players have to take the responsibility for delivering.' An area of strength for England in the past has been their back row, but Lancaster felt compelled to react to a decline in form from Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola. Joe Marler (left) and the rest of the England squad are put through their paces ahead of hosting Samoa . It is the first time Wood has been dropped by Lancaster, but the head coach hopes the presence of Wasps captain Haskell will offer another source of momentum. 'James will offer another carrying option, giving us more ball carriers than we've had,' Lancaster said. 'Billy Vunipola is obviously a strong carrier, but perhaps we didn't have enough around him in the type of game we ended up playing against South Africa.'

"The return of the ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’ could be a blessing for England, as James Haskell will take his place in an overhauled team on Saturday, full of intent and armed with a useful dose of perspective. As captain of Wasps this season, the flanker has proved he is a man of consistent substance to go with the larger-than-life persona. Now he has overcome a virus, initially feared to be meningitis, the 29-year-old is determined to inspire England as they seek to halt a sequence of five defeats. Haskell, one of three changes to the matchday squad for the QBE Test against at Twickenham, can add an edge to Stuart Lancaster’s team. This is a player who can talk the talk, but he has also been regularly walking the walk of late with a strong end to last season, a fine contribution to the gallant near-miss against the All Blacks in Auckland and a stirring start to the new club campaign. Flanker James Haskell returns to the England line-up on Saturday against Samoa at Twickenham . The ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’ has backed up his characterful chat with performances on the pitch . Having been a frustrated observer in the last two weeks, as England have sunk to home defeats against New Zealand and South Africa, Haskell is ready to enter the fray with a clear vision of what is required. Results - nothing else. ‘It’s important for us to get results on the board,’ he said. ‘That’s the key. We don’t feel in crisis but ultimately what cements everything we’re doing is results. No one reflects in a year’s time and says, “Oh, that was a narrow victory”, they just want to see a W. As for the idea that, “Win or lose, they’ve got a really good culture”, frankly, it doesn’t matter. ‘With all the fans that have bought into everything we’re trying to do, you want to do them justice, you want to do yourselves justice, and you want to confirm that everything we’re doing inside the camp is correct. We all know it is; it’s now just getting over the line and proving it.’ Haskell gets down to business on Tuesday as England look to stem the flow of Test losses . The flanker, coming in for Billy Vunipola, says England's squad want to repay the fans' faith . 15 Mike Brown (Harlequins) 14 Anthony Watson (Bath) 13 Brad Barritt (Saracens) 12 Owen Farrell (Saracens) 11 Jonny May (Gloucester) 10 George Ford (Bath) 9 Ben Youngs (Leicester) 1 Joe Marler (Harlequins) 2 Rob Webber (Bath) 3 David Wilson (Bath) 4 Dave Attwood (Bath) 5 Courtney Lawes (Northampton) 6 James Haskell (Wasps) 8 Ben Morgan (Gloucester) 7 Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, captain) Haskell replaces Billy Vunipola, while Richard Wigglesworth and Billy Twelvetrees have come in for Danny Care and Kyle Eastmond. Reflecting on the defeats by the All Blacks and Springboks that have set off a wave of criticism, Haskell added: ‘I have been involved when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides, when a narrow loss would have been acceptable. ‘It is now at the stage where we should be beating these teams and be right up there. I don’t think anyone is satisfied to be pushing those teams close. We should be beating them and we are doing everything in our power to go on and do that.’ But Haskell insisted the present problems bear no resemblance to the debacle at the last World Cup, which he was involved in. ‘It is the polar opposite,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t resemble that kind of atmosphere or situation at all. ‘My own view and that of the boys is that finishing an honourable second is not acceptable but let’s get some context here. It was the world champions and the second-best team in the world. No one wants to talk about a development journey, but we are a side that has come together pretty quickly. Billy Twelvetrees (left) and Richard Wigglesworth (right) come into the matchday squad with Haskell . ‘We have pushed some very good sides close but we are aware that we need to take that step next and take those opportunities. ‘We are talking about small percentages - that ruthlessness that New Zealand or the South Africans have which has been born out of a lot of experience and a lot of games together with pretty unchanged squads. They are doing it consistently and that’s what we are striving for.’ That is also what Haskell has been striving for on a personal level. He achieved that impressive continuity prior to his virus-induced week in hospital and he has done enough since his comeback to convince the coaches that he deserves another starting shot. His ambition is to maximise the opportunity and that is where deeds must trump words. Haskell stood up to be counted against New Zealand in the 3-0 series loss earlier this year . ‘You never want to be the guy who talks it up; who trains like Tarzan, plays like Jane,’ he said. ‘If you talk a good game, you have to play a good game. This is a huge opportunity for me and I want to seize it as best I can. I want to make sure I perform and leave nothing in the tank. There is never next week with international rugby because it is so competitive. That is my mind-set.’ Haskell’s hope is to ‘make life difficult’ for the coaches by playing well enough to leave them with a selection quandary. But in doing so, he would also be making life much easier by alleviating the pressure which has engulfed the England set-up. That would be a blessing for all involved.","James Haskell returns for England against Samoa on Saturday .

"Danny Care and Billy Vunipola were dropped from the England squad on Tuesday night and Dylan Hartley will be demoted to the bench for Saturday’s Test against Samoa. However, Owen Farrell has survived a selection cull but is likely to be switched from his favourite fly-half position to inside centre. In response to defeats by New Zealand and South Africa which have extended the national team’s losing run to five games, head coach Stuart Lancaster has taken drastic steps to arrest the slide. Billy Vunipola has been left out of Stuart Lancaster's match day squad ahead of England's clash with Samoa . James Haskell has been rewarded for his form for Wasps this season as he pushes for a back row place . Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees (left) and Saracens' Richard Wigglesworth get their chance on Saturday . Hartley, who was sin-binned in the second half against the Springboks, will be replaced at hooker by Rob Webber, while Care and Vunipola have been ousted from the match-day 23, with Ben Youngs and Ben Morgan taking over at scrum-half and No 8 respectively. When Lancaster names his line-up on Wednesday afternoon it will also include the recalled James Haskell at the expense of Tom Wood and Bath prodigy George Ford at No 10 for the first time, with, as expected, Farrell alongside him at inside centre. Farrell has been out of form after coming into this QBE series short of game-time but he has been given a reprieve as the management seek to try out a 10-12 combination which was so effective at age-group level. The Saracens playmaker may be under pressure but his influence was lauded on Tuesday by England captain Chris Robshaw who said: ‘Owen’s a fantastic player. I’m a very firm believer that any team with him is much better than any team that doesn’t have him in. Danny Care has been dropped after making his 50th Test appearance against South Africa . Kyle Eastmond suffered a concussion late in the match against the Springboks . ‘He’s been fantastic. He helps lead the guys. He spoke extremely well before the game. He’s a great guy to have alongside you in the ranks. You need players like that around you in these tough environments, these tough games with the mentality that he’s not going to be fazed. ‘He’s been exactly the same this week. He’s continued to work hard and he has spoken well already. He wants to go out there and continue to improve as well. Owen is a key pivot. ‘To single out guys (for criticism) is extremely tough. It doesn’t come down to one person - it’s a team thing and as a team we stick together.’ Gloucester captain Billy Twelvetrees will be among the substitutes, along with Saracens scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth.

Fiji-born winger Henry Speight will make his debut for Australia against Ireland after being named in the starting line-up for the third Test of the Wallabies’ tour of Europe. Speight qualified for Australia on residency grounds in September, but a hamstring injury delayed his debut. AUSTRALIA: Folau; Ashley-Cooper, Kuridrani, Toomua, Speight; Foley, Phipps; McCalman, Hooper (capt), Jones; Simmons, Carter; Kepu, Fainga’a, Slipper. Subs: Hanson, Robinson, Faulkner, Skelton, Schatz, Genia, Cooper, Beale.

"Richie McCaw will become the first rugby union player to captain his country in 100 Tests when New Zealand face Wales at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. It is somewhat fitting that McCaw will achieve the milestone against Wales as they were also the opponents when he captained the All Blacks for the very first time a decade ago. McCaw, who has led New Zealand to 87 wins in his 99 Tests as captain to date, spoke of his pride in playing for and leading the All Blacks at Thursday's team announcement in Cardiff. New Zealand star Richie McCaw is in line to captain his country for the 100th time in a Test match . McCaw has led New Zealand to 87 wins in his 99 Tests during his time as captain . The 33-year-old (right) warms up alongside Kieran Read (left) ahead of New Zealand's match against Wales . He said: 'I always just remind myself it's a privilege every time you get to play for and captain the All Blacks. I enjoy doing it and to do it for as long as I have I guess I have had a huge sense of enjoyment and learnt a lot doing it. 'To get to a hundred (caps as captain) is something that I'm obviously quite proud of, but you can't do it without a good bunch of people around you, that's something I always bear in mind.' All Blacks coach Steven Hansen paid tribute to the three-time IRB player of the year while unveiling his starting XV for the weekend encounter against Warren Gatland's side. 'On behalf of the team and myself, we would like to congratulate Richie on the impressive milestone of captaining his country in 100 Test matches,' Hansen, who coached Wales between 2002 and 2004, said. 'There is no doubt his leadership has grown phenomenally over the years and he is now one of the all-time great leaders of any sports team.' On Saturday's game, Hansen added: 'It's always a great occasion to play at Millennium Stadium, which is one of the great stadiums in the world. We have had a good week's preparation and we are expecting a physical Test with a high ball-in-play time. All Black captain McCaw packs down for a scrum during a  training session . Steven Hansen has lavished praise on McCaw ahead of his 100th game as captain of the All Blacks . 'We know we will have to be totally engaged in our own roles for the full 80 minutes and take the game to the Welsh at every opportunity.' Hansen has made 12 changes to the side that secured a 24-16 win against Scotland last Saturday, with Ben Smith, Charles Piutau and McCaw the only players to retain their place in the starting XV. Dan Carter, who made his first Test start of the year in last weekend's encounter at Murrayfield, is not included in the match-day squad, nor is Aaron Cruden, who was given the nod at 10 against England seven days earlier. Instead Beauden Barrett will start at fly-half, alongside scrum-half Aaron Smith, who was rested for the Scotland clash. Ben Smith starts a second successive Test at full-back after a Rugby Championship campaign which saw him play in no fewer than three different positions, while Julian Savea and Piutau will play on the wings. Sonny Bill Williams, who became a father for the first time on Tuesday, partners Conrad Smith in midfield. In the pack, McCaw is joined in the back row by Kieran Read and Jerome Kaino, while locks Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick return to the second row. Hooker Dane Coles, who was sin-binned during New Zealand's victory over England, will be flanked by props Wyatt Crockett and Owen Franks in the front row.

"Liverpool are compiling a dossier on the fitness issues that have plagued Daniel Sturridge’s career after it emerged he has injured his left thigh nine times. The England striker is faced with another six week lay-off after he broke down in training on Monday. It is the second time this season Sturridge has injured the muscle, but Liverpool’s medical staff are now processing his history from previous clubs in an attempt to get to the bottom of it and an operation cannot be ruled out. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who will meet Sturridge on Friday to discuss the situation, said: 'Most players you’ll find want to play through an injury to get on to the field. Obviously that’s what you do. Daniel Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and now could be out until next year . Sturridge, pictured arriving at Liverpool's Spire Hospital on Wednesday, has been plagued by injuries . Sturridge scored 28 goals for club and country last season and was in blistering form . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. ‘It was in a session and quite an innocuous action. He did it when he just flicked the ball. It wasn’t a shot or anything that looked serious. But obviously he felt the pain and then when the medical team told me the next day after the scan, it was disappointing. ‘Now we just have to concentrate and focus on the players we do have. It’s that simple. Though of course it’s hugely disappointing to lose a player of that quality. ‘I think that’s his ninth injury on that thigh from previous clubs and here. ‘So there is an issue there somewhere. This shows a slight tear just below where he had a previous injury (in September). ‘Most players you’ll find want to play through an injury to get on to the field. Obviously that’s what you do.’ Liverpool have laboured in front of goal in the absence of Sturridge. Rodgers, though, is not certain that going out to spend money in the transfer window is how to solve his problems. ‘We have to look at the players we have,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Crystal Palace on Sunday.

"Stewart Downing will return to West Ham more determined than ever to maintain the form which earned a surprise England recall. Downing is not deterred by Roy Hodgson's decision to take him off at half-time in the 3-1 win in Scotland after 45 minutes when he worked hard but struggled to get on the ball or impose his creative quality. He knows there will be critics who are quick to write off his chances of adding to his 35 caps but he has four months to persuade Hodgson with his performances for West Ham before the next England squad is selected for games against Lithuania and Italy. Stewart Downing is determined to keep his place in Roy Hodgson's England squad . Hodgson gives instructions to Downing and his England team-mate during a training session last week . Downing said: 'It is all about people’s opinions. As long as I am picked and playing then I am happy. That is enough for me. Everyone has an opinion in the world of football. Of those picked last night (Wednesday) some will think he should be in or it should be him and so on. That is just the way people talk but I am happy to be back in the squad and just have to stay there now. 'It was good to be out there and play some minutes and good to be back. 'Now it's the same for everyone. You need to keep playing well to be picked. That’s what the manager said to the players after the game. Carry on your form to be picked so I’ll go back to West Ham and try to carry on playing the way I have been playing and hopefully that will be enough to be in the next squad.' Downing's England return - it was his first cap for two and a half years - was not helped by injury. He took a knock on a knee last week and aggravated the problem during the warm-up ahead of the Slovenia game on Saturday. Although he remained on the team sheet among the substitutes at Wembley he was not fit to come on. The 30-year-old winger has been in brilliant form for West Ham so far this season . He was passed a fitness test in Scotland but was probably less than 100 per cent. Downing said: 'I had not trained all week but was passed fit to play and was just happy to get out there and play 45 minutes. I came through it and should be ok for this weekend’s game for West Ham. 'There’s a bit of swelling on the knee but it’s just a bang. I was fit to play and I was fine.' Hodgson deployed Downing on the left of a midfield trio, but much of his impressive form for West Ham has come in the No.10 role. His versatility can work against as well as for him. 'It would be nice to nail a position down but the way we have been playing at West Ham, it has suited me to play in that No. 10 role. I can play in the left of the three too. With the players we have with England, obviously it is going to be difficult playing at No. 10 if I am honest. Downing celebrates scoring a late equaliser against Stoke during the 2-2 Premier League draw . 'Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley can play there - so you’ll probably see me playing more on the left of the three. That’s where I think I will get the chance to play the most. 'I think we have got good flexibility. We were trying to get into the back of the Scotland midfield really. It was difficult because obviously they were pressing hard us at times. But the first goal settled us and the quality shone through with the goals we scored. 'It is nice to go away with a good win. A lot of people had us down to lose this game after Scotland won last week. That was a big motivation factor for us. To win the game. The first goal was crucial because it settled us down and I think we played some nice football. Downing made his first start for England in two-and-a-half years and was hooked after 45 minutes . 'The team took a lot of stick from the World Cup but have bounced back very well.' From a personal perspective, the 30-year-old was simply glad to be back in an England shirt, nearly a decade after his debut. Downing said: 'I have been out of the squad for a long time, two and a half years. I did not think I would be picked again but it’s just so nice to be back in it. Not many players are picked after such a gap. 'But it just goes to show that if you keep playing well, there is always the chance of being recalled. You’ve just got to play well for your club and you never know.'","Stewart Downing hoping to maintain good form with West Ham .

"Luis Suarez believes Steven Gerrard should remain at Liverpool for the rest of his career as the Anfield club is 'part of him'.

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan said Mackay had been ‘so unlucky’ as he ‘has done a little bit wrong’ and called for fans to back his decision.

"Ex-Fulham boss Felix Magath has ripped into his former players claiming they were relegated from the Premier League because of a lack of order, discipline and fitness. The German was sacked by the Cottagers in September after leading his side to just one point from their first seven Championship fixtures. But Magath, who believes England's national side must start modelling themselves on World Cup winners Germany, says that Fulham's failure was down to the players and not his style of management. Ex-Fulham boss Felix Magath has criticised his former players for a lack of order, discipline and fitness . Magath believes former Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the last Englishman to show 'English spirit' Fulham's players celebrate Bryan Ruiz's first goal during their 3-3 draw with Wigan at the DW Stadium . Magath's honours as a manager: Bundesliga title (2005, 2006, 2009), German Cup (2005, 2006), Intertoto Cup (2002) Fulham honours: First Division (2001), Seond Division (1932, 1949, 1999), FA Cup runners-up (1975), Europa League runners-up (2010), Intertoto Cup (2002) Speaking to The Sun On Sunday, Magath said: 'If you want to be successful, you need order, discipline and fitness. These are the three key components I demand from my players, who are earning seven-figure salaries.' The 61-year-old also claims that his squad lacked the necessary spirit to survive in the top-flight, even citing a former Prime Minister as the last Englishman to exhibit the quality he looks for. 'And you need English spirit,' Magath added. 'The last person to show this properly from England was Winston Churchill. But I didn't see much close to that during my time at Fulham.'

Kit Symons has replaced Magath as Fulham boss after a successful spell as the club's caretaker manager . The former Bayern Munich boss, who has managed Wolfsburg and Schalke among other German clubs, was also left unimpressed by Fulham's lack of silverware. The west London side are yet to win a major trophy during their 135-year history, something two-time Bundesliga winner Magath regards as a major downfall. He said: 'They can't keep living off the fact that in their entire history they have reached a Europa League final in 2010 and FA Cup final in 1975. 'If that was all I had on my CV, I'd consider myself a failure.'

"Kit Symons has been appointed Felix Magath's successor at Fulham and lands an 18-month contract. The Cottagers' owner Shahid Khan flew back to London on Wednesday, with his caretaker boss given the job permanently straight away - as Sportsmail reported on Tuesday. Symons has overseen five wins from his nine games in charge, leaving Khan with little choice but to promote the coach. Kit Symons (pictured) is expected to be confirmed as Fulham manager this week by owner Shahid Khan . Khan said: 'First, I must offer my sincere appreciation to the search committee for its commitment to the process. We asked a lot of all five committee members, perhaps more than they anticipated, and yet they gave us more than we could have ever imagined. 'Each of them brought something unique and valuable to the search, but the one thing they all had in common was a strong desire to return Fulham to its proper place as one of the most admired and respected clubs in English football. I cannot thank them enough. 'Kit has thoroughly earned the opportunity to take Fulham from here as our First Team Manager. We've been a different football club, on and off the pitch, since Kit stepped in as our Caretaker Manager in September. 'His passion for Fulham is evident and contagious, and I believe the promise ahead of him is extremely bright. Above all, Kit understands and is committed to our goals, and he knows there is much work ahead. Starting today, we can begin work with Kit firmly in charge at Fulham.' The 64-year-old was handed a trio of prospective new bosses by the five-man search committee installed to 'provide guidance' in their quest to find Magath's successor. Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Niall Quinn were alongside supporter and Nike director David Daly and academy boss Huw Jennings. Symons took temporary charge at the back end of September with Fulham rooted to the foot of the Championship table. The caretaker boss has overseen five wins in eight games to lift Fulham out of the relegation zone . But his sterling transformation at Craven Cottage has seen his side's record only beaten by Bournemouth and Derby County in the month following. The odds of Hull City's Steve Bruce taking over from Magath had tumbled on Monday night but there was never anything in the link, while moves for ex-Premier League managers Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke were also mooted.","Kit Symons has  five wins in nine games to pull Fulham from relegation .

"The FBI offered protection to a whistleblower who made corruption allegations against the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid because they believed she was in danger. Phaedra Al-Majid, a former employee of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, told Sky News that she was approached by agents of the USA’s national criminal investigation organisation in September 2011 and told that they believed she was under threat. ‘I was watching TV, there were three FBI agents on my doorstep,’ she said. ‘They said, “we are here because you have received threats and we know the security of you and your children is being jeopardised, so we want to see what we can do to help you”. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson being asked about FIFA bidding report . FIFA whistleblower Phaedra Almajid claims she is now under FBI protection and fears for her life . Speaking in an interview, Almajid said she would be looking over her shoulder for the rest of her life . Almajid spoke exclusively to the Mail on Sunday last weekend and revealed how she had been treated . FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the hosts for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 . Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckhart have been tarnished by FIFA's probe into the World Cup vote . ‘It was terrifying. They asked me questions pertaining to my time in Qatar, what I had observed, what I had witnessed and especially about the threats and affidavit.’ Al-Majid left the Qatar bid team in early 2010, nine months before they were awarded the 2022 World Cup, after becoming concerned at the conduct of the campaign. She provided information to several journalists on condition that they preserved her anonymity. In the past year she has also given information to New York attorney Michael Garcia’s ‘independent’ inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 bids. Her evidence was dismissed in a summary of the Garcia report published by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert last week, which she believes effectively identified her and breached her confidentiality. Speaking on camera for the first time, she said she does not regret speaking out. ‘If you are asking me do I regret being the Qatar whistleblower, it has cost me personally, it cost me emotionally,’ she said. ‘I know for a fact I will be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. It’s cost me security for me and both my children. However, I did witness something and believe I did have to say what I witnessed. Michael Garcia (left), former US Attorney for New York and Hans-Joachim Eckert (right), the German judge . Football's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the World Cup vote . ‘I had a lot of cyber attacks, a lot of them were directed to my children. I believe it was through the Qataris. They knew a lot of information about me that I don’t believe FIFA knew. I was a bigger threat to the Qataris than I ever was to FIFA.’ Al-Majid and fellow whistleblower Bonita Mersiades, who worked for Australia’s 2022 bid, have lodged separate formal complaints against Eckert’s 42-page summary. ‘I was shocked, immediately I was crying,’ added Al-Majid. ‘Every time I met with Michael Garcia he ensured me everything was confidential. It was agreed before I even met him that I would not participate in the investigation unless I was kept anonymous and everything was kept in confidence. ‘I had no reason not to trust him so I was in shock at what was done. I feel frightened because Eckert so calculatedly made sure that my identity was revealed. ‘Why has it happened? To silence any other whistleblowers and to intimidate me and Bonita so we will stop talking about what happened during the 2022 process.’ Eckert’s summary of Garcia’s 18-month investigation cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, having found no serious breaches of bidding rules. Blatter has served four terms as FIFA president and is set to stand for a fifth next year . The Al-Rayyan Stadium which will be built for the 2022 World Cup in the state of Qatar . FIFA have been widely criticised for failing to publish the Garcia report in full. The Eckert summary puts more blame on England for the way they conducted their failed 2018 bid than on either of the controversial Qatari or Russian campaigns. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is adamant that the full report cannot be made public and - while claiming not to have read it all himself - he has rejected FA chairman Greg Dyke’s call to publish. Replying to a letter from Dyke, Blatter said publication would break FIFA rules and Swiss law. Blatter wrote that Zurich-based FIFA must respect confidentiality agreements under Swiss law and his organisation’s own rules prevent the disclosure of information that ‘violates the code of ethics’. Sepp Blatter (right) hands the World Cup to Qatar's Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani . David Beckham, Lord Coe and Andy Anson look dejected as England miss out on hosting the 2018 World Cup . Dyke went on the offensive after the fiasco which saw Eckert’s summary disowned as a distortion of the original by Garcia, who said he would take a case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee. Garcia and Eckert are due to meet today in an attempt to sort out their differences but it is unlikely that Blatter and Dyke will see eye to eye any time soon. In his letter to Dyke, the 78-year-old Blatter did say that full publication ‘might be permissible if the persons and entities included in the report consent to such publication and waive any legal action they might be entitled to bring.’ He then asked whether Dyke’s request for full publication could be taken as a guarantee that all those involved from the England 2018 campaign would not be calling in the lawyers over the contents.

The fall-out has been extensive since FIFA on Thursday published a report investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Here are the events since the release of a 42-page report by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee, in his ruling on Michael Garcia's investigation. NOVEMBER 12, 2014 . FIFA announces the initial findings of the investigation into the bidding process for the next two World Cups will be published on Thursday morning, with England expected to come in for some criticism for the attempt to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner. NOVEMBER 13 . England are indeed condemned for rules violations in their bid for the 2018 tournament, but Russia and Qatar are effectively confirmed as hosts for 2018 and 2022 respectively, the report stating any rule breaches by them were 'of very limited scope'. The Football Association rejects 'any criticism' of England's bid, with a spokesman saying: 'We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable co-operation', willingly complied with the investigation.' FIFA's chief ethics investigator Garcia announces he will appeal against the findings, saying the report contains 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' in his original report. NOVEMBER 14 . Eckert admits his 'surprise' at Garcia's plans to appeal and adds: 'I will talk to Garcia but until then I will make no more statements.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims it is 'grossly unfair' for England to have borne the brunt of criticism and adds: 'The Garcia report should be out there in full.' American FIFA member Sunil Gulati and FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands issue a joint statement also calling for Garcia's report to be published in full. FIFA confirms receipt of Garcia's intention to appeal. NOVEMBER 16 . Former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson claims FIFA ran a 'Wild West' bidding process for the two tournaments which encouraged would-be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour. NOVEMBER 17 . Football Association chairman Greg Dyke writes to FIFA executive committee members calling for 'urgent action' to ensure Garcia's report is published in full, claiming public confidence in FIFA has hit a new low and that there is 'compelling evidence' of wrongdoing. Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades, members of the Qatar and Australia 2022 bid teams respectively and key whistleblowers in the original corruption allegations, register separate complaints against Eckert claiming his report breached promises of confidentiality. Almajid's statement labels Eckert's report 'a crude, cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials I provided the investigation'. Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein urges European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform - including Sepp Blatter not standing for re-election as president. NOVEMBER 18 . FIFA lodges a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general over 'possible misconduct' by individuals in connection with the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The move follows a recommendation by FIFA's ethics judge Eckert as part of his findings into the Garcia investigation on World Cup bidding. FIFA president Blatter has insisted however that the lodging of the criminal complaint does not affect Eckert's statement last week that the investigation into the bidding process for the two World Cups is concluded.

"John Daly has rubbished the formation of a task force to examine ways of improving the dire recent run of the US Ryder Cup team, urging his country to appoint Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson as player-captain. Daly, winner of the 1995 British Open and 1991 US PGA Championship, has never played in the biennial team event but said it was 'not rocket science' to work out why Europe had won eight of the last 10 editions. 'I don't know where they are going with a task force,' the 48-year-old said after posting a three-under-par 69 in the opening round of the £4.5million Turkish Airlines Open on Thursday. Phil Mickelson (centre) was part of the US team which were easily beaten at Gleneagles . Tiger Woods should be considered as a player-captain at Hazeltine in 2016, says John Daly . 'They should just go ahead and pick a captain. My view is that Phil Mickelson should be the next captain and play at Hazeltine. 'He knows everything about the Ryder Cup so maybe it should be him or Tiger who should be the next captain. We've had playing captains over the years so why not in 2016?'. The PGA of America announced the formation of the task force, which includes Mickelson and Woods, after Tom Watson's side lost to Paul McGinley's Europe by 16-1/2 points to 11-1/2 in Scotland in September. The job of the 11-man group is to examine 'the entire Ryder Cup process' including the selection of the captain and the points qualifying system. 'If they picked Phil he would have full team respect,' said Daly. 'It's not rocket science why the European team has been winning, it doesn't need a task force to work it out.' Paul McGinley (third right) and Europe celebrate their big win in Scotland in September . Daly is a two-time major winner but the American big hitter has never played in the Ryder Cup . Mickelson launched a stinging attack on captain Watson's performance at Gleneagles, saying he was particularly frustrated at how little input the players had behind the scenes that week. Colin Montgomerie, Europe's triumphant Ryder Cup skipper in Wales in 2010, has also criticised the setting up of the task force. 'I don't think it's necessary,' said the 51-year-old Scot. 'I just see someone getting the team to play as a team. 'The last Ryder Cup was a lot closer than you would imagine. There were four matches on the last day at Gleneagles that went the European way and might not have done - and it would have changed the whole scene.'","John Daly has called on Phil Mickelson to be next US Ryder Cup captain .

"Thierry Henry believes Arsenal fans demand a lot from the Gunners because of the standard Arsene Wenger has set himself during his time at the club. The 37-year-old, who spent eight seasons playing under Wenger, said his fellow countryman has transformed Arsenal for the better, despite having not won the league in ten years. 'For me, it's a no brainer,' he said speaking to BBC's Football Focus. 'Was Arsenal successful before? Yes, they were, but in a different way. Thierry Henry says Arsene Wenger deserves praise for transforming Arsenal into playing attractive football . Henry believes Gunners' fans expect so much of Arsenal because of the standard Wenger set himself . Henry won seven trophies in eight years working under Wenger in north London . 'Now Arsenal is recognised for the type of football they play, and that is all down to him.' Henry believes the success that saw him win seven trophies during his time in North London has lead the fans to demand so much from Wenger and his team. He said: 'When you give people a lot, they get used to it and they just expect and demand [a lot], and rightly so, because when you are at a club like Arsenal people expect and want you to win.' The Arsenal legend believes that Wenger's current crop is capable of winning the Premier League title but sees Jose Mourinho's Chelsea as a large obstacle to overcome. 'They do have a squad to win the league,' he said. 'But they are nine points behind Chelsea and somehow you are going to have to make sure you can grab somewhere those points, hoping Chelsea is going to lose somewhere.' Arsenal haven't won the Premier League in ten years when Henry was a part of the side . The Frenchman believes, however, that Wenger's current crop are capable of winning the title .

"FIFA ran a 'Wild West' bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups which encouraged would-be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour, former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson has said. The world governing body is firmly under the spotlight again following the release of a report on Thursday by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee which cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments having found no serious breaches of bidding rules by either nation. However, the man who led the investigation on which that report was based, American lawyer Michael Garcia, immediately appealed against the findings of the published report, saying it contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' detailed in his own report - which has not been made public. The bidding process that led to Qatar being awarded the 2018 World Cup has been likened to the 'Wild West' Investigator Michael Garcia (L) and FIFA ethics committee chairman Hans-Joachim Eckert - pictured together in 2012 - have different interpretations of the report into the bidding process . While Russia and Qatar were effectively cleared in the report published by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the England 2018 bid team was criticised for a number of rule violations, particularly in how it sought to secure the votes controlled by former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner. The Sunday Times has reported that Qatari national Mohammed Bin Hammam sought to strike a vote-sharing deal with an England bid official. Bin Hammam was banned from all football activity for life in 2011 after being found guilty of bribery during his campaign to oust Sepp Blatter as FIFA president, but the Qatar 2022 bid team has always insisted that he never had any official role in its organisation. Qatar 2022 and the joint Spain-Portugal 2018 bid teams have always strenuously denied collusion over the sharing of votes, and no evidence of this was presented in Eckert's report. Robertson, who was appointed as Minister for Sport in the months leading up to the decision to award the World Cup to Russia and Qatar in December 2010, said it very quickly became clear to him that the process was flawed. World football governing body FIFA have cleared both Qatar and Russia of any rule breaches . FIFA president Sepp Blatter hands over the World Cup trophy to Qatar's Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani . He told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'The problem here is that the FIFA rules were not at all clear. I asked the question when I became sports minister about what we were and were not allowed to do, and one of (the England 2018 bid team) said, and I quote exactly: 'There are no rules, it is a Wild West of a bidding process.'' Robertson claimed the violations by England 2018 detailed by Eckert - which included helping to secure employment for an associate of Warner and covering the costs of a £35,000 gala dinner for Caribbean Football Union officials - were 'minor infractions' compared to other things he believes were going on. 'Being British we've been quite honest about what we did and I suspect quite a lot of other bidding nations haven't been honest,' he added. 'You come back to the central point in all this - the 2018 bid team did not think they had done anything wrong. Andy Anson who was leading the bid is a man of enormous integrity and honesty.' Former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson says he was told there were 'no rules' to the bidding process . Robertson backed calls for Garcia's report to be published in full, adding: '(Publishing the report) is the only possible way that FIFA can start to regain its reputation. It has no reputation at all - the words 'FIFA' and 'corruption' are inextricably linked. 'The only way they could start to repair their reputation would be to publish that report in full, to shine a light into dark places. 'But I think the chances of that happening are fairly limited, unless Michael Garcia decides the damage to his professional reputation is so great that he redacts those bits where he's made commitments to people and then releases it unilaterally, I think that's probably our best hope.'","FIFA have been investigated for the bidding process that led to Qatar and Russia hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively .

"Click here for Grand Final match report by Martha Kelner . Wigan prop Ben Flower was sent off after just two minutes of Saturday's Grand Final for a shocking attack on St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia. Wales international Flower had spilled the ball with a try beckoning in the opening minute and seconds later he lost his head. Flower appeared to take exception to stand-off Lance Hohaia's use of a forearm on him during a Wigan attack and reacted by knocking him to the ground with a left hook.

Wales international Flower then followed up by landing a right hook on the stricken Hohaia . Hohaia was left bruised and dazed and taken to the dressing room for treatment at Old Trafford . The former Crusaders forward then struck his defenceless opponent with a second punch to his face while he laid motionless on the turf. Referee Phil Bentham had no choice but to brandish a red card and Flower became the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final. St Helens went on to win the showpiece 14-6 thanks to second-half tries from Tommy Makinson and Sia Soliola. For a time Flower was the top-trending topic on Twitter in the United Kingdom and he looks certain to be the talking point for some time to come. Hohaia was helped from the field badly dazed, only to return after the final hooter to help his team-mates celebrate their famous 14-6 victory. A Rugby Football League spokesman said it would be up to Hohaia and St Helens to decide whether to pursue action outside the game's jurisdiction, otherwise the case would go as normal before the match-review panel on Monday.

Michael Owen and Joey Barton, both fans of the 13-man game, condemned the Wigan man, and former England rugby union hooker Brian Moore suggested the second punch thrown by Flower was 'unforgivable'. QPR midfielder Barton suggested Flower and Hohaia should have resolved their differences 'over a gingerbread latte and a philosophy discussion'. He wrote on Twitter that the punches Flower launched after two minutes of the Old Trafford showpiece were 'madness', before moderating his initial verdict. 'Actually feel a bit sorry for Ben Flower,' Barton wrote on Twitter. 'Lance started it with his elbow. Superb 1st dig from Flower. 2nd when he's KO'd is out of order.' He added across a number of messages: 'In my eyes if you go round throwing digs and you get put a sleep, you get minimal sympathy. Its not draughts after all. £SuperLeague.

Owen, the former Liverpool and England striker, wrote: 'Can you imagine the outcry if a footballer did that?' He added: 'Can sort of understand the first punch after being provoked but to hit someone again when they are already out cold is hard to understand.' Moore, no stranger to physical combat at the heart of rugby union scrums, stressed Flower had overstepped the mark. The 52-year-old wrote: 'Ben Flower - his first punch was retaliation for a cheap shot on him; second one was unforgiveable (sic).

"FIFA are diseased and corrupt. These monsters always get away with it... Two whistleblowers who gave extensive evidence to FIFA's corruption probe into bidding for 2018 and 2022 World Cups have hit back at the whitewash findings presented last week - and reveal their anger at how the report portrays them. The two former bid insiders, Bonita Mersiades from Australia 2022 and Phaedra Almajid from Qatar 2022, exclusively tell The Mail on Sunday about being branded unreliable - despite their information being apparently largely accepted by lawyer Michael Garcia, who undertook the probe. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that campaigning MP Damian Collins has invited both women to Parliament to share their experience and has invited them to help him arrange a FIFA reform conference in Brussels in January. They have accepted. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the hosts for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 . 'Both Bonita Mersiades and Phaedra Almajid are strong, credible women who have had the guts and determination to stand up for what they believe is right,' Collins said. 'People have tried to smear them and discredit them. But they are knowledgeable people and they need to be heard. FIFA clearly does not want to listen.'

"The Football Association will meet supporters’ groups before England play the Republic of Ireland next year to reinforce messages about offensive chanting after anti-IRA songs during the Scotland game. The England band caused a storm on Tuesday night when they played the tune while supporters sang: 'F*** the IRA' inside Celtic Park. Roy Hodgson apologised on behalf of the FA after the friendly international won 3-1 by England, and the band have also apologised and issued an explanation, claiming they were unaware the words to a popular song had been changed for the occasion. Three Lions fans show their support for the England players during their side's friendly clash against Scotland - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . 5,000 England fans made the trip across the border and the Three Lions gave them plenty of reasons to cheer - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . England fans were in buoyant mood before Tuesday's friendly match at Celtic Park -  there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . Celtic is a club with strong catholic links and Irish connections and the episode triggered alarm ahead of England’s first game in Dublin since February 1995, when a game at Lansdowne Road had to be abandoned due to rioting by English fans in the stands. The FA have followed up Hodgson’s comments with an official apology in a statement from a spokesman on Wednesday. 'We apologise for any offence caused by a section of the England support at the match with Scotland,' said a spokesman. 'The FA does not condone inappropriate and offensive chanting and intends to meet with supporters’ groups to discuss the wider issues. 'We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective. 'With regard to the supporters’ band, there was contact during the match once the situation became clear. This is consistent with regular dialogue that takes place between the band and The FA. 'In also apologising, the band have given an explanation and confirmed they in no way endorse the chanting that occurred.' The England supporters' band, pictured in Ukraine at Euro 2012, were told to stop playing by a FA official . England are due to play in Dublin on June 7, next year, a preparation friendly ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia, seven days later. The two nations met at Wembley in May last year. More than 80,000 watched a 1-1 draw in a friendly and respectful atmosphere which offers encouragement ahead of the trip across the Irish Sea. The FA will reinforce the same messages of respect when they meet the supporters’ groups but England’s away support has a very different demographic to those who attend games at Wembley, with a hardcore of fans who have followed the team overseas for many years. Ultimately, supporters can sing what they want. Many England fans insert 'No Surrender' into the national anthem, which is also considered to be aimed at the IRA. Wayne Rooney salutes the travelling support after leading his side to a 3-1 victory against Scotland . England boss Roy Hodgson apologised on behalf of his fans who were chanting anti-IRA songs . At least the band have promised not to supply the tunes any more for songs which can be turned into politically offensive messages, as they unwittingly did in Scotland. The band is made up of independent supporters, who pay their own way. They are not sponsored by the FA, although there is a relationship. The FA have helped the band overcome problems in the past when they turn up at grounds in different countries to be told they cannot take instruments through the turnstiles. In Scotland, the FA were able to get a message through to the band to change their tune, which they did.","Some fans hijacked England band's tune to sing anti-IRA song against Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday night .

"In the wake of Danny Welbeck’s cut-price £16million move to Arsenal, Gary Neville just could not get his head around the logic of Manchester United’s decision to offload the England striker. ‘How have Arsenal got him for £16m?’ wondered his former team-mate. ‘I can’t work it out. I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways.’ Nearly three months on, we’re still searching for answers. Danny Welbeck sealed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . Welbeck scored his first Arsenal hat-trick during their 4-1 against Galatasaray in October . Welbeck (left) scores his first Arsenal goal, away at Aston Villa in September . Louis van Gaal attempted to justify the deadline-day sale by comparing the records of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie to the academy graduate, the boyhood fan who had trained with Ruud van Nistelrooy as an 12-year-old and seemed set for a career-long stay at Old Trafford. The Dutchman, of course, had a point; Welbeck’s 10 goals in two years a meagre return compared to the 38 of Van Persie and 29 of Rooney. But history is just that, history. Welbeck, at the Emirates and with England, has set about writing a new chapter in new surrounds. Already this season he has 10 goals for club and country – Rooney has nine, Van Persie, five. Falcao – the man signed to replace Welbeck – has one solitary strike. An 12-year-old Welbeck (right) trains with United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2003 . Gary Neville (right) doesn't believe Mancester United should have allowed Welbeck to leave . Welbeck has scored 10 goals for club and country since completing his Arsenal move in the summer . But Welbeck is about more than goals, shown by his performance during England’s 3-1 win over Scotland on Tuesday. There he was about graft as well as craft, an indefatigable presence with a willingness to work and worry the opposition backline. This weekend it is his former employers who should sound caution. On Saturday tea-time Welbeck has the chance to heap yet more misery on the man who let him go. The 23-year-old comes up against a defence – in the loosest sense – who have shipped 13 goals on the road this season. Radamel Falcao has scored just one Premier League goal since joining the Old Trafford club . Welbeck decided to cut his United career short after a lack of opportunities at centre forward . Welbeck (right) often found himself on the bench at Old Trafford or was told to play on the wing . Welbeck, better than anyone, will know their weaknesses. But even without insider know-how, United’s shortcomings are no secret. They are limping by, somehow trailing the Gunners by just one point and one place ahead of their showdown in north London. In their last four they have scraped late points against West Brom and Chelsea, gone down to defeat in the derby at their city rivals and recorded an unconvincing – but much-needed – 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace. And Welbeck, of course, has a point to prove. He had never agitated for a move away from United. On the contrary, he kept his silence amid prolonged deployment in an unfavoured wide role. The 23-year-old adds an impressive work rate to Arsenal's starting line-up . Louis van Gaal has a number of injury worries ahead of United's visit to Arsenal on Saturday . Van Gaal tried to justify Welbeck's sale by comparing the records of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie . From that domain they deemed his record not comparable to those populating the penalty area – what did they expect? Now, at Arsenal, he is taking centre stage. And so it is that observers such as Neville continue to be baffled by United’s decision to let Welbeck go – to a top-four rival, no less - without ever knowing how good he could have been. On Saturday, they might just find out.","Danny Welbeck set to face old club Manchester United on Saturday .

"Federico Fazio believes Tottenham have the players at their disposal to challenge for the title - but only if they can operate as a unit. The 27-year-old Argentina international moved to White Hart Lane in the summer but, like many new faces at Spurs over the last 18 months, he has struggled to make an impact. Having already picked up two red cards in just nine first-team outings, Fazio is yet to show the type of form which saw him at the heart of the Sevilla team that won the Europa League last season. Federico Fazio has struggled to make an impact since joining Tottenham in the summer . Mauricio Pochettino's tenure at Tottenham has not started well, with the former Southampton boss seeing his side lose four of their six Barclays Premier League home games so far this campaign. Despite their stuttering start, as well as the uncertainty over the future of the ownership, new stadium and chairman Daniel Levy, Fazio feels the sheer talent can shine through. The defender disagreed with Emmanuel Adebayor that the club's supporters had to stop showing their dissatisfaction and has instead urged the players to gel together and turn their form around. 'I think at Tottenham we have very good players who can fight for first position in the Premier League,' he said. Fazio played in Argentina's 2-1 win over Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday . 'We can fight for the Champions League and the Europa League. But we need to improve like a team, to be like a team because I think we have got very good players. 'I think this (fan's jeering the players) is not the problem. We need to play like a team on the pitch. I think that we have very good players, good enough to be higher in the Premier League. 'There have only been 10 or 11 matches. We need to improve some things but I think we will stay in the top positions of the Premier League.' Fazio played in Argentina's 2-1 win over Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday evening, operating alongside Sunderland's Santiago Vergini in the centre of Gerardo Martino's defence. Mauricio Pochettino's tenure at Tottenham has not started well with four home defeats from six games . A deflected Cristian Ansaldi strike and a Lionel Messi penalty saw Argentina come from behind to win their friendly, with a trip to face Portugal at Old Trafford next up for Martino's side. Fazio enjoyed his outing and is keen to keep club woes out of his mind as he looks to add to his three senior caps at the home of Manchester United on Tuesday. 'I was happy to give a good performance in this friendly match,' he added. 'The most important thing was to win for Argentina. We need to win all of our matches and I am very happy for this. 'I'm with the national team and so I only think about Argentina. About the national team. We did very well in this match and I am very happy for this.'","Federico Fazio believes Tottenham have the players to challenge for title .

"Jack Wilshere has asked Arsene Wenger about the possibility of playing in a deeper midfield role for Arsenal. Wilshere’s performances have improved rapidly since he was first deployed by England directly in front of the defence against Switzerland in September. Wenger, however, prefers to use the 22-year-old in more advanced positions, where his vision and quick passes can create chances, and is reluctant to make a change. Jack Wilshere is keen to play deeper in the midfield for Arsenal, where he's been deployed for England . Wilshere's impressed in the holding midfield role though Arsene Wenger prefers him feeding the strikers . ‘I wouldn’t mind playing there for Arsenal,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’ve already spoken to the manager about it and he doesn’t see me playing that holding role just yet. That’s his decision. 'At the moment Mikel Arteta is injured and Mathieu Flamini is playing that role. It’s down to him. ‘This is probably the best I’ve played for England and I’m enjoying it. I said after the first game against Switzerland that I’d only get better. It was my first game in that role. The main thing is the coaches are getting their points across.’ The 22-year-old says he's played his best games for England in the position . After first playing in front of the defenders against Switzerland, Wilshere's only improved . Wilshere was voted man of the match against Slovenia on Saturday and then produced a wonderful pass on Tuesday to create the opening goal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in England’s 3-1 win in Scotland. It was his first England assist, although Wilshere claims Wayne Rooney is also at fault for this. He said: ‘If that’s true, I’ve got Wazza to blame because against Estonia he could’ve had six.’ Mikel Areteta (left) and Mathieu Flamini (right) are preferred to Wilshere in the pivotal holding role . Meanwhile, Wilshere’s Arsenal team-mate Lukas Podolski has been warned his international future may be in jeopardy if he doesn’t quit the club in January. The forward has hardly featured for the Gunners this season and Germany boss Joachim Low has said the 29-year-old’s place in his country’s squad will come under threat if he isn’t playing regularly.

"Manchester United haven't made a flying start to life under Louis van Gaal, but that hasn't stopped some of his players from attempting to soar high. Judged by club vice-captain Darren Fletcher, nine of his Red Devils team-mates - including Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick - took part in a three-minute painting challenge where they had to replicate the look of a toy model Russian Aeroflot plane.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from Celtic Park. Wayne Rooney played down moving clear of Jimmy Greaves and into third by himself in the England all-time scoring charts - but admitted he would be 'delighted' to eventually break Sir Bobby Charlton's record. And on a night when Rooney bagged a brace in the Three Lions' 3-1 victory over rivals Scotland at Celtic Park, Gary Lineker enjoyed having a bit of fun with the England striker. Lineker - who is second in the scoring charts with 48, one behind Sir Bobby - tweeted throughout the match, joking that it was 'c**p' to be second in the list of England scorers.

He told ITV: 'I'm just enjoying my football at the minute. I've always loved playing for England. I hope that continues and if that means beating the record I'll be delighted.' And, speaking on Sky Sports, Rooney said: 'I'm just happy to score goals for England and it's a special night for me to score goals at Celtic Park.' Yet, when Rooney scored his first goal, former Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur striker Lineker tweeted: 'Yes! Get in there, just 4 to go @WayneRooney. It's c**p being second anyway.'

The striker (centre) runs off with his arms out wide after heading in England's second goal at Celtic Park .

"England defeated Scotland 3-1 on Tuesday night's 'friendly' at Celtic Park thanks to headers in each half from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wayne Rooney, who then finished his second to snuff out an Andrew Robertson-led fight back from the hosts. Sportsmail's Rob Draper soaked up the atmosphere in Glasgow. Alf Ramsey’s famous line – ‘Welcome to Scotland? You must be f******  joking!’ – looked a little anachronistic when the England coach arrived. There were a few pantomime boos but Roy Hodgson emerged beaming alongside Wayne Rooney and a small crowed attempting to abuse the England captain got little encouragement from their peers. England captain Wayne Rooney and coach Roy Hodgson arrive at Celtic Park to some pantomime boos . Hodgson holds a bottle of Scotch whisky as he shares a laugh with a Scotland fan ahead of the match . Things got a little feistier inside Celtic Park, where the pre-match parade of flags saw the St George’s cross predictably booed, prompting one flag bearer – presumably English - to make a friendly gesture to the crowd which might have been a V for victory sign. And the PA’s pleas for respect for both anthems to be respected ‘especially England’s’ was, shall we say, not strictly adhered to. Things got feistier once inside Celtic Park with England's St George's cross getting a hostile reception . A shirtless fan sings with gusto in the stands in Glasgow as England faced Scotland . The England fans appeared to have confused the venue – that of Celtic Park, with its Irish connections – with the team they were playing against. They spent a good part of the first half singing a song about their opposition to the IRA – enthusiastically accompanied by their official band – to the apparent bemusement of most Scotland fans. England fans sang about their opposition to the IRA at Celtic Park to the bemusement of the Scots . Stewards attempt to round up a pitch invader wearing a kilt and Scotland shirt . Pre-match entertainment rarely strays beyond the banal and the cliche. But at least The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) injected a little life into proceedings and it was a cut above Wembley’s standard fare of Football’s Coming Home. That said, manufactured ‘atmosphere’ remains an anathema compared to the real thing. Former England managers never disappear. They can be relied upon to re-emerge abroad with a lucrative contract and Sven Goran Eriksson was unveiled as the new coach of Shanghai East Asia on a reported £3.8m-a-year contract that puts him among the top earners in football management.

"The atmosphere was as expected and so was this Scotland team. The Battle of Britain was a game too far for Gordon Strachan’s men. Credit to Scotland’s supporters because the intensity, the wall of noise predicted by Roy Hodgson was mighty impressive before England took control. Scotland are a mediocre team. Celtic Park is a magnificent sporting cathedral and the mood was passionate and partisan, which is just the way we like it.

When Scotland’s supporters stood on their feet for the unofficial terrace anthem - I'm Gonna Be (500 miles) by the Proclaimers - it was spine-tingling. Every fan inside this grand old stadium was on their feet, belting it out as they waited for the teams to emerge from the tunnel. When they did, this fabulous place stirred again when the bagpipe players began to hum Flower of Scotland. Their tails were up and rightly so after Shaun Maloney’s magnificent goal against the Republic of Ireland last Friday had sent 50,000 kilts home happy. You just knew what a goal against England would do to this place, but no amount of singing can turn Scotland into a decent football team. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring before the break to put England in the driving seat . Wayne Rooney's second-half header gave England a cushion their dominance deserved . How Wembley, the dreary concrete bowl constructed in west London seven years ago, could do with a good dose of this before England play their next match there in March. They are regenerating the surrounding areas, so why not sort out the stadium acoustics a go, too? Something must be done because the supporters of both these teams reminded us what a football stadium should sound like on a big match night. At times, the place crackled with excitement. There was a boo for everything: England flag transported across the pitch. Boo. Fraser Forster’s name read out. Boo. Nathaniel Clyne. Boo. Luke Shaw. Boo. And so it went on. It was old school, blood and thunder and a reminder of the days when these two slugged it out for pride and honour at the end of every season on a churned up pitch at Wembley or Hampden Park. Scottish fans hoist the Saltire, complete with 'Yes', aloft and bellow out a ditty . 5,000 England fans made the trip across the border and the Three Lions gave them plenty of reasons to cheer . Quite what this means for England - other than a sixth successive victory following the World Cup disaster - is a different matter. There were moments of forced patriotism, such as the sight of England’s assistant manager Ray Lewington stalking the technical area and appealing for calm. It was rough, rather than refined. Perhaps Lewington remembers Graeme Souness and Bryan Robson ripping each other’s heads off when Scotland beat England 1-0 at Hampden Park way back in 1985. There was the odd skirmish here, but the modern player has a different constitution. There is a bit of back chat and then they agree to swap shirts at the end of the game. All very convivial. At times there some pedantic squabbles, but no-one left the pitch with stud marks raked down their thigh or a bloodied nose after this largely one-sided clash. No-one’s socks were cut to ribbons, either. There was a bit of afters when Danny Welbeck got sick and tired of Scotland right-back Steven Whittaker nibbling away at his ankles in a feisty opening spell. Steven Whittaker gets to grips with Danny Welbeck with tempers flaring between the warring duo . Welbeck gets his own back and a referee's assistant had to stand between the pair (above) Wayne Rooney, sensational throughout, showed his colours when he bawled out his team-mate Jack Wilshere for a careless pass long before England took control. To say England controlled the tempo or ever looked entirely comfortable would be stretching the imagination, but they certainly played in bursts. Scotland boasted just two players - goalscorer Andrew Robertson (Hull) and Steven Naismith (Everton) - from the Barclays Premier League. The rest are Championship players and they looked like it, too. This is a unique fixture, a game that has fallen off the international radar in recent times because of the sheer number of qualifying games and reciprocal arrangements with opposition teams over friendly fixtures. It means Scotland, who were courageous and honest, will probably have to wait a while again England can find a date for them in their congested fixture list.

Scotland's James Morrison (centre)  is closed down by Jack Wilshere (left) and James Milner . Strachan’s side were beaten 3-2 at Wembley last August but this defeat, courtesy of goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and two from Wayne Rooney - felt terminal. There is a huge gulf and that is saying something because this England team is not operating at anything like the level of world champions Germany. By the time Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson blew the final whistle, the stands at Celtic Park had emptied. This was England’s night. They rushed over to the travelling England fans at the final whistle, saluting them after emerging with their reputations enhanced after this victory. All they can do is to beat the opposition put in front of them and they are certainly doing that after travelling north of the border to beat Strachan’s side. The only disappointment is that they couldn’t take this unrivalled atmosphere back with them.","England did not freeze in the intense cauldron of Celtic Park .

"Wayne Rooney is just four goals away from claiming Sir Bobby Charlton's crown as England's all-time top scorer after finding the net twice during Tuesday's 3-1 victory against Scotland. However, the debate over whether the Three Lions frontman is a 'football great' continues to rage on. Whether or not the Manchester United star compares to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Sportsmail duo Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher insist Rooney is  heavily relied upon by England. Wayne Rooney's double means he is three goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England record . Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp insist Rooney is an integral part of the England set-up . Speaking to Sky Sports, Redknapp said: 'When we talk about big-game players we talk about Wayne Rooney and that's what he is. 'When we needed him most tonight he was the one who came up with the goals. There should never be a point where he can be dropped in his England career, he needs to be in that side. It's between Welbeck and Sturridge who plays beside him.’ Carragher, not convinced Rooney is up there with the very best, added: 'Of course he's an England great. He's going to be our greatest goalscorer. Is he a world great, is he a Messi or Ronaldo? No he's not. But he's an England great. The former Liverpool defender, who himself earned 38 international caps, insists Rooney is an integral part of Roy Hodgson's side and said: 'He should always be in the England team, it's nonsense to say he shouldn't.

"It ended as it started, in celebratory mood. At times, it might have seemed like a lacklustre party full of curmudgeons and killjoys refusing to enter into the spirit. But eventually the guests did get into the swing of things to produce an evening of lukewarm revelry, even if they had to be prodded into action.

And they completely disrupted the running order when they took the lead though that at least sparked England into some action, with Rooney himself was forced to take the initiative, winning and converting a penalty before Danny Welbeck’s two goals put the game out of Slovenia’s reach and ensure that England’s steady march to Euro 2016 continues unimpeded and that Rooney would at least end the game happily. ‘It was a wonderful evening for him,’ said his manager Roy Hodgson afterwards. ‘It must have been special to have the cap presented by Sir Bobby Charlton. And then to give a good performance and cap that by scoring the important first goal. It put us right back in the game after their goal against the run of play - but we were good value for our victory and good value for our three goals.’ They were by the end. But after a dreadful first half, you did rather wonder whether anyone was in the mood to celebrate. It certainly wasn’t a stage fit for international royalty. The pitch looked an utter mess after the NFL series of matches. It could not explain England’s first-half performance, allowing the game to be played at a pace which suited Slovenia. Possession is all well and good, but means little without intent. England had settled for the safety of the sideways pass . There were occasional flurries of quality. A pass here, a run there; they always ended with a woeful finish or a poor final ball. Their best early moment came on 21 minutes when Jack Wilshere looked up and picked out Danny Welbeck with a raking, lofted ball from deep. He chested the ball down perfectly for Wayne Rooney, but the centurion shot wildly high and wide. Katanec, who guided his nation to major tournaments in 2000 and 2002, had a clear game plan and his players did not waver early on. Yet they were no innocents abroad; Alex Mertelj crunched into Adam Lallana and later Bostjan Cesar gave the Liverpool player a sly elbow in the face, before proffering apologies. A red card would not have been amiss . That said, England’s willingness to collude with Slovenian needs was depressing. They simply could not create any intensity. Indeed, Milivoje Novakovic went close heading wide from a corner and Slovenia most worrisome first-half moment came when Jasmin Kurtic attempted an unnecessary back pass which had goalkeeper Samir Handanovic scrambling. At least that gave the Wembley crowd something to cheer. There had been precious little else, so their reaction at half time was extraordinarily benign: a rippling of applause. Better performances than this have seen England subjected to a cascade of boos: either crowds have grown up, or expectations have been managed down.

There is more flexibility about this team. ‘We had two systems of play up our sleeves because we didn't know how the pitch would play,’ said Hodgson. ‘Welbeck went slightly wider, Raheem sent slightly wider, we kept our three in the middle, and it worked well. Danny Welbeck profited strongly from that and we saw a better Raheem Sterling.’ Indeed they did but not before Slovenia had startled England on 56 minutes. Andraz Kim sent in a superb curling crossed free kick. Jordan Henderson rose to make an impact but unfortunately ended up flicking an arching header over his own goalkeeper to score: a striker could not have been more proud. Slovenia though were undone by their own stupidity, retaining their lead for less than a minute. Rooney seemed ready to them on all alone. Fed by Wilshere, he burst into the box, causing consternation, though in reality, he was heading nowhere dangerous when Cesar panicked and felled him. A penalty awarded, Wembley chanted for their 100-cap man and he did not disappoint, fairly blasting the spot kick into the corner to the right of Handanovic, who, to his enormous credit, got a strong hand to it. In scoring, Rooney moved on to 44 England goals, level with Jimmy Greaves. England were a good deal more comfortable on 66 minutes when Lallana executed a lovely turn to engineer a cross which was deflected by Cesar into goalkeeper Handanovic, forcing him to clear unsatisfactorily. The ball was eventually headed out to Welbeck who, despite falling backwards and being unable to make clean contact, did enough to direct it through a crowded penalty area to make it 2-1. The game finally slipped away from Slovenia on 74 minutes, when Sterling and Welbeck exchanged passes with the Arsenal man left to take a touch and drive a clean finish past Handanovic for 3-1, his fifth goal for England in four games.

"Roy Hodgson claimed the England captaincy has turned Wayne Rooney into the finished article after he struck twice in a 3-1 victory over Scotland. Rooney’s masterful performance was the difference as England finished the year on a high at Celtic Park by recording their sixth successive victory.

There were injury scares for Luke Shaw (groin) and Danny Welbeck (hamstring), but Hodgson claimed the pair would be fit for the Arsenal-Manchester United clash at the Emirates on Saturday evening. Hodgson said: ‘It has been a good three or four days for him. Slovenia was a great occasion, he has added to that. We knew Scotland would be a hard place to come and win. ‘I can’t speak for Wayne but if you ask me they should be very important. ‘Records are very important and if he carries on this way he will soon be on the top of the list. He has a record number of caps in sight and if he keeps his form and fitness he will get here. He won’t retire from football. ‘In the last two years he has not become a worse player and his game is improving all the time. ‘He takes responsibility, everything will be about the two goals. There was a lot of other positive points to his game, I would like to think he is better but I am wary as a coach of putting too much responsibility on his shoulders.’ Roy Hodgson makes his point to his two-goal skipper during England's sixth consecutive win . Both sets of fans contributed to a bristling atmosphere as the Auld Enemies contested a fine game . Hodgson claimed he did not hear England fans singing anti-IRA songs during a 15 minute spell in the first half, but admitted he did not condone it. He added: ‘I was aware that the crowd was tremendously supportive and I even heard one about Gordon Strachan but of course I don’t condone the chanting.’ Hodgson’s side were comfortable winners here and he claims the team are continuing to learn from their World Cup experience. He added: ‘I can't think of many periods in the game where we were losing control. Our defending was sharp and when we lost the ball. ‘I don’t know that they needed to prove to me that they are real men, this is a goldfish bowl under the magnifying glass. There were some good individual performances. ‘If you watch the game against Slovenia, we played the same intensity, that is what we are trying to do. There was a moment when we lost it for a few minutes. Rooney's double means he is three goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England record .

But to deal with this game is difficult and we have to deal with it. We have let ourselves down. ‘We know we can play better but we have to be at our maximum against top teams.

"The company that was due to make the scratchproof sapphire glass screen for the Apple Watch it still in crisis and may be forced to shut down, it has been revealed. GT Advanced Technologies, a former stock market darling and supplier to Apple, . filed for bankruptcy on Oct 6 in a stunning turn of events for a . company whose fortunes looked bright only a few months ago. Apple said on Thursday that GT's 'ambitious' vision of sapphire . manufacturing was ultimately not quite ready for primetime. Apple's Watch uses a sapphire glass screen - but the firm that makes it may have to shut down . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. Few details have emerged since the bankruptcy filing, which . wiped out most of GT's market value and triggered speculation . over what may have soured its relationship with Apple. But on Thursday, Apple, which had backed the development . with GT of a sapphire-manufacturing plant in Arizona, said it . will keep an eye on GT's advances, holding open the possibility . of doing business with it in future. 'Apple put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire . manufacturing process with GTAT which is not ready for . production. 'We're going to continue evaluating GTAT's progress . on larger sapphire boule development, as well as consider other . options for the facility,' spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said, . referring to raw cylinders of the material. At the heart of GT's bankruptcy filing was a deal struck . with Apple in November 2013. GT Advanced was to have used the . Arizona plant to make scratch-resistant sapphire exclusively for . Apple. That sapphire was to have eventually found its way into . future mobile devices, such as iPhones - where it's already in . use in their fingerprint sensors - or the upcoming Apple Watch. On Thursday, GT said it will continue 'technical exchanges' with Apple on making larger, next-generation sapphire boules, . raw cylinders of the material that effectively increase capacity . and lower the unit cost of production. GT said it would expand . into boules of more than 165 kg, from the current 115 kg. On Thursday, GT Advanced also laid out the details of an . agreement struck and described in court on Tuesday. Apple CEO Tim Cook shows off the new iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch during an Apple special event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts on September 9. both products use sapphire glass - the watch for its screen, and the phone for its touch ID fingerprint sensor . Under that pact, GT will stop making sapphire materials for . now and focus on supplying equipment to make sapphire crystals. GT said it would be released from all exclusivity . obligations with Apple and a mechanism would be provided for the . iPhone maker to recover its $439 million pre-payment to the . company, without interest. At a hearing this week at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in . Springfield, Massachusetts, GT said the expected deal with Apple . would save money and allow it to be more open about its . mysterious Chapter 11 filing. GT said on Thursday it would wind down its sapphire . production factories in Mesa, Arizona and Salem, Massachusetts. It has laid off about 650 employees at the Mesa plant and . expects additional job cuts in Salem. GT will retain control of its intellectual property and will . be able to sell its sapphire fabrication technology without . restrictions, it said in a statement.","GT Advanced Technologies has been working with Apple on sapphire glass plant .

"Dinosaurs breathed through their noses to smell their surroundings and cool their brains, experts claim. They made their discovery after reconstructing how dinosaurs breathed for the first time. The study explains how the prehistoric creatures used their heavy, moist breaths to smell their surroundings and hints at why most of the land-roaming giants had long snouts. Dinosaurs breathed through their noses to smell their surroundings and cool their brains, experts claim. Scientists at Ohio University made a computer model (pictured) to show how air moved through the nasal passages of Cretaceous pachycephalosaurids or 'pachy' dinosaurs . Sixty five million years after they last drew their breath, 3D computer models of the inside of dinosaurs’ nostrils have revealed how air moved though their nasal passages. The research was based on the discovery of perfectly preserved soft tissues within the nasal cavities of the remains of Cretaceous pachycephalosaurids or ‘pachy’ - small plant-eating dinosaurs known for their thick bony skulls. CT scans of a Canadian pachy called Stegoceras gave scientists a glimpse of the internal structures in unprecedented detail, including the animals’s long narrow bones called turbinates in the back of the nose and a bony ridge in the front. The research team were struck at how the dinosaur had similar nasal structures to a modern day ostrich or alligator. ‘Dinosaurs were pretty ""nosy"" animals. Figuring out what’s going on in their complicated snouts is challenging because noses have so many different functions,’ Jason Bourke, a doctoral student at Ohio University, explained. ‘It doesn’t help all the delicate soft tissues rotted away millions of years ago.’ The experts looked to the creature’s modern-day relatives for clues, such as birds, crocodiles and lizards. The research was based on the discovery of perfectly preserved soft tissues within the nasal cavities of the remains of Cretaceous pachycephalosaurids or ‘pachy’ - small plant-eating dinosaurs known for their thick bony skulls. An illustration is pictured . Pachycephalosaurus means 'thick headed lizard' in Greek, because of their thick skulls, . Their skulls are up to 10 inches (25cm) thick to cushion their tiny brains. The rear of the dome has bony knobs and blunt spikes. It is thought they used their tough heads to fight each other, although this claim has been disputed. They were around 15ft (4.5 metres) long and weighed around 990lbs (450kg). The animals lived during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now North America. The dinosaurs ate mostly plants and moved on two legs. They were one of the last non-avian dinosaurs before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The new study sheds lights on how pachys breathed. Professor Lawrence Witmer said: ‘We did lots of dissections, blood-vessel injections and CT scanning - but a major new tool was 3D computer simulation of airflow.’ Mr Bourke used a branch of engineering called computational fluid dynamics to model and understand how air flowed through the noses of modern-day relatives of dinosaurs. ‘Once we got a handle on how animals today breathe, the tricky part was finding a good candidate among dinosaurs to test our methods, he said. The scientists decided on pachys and quickly found delicate scrolls of bone in the nasal region of one specimen from North Dakota, which were nasal turbinates. Similar structures were found in Stegoceras. The first nasal turbinates to be discovered in that species were in the back part of the nasal cavity, called the olfactory chamber, where smelling takes place. CT scans revealed that the olfactory region of the brain was quite large, which, along with the large olfactory turbinates, suggested that Stegoceras had a good sense of smell. But when Mr Bourke ran his airflow simulation analyses, the inspired air bypassed the olfactory chamber. ‘It made no sense,’ he said. ‘Stegoceras obviously had a pretty decent sense of smell, but the odours weren't reaching where they needed to go. We obviously were missing a piece of the puzzle.’ That missing puzzle piece was hinted at by a long bony ridge on the wall of the front of the nasal cavity. The scientists  quickly found delicate scrolls of bone in the nasal region of one specimen from North Dakota, which were nasal turbinates. Similar structures were found in Stegoceras. A stock image of a pachy skull is pictured . In the modern-day relatives of dinosaurs, cartilaginous nasal turbinates often attach to such ridges, suggesting to the team that pachys may have had turbinates in the front, respiratory part of the nasal cavity. When Bourke digitally inserted respiratory turbinates of different shapes- including the scrolled turbinate of a turkey and the branched turbinate of an ostrich - the computer airflow simulations started to make more sense. ‘Some of the restored airflow patterns now carried odours to the olfactory region,’ he said. ‘We don't really know what the exact shape of the respiratory turbinate was in Stegoceras, but we know some kind of baffle had to be there. ‘We have the smoking gun of the bony ridge on the fossil and the airflow analyses show that attaching some kind of turbinate produced the only airflow that made any real biological sense.’ The study suggests that pachys had turbinates not only to help them smell, but to cool their brains. Study co-author Ruger Porter, said: ‘The fossil evidence suggests that Stegoceras was basically similar to an ostrich or an alligator.’ ‘Hot arterial blood from the body was cooled as it passed over the respiratory turbinates, and then that cooled venous blood returned to the brain. It may not have been much of a brain, but you don't want it cooked!’ The team is now trying to work out how other dinosaurs breathed. The researchers were struck at how  similar the dinosaurs' nasal structures were to some modern day animals, such as the ostrich (pictured) or alligator .","Scientists made a computer model to show how air moved through nose .

"They shame the adult industry, teach sexual abstinence and warn against lustful thoughts. But the Bible Belt may have a hidden kinky side, according to a new study that claims the more Christian you are, the more likely you are to watch porn. Compared to their liberal counterparts, those who are religious use more search terms on Google considered to be pornographic, according to the research. the Bible Belt may have a kinky side, according to a new study that claims the more Christian you are, the more likely you are to watch porn . The study, by researchers at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, looked at two years of data from Google Trends from different states in the US. The study distinguishes between states that are identified as religiously conservative and those the politically conservative. The latter is more likely to look for sex specific terms, such as 'gay sex, free porn and xxx,' whereas those that consider themselves religious look for more generalised sex terms. 'Prominent political scandals and recent research suggest a paradoxical private attraction to sexual content on the political and religious right,' the researchers write in their study abstract. Canterbury Cathedral has blocked access to porn websites to keep worshippers from temptation . The church has long warned against indulging in the pleasures of the flesh. And now Canterbury Cathedral has blocked access to porn websites in a bid to keep worshippers from temptation. Managers at the cathedral have acted to deter people from visiting 'salacious' websites in its newly opened café. Canterbury Cathedral is worried that people might try and look at unsuitable sites on their laptops and smartphones over a slice of lemon drizzle cake after visiting the shrine of Thomas Beckett and saying a prayer or two . However, the world heritage site, which dates from the sixth century is keen to offer patrons of its coffee shop internet access. Christopher Robinson, a spokesman for the cathedral, told the : 'It's really a safeguarding process. What we wanted is to provide free Wi-Fi for members of the public, but we didn't want salacious or debasing sites being accessed.' Canterbury is not the only cathedral to make moves to stop people looking at hardcore pornography on its grounds. Chester Cathedral had to shut down its Wi-Fi network after it was found that patrons could pay homage to the naked human body in its coffee shop. 'Across two separate years, and controlling for demographic variables, we observed moderate-to-large positive associations between: greater proportions of state-level religiosity and general web searching for sexual content and greater proportions of state-level conservatism and image-specific searching for sex.' While this suggests religious people may indulge more in porn, there could be another explanation, the study authors claims. 'It is possible that liberal citizens living in states higher in religiosity or conservatism search more for sexual content due to living in a more sexually-restricted environment,' they wrote. In a separate study earlier this year, Homegrown Video revealed that about a third of all homemade sex tape submissions were created in the 'Bible Belt.' In a separate study earlier this year, Homegrown Video revealed that about a third of all homemade sex tape submissions were created in the 'Bible Belt' Meanwhile, California-based research group Barna, found that 64 per cent of Christian men and 15 per cent of Christian women admitted to viewing pornography at least once a month. These figures compared to 65 per cent of men and 30 per cent of women who identified as non-Christian and said they watched porn the same amount. Joel Hesch, president and founder of Prove Men Ministries, which commissioned the Barna study, said the results point to a frightening pattern of addiction. 'It needs to be openly addressed in the church, a safe place within the church,' Mr Hesch told Meredith Somers at The Washington Times. '[Pornography] is addicting. It is a problem not just affecting individuals, but families. 'The church needs to be the front-runner in this.

"In one corner, the mouthy puncher. In the other, the educated boxer. After three years of petty squabbling, cheap insults and idle threats, a line will finally be drawn under one of British boxing's most bitter of rivalries. When first Nathan Cleverly and then Tony Bellew clamber through the ropes, both men will finally be free to do what they crave most: hurt each other. Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon . Cleverly finds one of Bellew's taunts amusing as the pair had to be separated at the end of their weigh-in . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) was on hand to keep the pair apart as the taunts and jibes continued . Opinion remains split down the middle as to which will conquer. Repeat or revenge? This is the classic clash of the hard-hitting puncher against the skilled boxer. While the waters will be muddied when the inevitable red mist descends, Bellew's only chance of victory is surely the knockout. One he intends to be brutal. He says: 'I hope I don't put him out with one shot. I want it to be painful. After he's fought me he's not going to want to box any more.' Bellew, apparently rejuvenated at cruiserweight, has shown glimpses of why he was branded the 'Bomber' as an amateur with two stoppage victories this year. Cleverly and Bellew will be contesting the WBO and WBA cruiserweight titles . Bellew weighed-in a fraction under the 200lb limit for the cruiserweight division ahead of facing Cleverly . Cleverly received a hostile reception in Liverpool but remained focused at the weigh-in on Friday . Although Cleverly has followed suit, his foes were of a lower calibre. Indeed, as a world champion, he stopped just two of his six challengers. And in the first meeting in 2011 – a fight, incidentally that history has made much closer than the reality – it was Cleverly who out-boxed the more crude Bellew. And the Welshman says: 'A lot of people have him as the favourite because he’s the naturally bigger guy. 'I feel comfortable, strong, sharp and fit. I’ll beat this guy. I’ll bring the speed, I’ll bring the stamina. He can bring his power – I’ve already tested it and I’ve taken it with ease. Has he become this King Kong puncher overnight?' Both men stand at a crossroads but each is made from different fibres. Cleverly and Bellew square up after the press conference ahead of their fight . Cleverly taunts rival Tony Bellew ahead of their anticipated re-match in Liverpool . Cleverly and Bellew both look focused ahead of their fight in Liverpool this weekend . Bellew is a fighting man and knows little else; he insists he would fight for free. Cleverly, who won three major titles while studying maths at university, is less limited. The question mark hanging over him is his mentality. Does he have the heart for another war after being broken down piece by piece against Sergey Kovalev 15 months ago? Bellew insists not. He says: 'He will say anything to convince himself at this moment in time. He's probably telling himself he's going to knock me out, he's going to do this and that, but reality is striking home with him and it's striking home very quickly.' Cleverly is dismissive. Bellew soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales in front of the local Liverpool crowd . The Liverpool crowd was orchestrated by Bellew who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown . He says: 'I've got such a good academic brain and I could have a comfortable life outside boxing. I could turn my hand to many other things but its boxing I've decided to do and to stick to because I've worked too hard to just throw in the towel; I've come too far. 'I'm on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something I could never forgive so for me its about giving it another crack and going to get another world title. That's my goal and that's what I've set out to do.' These men pride themselves on being different but in reality share more than they care to admit. Neither can afford defeat. Both have changed trainer following heavy defeats. Both are almost two stone heavier than three years prior. But only one will achieve closure in front of a sold-out Echo Arena crowd. The puncher or the boxer? I predict the latter, a repeat performance from Cleverly. And heartbreak for Bellew.","Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew meet in Liverpool on Saturday night .

"It is an incredible image of oceans on another world. Nasa today released this incredible mosaic showing the sun glinting off polar seas on titan, one of Saturn's moons. This mirror-like reflection, known as the specular point, is in the south of Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare, just north of an island archipelago separating two separate parts of the sea. This near-infrared, color mosaic from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows the sun glinting off of Titan's north polar seas. This mirror-like reflection, known as the specular point, is in the south of Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare, just north of an island archipelago separating two separate parts of the sea. The near-infrared, color mosaic from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows the sun glinting off Titan's north polar seas. While Cassini has captured, separately, views of the polar seas (seePIA17470) and the sun glinting off of them (see PIA12481 and PIA18433) in the past, this is the first time both have been seen together in the same view. The sunglint, also called a specular reflection, is the bright area near the 11 o'clock position at upper left. 'This particular sunglint was so bright as to saturate the detector of Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument, which captures the view,' Nasa said. 'It is also the sunglint seen with the highest observation elevation so far -- the sun was a full 40 degrees above the horizon as seen from Kraken Mare at this time -- much higher than the 22 degrees seen in PIA18433.' The southern portion of Kraken Mare (the area surrounding the specular feature toward upper left) displays a 'bathtub ring' - a bright margin of evaporate deposits - which indicates that the sea was larger at some point in the past and has become smaller due to evaporation. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's 'water' is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. The deposits are material left behind after the methane & ethane liquid evaporates, somewhat akin to the saline crust on a salt flat. The highest resolution data from this flyby -- the area seen immediately to the right of the sunglint -- cover the labyrinth of channels that connect Kraken Mare to another large sea, Ligeia Mare. Ligeia Mare itself is partially covered in its northern reaches by a bright, arrow-shaped complex of clouds. Titan has a global circulation pattern in which warm air in the summer hemisphere wells up from the surface and enters the stratosphere, slowly making its way to the winter pole. There, the air mass sinks back down, cooling as it descends, which allows the stratospheric methane clouds to form. The clouds are made of liquid methane droplets, and could be actively refilling the lakes with rainfall. The view was acquired during Cassini's August 21, 2014, flyby of Titan, also referred to as 'T104' by the Cassini team. The view contains real color information, although it is not the natural color the human eye would see. Here, red in the image corresponds to 5.0 microns, green to 2.0 microns, and blue to 1.3 microns. These wavelengths correspond to atmospheric windows through which Titan's surface is visible. The unaided human eye would see nothing but haze, as in PIA12528.","Mirror-like reflection is in the south of Titan's largest sea, Kraken Mare .

"Inspired by the self-driving hoverchairs in Wall-E, an inventor has created a one-wheeled vehicle controlled using signals from his brain. Dubbed Cycoped, the rechargeable device connects to a smartphone app and a pair of specially-designed goggles. These goggles register the rider's brain impulses before sending them to the app, which controls the novel mode of transport. Scroll down for video . The Cycoped was designed by 24-year-old Pretom Chakraborty from Birmingham. It is controlled using electrical impulses in his brain via specially-designed goggles (pictured). The goggles then send these signals to a smartphone app via Bluetooth . It was created by 24-year-old inventor Pretom Chakraborty from Edgbaston, Birmingham. The goggles pick up signals by monitoring changes in electrical impulses released by his brain. These signals are sent to the app via Bluetooth and are converted into commands, including accelerate and decelerate. The Cycoped was created by 24-year-old inventor Pretom Chakraborty from Edgbaston, Birmingham. Goggles pick up signals by monitoring changes in electrical impulses released by the rider's brain. These signals are sent to a smartphone app via Bluetooth and are converted into commands, including accelerate and decelerate. Cycpoed weighs almost four stone (55lbs or 25kg) and reaches speeds of 16mph (25km/h). It then travels up to 18 miles (28km) on a four-hour electric charge. It can also be steered by leaning to the side, similar to how Segways and the AirWheel work. The freelance designer said: ‘The original idea came after watching 2008 Pixar film Wall-E in which human beings control hover crafts with their brains. ‘I wanted to create the Cycoped to use the least amount of energy possible. ‘I worked alongside mechanics in order to create my design, before ordering the plastic mould from China.’ His Cycpoed weighs almost four stone (55lbs or 25kg) and reaches speeds of 16mph (25km/h). It then travels up to 18 miles (28km) on a four-hour electric charge, which works out at just 25p a trip. Mr Pretom additionally designed the goggles to detect risk and safety impulses released by different areas of the user's brain. When the goggles detect these impulses they communicate with the Cycoped via the app to accelerate or slow down. This is named 'psycho mode', because the device is psychologically controlled.

"When it comes to boxing stereotypes, Chris Algieri has shattered more than his fair share. Born in the middle class town of Huntington on the north shore of Long Island, the 30-year-old still lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974. His bookshelf is lined with tomes from Sun Tzu's The Art of War to Sugar Ray Leonard's autobiography to books on diet and nutrition. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chris Algieri stripping to make the weight . Chris Algieri (right) poses at the press conference before going  toe-to-toe with Manny Pacquiao on Sunday . Pacquiao (right) trains in Macau with his coach Freddie Roach ahead of the fight . American Algieri lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974 and will receive $1.5million . He has a degree in health care sciences and a master's in clinical nutrition and has designs on going to medical school. Algieri has no amateur career having made the transition from kickboxing six years ago and was virtually an unknown until he became a world champion in June. But on Saturday he will earn around $1.5million when he takes on Manny Pacquiao in the gambling mecca of Macau. Indeed, this will be the first fight that Algieri hasn't been working while training. On the Tuesday before his shock victory over Ruslan Provodnikov last summer, he was putting a personal training client through his paces. 'I worked with a lot of athletes helping them, especially combat athletes. Then also mums, middle aged mothers that want to get back in shape after pregnancy or just being home and not training. I had a very varied client list.' It was Algieri's grandfather who first piqued Algieri's interest in boxing with tales of Argentinean legend Carlos Monzon. But despite being enthralled by the likes of Arturo Gatti, it was to martial arts and eventually kickboxing that a teenage Algieri turned. A professional by 19, he won two world titles but after suffering a broken elbow and a badly-injured knee, decided the risk/reward ratio was skewed against him. Six months later, he had switched to boxing. Pacquiao poses for the cameras during a workout session in Macau, showing off his trim physique . The Pacman (right) works with trainer Roach ahead of his fight with Algieri in the gambling mecca of Macau . 'A lot of the [kickboxing] techniques are very similar to punch techniques,' says Algieri. 'The fact that I've been fighting without a headgear for such a long time I think has really helped with my defence in my pro boxing career. 'But, in terms of how this sport is fought; it's a totally different pace. Boxing is a lot faster, conditioning is a lot more intensive and fights are longer.' After 20 fights, all in New York, over a six-year period, he was pitted against light-welterweight champion Provodnikov, a hard-hitting Russian nicknamed the Siberian Rocky. Algieri was knocked down twice in the first round but, despite his right eye closing during the fight, recovered to win a split-decision victory. 'It's zero to one hundred and that is just the nature of the game,' he says. 'It's nothing then boom! It's the nature of the business and I'm not surprised by it. 'I've been watching this sports for years and I have seen it with other fighters. I knew my time would come I just had to stay focused and disciplined and if you work hard good things happen. I am right where I am supposed to be.' On Saturday, that will be sharing a ring with Pacquiao, the eight-division world champion who still craves a shot at Floyd Mayweather Jnr. But Algieri is confident he can punch a considerable dent in those ambitions. 'I've got length, I've got reach, I've got speed; I've got footwork and defence, but that's not what's going to be the difference in this fight,' he adds. 'It's not a tall guy versus a short guy - It's Chris Algieri versus Manny Pacquiao. It's what I bring to the table versus what he brings to the table. I think a lot of it has to do with my mental preparation and mind going into this fight as well as what we know from Manny. 'We know Manny is a living legend. He's one of the greatest fighters that has ever lived. For me, I have to go out there and be myself. I have the talent and the tools to win this fight - I just have to go out there and perform.'","Chris Algieri goes toe-to-toe with Manny Pacquiao on Saturday in Macau .

"The young men in tangerine shirts trooped off Bloomfield Road to a standing ovation as another bewildering week in the life of Blackpool FC reached its bizarre conclusion. Days of anger and recrimination had ended in mystery and farce. For the most part, that pitifully small but enthusiastic crowd was applauding perfect strangers. Even the most ardent home fan could not have named more than a handful of Blackpool’s unlikely heroes. A summer of bitterness and confusion had left Blackpool with a grievously depleted first-team squad. At one stage last week, the club employed just eight fully fledged professional footballers. A tour of Spain had been cancelled, just a single pre-season friendly had been played and there was real doubt they would be able to field a side for Saturday’s match with Burnley. Discontent: Blackpool fans vent their anger at chairman Karl Oyston before the game with Burnley . Oyston out: Blackpool fans want Karl Oyston out of the club after a disastrous few years for the club . The club’s owner, Karl Oyston, had attracted even more than his usual ration of anger and contempt in these parts. Rumours and accusations were running wild and the entire dark pantomime was expressed in the pre-match message on the public address. ‘The Seasiders team will be — No1: Triallist... No3: Triallist...’ And so on. A few old favourites had survived the summer but several of the new men had arrived under conditions of anonymity. This phenomenon was seen at its most vivid in the second half, when the substitutes started to arrive. Again, the announcer could not enlighten the small assembly. The outcome was that 2,389 patrons now believe their new players are, respectively: No15, No14, No13 and 16 and last, but by no means least, No17, who came on with eight minutes left. Many a club would infuriate their fans with such cavalier treatment but at Blackpool they just chuckled. ‘Where are they finding them?’, asked one lady in the Matthews Stand. ‘Do you think we’re actually paying all these people?’ Her husband snorted cynically: ‘Not if Oyston has got anything to do with it.’ In truth, the most savage reaction against Oyston and his father, the former chairman Owen, had been vented outside the ground before the match. A crowd of about 120 gathered with banners and flags chanting: ‘Get out of our club, get out of our club, two greedy b******s, get out of our club!’ The Oystons have heard far worse over the years and the fans’ advice is unlikely to be obeyed. And not all the supporters are as antagonistic. But the abject failure of Blackpool’s owners to build upon their single, immensely lucrative season in the Premier League is the chief cause of the bitterness. The season of 2010-11 was their year in the sun. Indeed, for one, bright, shining moment, they sat at the summit of the English game after beating Wigan 4-0 in the opening match. But despite occasionally delighting with their attacking football, they survived for only that season. Their financial reward amounted to some £40million plus substantial ‘parachute payments’, the last of which is almost due. They have a fine, modern ground and, it is said, many millions in the bank. But investment in the team has been negligible. The bookmakers have made Blackpool favourites for relegation at 8-13 on. Hard work ahead: Jose Riga has a huge task ahead of him at Blackpool this season . Who are you: Darren Ambrose was one of the trialists who come on for Blackpool against Burnley . And yet Saturday, against a side who are preparing for their own shot at the top division, Blackpool played with spirit, a surprising degree of organisation and the vaguely desperate air generated by pros in search of a contract. By contrast, Burnley were rather less than ordinary. Although their own pre-season preparations have been infinitely more serene than Blackpool’s, they swiftly ran short of ideas and enterprise. They will improve, of course, but after taking 68 minutes to score the only goal of the game against the team with no names — Marvin Sordell striking a volley with casual authority — a hefty degree of improvement will be essential. Glenn Bowley, chairman of the Blackpool Supporters’ Association, takes the view that the Oystons are going nowhere and so the fans will have to work with them. Blackpool Supporters’ Club take a quite different view. ‘Oyston is clearly to blame for the chaos at the moment,’ said Bowley. ‘With so few players signed and ready, he has to be. He’s the most hated man in Blackpool and possibly with good reason. But he has things in his favour. He refuses to deal with agents, which takes some principles, even if it sometimes seems a bit naive. And he has put money into the ground, to set alongside the money the family has supposed to have taken out. So there’s a balance to be struck.’ According to Bowley, the club made £40m from that Premier League season, plus the parachute payments. ‘We don’t have high expectations,’ he said. ‘There are more important things than football in Blackpool. There are areas of real deprivation round here. But still we take the club seriously. ‘Look, the training ground is not fit for purpose. We’ve battled relegation for two seasons running. And all this is the result of bad management by Karl Oyston, basically.’ And this from a man regarded as a moderate by the Blackpool followers. Rise high: Nathan Delfouneso has penned a permanent deal at Blackpool after two previous loan spells . New beginnings: Jacob Mellis will be looking to get his career back on track at Blackpool . Naturally, it would have been helpful to hear from Oyston himself but he was not only unavailable for comment, he also banned the Mail newspapers from the Press box. And Oyston was not alone in his pique. His new manager Jose Riga refused to comment after the game. He is said to be on unfriendly terms with his employer. He had no notes in the programme and the dwindling band of fans have no notion of what he is thinking. Such is the way of things at Bloomfield Road. Yet some things never change in this rackety old town. When the storm was done, Blackpool landmarks emerged from the driving rain in all their gaudy glory; Tower and Pier and Nellie Dean’s Karaoke Bar. I remembered the old chap shuffling away from the Matthews Stand when the storm was brewing. He zipped his wet-top to his neck. ‘They reckon it’s in for four days, is this,’ he remarked. ‘Still, it’s good for the garden, eh?’ That’s the thing about Blackpool fans, they like to see the bright side in the darkest situations. It is a gift which will be sorely needed for the new season.","Blackpool fans were protesting against owner Karl Oyston on Saturday .

Brian May is said to have paid £10,000 for a second seat in the first class cabin of a British Airways flight to Los Angeles for his beloved electric guitar . The rocker was making the 5,500 mile journey from London to LA to perform at the Classic Rock Awards in Hollywood on Tuesday.

"The pretty old Belgian cloth town of Ypres is linked by a canal to the Channel, from which for centuries English wool was shipped inland for weaving. On Thursday, it will provide the setting for an EU summit which could mark the beginning of a process whereby, within a few short years, Britain could feel obliged to quit Europe. If Jean-Claude Juncker is anointed president of the European Commission, many voters in this country will start eyeing the exit. The Cathedral and Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, pictured in 1916, was reduced to rubble during the First World War . The Cloth Halls have been restored to their former glory in Ypres, Belgium, a hundred years after they were destroyed. In the same town this week, the EU is planning to hand its top job to an arch-federalist . Yet a century ago, around this same Ypres, millions of British soldiers fought to frustrate German dominance of Europe, and almost a quarter of a million died, including one of my own great-uncles. It is a place etched deep into the heritage of Britain, a name that commands pride — because there the British Army defied repeated German offensives — and also horror, because of the cost. One of my grandfathers and another of my great-uncles won Military Crosses there, and most families in Britain can claim similar associations. Uncle Lewis was a poet, a post-war friend of Siegfried Sassoon. In 1930, he wrote a piece entitled The Salient, about Ypres in 1917, of which one verse ran: . When every hollow’s a belching mass . Of wrangling guns, guns bellowing to guns . You cannot tell a burst of ours from the Huns’ Suddenly through the cordite, I smelt the gas. Down went the warning through the roar and screech . The spitting splinters ploughed us like a squall . Half-blinded gunners wrestled with the breech. What would Lewis and the legion of his long-ago comrades have thought, I wonder, to see Ypres today, rebuilt from knee-high rubble into manicured prosperity, the scene of a summit of nations overwhelmingly dominated by mighty Germany? They would surely welcome Angela Merkel’s country as an impeccable democracy, which has forsworn militarism to become one of the greatest manufacturers on Earth. But they would wonder at the extraordinary reversal of history, whereby ‘Wipers’ threatens to go down in history as the place where the British commitment to the Continent — which began in 1914 — faces its nemesis. Britain for most of its past sought to influence Europe at long range, without direct engagement on foreign soil. For most of the Napoleonic Wars, we fought the French mainly with our fleets and our gold, and only reluctantly committed an Army to the Continent. The EU may give its top job to to Jean-Claude Juncker, pictured . After Wellington secured his triumph over Bonaparte on June 18, 1815, at Waterloo —barely an hour’s drive from Ypres — our soldiers went thankfully home. No British government wished to contemplate fighting again in Europe. Thus, a hundred years later, the British Army, which had meanwhile fought Zulus and Dervishes and Russians and Afghans on far-flung fields, was bemused to find itself back in Belgium. A Grenadier officer wrote after leading his men through Ypres for the first time in October 1914: ‘It seems so odd to be fighting in this sort of country — we have always associated war with the tropics.’ But fight furiously he and 150,000 of his comrades did, through October and November, to defeat the last huge German offensive, designed to win the war by Christmas. Yet the price of victory was so high that no one felt minded to celebrate. Most of the British Expeditionary Force, the old sweats of the regular Army, repose for ever in cemeteries around Ypres. During the four years that followed, an average of 5,000 British soldiers a month perished in the Salient, where they fought three more major battles that bear its name. In addition to the dead, a million British men were wounded there. One of the most familiar sights of my childhood was that of some of them, wearing medals but with empty sleeves or trouser legs, playing chirpily melancholy music in city streets. Many of those who had bled, or seen loved ones perish in World War I, felt deeply bitter when it proved necessary for their successor generation to do it all over again, to fill thousands more cemeteries, to defeat Germany a second time between 1939 and 1945. After we had won all over again, it seemed that the only way forward for tired, broke, battered Britain was to throw in its lot with the Continent. In pursuit of peace, we kept an Army on the Rhine for more than half a century, to play our part in deterring Russian aggression through the Cold War. In pursuit of prosperity, in 1973 we joined the Common Market, a free trading association which, for a time, seemed to serve us well. But Europe’s tragedy — and I use the word advisedly — is that its political elites have never been content with the notion of the Union as a medium of mercantile exchange. They have pursued with dogged determination a vision of political and economic union which defies popular will, cultural identities, democratic principles and the merest common sense. I say all this without pleasure, because I have never voted for  Ukip and never will. If it is humanly possible, I want us to stay in Europe — but not at any price. If our partners, and especially the members of the Eurozone, are bent on advancing towards ever-closer union, then not only are the British people almost certain to reject such a course, but they seem entirely right to do so. The EU leaders’ apparent determination to choose as their president the Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker, who is as notorious for fanatical federalism as for his unfitness to achieve much after liquid lunches, seems a sign no British citizen can fail to heed. We often hear how eager the Germans are to keep Britain in Europe, to offer concessions to our desire for a repatriation of powers. But Merkel’s support for Juncker’s appointment makes plain the emptiness of such expressions of goodwill. I have attended several European conferences, at which the obsessive commitment of the German political elite to pursue union, regardless of their own electorate’s opinions, has been wretchedly apparent. A pitch by David Cameron, pictured talking with Jean-Claude Juncker, for a renegotiation of our EU membership if he wins next year¿s general election 'seems likely to get nowhere meaningful' David Cameron’s pitch for a renegotiation of our EU membership if he wins next year’s general election seems likely to get nowhere meaningful.Sooner or later, the Eurozone will probably crash-land, with especially painful consequences for its southern European members, however many of their bills the Germans go on paying in order to enable them all to buy imported BMWs. France’s future looks politically bleak and economically sterile. Even in the cause of we British being good Europeans — of the kind I have wanted to be for most of my adult life — it seems impossible to stay aboard a vessel committed to a doomed voyage. I do not think our departure from Europe will bring sudden happiness to Britain, but Thursday’s meeting at Ypres seems almost certain to start us on that path, through no fault of Mr Cameron. What a place to choose, to make decisions that presage the undoing of so many of our hopes for Britain in Europe. My ancestors, and probably yours, too, would look upon the triumph of Jean-Claude Juncker with disbelief that the Germans could prove themselves so stupid as to want this foolish man, and Britain so small a place as to be unable to stop him. On Thursday, the buglers who play the Last Post at the Menin Gate in Ypres may bid a symbolic farewell to more than the dead of a century ago. The saga of Britain’s role in Europe, which began in blood a century ago, threatens to end in torrid farce.","The European Union is planning to make Jean-Claude Juncker president of the European Commission .

"This is the moment a menacing great white shark swims straight for divers, jaw wide open and teeth bared... and ends up headbutting the diving cage. In an incident that would leave any human cringing with embarrassment, the predator missed the bait it was aiming for and crashed head-first into the protective enclosure. Canadian Jeremy Stewart was holidaying in South Africa caught the shark's mishap on camera during a diving excursion in Gansbaai - ominously nicknamed 'Shark Alley'. Moving in for the kill: A Great White shark heads straight for a diving cage in Gansbaai, South Africa . Lunch time: Jaw wide open and razor-sharp teeth bared, the 10-foot long predator prepares to hunt . Ouch! The shark misses the bait (and the divers) and collides with the protective enclosure . The Vancouver native was left awestruck when he came face to face with the 10-foot long great white underwater. He said: 'I was pretty confident the cage would protect us and the shark didn't seem interested in us. It was just going after the bait. 'For the most part I was calm, it was amazing to see these awesome creatures in the wild. 'However the moment when it hit the cage I got to feel its incredible power. For that second I don't know what I was thinking I just wanted to get out of the way.' Thrillseeker: The footage was captured by Canadian holidaymaker Jeremy Stewart . Not scared off: Stewart says  'I was calm, it was amazing to see these awesome creatures in the wild' Tourist attraction: The incident occurred during a cage-diving excursion in Gansbaai . Exhilarating: Cage-diving with Great White sharks is a popular tourist activity in 'Shark Alley' Jeremy added: 'You're pretty safe as long as you keep all your limbs inside the cage. 'But you forget all that when its swimming right at you with its huge jaws of serrated teeth.' And despite his close encounter, the 36-year-old computer animator admitted that the experience did not discourage him from going back into the water. He said: 'It didn't stop me from going surfing the next day in Jeffreys Bay which is about a day's drive down the coast. Hunting grounds: There is a large population of sharks in the region, making it popular with sight-seers . Shark Alley: The channel near Dyer Island  is a magnet for sharks hunting seals who reside there . 'I tried to capture as much of this once-in-a-lifetime experience as I possibly could. Hopefully I get to do it again one day.' Gansbaai is a popular tourist destination in Western Cape of South Africa. The channel between two  islands off its coast, Dyer Island and Geyser Rock, is widely known as 'Shark Alley' as it is a common hunting ground for sharks, who come to feast on the Cape fur seals who reside on Dyer Island. The region is renowned as one of the best commercial cage-diving destinations in the world, and after Kruger National Park, attracts the most tourists to South Africa of any other activity.","Incident occurred during cage-dive in Gansbaai, South Africa .

"The Beatles were right. Love is all people need to thrive in every way, a new study claims. Researchers claim that relationships help people cope with stress and adversity as well as helping them to learn, explore, achieve goals, cultivate new talents and find purpose and meaning in life. But how someone provides support dictates how successful another person can become. Scroll down for video . Researchers claim that relationships help people cope with stress and adversity as well as helping them to learn (stock image), explore, achieve goals, cultivate new talents and find purpose and meaning in life . Previous research has shown that people with supportive and rewarding relationships have better mental health and quality of life, and lower rates of morbidity and mortality. The new study, published in Personality and Social Psychology Review, builds on this and says that people are most likely to thrive with well-functioning close relationships. These relationships could be romantic or between friends, parents, siblings or mentors. Dr Brooke Feeney, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Professor Nancy Collins, of the University of California at Santa Barbara, said ‘thriving’ involves five components of wellbeing. These include 'hedonic wellbeing', such as happiness, 'eudaimonic wellbeing' - having purpose and meaning in life as well as progressing towards life goals - and 'psychological wellbeing', such as the absence of mental health problems. They continued that 'social wellbeing' – provided by deep and meaningful human connections and positive interpersonal expectancies – as well as physical wellbeing is necessary to thrive. Video courtesy of The Couple Connection . One expert said that relationships help people recover in bad times (illustrated with a stock image) and not only help people recover, but thrive afterwards . Bosses who shout and send demeaning emails to employees can cause conflict throughout their team, researchers recently claimed. They say the abuse is 'toxic' and can spread through the workplace, leading to everybody suffering. The Michigan State University study, conducted in China and the United States, suggests the toxic effect of nonphysical abuse by a boss is much broader than believed. Study author Crystal Farh said supervisors who belittle and ridicule workers not only negatively affect those workers' attitudes and behaviours, but also cause team members to act in a similar hostile manner toward one another. 'That's the most disturbing finding because it's not just about individual victims now, it's about creating a context where everybody suffers, regardless of whether you were individually abused or not,' she said. The findings could likely be explained by social learning theory, in which people learn and then model behavior based on observing others, in this case the boss. Lead researcher Dr Feeney said: ‘Relationships serve an important function of not simply helping people return to baseline, but helping them to thrive by exceeding prior baseline levels of functioning. ‘We refer to this as source of strength (SOS) support, and emphasise that the promotion of thriving through adversity is the core purpose of this support function.’ She explained that relationships should support a person’s development by helping them seize opportunities and explore, grow and achieve. This type of support is referred to as relational catalyst (RC) support. And the social scientists found that support providers with certain characteristics can provide more meaningful support and the most important is sensitivity. ‘It is not just whether someone provides support, but it is how he or she does it that determines the outcome of that support,’ Dr Feeney said. ‘Any behaviours in the service of providing SOS and RC support must be enacted both responsively and sensitively to promote thriving. ‘Being responsive involves providing the type and amount of support that is dictated by the situation and by the partner's needs, and being sensitive involves responding to needs in such a way that the support-recipient feels understood, validated, and cared for.’ She warned that some support providers may accidentally do more harm than good, by making a person feel weak, needy or inadequate. They could also run the risk of making someone feel guilty, indebted or as if they are a burden.","Experts from Pittsburgh and California said relationships help people 'thrive'

"A Football Association official was forced to ask the England supporters' band to stop playing during Tuesday night's friendly against Scotland in Glasgow after it inadvertently provided background music to anti-IRA singing. Some of the 5,000 away supporters sang foul-mouthed anti-IRA songs while the band played Follow England Away- a song it regularly performs during England matches - during the 3-1 victory for Roy Hodgson's side at Celtic Park. Many England fans sang 'F*** the IRA' on several occasions during the match and, in the first half, an FA official contacted the band to ask it to stop playing the song because it was innocently providing the tune for the offensive singing. Three Lions fans show their support for the England players during their side's friendly clash against Scotland - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . 5,000 England fans made the trip across the border and the Three Lions gave them plenty of reasons to cheer - there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . England fans were in buoyant mood before Tuesday's friendly match at Celtic Park -  there is no suggestion that any of the fans pictured took part in the anti-IRA chanting . The band has since come in for severe criticism, but its leader John Hemmingham says he had no idea about the issue until he was notified about it by one of his colleagues. Hemmingham instead thought the band was providing the tune to a song called 'Follow England Away' rather than anything to do with the IRA, and apologised for any offence. 'We were absolutely not aware of it (the IRA chants),' said Hemmingham. 'All the fans around us were singing ""Follow England Away"". 'It was only when a band member saw on Twitter that some people were saying we were playing anti-IRA songs that we became aware. 'Then we immediately stopped and played something else.' Hemmingham, who formed the England band 21 years ago, added: 'If anyone was offended by what was happening, then obviously we are not very happy about that. The England supporters' band, pictured in Ukraine at Euro 2012, were told to stop playing by a FA official . 'The FA have apologised and we would go along with that if anyone was offended.' Hodgson was unaware of the chanting, but apologised for any offence on behalf of the FA, who could take further action particularly when England are due to play in Dublin next June. He said: 'I was aware the crowd were tremendously supportive. I didn't have a clue what they were chanting. 'I don't condone it. If anyone was offended, I'm sure the FA would like to apologise to them. 'All we can do is play our football and be grateful for the support and hopefully they will behave themselves and not get themselves into a situation where their chanting is being criticised.' Wayne Rooney salutes the travelling support after leading his side to a 3-1 victory against Scotland . England boss Roy Hodgson apologised on behalf of his fans who were chanting anti-IRA songs . England fans had behaved well in the build-up to the match, joining in with a minute's applause for Scotland supporter Nathan McSeveney, who died from a fall at Celtic Park during the Republic of Ireland match on Friday. But once the match had begun some Three Lions supporters tainted their reputation when the anti-IRA songs began. Hodgson admitted that he had long ago stopped listening to what fans are singing during matches. Asked about the chants on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: 'After a long career in football, I learnt long ago that the crowd are either signing or are silent in the background but when they chant or sing most of the time I don't have a clue. 'I thought their support was excellent. I will leave any discussion about any words they have used.' Police Scotland reported no football-related disorder in the immediate aftermath of the match and said they had not received any reports of offensive chants.","Some England fans hijacked the band's tune to sing anti-IRA song .

"It is the moment many young children dream about - waking up on Christmas morning to find a bulging stocking full of treats hanging on their bedpost. But this year some youngsters may find one traditional bag of goodies missing, as Cadbury has announced they will no longer be making their beloved sacks of chocolate coins. The company dropped the bombshell on Twitter today, replying to a consumer enquiry with: 'Chocolate coins have been discontinued however we have lots of other chocolatey treats to try'. Scroll down for video . Traditional: Cadbury replied to a consumer on Twitter today informing them they had 'discontinued chocolate coins' No more: The confectionery giant will not be selling their sacks of chocolate coins this Christmas . The comment was met with shock with many on the social media site questioning the decision to abandon the Christmas favourite. One user, Mark Cobley, posted the dramatic message: 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO This is a horrendous decision and @CadburyUK must reconsider.' Another, Melanie Bien, worte: 'How do I explain that to the 5yo and 3yo who adore them? #wrongmove.' An online petition has also been launched to reverse the confectionery companys move to stop selling the 59 gram sacks. Treats: Chocolate coins have become a traditional Christmas stocking item . Chocolate coins have long been a Christmas treat and the tradition is thought to have stemmed from Saint Nicholas secretly giving his money away to children in his native Turkey. The figure, a 4th centruy bishop we now call Santa Claus, was shy so he decided to drop his purse  down a chimney. It landed in a pair of stockings a little girl had hung up to dry and the tradition was born. Cadbury, established in Birmingham in 1824, was bought by US company Kraft Foods for £11.5 billion in 2010. The acquisition faced widespread disapproval from the UK public - dismayed at the prospect of an iconic British institution falling into American hands. Last year Kraft split into two companies, with the confectionery business taking the name of Mondelēz International, of which Cadbury is now a subsidiary. Explaining their decision, a spokesman told The Telegraph that wrapping foil around the coin-shaped chocolates was 'fiddly' work. They suggested the coins were not as profitable as other products because they could not market them in the 'Cadbury purple'. The chocolate maker also believes shoppers have switched to cheaper, own-brand versions sold at supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl causing its own sales to decline. 'We are sorry to see the coins go, but that's business,' the spokesman added.","Confectionery giant broke news responding to consumer on Twitter today .

"I'm surprised that Crystal Palace haven't been charged by the Football Association. When Palace fans unfurled a banner on Saturday during the game with Chelsea at Selhurst Park, I was shocked. It read: 'Roman's Dirty Money Is A Disease That Has Plagued Our Game.' Split into two sections, the banner was so large it stretched across 20 to 25 people at least. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Jose Mourinho and Neil Warnock . Crystal Palace fans hold up two banners criticising Roman Abramovich's influence on English football . Chelsea owner Abramovich, pictured celebrating Diego Costa's goal against Arsenal, could take legal action . Cesc Fabregas celebrates after scoring Chelsea's winning goal at Selhurst Park on Saturday . The Invincibles proved to be the worst thing to happen to Arsenal . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers desperately needs a big performance against Real Madrid . That statement is actionable, and if Roman Abramovich was so inclined, he could seek legal advice about whether to pursue those who created the banner and wrote the words through the courts. He could even take action against Palace for allowing the banner to be shown. There is no way that banner should have been allowed into the ground. Palace should be charged, although leniency should be shown to the club because stewards took it down swiftly. There is an irony with all this moralising and sermonising among the Selhurst faithful. Crystal Palace is a club that has hit hard times in the past. So hard that they had to go into administration less than five years ago. Going into administration means they got away with not having to pay all their bills in full. The players are looked after – when the PFA aren't busy supporting any of their members who are convicted rapists, they make sure all footballers get their wages even when a club is in crisis, and on the brink of extinction.

No, it's the less well-paid employees who won't get paid up, and the small businesses who don't receive money owed to them when a football club sinks into administration. Twenty-nine people were made redundant when Palace took that route in January 2010. This situation where ordinary working folk lose their jobs or don't get what's owed to them by Palace and other clubs who go into administration, is apparently fine with these pompous high and mighty Eagles fans, who think they have the right to write libellous words on a banner and display it in front of thousands at a public event. And can they back up their claims? Abramovich (second from right) has spent huge amounts of money since taking control of Chelsea . If they have any evidence of 'dirty money' they should take it to the relevant authorities. The hypocrisy of a group of fans who ignore their own club's past financial mismanagement and instead make unsubstantiated claims about the owner of another is breathtaking. Will Palace take any action against the individuals who made and displayed the banner? I hope so. Steve Parish has always acted and spoken with class and integrity as co-chairman of Palace, I hope he continues to do that and protects the integrity of his Chelsea counterpart.","Crystal Palace fans unfurled a banner reading 'Roman's dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game' at Selhurst Park .

"A massive European night at Anfield – surely every football lover can’t wait for these games? You’ve got to be a hard-boiled hater of Liverpool Football Club if you’re not wildly excited about the prospect of the European champions Real Madrid, featuring arguably the world’s finest player in Cristiano Ronaldo, turning up at the historic and celebrated home of England’s finest European ambassadors over the years. The truth is that those massive European nights are only remembered if they are successful. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rodgers say Anfield crowd will be key for Real Madrid clash .

And Brendan Rodgers desperately needs a big European performance this week. Liverpool stumbled past Ludogorets, and then failed miserably in Basle. The Reds need to breathe life into their European adventure, and what better stage to do that than when the football world’s eyes will be watching – at Anfield against the continent's finest. Rodgers’ team might not win the Champions League this season, but he needs to have a competitive European campaign. Bill Shankly built the Anfield empire, Bob Paisley and then Joe Fagan carried it on. Kenny Dalglish continued the domestic domination. Since that long period of glory, only Rafa Benitez qualifies as a great Liverpool manager, and that’s because he won the Champions League. Rafael Benitez won the Champions League with the Reds by beating AC Milan in Istanbul nine years ago . Rodgers is a student of the game, and he has been smart enough to fully acquaint himself with Liverpool’s history and tradition. Rodgers knows what makes this great club tick, and he knows what will feed the fervour of the fans. He’s immersed himself in all things good about Liverpool past and present. Last season won Rodgers a lot of friends. The title looks a long way off, so he can only enhance his reputation with a memorable European campaign. Bob Paisley (left) and Bill Shankly were both hugely successful during their spells as manager at Liverpool . Six points from two games against Ronaldo and Real is exactly what Liverpool need. It’s a big ask. But taking his team into the top four last season was also a big ask for Rodgers. And he almost won them the title. This is Rodgers’ big stage. He’s travelled the world educating himself about football. He’s dreamed of nights like these. Let’s see what he’s got.

"When James Rodriguez signed his contract with Real Madrid, scarcely an eyebrow was raised. Of course, £60million is a massive transfer fee, especially when the attendant  salary exceeds £5m a year. But the young Colombian said he was desperate to play for Real and we instinctively believed him. They are champions of Europe, they have a team which reads like a litany of sorcerers and they are, well, they are Real Madrid. Who wouldn’t want to play for such a club? VIDEO Scroll down to watch great footage of James Rodriguez and Robert Lewandowski . Major coup: James Rodriguez, the top scorer at the World Cup, moved to Real Madrid earlier in the week . Summer loss: Luis Suarez, the Premier League's Player of the Year, left Liverpool for Barcelona . Hype: The Premier League has long been heralded as the best league in the world, but are we told a lie? Rodriguez is prodigiously gifted but so are most of his new colleagues. And so he walked into a dressing  room containing Cristiano Ronaldo, Toni Kroos, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric and he hoped to catch  the manager’s eye. He is likely to make the starting  line-up but his place  cannot be guaranteed. When he has served his well-merited suspension, Luis Suarez will experience a  similar process at Barcelona. This is the club which, under Pep Guardiola, took its football from the gods and now its standard-bearers include Lionel Messi, Neymar Jnr, Javier Mascherano and Andres Iniesta. Suarez has never seemed short of self-belief but even his ego may be daunted by such company. Like Rodriguez, he has no concrete assurance of first-team football. Bayern Munich, whose players formed the framework of  Germany’s World Cup-winning team, are less obviously dazzling than the Spanish clubs but this enduringly impressive side has added the coveted striker Robert Lewandowski to a squad whose strength extends from the world’s finest goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, through Bastian Schweinsteiger and on to Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Mario Gotze. So Real, Barcelona and Bayern are the finest teams in world and European football and such are their standards that only the  very best are invited to join  the magic circle. Hence the recruitment of Rodriguez, Suarez and Lewandowski. All three men want to play at the peak of the game. And when they turned their eyes to that peak, not a single  English football club was in sight. Naturally, finance is a factor since such players and, more  pertinently, their agents are never knowingly under-paid. But if it were merely a matter of money, then who could bring more to the table than Sheik Mansour at Manchester City, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea or the improbable Glazers at Old Trafford? No, there are other, less tangible, considerations, and the pursuit of excellence stands high among them. There comes a point where even extreme affluence is taken for granted, where status and  satisfaction are the motivating  factors. And currently, such aspirations cannot be fulfilled at English clubs. Consider the career path of some of those names. Bale and Modric moved from Spurs, Xabi Alonso, Mascherano and Suarez left Liverpool and Ronaldo departed Manchester United. Rich: If the game was about bringing money to the table, who could bring more than Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City (left) or Roman Abramovich at Chelsea (right), but other factors define a league's excellence . Star: Ronaldo is paraded in 2009 in front of a packed Berbabeu after his move from Manchester United . Silverware galore: Real are Europe's most successful team, winning their tenth European Cup last season . The peak: The likes of Messi and Neymar are likely to be rooted in La Liga for the majority of their career . Each man made the requisite noises of gratitude and regret  but they did not delay their departures. For they now play on stages which deserve their talents and our loss is Europe’s gain. In three weeks the Premier League season will recommence; some would suggest it never really ceased, others, more impressionable, will be counting down the days. Irksome irrelevances like Test cricket and international track and field will be brusquely cast aside, while the delights of Stoke and Crystal Palace will be ardently embraced. Already, the hucksters of Sky Sports are babbling breezy promises of ‘the most eagerly-awaited Premier League season in years’, with ‘must-see shows’ in ‘stunning new studios’. And we prepare for month upon frenzied month of Super Sundays, Magic Mondays and bland platitudes uttered by dull men in sharp suits. Much of the football will be exciting, . some will be enthralling, but all will be presented as the real thing, . the genuine article, ‘the best league in the world’. And we know the . claim to be a nonsense. Only one option: Real and Barcelona are the finest in world and European football, joined by Bayern Munich, who recently signed Robert Lewandowski (above), a striker who wants to play at the peak of the game . Competing: The Premier League had seven Champions League finalists between 2005 and 2012 . We have known it for years but our convictions have been  reinforced by the performance of the national team just a few weeks ago in Brazil. We may love the sport, for its faults as well as its many virtues. But we are tired of being lied to, year after year. For what we shall be watching, from late summer through to early spring, is something which falls several steps short of excellence. The finest expression of a glorious game is not to be found in these islands. Outstanding players like Suarez, Bale and Ronaldo know the truth of that statement. And so, deep down, do we. Galactico: Bale was made the world's most expensive player in 2013 when he moved to La Liga . Reunited: Luka Modric (left) and Gareth Bale (right) moved to La Liga despite interest elsewhere . Prior and his pals need a reality check . As one more chance evaded the gloves of Matt Prior last week, a former England cricketer stared down in bewilderment. ‘What’s he doing out there when he’s clearly not fit?’, he asked. Prior himself conceded the point after the Lord’s Test. He said he had torn his right quad before the first Test of the series, that his right hand had been ‘beaten to a pulp’ and that he needed an operation on his Achilles. ‘I’m not doing justice to myself and, more importantly, the team’, he concluded. None of which answered the old cricketer’s question. Grounded: Prior puts down a regulation chance off India danger man Virat Kohli . At this point, his most raucous defender said some rather foolish things. Mark Robinson, manager of Prior’s county of Sussex, first endorsed the admission of unfitness: ‘He didn’t go in with the best health,’ he said. ‘But Matt is a warrior, he is a tough guy and for him to say enough is enough, then he must be hurting’. He then decided to blame the messengers. ‘The media have hunted him mercilessly. Everybody scrutinises every move he makes. It almost makes it impossible for him to do his job.’ Now, the dreaded ‘media’ may have all manner of faults but the idea that Prior has been mercilessly hunted is simply tosh. In truth, there are footballers out there who crave Prior’s trivial level of media scrutiny. Much more relevant are the fitness questions raised by the player and his hapless advocate. Why was he playing Test cricket with a torn right quad? Why did it take him so long to discover that he was not doing justice to himself or the team? Glum: England wicketkeeper Matt Prior on the balcony at Lord's last week . And when was it deemed acceptable for an England wicket-keeper to start a match, knowing that he is not in ‘the best health’. Matt Prior has given England distinguished service. Hopefully, he has still more to offer. And Mark Robinson, his devoted admirer, knows precisely what must be done: ‘He can take stock of himself, do what he needs to do on his Achilles and get himself ready to properly put his name in the ring,’ he declared. Which is surely what he should have done before the series started . PS . Iago Aspas, once of Liverpool and now on loan to Sevilla, is a bosom chum of the serial biter Luis Suarez. And he is outraged by FIFA’s decision to suspend Suarez from all football activities for four months, along with a nine-match international ban, following his celebrated assault during the World Cup. ‘They are treating Luis like a murderer and not like a footballer,’ he protests. ‘There are murderers who pay less [for what they have done].’ In defence: Spanish forward Aspas (left) is unveiled after going on loan to Sevilla from Liverpool . Ousted: Suarez was given a four-month suspension from all football related activities . Unlike Senor Aspas, I have little knowledge of Spanish penal policy. But I have discovered that 242 homicides were recorded in Spain last year. And of those convicted, not one was sentenced to stay home and keep fit, while continuing to earn £200,000 every week. PPS . Overwhelming enthusiasm, titanic competition and the glowing satisfaction of a glorious festival; this sporting nation has seen nothing to compare with the Olympics of 2012. We assumed they would come at a price but we were convinced that price was worth paying.

"Balotelli needs to learn from Sanchez . Berahino oozes passion for England and Hodgson should give him a go . That tearful, emotional cuddle between Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho before Sunday’s game at Old Trafford made me feel sick. What was all that about? This is Chelsea at Old Trafford to take on Manchester United. These are the two clubs who fought out a fierce rivalry from 2004 when Arsenal bid the big-time farewell and settled for mediocrity, all the way through to 2012 when Manchester City emerged as champions. Louis van Gaal (left) and Jose Mourinho get ready for the first of several hugs together at Old Traffprd . The pair embrace again on the touchline before the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw . Sure there was respect between Fergie and Jose, but you didn’t have an emotional hug in the tunnel pre-match. I don’t care if they know each other and worked with each other, they are now sworn enemies. Van Gaal should have disarmed Mourinho by blanking him completely until after the game. It might not have affected Jose, but hugging him? You’ve got a lot to learn Louis, the Premier League is all about the rivalry, so cosying up to the manager of Chelsea is not the way things are done. Their faces were sterner after the game but they still found time for another hug . Ten years on from Fergie having pizza thrown at him in the tunnel by fierce enemies Arsenal, we had a love-in at Old Trafford this weekend. Mourinho normally disrespects opposition managers by offering a handshake before the final whistle. At Old Trafford he couldn’t wait to charge up the steps to the United dug-out to embrace Van Gaal. It’s only a couple of years ago Mourinho was going too far with his antics, thrusting his finger into the eye of an opposition coach, the late Tito Vilanova. He was getting under the skin of a great like Pep Guardiola to the point where Pep left Barcelona because he was so stressed by the pressure. Pep Guardiola (left) and Mourinho enjoyed a far less warm relationship in Spain . 'He is special,' said Van Gaal of Mourinho, pre-match. Yes we know, he told us that himself years ago. Mourinho is showing us some true quality managing Chelsea this season. So this isn’t about the football on the pitch. It’s about the rivalry of two great clubs. Thankfully the United fans launched into songs targeting Mourinho from the first whistle – that’s what this fixture should be about. The 1-1 draw was gutting for Jose, but I almost got a sense that he was happy to give his friend – football friend – a point in his fight to get United back to where they think they belong. Robin van Persie celebrates scoring United's last-minute equaliser at Old Trafford on Sunday . Van Persie is mobbed his team-mates after earning Manchester United a point . Message to Van Gaal, instead of whispering sweet nothings into Mourinho’s ear, you should have spent more time getting the message out that Rafael can’t possibly be designated the role of picking up Didier Drogba at a corner. Message to Mourinho – are you going soft as you get older? Show some edge when you go to United, don’t roll over and let your old boss tickle your tummy like a pussycat. Chelsea should not be friends of Manchester United. They should be arch-rivals. The respective managers should be conscious of that and save the love-in until after the main event is over. Throw some pizza instead of hugging each other like long-lost lovers.","Jose Mourinho worked under Louis van Gaal at Barcelona .

"With a rueful smile and a brief admission of a truth almost universally accepted, Roy Hodgson seemed to sum up the lot of an England manager forever burdened by expectations, rarely given the kind of freedom that having nothing left to lose bestows upon less exalted colleagues. ‘If I say what I really think, people will turn it against me with a plethora of facts,’ said Hodgson, an experienced and well-travelled coach currently in charge of a team with five straight wins and one foot already in the Euro 2016 Finals. Despite this run of all-conquering form, the shadow of the summer’s World Cup lingers over England still, it seems. For a man whose earliest memory of the world’s oldest international fixture is of Jim Baxter destroying the reigning world champions in 1967, tonight’s match offers intensity, yes — but also a little breathing space. Wayne Rooney said playing in such an intense atmosphere at Celtic Park will benefit the younger players . Roy Hodgson was out to inspect the Celtic Park pitch with his players ahead of Tuesday night's clash . Continuing to lay down the testimony that he thought might be used against him, Hodgson said: ‘The World Cup was a real cold shower for us, a real bad moment. ‘I thought we were doing quite a lot of things well, leading up. Then we lost two matches and we’ve hit a wall — and supposedly we have to start again. ‘Well, I don’t think we’ve started again. We did have a massive barrier to get over after the World Cup, because we created that barrier by losing two matches. ‘We erected the fence. But I don’t think we started at the World Cup and have now got somewhere. We’d always been working towards what we’re getting today. ‘The rider from my side is that a lot of players were beginning to emerge and stake their claim just before the World Cup, who hadn’t necessarily fully succeeded, . ‘After the World Cup, it gave us a good opportunity to say: “Look, let’s give these guys their opportunity and see if, with the work we do, we can bring them up to speed in the next two years.” That was a great benefit. Rooney, who is just six goals short of becoming England's record goalscorer, speaks to the media . VIDEO Rooney expecting fiery atmosphere in Scotland . ‘I’d like to think some of the players we’ve brought in have shown signs they can justify that confidence I’ve shown in them.’ If Hodgson expects to give some of the emerging talents valuable exposure to a fairly fiery friendly, he made it clear last night that he will still be deploying his big guns at Celtic Park, with no club managers promised deals on early substitutions. Even in a match where half-a-dozen changes can be made from the bench. For the man whose career has taken him all over Scandinavia, to Inter Milan twice — and even included being linked with the Scotland job back in 2002 — this fixture will always be special. Recalling his first memories of the clash, he revealed: ‘The one memory that sticks out is when Baxter ran us ragged at Wembley just after the World Cup. I didn’t go to the match, you couldn’t get tickets for Wembley in those days, but I watched it on television. Jim Baxter is hugged by fans who invaded the pitch after a 3-2 win for Scotland at Wembley . ‘I was just starting out in football, just getting interested in tactics, so I watched it with great interest. ‘Scotland came down in ’67 and gave that wonderful display, which was personified by Jimmy Baxter in the middle of the park. That is my abiding memory. But there is no point in me talking about it with these boys, because they weren’t even born.’ Asked whether taking the Scotland job had ever been on his horizon, Hodgson said: ‘It might have been if they’d have offered it to me. In 2002, where was I...? ‘I’ve tried in the past to play down those so called linkages, unless a situation has arisen when I’ve been sitting down being interviewed or offered the job. ‘I’m sure you have the information, and it was correct, but I can’t remember too much about it.’ The England manager looks focused as he strides out onto the Celtic Park pitch on Monday . Polite and politically astute enough not to tread on any local sensibilities, Hodgson — a well-read man who referenced George Orwell’s Animal Farm at one point, albeit in a slightly odd aside — stressed the pure footballing nature of the rivalry that underpins this fixture, while predicting a ‘classic’ game between two teams keen to play the right way. ‘In future, we will play matches against teams who accept we have the better players, so they seek to restrict their attacking movements to frustrate us,’ he said. ‘I’m expecting to see a classic game of football where both teams want to win, where both believe they have the ability and quality to win. Both teams will be attempting to create goal chances, which will inevitably lead to some counter-attacking football. ‘It will be of a similar ilk to Friday’s game between Scotland and Ireland. It will be different to our games against San Marino and Estonia, when defeat wasn’t our major concern but scoring goals might have been.’","England face Scotland in international clash at Celtic Park on Tuesday .

"The friendship between Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher will be put on hold for 90 minutes when they lead England and Scotland into battle at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Having played alongside Fletcher for 11 years, Rooney has nothing but admiration for his Manchester United team-mate. The England captain rates Fletcher highly as a player and he also has nothing but respects him for the way he battled back from a debilitating bowel disease to return to first-team action for club and country. Wayne Rooney paid tribute to his Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher ahead of Tuesday's friendly . England captain Rooney said he will put club loyalties aside at Celtic Park against Scotland . 'It's incredible for him to be back playing and to be back in the Scotland team,' said Rooney of Fletcher, who was missing for most of the 2011-12 and the 2012-13 seasons because of ulcerative colitis. 'It shows the character he is, the type of person he is. 'Obviously it was a hard moment for Darren and his family and he's come though that with flying colours.

Down on the pitch Rooney knows he will have to put his friendship with Fletcher to one side for the night.

"When Roy Hodgson was asked if a contest between England and Scotland could ever be called a friendly, he replied: ‘Why not?’ He has been at pains to stress his fondness for the Scots in the last few days, summoning his father’s Newcastle roots to somehow support his case. With Gordon Strachan, it is not quite the same. Strachan, after all, was on the pitch as a fan when the Tartan Army invaded Wembley in 1977 and on the pitch as a player when Richard Gough headed the winner in the rain at Hampden Park eight years later. Hodgson recalls the painful memory of Jim Baxter in 1967, but Strachan is connected to this fixture. When the nations met in the Euro 2000 play-offs, the last time England were in Glasgow, he was the manager of Coventry and stirring mischief, by saying: ‘The English stole our land... The English robbed us of all our oil... The English perpetrated the Highland clearances... And now, the English have pinched Billy Connolly.’ Scotland skipper Scott Brown leads the way during training on Monday ahead of clash with the Auld Enemy . Gordon Strachan says his stars are all desperate to play against England on Tuesday . Cardiff City keeper David Marshall is put through his paces during the session . Strachan joked in 1999 that the English 'pinched Billy Connolly' (above) The Scotland boss updated those remarks for the 21st century on MOnday as he relaxed amid the roaring fires, stag art and whisky bottles which gave his team’s hotel base, on the banks of the River Clyde by the Old Kilpatrick hills, the feel of a scene from the James Bond film Skyfall. It was only a shame the 57-year-old had opted for the man-made fabrics of modern sportswear as opposed to tweed. ‘Billy’s back, we lost him for a while but now he’s back,’ quipped Strachan, on the subject of Billy Connolly and who has rights to the much-loved comic. ‘That was 15 years back. Did I really say that? Is my lawyer in here? It was probably tongue-in-cheek, but that’s the way it went years ago: the Anglos at one table and the Scots at the other.’ The clod of turf he took from Wembley in 1977 has long since been left in the back garden of a home he had in Broughty Ferry, Dundee. ‘It was my honeymoon and I spent it in Watford,’ said Strachan. ‘I took my wife and my best man to the game. Unfortunately, his wife couldn’t get in. We only had three tickets, so she had to stay in the hotel. ‘I wasn’t one of the first on the pitch. I think there were only three of us left standing there and the policeman said: You might as well go on as well, son.’ The one-liners are delivered in a flash. It is like an audience with Roy Keane without the undercurrent of menace. Strachan says he has a selection headache for the game at Celtic Park . Strachan oversees training on Monday as his players try to stake a claim for a starting spot . Scotland star Ikechi Anya was all smiles following Friday night's win against the Republic of Ireland . Strachan admits the wise-cracking is a defence mechanism which kicks in when the questions turn to subjects he would rather avoid. But there can’t be many of those when his side are in such rich form. Scotland have lost only once in 10 — a narrow defeat by Germany — and are giddy about the upturn after emerging from a period of national soul-searching which accompanied the independence referendum in September. When Strachan went to see the band James in concert at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro on Saturday, he found the live acts talking on stage about Shaun Maloney’s winner against the Republic of Ireland and the crowd abuzz. They are not quite ready to relinquish their underdog status to England — the manager pointing out his team against the Irish contained only three players from the Barclays Premier League — but the first home game for 15 years against their oldest rivals could barely have been timed better. Strachan takes a moment to mull over a question from reporters during his press conference . Strachan, pictured here up against Mike Duxbury in 1984, says the clash was the highlight of his calendar . Brown shows off his keepy-uppy skills during training as he prepares to lead his troops into battle . ‘Nobody wants to be rested, that’s for sure,’ said the Scotland boss, when asked about the strength of his team. ‘A wee bit of that is because of the fixture. We’re only human. If we were playing some team 70-odd in the rankings, we wouldn’t be as excited. ‘It was a bit like the first day of pre-season in training. We’ve got so many players who want to play. There were a few bumps but it was old-school rub it down and get on with it. ‘Top players have to play 60 games a season. If you want an easy life, go to a mediocre Championship club. You can get nine weeks’ break. If you want to be a top player, get your mind around playing every week and deal with that.’ It was not signposted as a message for Raheem Sterling, but relevant nevertheless. Strachan grabs a word with in-form Everton forward Steven Naismith . Jim Stewart briefs Scotland's shot-stoppers before the session near Glasgow . England must be fully focused and committed to pass this test in the face of a Scottish renaissance. ‘This is a competitive game, even if there are no points available,’ said Strachan. ‘It was the event of the season in my time, but we never had a lot of live football on the telly back then. ‘There are so many big games on now that it dilutes interest. But this still has an interest.’ This does not mean it will be a ‘bloodbath’, he was quick to add. England goalkeeper Ben Foster struck a nerve when he noted the Scots and Irish had been ‘kicking lumps out of each other’ on Friday. ‘Ben doesn’t need to worry because he’s in goals,’ said Strachan. ‘It’s new to me, all this, we’re only 5ft 6in. On Friday, people went toe to toe. It wasn’t a nasty game. I’d have called it a really good game of football. There was a real intensity but no nastiness at all. Anya juggles with the ball as Scotland's stars looked relaxed ahead of the friendly fixture . Anya made light work of the slalom during the training session in Bishopton . ‘The game’s changed. You can’t kick lumps out of people anymore. There are rules in place. A team like Barcelona couldn’t have emerged 30 years ago because of the rules and the pitches. That’s why Ronaldo and Messi are able to flourish. ‘You have 22 cameras at every game and you get done retrospectively. If somebody elbowed you 30 years ago, you just had to wipe the blood from your face and get on with it. ‘That kind of intimidation in football is completely gone.’ VIDEO Rooney expecting fiery atmosphere in Scotland .","Gordon Strachan's side looked relaxed during training on Monday .

"Cardiff City have started High Court proceedings to reclaim more than £50,000 they paid to football agent Paul Atkin for information he provided about discredited former manager Malky Mackay. It’s claimed Atkin, of Pro Star Management, made an approach to Cardiff under the pseudonym Jack Anonymous offering to help the club defend Mackay’s £7million employment claim with ‘two significant pieces of information’ regarding his alleged ‘serious misconduct’. Mackay later settled with the club before Sportsmail revealed the series of racist, homophobic and sexist texts he had exchanged with director of football Iain Moody. Neither has yet found another job in football. Cardiff have taken agent Paul Atkin to court over information he provided about Malky Mackay (above) Cardiff paid Atkin, via his solicitor, £51,500 for the information he had been touting. But on receiving it, they found it ran to less than one typed page and was either of questionable accuracy or relevance. The first item was that Norwich majority shareholder Delia Smith had allegedly approached Mackay about managing the Canaries and the second was that Atkin’s own agency had a scouting agreement with Mackay through his agent Raymond Sparkes, who also works for Pro Star Management. The Welsh club, whose owner Vincent Tan has spent £750,000 investigating eight transfers during Mackay’s tenure, are seeking the return of their money plus legal costs. A new gambling law involving the licensing of online betting companies that came into effect on Saturday will have Premier League clubs examining any sponsorships involving the gaming sector. It will soon be illegal for any non-registered betting operation with UK interests to advertise on the back of shirts or on perimeter boards. A Premier League spokesman said: ‘Our clubs have been made aware of these new regulations well in advance.’ It doesn’t say much for Michael Owen’s commitment as a BT Sport co-commentator that he missed last Saturday’s Premier League match between two of his old clubs, Liverpool and Newcastle, to travel to the United States to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting. This isn’t the first time Owen has put his horse racing passion ahead of TV football duties. Michael Owen opted to attend the Breeders' Cup rather than commentate for BT Sport at the weekend . Hot on the heels of Mark Clattenburg’s one-match ban for not using the official referees’ transport after West Brom v Crystal Palace, it is alleged that Lucy May, girlfriend of Michael Oliver, bagged a lift in the officials-only people carrier after Burnley played Chelsea. The Professional Game Match Officials said they don’t comment on individual incidents. Military manoeuvred . There is some disquiet among fans that four of the clubs — Portsmouth v Aldershot and Gosport v Colchester — whose FA Cup first-round matches have been moved to November 9, Remembrance Sunday, are from military or naval towns. An FA spokesman said there had been no complaints from the teams involved and that there would be appropriate recognition of the date at both venues . Celtic are considering complaining to Ofcom about Sky Sports News using footage of Stefan Scepovic instead of team-mate Aleksandar Tonev when the latter was banned for seven matches for racist behaviour. The club consider the on-air apology was not made quickly enough. Sky say they apologised as soon as they were made aware of the error. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (centre) was banned for seven matches for racist behaviour . FA National Game chief Roger Burden has slammed Sport England for the way they measure participation in team games. This follows the FA being docked £1.6million of their grassroots grant from the funding agency after a drop in football participation. Burden wrote in a letter to FA councillors: ‘Sport England’s way of measuring sports activity leaves a lot to be desired and does not properly recognise team sports or those who don’t play football every week, but still play regularly. Most team sports have similar criticisms.’ Sport England said: ‘We talk to the FA regularly about how we monitor their performance and are confident the Active People Survey is fully understood.","Cardiff are in the High Court to sue agent Paul Atkin .

"Scotland host England at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, with Roy Hodgson's side looking for their sixth straight win. Scotland, meanwhile, are undefeated in their last three games and full of confidence after their win against the Republic of Ireland. Here, Sportsmail's John Greechan introduces Gordon Strachan's expected starting XI for the clash. CRAIG GORDON . Age: 31 Caps: 40 . The former Sunderland goalkeeper was out of the game completely for two years, beset by injury and dogged by talk he’d never return. After training with Rangers last summer, he signed for Celtic — and now wins his 41st cap four years after his 40th. Craig Gordon has not played for Scotland for four years, but will start against England on Tuesday . STEVEN WHITTAKER . Age: 30 Caps: 27 . The Norwich full back is likely to start on the right but can play on the left. He loves a mazy dash into opposition territory. RUSSELL MARTIN . Age: 28 Caps: 15 . Born in Brighton to a Scottish dad, the Norwich defender has a doggedness that helps him stick to strikers who should really be out of his league. Norwich City defenders Steven Whittaker (left) and Russell Martin (right) will line-up at Celtic Park . I played Scotland three times in my career and the games were always fast, furious and aggressive, but I’ll never forget walking out at Hampden Park. We felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive. That was the first half of a play-off to reach Euro 2000, so it was a massive game. GRANT HANLEY . Age: 22 Caps: 16 . The Dumfries-born centre half may give the impression of being a bit lumbering but he can shift. Great potential. ANDY ROBERTSON . Age: 20 Caps: 4 . The youngest member of the starting XI, who was released by Celtic when he was 15, had only played 180 minutes of professional football the last time these two sides met. Blackburn defender Grant Hanley (left) and Andy Robertson (right) will likely complete the defence . You can’t call Scotland v England games friendlies. I had team-mates at Ipswich who I would play with and then against. You wanted to kick lumps out of each other, and that is what happened in those days. Mick Mills was our captain at Ipswich, but (with England) he was against us. You want to beat England and vice versa, that won’t change. But after the game we went on holiday together... and are still talking about it to this day. SCOTT BROWN . Age: 29 Caps: 41 . ‘Broony’ is the kind of snarling, snapping, fiery Scot who used to give English opponents nightmares. JAMES MORRISON . Age: 28 Caps: 34 . The West Brom midfielder usually sits alongside Brown deeper in midfield but can be used further forward where his passing creates chances. Midfielders Scott Brown (left) and James Morrison (right) bring a wealth of experience between them . BARRY BANNAN . Age: 24 Caps: 18 . Slight and prone to playing with his cuffs down over his hands, Bannan is a throwback to a different age. Hugely popular with fans, he plays in the three behind the striker. STEVEN NAISMITH . Age: 28 Caps: 33 . The Everton forward carries a threat from any position in the three-man support unit behind the main striker. His work-rate makes him a certain starter. Barry Bannan (left) and Steven Naismith (right) both ply their trade in the Premier League . IKECHI ANYA . Age: 26 Caps: 10 . Lightning-quick, Anya’s best Scotland moment came when he scored against Germany, later tweeting: ‘Can’t believe I beat Manuel Neuer. I don’t even do that in FIFA!’ CHRIS MARTIN . Age: 26 Caps: 4 . The Scotland coaching staff really love the Derby County forward, who will deputise for the injured Steven Fletcher. Big but mobile, the 26-year-old is a former England youth player who qualifies for Scotland through his dad. Won the first of his four caps in May in a friendly against Nigeria. Ikechi Anya (left) and Chris Martin (right) will be tasked with breaking down England's defence .","England and Scotland face each other in a friendly at Celtic Park .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke will open himself up to accusations of cronyism in his appointment of a new general secretary to replace Alex Horne if he does not employ headhunters. An FA board meeting this week discussed whether they could save money by selecting Horne’s successor through their own contacts rather than hire expensive recruitment specialists. A decision has yet to be made but the saving of £100,000-plus has to be measured against the need for such a scrutinised body as the FA having a transparent open process in finding their next lead executive. The FA have used headhunters to fill all their senior positions over the last few years — including Dyke’s own appointment. And Horne leaving has given the FA an unexpected opportunity to analyse the type of CEO they want — best served through a rigorous independent search. Alex Horne will leave his position as the Football Association's general secretary after 11 years in January . Jonathan Trott (left) offered the much-maligned Kevin Pietersen the chance to have dinner with him . Even Liverpool find it difficult sorting out fact from the fiction in the constant stories surrounding Mario Balotelli . Keeping the hunt in-house could lead to significant problems if it emerges that the choice had strong links with Dyke or any of the other FA power brokers making the selection. At least the discarded Kevin Pietersen still has one friend from his England days. Jonathan Trott, well enough after his stress-related illness to go on the England Lions tour, offered the chance to have dinner with him and Pietersen to the Football Extravaganza charity auction. It was bought for over £10,000 by Manchester United’s Class of 92. Meanwhile, Roy Keane’s autobiography is proving to have sustained buying interest rather more than KP’s book after they were both published in a blaze of publicity. Keane’s sales last week in the UK and Ireland were 20,000 hardbacks compared to KP’s 5,700. ......................................................................... The owner of rundown Tatenhill airfield next door to St George’s Park deep in the Staffordshire countryside wrote to the FA looking for funding to help refurbish the facilities. The FA were not interested in supporting Tatenhill despite fast air transport to London being one sure-fire way of making the £100million Park more popular with the England team who still use The Grove outside Watford as their other base during international weeks because of its proximity to Wembley. ......................................................................... Even Liverpool find it difficult sorting out fact from the fiction in the constant stories surrounding their striker Mario Balotelli. The latest gem doing the rounds is that Mario and friends were refused entry into a nightclub in Southport because some were wearing trainers. So they went back to a late-night bar in Formby where Mario lives and he treated everyone in the hostelry to drinks for making him welcome. ......................................................................... Tickets prove a point . In a week when Northumberland County’s idiot vice president John Cummings said that ‘a woman’s place was in the kitchen and not on the football field’, the best news for women’s football is the expected crowd at Wembley for the England v Germany women’s international on November 23. The FA were originally hoping for around 30,000 to be there. But already more than 41,000 tickets have been sold for what will be the biggest attendance ever for a women’s football match in the UK outside the Olympics. Cummings should be forced to watch as part of his four-month ban. ......................................................................... BBC starting their ‘whole new revamped’ FA Cup coverage next Friday night with Warrington v Exeter presented by stand-in Dan Walker hasn’t impressed former rights holders ITV.

"Mark Clattenburg must wait until 4pm on Monday, when the list of referees for next week’s round of Premier League fixtures is published, to learn if his ban will extend beyond one match this weekend. But Clattenburg’s upset over any further suspension will be heightened because he personally informed his employers, the Professional Game Match Officials, about the telephone conversation with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock that broke refereeing protocol. The 39-year-old referee, having already breached regulations by leaving The Hawthorns after West Brom’s 2-2 draw with Palace in his own car without his assistants so that he could get to an Ed Sheeran concert, should not have conversed with Warnock — and may be in further trouble for doing so. Mark Clattenburg was dropped from this week's Premier League matches after breaking referees' protocol . Neil Warnock has been given no punishment for the conversation between him and Clattenburg . But it is another example of football’s double standards that Warnock, who is understood to have made the call to Clattenburg, faces no sanction for doing so. The FA would only act if there was any suggestion of impropriety in their conversation. BT Sport, who launched in 2013 with a firm intention of knocking Sky Sports off their perch, now seem to have lowered their ambitions. Tony Chanmugam, chief financial officer at BT, told American cable business channel CNBC that BT did not need to own the sports TV market and would rather be a ‘strong No 2’. Chanmugam added: ‘There’s plenty of space for both of us to survive and survive well.’ BT Sport have invested in the likes of Paul Scholes, but now appear happy to play second fiddle to Sky . It did not go unnoticed at the Women’s Sport Conference hosted by Minister for Sport Helen Grant at Lord’s on Thursday that this initiative to promote female involvement in sport took place on the same day that a Northumberland County FA buffoon was quoted as saying: ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen and not on a football field. All the time I’m alive, a woman will never referee in my league.’ Grant said of county vice-president John Cummings’s views that have led to a four-month ban: ‘His comments are deplorable and the FA were right to take strong action. ‘At a time when there is so much good work going on to raise the profile of women in sport and encourage more women to get involved, it is extremely disappointing to hear about such sexist remarks.’ Helen Grant, Minister for Sport, described a Northumberland County FA official's comments as 'deplorable' The £10million cost of Sport England’s campaign to increase women’s participation in sport has caused some concern among governing bodies. Yet Sport England have gone ahead with hiring an expensive PR agency, Blue Rubicon, to promote the initiative, saying it was too big a project to be handled in-house. Stuart goes clubbing . England rugby coach Stuart Lancaster’s desire to connect his international players with their grassroots beginnings — the ‘journey’ is a favourite Lancaster buzzword — has resulted in six of his squad presenting plaques this week to their first clubs. Stuart Lancaster takes training in a week when he encouraged his England players to go back to their roots . Richard Wigglesworth was one of the players whose previous clubs were invited to watch England train . So ‘unsung heroes’ from Warlingham (Chris Robshaw), Fylde (Kieran Brookes and Richard Wigglesworth), Salisbury (Mike Brown), Dursley (Ben Morgan) and Westoe (David Wilson) watched England train before meeting Lancaster and being presented with commemorative signs by their old boys. Meanwhile, the RFU are ramping up their communications army ahead of World Cup year — they had six PR operatives at Lancaster’s first briefing of the autumn international series as well as extra media personnel from Bath and the Ministry of Defence. A senior civil engineer involved in Olympic Park construction has cast doubt on whether the highly complex stadium roof, the biggest of its kind in the world and already subject to £39m worth of unforeseen extra costs, will be completed in time for a safety certificate to be issued to host five Rugby World Cup matches next autumn. The Olympic Stadium's reconstruction might not be ready in time for next year's Rugby World Cup . But the London Legacy Development Company insist the roof will be finished on schedule for a Diamond League athletics meeting ahead of the RWC. And contingency plans for a harsh winter include stopping roof work — which doesn’t need to be fully completed until West Ham arrive in 2016 — whenever necessary.","The 39-year-old referee will find out on Monday if he gets a game next week .

"Roy Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson did book publicity in London over the weekend. Keane was hardly mentioned by Ferguson, while Keane, normally quick to mention his favourite F word chose to talk about another of his famous feuds at the London Sports Writing Festival. Roy Keane (left) revealed that there is little chance of burying the hatchet with Alan Shearer (right) Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. Meanwhile, Fergie was predictably given the easiest of times by United fan interviewer James Nesbitt who preferred to have him talking about his ‘greatest experience outside football’ — helping Paul McGinley motivate his Ryder Cup winners. Roy Keane was shown a red card for pushing Alan Shearer, who had wound up the Manchester United skipper with his time-wasting tactics in 2001 . Keane said later he wished he had punched Newcastle striker Shearer after being sent off . The ludicrous FIFA watches farce continues with ethics committee investigatory head Michael Garcia writing to FA chairman Greg Dyke warning him of possible disciplinary action if he doesn’t return his £16,400 Parmigiani watch, given as a delegate gift at the FIFA Congress. Dyke had already notified Garcia that he intends to auction it for the benefit of a cancer charity. Christian Purslow used to work for Liverpool and is joining Chelsea . Ex-Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow’s rent-a-quote role for Sky Sports News on all football business matters seems to have been rewarded with his appointment as Chelsea’s head of global commercial activities — effectively replacing Ron Gourlay who left Stamford Bridge last week.

"Australia head coach Michael Cheika views next year's World Cup as a realistic target for Sam Burgess. Burgess was officially unveiled by Aviva Premiership club Bath on Thursday afternoon after completing a high-profile switch from rugby league. The 25-year-old's union debut has been delayed by the fractured cheekbone and eye socket suffered in the NRL Grand Final earlier this month, but Cheika predicts he will make a seamless transition once fit. Sam Burgess was unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday following his switch from rugby league . Australia coach Michael Cheika believes Burgess is capable of making the 2015 England World Cup squad . 'I've been fortunate enough to have a bit to do with Sam back in Australia and he's a very good player,' Cheika said. 'His enthusiasm and passion for the game is going to far and away supersede any issues he will have with knowledge and learning the game. 'If any player can make the World Cup from a zero base in the time he has, then he can. 'It's his hunger to learn and his individual skills that set him apart.' The Bath star celebrates with Russell Crowe (left) after the Rabbitohs won the NRL Grand Final match . Burgess's mum Julie poses with her Rabbitohs sons (from left to right) Sam, Luke, George and Tom . Cheika has named his first Wallabies team since replacing Ewen McKenzie as head coach last week with Quade Cooper and Will Genia reunited at half-back for Saturday's European tour opener against the Barbarians at Twickenham. The NSW Waratahs coach outlined his plan to reselect the XV defeated 29-28 by New Zealand almost two weeks ago for the Test against Wales on November 8 in the belief they deserve another chance. Australia were edged with just seconds of the Bledisloe Cup match to go despite the turmoil that had engulfed the squad after Kurtley Beale sent an obscene text to team business manager Di Patston, who subsequently resigned. Burgess poses after being awarded rugby league's International Player of the Year award last week . Burgess (left) has joined the Aviva Premiership side with an aim to represent England at the 2015 World Cup . Cheika believes the display against the All Blacks is proof the Wallabies' spirit remains high despite recent events. 'If you look at the last performance against New Zealand, although it was a loss the lads played pretty well,' Cheika said. 'There was a lot of controversy and things that weren't rugby-related going on. Burgess went on to win the Clive Churchill Medal (left) man of the match before getting his hand on the trophy . 'You can never be happy to lose, but considering what was going on they did well. 'That's a good signal of where the team's spirit is at. We can build on that. It's not complete, but we can keep building on that.' Cheika has experienced a whirlwind 10 days since being given a three-year contract to lead the Wallabies. Burgess (right) said goodbye to his loved ones older brother Luke and girlfriend Phoebe Hookeat at Sydney Airport on Tuesday ahead of his flight to England and Bath Rugby . 'It's been hectic. I was only sitting on my couch last week - I wasn't planning on screaming and yelling at guys in training! It's been good,' he said. 'We like to spring a few surprises and have a laugh, keep the players on their toes. 'We want the attitude of being able to switch on and switch off at key moments.'","Sam Burgess unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday afternoon .

"Read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel on how Mark Clattenburg failed to follow his own lead on holding in the box . Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg will miss next weekend’s round of fixtures for breaking protocol so he could watch an Ed Sheeran concert. Clattenburg travelled in his own car to officiate the West Bromwich vs Crystal Palace match in order to get back to Newcastle in time to see the award-winning singer-songwriter perform at the Metro Radio Arena last Saturday. Premier League regulations require the referee and his assistants to travel together to and from games for integrity and security purposes. Mark Clattenburg will not officiate next weekend's games after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games . Clattenburg drove alone to West Brom v Crystal Palace at the weekend so he could see Ed Sheeran perform . Read Jonathan McEvoy's profile of Mark Clattenburg's controversial career . Clattenburg also talked to Palace manager Neil Warnock while in his car, even though the Premier League code allows officials to speak to managers after a game only when all the assistants are present or with the permission of referees’ body Professional Game Match Officials Limited. The PGMOL do not want a situation between manager and referee which might escalate to being one version of a conversation against the other. It is understood serial referee baiter Warnock had wanted to discuss with Clattenburg two incidents during the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns, Wilfried Zaha being denied a penalty and a challenge by Craig Dawson on Julian Speroni that led to a goal and the injured keeper being substituted. After the game Warnock said: ‘It’s just like an assault. How come one of the four officials doesn’t see that? Dawson goes for about five yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face. 'I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann,' added Warnock, referring to how Manchester City's keeper famously suffered a broken neck in a challenge with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy in the 1956 FA Cup final. The Premier League called it ‘an internal matter’ that Clattenburg had not being given a match before expected Champions League duties next week. Clattenburg also broke rules by speaking to Neil Warnock without the company of his assistants . Warnock wanted to discuss the incident that saw Julian Speroni (centre)  injured in a clash with Craig Dawson . Saido Berahino (L) scored a last-minute goal to earn a 2-2 draw for West Brom at The Hawthorns . Clattenburg has previously been cleared of allegedly making inappropriate comments to Jon Mikel Obi in 2012 . Clattenburg has had a controversial career as an elite referee, including serving an eight-month suspension after an investigation into his personal life and business debts. Chelsea also made a formal complaint to the FA about his alleged use of inappropriate language towards John  Mikel Obi but the referee was cleared and the player disciplined. Nine years ago, he infamously ruled out a Pedro Mendes effort from near the halfway line at Old Trafford, even though replays showed the ball clearly crossed the line. Clattenburg will take charge of Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash between Tottenham and Brighton and is due to officiate in the Champions League next week. ADAM LALLANA ROW (January 2014) Clattenburg was cleared by the FA after Southampton complained about comments he made to midfielder Adam Lallana - which were first revealed in Sportsmail. JOHN MIKEL OBI RACE ROW (October 2012) Clattenburg was accused of using 'inappropriate language' towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi during their 3-2 defeat by Manchester United. Clattenburg was eventually cleared after investigations from the FA and Metropolitan Police. Mikel was fined £60,000 and given a three-match ban for threatening Clattenburg after the match. CRAIG BELLAMY ROW (Decemeber 2009) Clattenburg sent Bellamy off for two yellow cards in a match between Manchester City and Bolton, having earlier asked the City bench: 'How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?' SACKED OVER BUSINESS DEALINGS (August 2008) He was sacked by the PGMO board after allegations he owed £60,000 following a failed business deal. In February 2009, after an appeal, he was reinstated as a Select Group Referee but suspended for eight months from August 6 - the date of his original ban - for 'issues relating to his private business affairs'.

The France international forward was reported by match citing commissioner Peter Larter following the offence on Ulster centre Stuart Olding during a European Champions Cup pool game in Belfast last Saturday. Tournament organisers said Taofifenua was suspended following a disciplinary hearing in Dublin on Thursday.

In a statement, European Professional Club Rugby said: 'The independent judicial officer, Christopher Quinlan (England), heard evidence from Taofifenua, from Toulon's legal representative John O'Donnell SC and from the tournament disciplinary officer. 'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, but that it was at the low end (four weeks) of the IRB (International Rugby Board) sanctions for offences of this nature. 'As there were no aggravating factors, he reduced the suspension by one week due to the player's good conduct during the hearing.' Taofifenua, who has the right of appeal, will be free to play again on November 17.","Romain Taofifenua has been handed a three-week ban .

"Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England . If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop . Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016 . In decades gone by, top clubs would raid the lower divisions for players. Ian Rush arrived at Liverpool from Chester and became a European champion. Stuart Pearce was a non-League player and ended up in a World Cup semi-final. These are a couple of examples – there are many others like John Aldridge, Kevin Keegan, Garry Birtles, Alan Smith, Ian Wright – the list goes on. Most of the examples of players plucked from the lower leagues these days are of talented youngsters who haven’t played many first team games, but have standout talent and potential that takes them to a top club – look at Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Hart as two examples. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rare footage of Ian Rush shooting for Chester in 1980 . Ian Rush playing for Chester in 1980 (left) - he would go on to be a European champion with Liverpool . Stuart Pearce pictured in his early years at non-League side Wealdstone (left) and at Euro 96 with England . But I would love to see one of these over-hyped top managers do the dirty work of finding a gem from the lower divisions and polishing him up into a top player. I watched Barnsley beat Bradford 3-1 in League One at the weekend and I saw a striker – Sam Winnall – star for Barnsley. He was superb – his running was clever, he bullied defenders, he found space, he finished, he was aware of his team-mates’ runs, and his work rate was phenomenal. He was the difference between the two sides. He was the top scorer in League Two last season, he can score tap-ins and long range goals (check out his beauty at Oldham in the the Johnstone's Paint Trophy this season). My point is not that he’s a world-beater but he has the raw ingredients, that’s for sure. Sam Winnall made the difference for Barnsley in their 3-1 win over Bradford City on Sunday . The real test of a manager like Jose Mourinho at Chelsea would be to find and develop a lower league gem . Louis van Gaal has spent in excess of £150m at Manchester United seeking a quick fix . No, my point is that if you are Jose Mourinho, Arsene Wenger, Manuel Pellegrini, or Louis van Gaal – surely one of the qualities needed to qualify as a top coach must be to spot talent in the lower leagues and turn that talent into a top player? Were any of those four coaches at Oakwell to watch him on Sunday? No, of course not. It’s easy signing players for anything from £10m to £60m and putting them in the first team. What about coaching a player? Isn’t that part of their job, too? I wonder if any of them have ever heard of Winnall, let alone watched him. I don’t know if he could make it at the top level. But these coaches will never know because they don’t even bother watching him.

"The great FIFA watches farce continued when football powerbrokers Michel Platini and Greg Dyke joked about their contrasting responses after being ordered to return their £16,400 Parmigianis. The watches were given as gifts by Brazil’s football federation to delegates at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo, but FIFA ethics chief Michael Garcia has ruled that they be sent back to Zurich. UEFA president Platini, who had a laugh with FA chairman Dyke about the pantomime while on a train to St George’s Park, has sent his watch back despite saying he would not do so because he doesn’t believe in returning presents. Dyke, though, still intends to auction his watch for the benefit of the FA cancer charity and has informed Garcia of that decision in writing for a second time. Michel Platini poses with Greg Dyke at St George's Park and the pair joked about their posh watches . Platini was relaxed and the Frenchman sauntered across the indoor pitches at the national football centre . Garcia had earlier warned Dyke he could face disciplinary action if the watch wasn’t posted back to FIFA. But Dyke, rightly, is not prepared to be dictated to on such a petty issue. Garcia’s deadline for retrieving the watches was October 24, but there is still no word from him on how many of the 65 were handed back, or on those threatened sanctions. Meanwhile, it didn’t do much for London’s standing as UEFA’s favourite location for their marquee matches when it took Platini three hours to travel from Heathrow to Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium for the Champions League match against Anderlecht on Tuesday night. Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, who control the referees, are doing themselves no favours with their lack of transparency when they are under the spotlight after banning Mark Clattenburg for not travelling with his assistants after a game. Elite assistant referee Sian Massey, at the centre of the sexism storm involving former Sky pair Andy Gray and Richard Keys, hasn’t been selected for any match this season. PGMO will say only that she is ‘injured’ but has not failed any fitness tests. Christian Purslow, Chelsea’s new head of global commercial activities, is yet to meet Jose Mourinho, despite, one would imagine, busy Christian making that a priority. A Chelsea spokesman said their paths had not crossed due to the nature of their jobs rather than Mourinho remembering anything Purslow said about Chelsea when he was Liverpool CEO. Christian Purslow (left) pictured during his Liverpool pomp, alongside commercial director Ian Ayre . Wacky Leeds owner Massimo Cellino regards the number 17 as unlucky, to the extent that it has been taken off the shirt, squad list and an executive box at Elland Road. So the chances of Cellino attending Saturday’s match against Blackpool look slim. Leeds have 17 points after scoring 17 goals and the next match is their 17th of the Championship season. Elleray case haunts FA . The FA only giving referees chief David Elleray diversity training after he made a ghastly racist comment to a colleague, continues to embarrass the governing body. John Cummings, the Northumberland County FA vice-president rightly banned for telling young referee Lucy May that a ‘woman’s place is in the kitchen’, is appealing over the severity of his sentence compared with Elleray’s. Cummings said: ‘Does it seem fair that I get a four-month ban and a £250 fine and Elleray gets a slap on the wrist. I want a fair punishment for what I’ve said and what’s been said elsewhere.’ David Elleray, a former housemaster at Harrow School, came under fire for his controversial comments . Guy Kinnings, IMG’s head of golf, seems the obvious choice from inside the sport to replace departing European Tour chief executive George O’Grady. But it seems that Tour chairman David Williams wants to make an appointment from outside golf. The appointment of Nick Rust, head of retail at Ladbrokes, as the new chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority was kept under wraps because, it is understood, the struggling betting giants were concerned how the departure would affect their share price. Rust’s former racing roles include being director of business for trainer Micky Hammond, with whom he has four horses. Hammond’s racing concern went into voluntary liquidation in 2010, but the BHA say Rust was a director of the company from 2005 to 2007.","Powerbrokers Dyke and Platini joked about the Parmigianis pantomime .

"FA chairman Greg Dyke’s next stated ambition after his England Commission is to restructure the management of the FA. That doesn’t look like good news for the Club England set-up established by Sir Dave Richards in 2010 to run international football for the FA. Two members of the Club England board, Sir Trevor Brooking and general secretary Alex Horne, have left or are leaving the FA. That gives Dyke the opening to disband the group and hand the responsibility of running England business to Dan Ashworth, technical director designate, and performance services chief Dave Reddin. They both impressed the main FA board with a presentation about the way forward for England after the World Cup debacle. A perplexed Football League can’t help identify who is responsible for posting an advertisement in The Times offering a full-time professional football club for sale that owns the stadium and is situated in a ‘fast expanding city in England’.

And Sweden, who withdrew from bidding for the 2022 Winter Games, said they would have re-engaged in the process if the new regulations had come in earlier. One wonders why American sports tycoon Josh Harris, owner of ice hockey’s New Jersey Devils and basketball’s Philadelphia 76ers, turned up at the recent Leaders in Sport conference when he was already well down the road in his Crystal Palace takeover and then denied any interest in acquiring a Premier League club. American investor Josh Harris is in talks with Crystal Palace about purchasing the Premier League club . A Koch and bull story . FIFA executive Alexander Koch made an extraordinary claim that temporary buildings are the only real cost of staging a World Cup and that FIFA spent three times more than Brazil on the 2014 tournament. FIFA’s corporate communications manager told the Host City summit that $600m — the cost of temporary structures — was the real Brazil bill, while the governing body had forked out $1.7billion. FIFA’s spending for Russia 2018 is estimated at $2.1bn. Koch said: ‘There is a complete misunderstanding of what are the costs of staging a World Cup. In Brazil every metro or bus line was put under the cost to get this number of $31bn. But what does this have to do with the World Cup? We don’t need a new bus line or changing a favela. It was never required. The temporary infrastructure, yes, that’s the only cost.’ Koch also added that Germany and South Africa had a vision of why they wanted a World Cup but FIFA were ‘still wondering’ what Brazil’s was — apart from winning it. Whatever Koch’s left-field views, FIFA still made a profit of $2.7bn from the Brazil tournament.","Dan Ashworth will have more responsibility on the Three Lions set up .

Scotland – the better team in the first half – had actually just weathered a dangerous spell from a rejuvenated Ireland when a header from Jon Walters on to his own crossbar and over earned them a corner on the left. Previously, Irish goalkeeper David Forde had plucked Scottish set-pieces out of the air with comfort. This time, though, the ball was played low to Scott Brown and when the Scotland captain laid it in to the path of Maloney the curling shot in to the far corner was exquisite and unstoppable. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan thanked one his coaches, Stuart McCall, for a routine straight from the training ground. The pretty patterns laid out on paper need executing when the stakes are high, though, and moments like this one can define careers. Maloney is a technically talented footballer but one currently playing near the foot of the Championship with Wigan. At almost 32, he may fear his best days are behind him. His goal, though, his moment of supreme calm amid the chaos, has given Scotland something to cling to in a group that looks as though it will last the distance. As such – with games against Gibraltar and a return against Ireland to come in the first half of next year – Maloney's season all of a sudden becomes something more than a scrap against gravity in the English football pyramid. On Friday night Maloney was his country's best player alongside Everton's Steven Naismith. This was not a game devoid of quality altogether but these two provided more of it than most. 'They were brave,' said Strachan. 'Little men in a physical game, where the ball was fizzing about and tackles were flying in. 'As a spectacle this was mesmerising. 'The fans made it special and the players wanted to jump higher, run faster and tackle harder. 'It was like a big heavyweight boxing match.' Narrowly, Scotland deserved their win. They could have been reduced to ten men in the first half when Grant Hanley followed a yellow card with a reckless leap at Forde. As it was, he remained on the field and it was the Blackburn defender's header against his own bar in injury time that came closest to giving Martin O'Neill's team an equaliser. O'Neill will not panic about this loss. His team's chances of qualification probably lie in a home programme next calendar year that sees Scotland come to the Aviva Stadium as well as Georgia and group favourites Poland and Germany. Nevertheless, he knows his team didn't play as well as they can on Friday night.

Scotland's Steven Naismith (right) battles for the ball with the Republic of Ireland's James McClean in the Euro 2016 qualifier . Ireland were the better team for the first 15 minutes of each half. Only in the second, though, did they create chances, Aiden McGeady coming to life as Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall saved from him and from centre forward Shane Long. The second chance – a header from six yards – really should have gone in. That apart, Scotland were on top. Much of their football was hurried. When they did play, however, they were progressive. Naismith was terrific behind main striker Steven Fletcher while either side of the Everton player Maloney and Watford's Ikechi Anya were dangerous. Had Fletcher shown a little more quality and, at times, a sharper instinct, Scotland may have led earlier. The Sunderland player headed an early corner over and another first half chance wide. When Anya crossed low from the left near half-time, meanwhile, Fletcher was caught on his heels. As the stalemate dragged on, so the intensity of the game raised. The crowd had been rather quiet before kick-off but they were soon sucked deep in to the importance, the needs-must nature, of the game.

Midway through the second period, things got a bit much for O'Neill's assistant Roy Keane. He has had a long week. Lectured for his boisterousness by the referee, he responded with a sarcastic salute but moments later he had something tangible to worry about as Scotland surged in to the lead. 'I thought we deserved a draw,' said O'Neill afterwards. 'We were comfortable and I thought we would get something out of it.' With Poland winning in Georgia, both these teams still face a challenge to get out of this group. This, though, was an enormous result for the Scots.

"He still remembers how it all began — on a March afternoon in 1991. Sir Alex Ferguson was in the French city of Montpellier checking out the accommodation for his Manchester United squad ahead of a big match against the local side. ‘Would you like lunch?’ asked the owner of the Maison Blanche Hotel. Out came his finest wines — a Petrus and a Chateau d’Yquem — and Sir Alex left with the hotelier’s wise words of advice imprinted in his memory: ‘Invest in ’82s and ’85s. You won’t go wrong.’ Next month former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson will start to sell off a large part of his wine collection - some 5,000 bottles in total. They are expected to reach more than £3 million at auction . And he didn’t. Because now, more than 20 years later, the most successful football manager of our times is about to make (yet another) small fortune as a connoisseur of fine wine. Next month, Sir Alex will start selling off a large part of his collection — some 5,000 bottles in total (all red, needless to say). And the guide price? An extremely ripe and fruity £3 million. Now, admittedly, in current footballing terms, this might buy you only one leg of a half-decent defender. But, since that works out at an average of £600 a bottle — or £100 a glass — it’s a heck of a lot for a drop of wine. And the industry experts have little doubt that many of these wines will go for well above the asking price when they go under the hammer at three Christie’s sales — one in Hong Kong, one in London and one online. For the guide prices, based on market rates, do not include the added premium of the Ferguson brand, still as strong as ever one year on from his retirement. Sir Alex began collecting wines in 1991 after visiting Montpellier to check out the accommodation for his squad ahead of a Manchester United fixture . For example, the star lots include a half-case (six bottles) of Domaine Romanée-Conti Grand Cru 1999, valued at £50,000-£65,000 (£8,300 to £10,800 a bottle). Romanee-Conti is extremely hard to come by. Very little is produced each year, it is the darling of the Burgundy region and 1999 was one of the best vintages of all time. It was also a vintage year for Sir Alex as his team achieved the magical ‘treble’ — winning the European Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup. And whoever buys this lot will also get a 1999 Manchester United Champions League shirt signed by the man himself. That might be of limited interest to the grandees of the St James’s wine trade (for whom the name ‘Super Reds’ has a different meaning). But it will have huge appeal in Asia, where United are revered as the greatest team in the world. Those half a dozen bottles could easily reach six figures when the hammer falls. Looking through the catalogue of more than 400 lots, it is clear that Sir Alex was as canny with his wine as with his footballers. ‘This is a great time to be selling Burgundy — people are mad about it — and a bad time to be selling Bordeaux,’ says Miles Davis, founding partner of London’s Wine Asset Managers. Sure enough, three quarters of the Ferguson collection consists of Burgundy — most of it from that same highly-prized Romanée-Conti estate. But Sir Alex was judicious, too, in his choice of Bordeaux. For, while the market for many grand old clarets has crashed, it remains extremely strong for Petrus. And, guess what? Sir Alex has bucketloads of that. ‘Petrus is an iconic wine made in small quantities with a very strong following,’ explains David Elswood, Christie’s head of wine. He describes Sir Alex as ‘a very sophisticated collector’ and says a sale of this magnitude might come around only two or three times a year. To see just how shrewd Sir Alex has been, I consult Liv-ex, the London-based global stock market for fine wine sales which can track the price of every wine from release to the present day. Some of these wines are worth 30 times what Sir Alex paid for them. Many of his Burgundies are at an all-time high. Staff at Christies auction house show off a bottle of Petrus 1988, one of 12 to go under the hammer. A retro Manchester United Champions League shirt will also be up for grabs when the three separate sales take place, one in London, another in Hong Kong and the last online . Any bargains? Sir Alex doesn’t do bargains. If you’re lucky, you might pick up a case of Chateau Pontet-Canet 2009 for under £1,000 (with a signed catalogue thrown in). Sir Alex’s drinking days are far from over. He still has plenty of wine, he says, in the cellar of his Manchester home and keeps rather more in a bonded warehouse in an old Cold War bunker in Wiltshire. He can also take the credit for introducing a post-match ritual among the top flight of football management — sharing a bottle of fine wine with the opposition. Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger, he notes, ‘has some decent wines’ and former Manchester City manager, Roberto Mancini would always produce a decent Sassicaia. Not so the management at Chelsea whom he puts at the bottom of the wine appreciation league. ‘Chelsea weren’t very good. I had to remind them that they should have better wine.’ It’s been an extraordinary journey, not just on the pitch but in the glass. And for that, he can thank the Maison Blanche Hotel. So what happened after that life-changing lunch? Sir Alex’s team duly thumped Montpellier 2-0, went all the way to the final and won the European Cup Winners’ Cup.

"If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop . True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce . Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016 . Less than three weeks before Raheem Sterling was too tired to start for England in Estonia, he was one of only a couple of regular members of the Liverpool starting XI who had played the full 120 minutes of the Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough, and endured the draining nervous tension of a very lengthy penalty shootout. He has started all but one of his club's games this season, and played the full 90 minutes in most of them. So what happened in Tallinn? Did Roy Hodgson ignore Brendan Rodgers' dossier again? Or did the Liverpool boss forget to put the note detailing Sterling’s nap times in his satchel when he sent him off for his trip with the England squad? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sterling defends England tiredness . Raheem Sterling came on in the second half during England's win in Estonia after starting on the bench . Sterling was left on the bench for 64 minutes of England's game in Estonia after saying he felt tired . Sterling speaks with England boss Roy Hodgson the night before the game in Estonia . VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness . I’m being flippant when actually this is a very serious issue. Amid the inevitable finger-pointing and blaming that is going on, there is a very real problem facing Rodgers, and that is a teenager facing burnout two months into the season. No surprise that Liverpool wanted Sterling left out in Estonia. The real test will come this Saturday. Nobody can be in any doubt that Sterling will need to be given a few days off – including the weekend trip to his old club Queens Park Rangers. Coming up after that of course, it’s a crucial double header with Real Madrid. Sterling played a huge number of games last season, and then went to the World Cup and played in all three of England’s matches. Liverpool being without Luis Suarez now means the 19-year-old is very much in demand. Brendan Rodgers has been keen to protect his prize asset Sterling at Liverpool . Sterling is under pressure to be Liverpool's match winner following the departure of Luis Suarez (left) It’s not just the physical effect of playing games, it’s the level of expectation that may well be weighing heavy on his shoulders. If he were at Chelsea, or Real, or Manchester City, the quality and depth of their squads would mean he would get a break. Rodgers doesn’t have that luxury. The one time he left Sterling out of the starting line-up this season, Liverpool lost at home to Aston Villa. With Suarez gone, Sterling is now the go-to guy when Liverpool need a match winner, a bit of magic, something special. Not even England place that burden on him – Wayne Rooney fills that role for the country he captains and his years of experience mean he can deal with it no problem. Sterling played 120 minutes for Liverpool in their Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough in September . Sterling is one of Liverpool's bright young stars . Sterling was named Liverpool’s young player of the year in May – he’s too young for these kind of demands. That’s surely contributed to his tiredness. He isn’t under pressure with England – Hodgson’s side won their toughest qualifier in Switzerland, and have virtually won the group already. What makes a teenage footballer tired? Playing against San Marino? Training before a game in Estonia? It's more likely to be the pressure of playing week in, week out and having to produce star quality performances in the Premier League and Champions League. Rodgers could have gone out and tried to sign a star after Suarez left. But he chose instead to build a bigger squad, with players way below Suarez's quality. That was Rodgers' decision but it means now the pressure of being the man to replace Suarez isn’t placed on Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert or Lazar Markovic. It has fallen on Sterling. Is he old enough to cope with that pressure? Does he have that experience? He’s got the quality – that’s not up for debate. But he is still developing and growing as a player, so the last thing he needs is to be used as some sort of pawn in the managerial mind games between Rodgers and Hodgson. Sure, Liverpool pay his wages and Rodgers has the right to pick whatever team he wants. But he also can’t ignore the fact that this teenage sensation is being overplayed. Let’s see if Sterling starts at Loftus Road.","Raheem Sterling complained of being tired ahead of the game in Estonia .

"Connacht prop Nathan White will miss Ireland's autumn Test series after rupturing a tendon in his upper arm in training with Joe Schmidt's squad. The New Zealand-born tighthead faces surgery next week and could now be sidelined for as long as four months. The 33-year-old was lined up for his international debut against South Arica next weekend. His absence further drains Ireland's already stretched front-row resources. Connacht prop Nathan White will be out of Ireland's autumn internationals after suffering an arm injury . The former Leinster front-rower had been expected to understudy Mike Ross across the autumn series, with Marty Moore already out for three months after shoulder surgery. Now head coach Schmidt and Ireland will be pinning hopes on Leinster's experienced front-rower Ross recovering from groin trouble as expected to shore up Ireland's scrum. Leinster's 34-year-old scrum cornerstone Ross is expected to return to full training next week. With White the latest star to lengthen Ireland's injury glut, his return gains even greater importance. The big-scrummaging Springboks would have looked to take on Ireland's set-piece even if the Aviva Stadium hosts were at full strength up front next weekend. White's absence, allied to Moore's shoulder surgery, leaves Ireland short of experience at tighthead for the South Africa clash. White could be out of action for four months as he is due for surgery on a ruptured tendon in his arm . Schmidt had admitted he promoted White into the squad for his potential debut on the strength of his lengthy top-level club career, expecting the 33-year-old to handle Test intensity better than several promising but young and raw prospects. Now the former Leinster coach must draw on Connacht's versatile front-rower Rodney Ah You and Munster's Stephen Archer as potential understudies to Ross. Former schoolteacher Schmidt should at least be able to call on Jack McGrath at loosehead prop as he aims to step up his return from injury, offsetting somewhat Cian Healy's long-term absence. Ireland will still be shorn of at least 15 stars for the visit of Heyneke Meyer's Springboks, however, before entertaining Georgia and then Australia across the three-Test Guinness series.","Nathan White was set for Ireland debut against South Africa in November .

"Canadian Nick Taylor picked up his first win on the PGA Tour on Sunday as he won the Sanderson Farms Championship. The 26-year-old from Winnipeg - in his first season on the Tour - finished two shots clear of the field in Jackson. It is some achievement in just his 13th full-time start and he becomes the first man from his country win on the tour since Stephen Ames five years ago. Nick Taylor hoists the trophy after winning the Sanderson Farms Championship . A final-round 66 helped him finish 16-under-par for the week and earns him a cheque of £450,000. He was so untroubled that he could even afford a bogey on the par-four last, with a run of birdies from 13 to 15 having got him into a winning position. 'It's been a whirlwind of a summer; six months ago I was struggling,' Taylor told the PGA's official website. 'I'm shocked but I'm happy about it. 'I felt very comfortable, I had some nerves but I was able to make some putts.' Taylor watches his putt roll on the 18th green during the final round of the Sanderson Farms Championship . Boo Weekley and Jason Bohn came home tied for second after respective rounds of 66 and 69. Overnight leader John Rollins finished fourth and will be left kicking himself, with the three shots between him and first avoidable. He dropped three shots coming home on 12,14 and 18, losing his game when he needed it the most after a level front nine.

"Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England . If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop . True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce . The two recent qualifiers for England didn’t exactly get the pulses racing did they? Two routine wins in the end. But one thing that did excite me a lot from both games was the link up play between Jack Wilshere and Wayne Rooney. There’s an understanding which is on the brink of being telepathic and it’s something special that England have rarely had. When Fabio Capello was in charge of England, Rooney linked up with Steven Gerrard in an equally exciting way. They instinctively knew where the other was. Go back and check out a 3-1 win in Belarus – Rooney and Gerrard made Minsk magic that night. In fact that whole qualifying campaign for the World Cup 2010 saw England play some of their best football of recent times with Rooney and Gerrard at the heart of everything good.

England's record with their dynamic duo is better than when they are missing (source Opta) Sadly, Capello lost his nerve and seemed to lose his mind with team selection, tactics and pretty much everything else about managing a team at a World Cup, once they pitched up in South Africa. This time it could be different. Roy Hodgson seems to understand what makes Rooney tick. The England captain can make some great runs, peeling off a defender, finding time and space - even in the box. Wilshere loves to play a killer pass. I’m not one for checking pass completion statistics – if I make 50 two-yard passes back to my keeper as a centre half per game my pass completion stats will be amazing. Wayne Rooney embraces Steven Gerrard after scoring for England in their 3-1 win over Belarus in 2008 . Rooney scores the second of his two goals in England's World Cup qualifying win in Minsk . I suspect his stats suffer because he tries to play difficult balls sometimes. But that’s what you want from top players – adventure, trying the spectacular, having that imagination and creativity to go for something amazing. It was only San Marino last week, and only Estonia on Sunday – I get that. But I saw the signs of a link up between Wilshere and Rooney that might not win England the European Championship in 2016, but it will definitely make us pleasing on the eye. Roy Hodgson seems to have an understanding of how to get the best from his captain Rooney .","Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere linked up brilliantly for England in Sunday's 1-0 qualifying win over Estonia .

"Anyone else fed up with the fawning over the Arsenal Invincibles 10 years on? Boring. Here’s what that team achieved – failure in Europe when the Champions League was there for the taking, and at the same time they directly helped Jose Mourinho become greater than Arsene Wenger. Funny how the Wenger lovers conveniently ignore all this. The myth of the Arsenal Invincibles grows beyond all credible recognition as every year passes without another title or any Champions League success for the Gunners. VIDEO Scroll down to see several Invincibles congratulate Wenger before his 1000th game . Arsene Wenger is photographed with the Premier League trophy outside Islington Town Hall in 2004 . The Gunners were led by Patrick Vieira (second from left) as they went the entire season unbeaten . There has been so little to shout about since that unbeaten season in 2004 that Arsenal fans and admirers insist on relentlessly eulogising about the awesome power and glory of the Invincibles. One Gooner is living in the past so much they have even written a book about them. I’ve already ripped the myth of the Invincibles to shreds elsewhere. In brief, here’s why. When they were named the best ever Premier League team, they were overrated: they collected 90 points – five fewer than Chelsea the following season; they scored 20 goals fewer than Manchester City in 2011-12. It was a good side that won the title in 2003-04, but they certainly weren’t the best Premier League team ever, and they probably weren’t the best Arsenal side to win the title. The Premiership title was the only trophy they won that season – other Arsenal teams did doubles, Manchester United did the Treble in 1999. How could the 2003-04 team be the best? It doesn’t add up. They ended the season playing for draws just to preserve the unbeaten record – the best teams go out to win matches, and win them in style. But when placed into its historical context, that Invincible season has proved to be the worst thing that ever happened to Arsenal Football Club. Let’s take a look at what happened: by the end of February, the possibility of going the season unbeaten in the Premier League was becoming a probability. Arsenal won at Chelsea on February 21 and that was a huge hurdle for the Gunners to overcome. Many thought that if Arsenal could avoid defeat at home to Manchester United on March 28 that would be their last big test. They drew the game 1-1. Including those two matches, Arsenal played five League matches in that period, an FA Cup tie at Portsmouth, two Champions League games with Celta Vigo, and then the quarter final first leg away to Chelsea. That’s a total of nine games in five weeks. Wenger kept the same team for all nine games apart from alternating Jose Antonio Reyes and Dennis Bergkamp, and using Gael Clichy twice at left back instead of Ashley Cole. After that draw against United, Arsenal faced four games in nine days over the Easter period. United knocked the Gunners out of the FA Cup at Villa Park. A few days later Chelsea turned up at Highbury and Wayne Bridge’s late goal ended the Gunners' Champions League challenge. A Thierry Henry masterclass resurrected Arsenal on Good Friday after they trailed to Liverpool at half time. And then on Easter Sunday it finished goalless at Newcastle. Thierry Henry celebrates the Premier League triumph as Arsenal set about ruling English football . That side created by Wenger was widely regarded as the best Arsenal squad ever assembled . Thirteen games in just over six weeks called for some astute squad management. But with one or two exceptions the same players were used over and over again, and so their European campaign suffered, and they didn’t have enough in the tank to beat Chelsea. I suspect that Wenger became obsessed with his place in history, and completing the league season unbeaten, rather than focusing on how to win both the title and the Champions League. What a mistake! A huge error because had Arsenal beaten Chelsea they would have had to face Monaco and then Porto to secure their first ever European Cup success. That would have guaranteed Arsenal’s place in history as the first London club to ever win Europe’s top prize. It gets worse. Wenger’s obsession with the unbeaten Premier League season cost them in Europe, and opened the door for Mourinho to win the Champions League with Porto. Off the back of that he got the job at Chelsea, and became Wenger’s unbeatable nemesis over the last 10 years, when only token FA Cup glory has papered over the dirty great seismic cracks. Jose Reyes tackles Portsmouth midfielder Nigel Quashie during the disappointing draw at Portsmouth . Paul Scholes scores for Manchester United to defeat Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park . Arsenal were dumped out of the Champions League by Chelsea after this Wayne Bridge strike at Highbury . Jose Mourinho (hugging Paulo Ferreira) won the Champions League that season with Porto . Arsenal ended up winning the title by 11 points that year. If Wenger had rested top players at the right time in the run-in that season, they may have lost a couple of games in the league, but they had room to spare. Instead the Frenchman chose to rinse those players, stay unbeaten, and it cost them the even bigger prize of Champions League success. The Invincibles – draws with Birmingham, Portsmouth and Spurs. Is that glory? The Invincibles should have won the title and the Champions League. Instead, the mismanagement of Arsenal allowed Mourinho to turn Wenger from a man who nearly won something in Europe, to a specialist in failure. VIDEO Wenger concerned by Chelsea gap .

"The ugly American fallout from the Ryder Cup has been reignited after Rickie Fowler - the US wonderkid - hit back at Phil Mickelson - the team's de facto leader - for his public criticism of Tom Watson's captaincy at Gleneagles. Mickelson and Fowler had forged a close bond on tour, with the former Masters, Open and US PGA champion taking the younger Californian under his wing and the pair playing regular money games against each other. But that hasn't stopped Fowler, 25, taking aim at Mickelson over the embarrassing character assassination the 44-year-old dealt Watson in September. Fowler, speaking in China at the WGC-HSBC Champions event won by Bubba Watson on Sunday, not only insisted that any grievances against Watson should not have been made in public, but also gave clear backing to Watson's captaincy, saying he did a 'great job' and calling the eight-time major winner a 'legend'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Phil Mickelson slams US Ryder Cup captain Watson's strategy . Rickie Fowler (right) with US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson (centre) at Gleneagles in September . Phil Mickelson was openly critical of Watson in a now infamous press conference after the event . Fowler was in action last week at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in China, won by Bubba Watson . 'The unfortunate part, I believe, is that stuff that happens in the team room should stay there,' said Fowler. 'I thought Tom did a great job of talking to the guys. He had been there plenty of times, and I enjoyed the time I got to spend with him. I respect him, he is a legend within the game. 'Some things may have got blown a little bit out of proportion. But obviously we didn’t play as well as we needed to in order to win.' Intriguingly, both Fowler and Mickelson are on the 11-man 'task force', which also includes Tiger Woods, appointed to end American misery in golf's biennial showpiece ahead of the next match at Hazeltine in 2016. The US have lost eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups against Europe, never got close to Paul McGinley's side in Scotland, then aired their dirty laundry in public thanks to Mickelson's comments in that now infamous press conference. Paul McGinley (top) leads European celebrations after their victory at Gleneagles . Mickelson and Fowler are regular golfing partners and play practice rounds together . Fowler, who finished in the top five at every major championship this year, hinted that the 'task force' would have some lively discussions over the direction US golf needs to take to avoid future embarrassment. And he admitted one thing Mickelson would surely echo: 'It sucks losing'. 'I am looking forward to getting together with the guys to see what everyone has to say,' saifd Fowler. 'Clearly, we want to win the Cup, and it is not as if there has been a lack of motivation or anything like that. It sucks losing. Everyone is aware of that and everyone wants to win.'","Rickie Fowler said Phil Mickelson was wrong to criticise Tom Watson .

"Gordon Strachan faces a growing headache over his starting line-up to face England on Tuesday night with all his star names desperate to be part of the action. The Scotland boss had planned to rest most of those who battled their way to a bruising and draining Euro 2016 win over the Republic of Ireland. But the players have told Strachan they are keen to face England in the Celtic Park friendly and the Scots boss is now rethinking his original plan to hand those on the edge of his first XI a Parkhead start. Scotland skipper Scott Brown leads the way during training on Monday ahead of the clash with England . Gordon Strachan says his stars are all desperate to play against England on Tuesday . Cardiff City keeper David Marshall is put through his paces during the session . After settling on a line-up over the weekend, Strachan admitted the issue is now far from decided. ‘I had an idea a couple of days ago - but the players who played the other night keep banging on that they are fit enough to play again,’ he said. ‘They’ re dropping hints everywhere I go. ‘I need to rethink my strategy. From the training today nobody wanted to be rested, that’s for sure. ‘It was like the first day of pre-season in training. We’ve so many players who want to play. There were a few bumps but it was old-school rub it down and get on with it.’ Despite the Ireland game dominating the national mindset for the last month, a rare chance to face the Auld Enemy in a reprisal of the world’s oldest international fixture holds huge appeal for Strachan’s squad. ‘I would say a wee bit of that is because it’s the fixture,’ he admitted. ‘We’ re only human . Strachan says he has a selection headache for the game at Celtic Park . Strachan oversees training on Monday as his players try to stake a claim for a starting spot . Scotland star Ikechi Anya was all smiles following Friday night's win against the Republic of Ireland . Strachan takes a moment to mull over a question from reporters during his press conference . Brown shows off his keepy-uppy skills during training as he prepares to lead his troops into battle . ‘If someone said to us we are playing some team that’s 70-odd in the rankings we wouldn’t be as excited around this table, all of us. We’re only human. We only want real, competitive games. This is a competitive game for different reasons, even if there are no points available.’ Strachan planned to field the likes of goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Manchester United’s Darren Fletcher and West Brom’s James Morrison – posted missing from the Ireland game with a severe virus. Morrison’s condition has improved, but both he and Fletcher are still doubts after the Old Trafford man failed to train on Monday. That could force Strachan to turn to old stagers like Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew for their second international game in a week – despite an intense workload at club level. Playing down suggestions of tiredness amongst his squad, the Scots boss added: ‘It’s not so much the players who say it, it’s the coaching staff. ‘As one famous manager said “I’ll tell you when you’re tired”. When he asked the question “who’s tired in here?” and some unfortunate kid put their hand up and we just stood by and watch him get terrorised. Strachan grabs a word with Everton forward Steven Naismith . Jim Stewart briefs Scotland's shot-stoppers before the session near Glasgow . ‘You have to remember Messi and Ronaldo, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea, they’ re all playing 60-odd games. The top players’ mindset is “play, play, play” so then what you think is hard work is not hard work to them, it’s the norm. ‘Top players now have to play 60 games a season. If you want an easy life go to a mediocre Championship club and you can get nine weeks break sometimes. If you want to be a top player get your mind around playing every week and dealing with that.’ Opposite number Roy Hodgson arrived with his squad on Monday afternoon and immediately took the opportunity to familiarise them with Celtic Park. Hodgson is buoyed by last year’s 3-2 win over Scotland at Wembley although a disappointing World Cup campaign means he does not have to look far for critics. Anya juggles with the ball as Scotland's stars looked relaxed ahead of the friendly fixture . Anya made light work of the slalom during the training session in Bishopton . A less than exciting European qualifying group for England means the fixture has an added air of importance and Hodgson is looking forward to tasting the white hot atmosphere. ‘The fans here, they’ll certainly give Celtic and Scotland incredible support and that’s something we’ll have to deal with in terms of not letting it affect us too badly mentally, he said. ‘For some of our younger players they won’t necessarily have experienced that type of atmosphere in their careers.’ When asked which fixture between the two nations stood out in his mind, he replied: ‘The one that we played last year at Wembley. It was an excellent game, very, very close, very well-fought and incredible atmosphere because a lot of Scottish fans had travelled down to Wembley for the game. ‘It’s a very exciting game, it’s a big game. We know we’ll be given a very tough test up here and we know that Scotland will be very keen to win the game and I’m certainly hoping that we have the same degree of hope and expectation from our side.’","Gordon Strachan's side looked relaxed during training on Monday .

"It appears Sam Burgess body clock hasn't quite adjusted to UK time yet after flying from Sydney. The 25-year-old tweeted at 5:33am on Thursday: . 'I'm Up bright and early this morning. Big day coming up at @BathRugby... Can't wait. But first, I've got to find some coffee. Where you at?' Sam Burgess fears it could be 'a couple of months' before he makes his union debut but  is eager to win the respect of his team-mates after officially being unveiled as a Bath player. The 25-year-old cross-code convert posed for pictures and met his new team-mates on Thursday, having flown to Bath on Tuesday after saying goodbye to girlfriend Phoebe Hookeat and older brother Luke at Sydney Airport. Burgess agreed a three-year deal with Bath in February and will be hoping to play for England at the 2015 World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sam Burgess say goodbye to loved ones at Sydney Airport . Sam Burgess was unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday following his switch from rugby league . 25-year-old has joined Bath on a three-year contract after leaving NRL side South Sydney Rabbitohs . Burgess (left) has joined the Aviva Premiership side with an aim to represent England at the 2015 World Cup . Burgess (right) said goodbye to his loved ones older brother Luke and girlfriend Phoebe Hookeat at Sydney Airport on Tuesday ahead of his flight to England and Bath Rugby . Burgess left rugby league on a winning note after putting in a man-of-the-match performance as South Sydney Rabbitohs beat Canterbury Bulldogs 30-6 in the NRL Grand Final. It was the Rabbitohs' first title in 43 years and Burgess also claimed the international rugby league player of the year award. However, he fractured his cheekbone in the first minute of the game and will not rush to make his first appearance for Bath - despite the enormous weight of expectation on his shoulders. He said: 'We haven’t put a date on or put any pressure on ourselves. The surgeon said to be smart and take my time. I’ll work hard with the medical staff. ‘It’s probably a bit of a blessing that I can see the game at ground level before jumping in at the deep end. I honestly don’t have a ball park at all. It could improve drastically or take a while. ‘We’ll see how I go in training. It could take a couple of weeks or even a couple of months.’ There will be a lot for Burgess to adapt to in the coming weeks - including, it seems, a new time zone. Burgess tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning as he struggles to overcome jet lag from flying . Burgess shared an Instagram photo of his excitement at his official unveiling at the Rec on Thursday . It's clear he hasn't recovered from the jet lag yet after he tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning about his excitement at moving to Bath. 'I'm Up bright and early this morning. Big day coming up at @BathRugby... Can't wait. But first, I've got to find some coffee. Where you at?' he wrote, before later uploading a picture to Instagram as he waited to be unveiled to the media. Burgess also admitted his knowledge of rugby union is limited after growing up playing the opposite code for Bradford Bulls and then the Rabbitohs. ‘I didn’t watch a great deal of union growing up,’ he said. ‘Everyone’s familiar with the 2003 World Cup. Mike (Ford) has sent across a lot of footage but I’ve only watched from a distance. It’s really important to earn the respect of my team-mates.’ Bath coach Mike Ford played a key role in signing Burgess and was keen to stress he will not be forced into action too early. He said: 'The injury is a blessing. He can learn the game without any pressure of when he’ll play or where he’ll play. He’ll play when he is ready. We just don’t know when that will be. He’ll play when he’s ready. We just don’t know. The guy has a pretty beat up cheekbone. The last thing I want to do is play him too early.’ Burgess added: 'It is just sinking in. I have only been here just over 24 hours. The club and the staff are fantastic, and I am really looking forward to meeting the team. So far, it has been a cracking experience. Burgess (left) played on with a suspected broken cheekbone for South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final . Burgess went on to win the Clive Churchill Medal (left) man of the match before getting his hand on the trophy . 'Being in a team environment is one of the most powerful things. I am not getting carried away with anything. I understand it is going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of commitment to achieve what I want. The former Bradford Bulls loose forward was lured to Bath by the prospect of following in the footsteps of Jason Robinson - the only Englishman to switch codes and win the union World Cup. 'It is always nice to talk with people who have been in your situation before. I have spoken to Faz (Andy Farrell) a couple of times, but nothing in depth. With the NRL competition in Australia, I was very much into that and didn't want any distractions,' he added. 'Jason (Robinson) has been in touch, and I am sure we will sit down and have a chat. These guys are successful people.' Bath have yet to reveal where they see Burgess fitting into their team, with back-row and midfield as possible options. There is already talk of an England call-up.

The Bath star celebrates with Russell Crowe (left) after the Rabbitohs won the NRL Grand Final match . Burgess poses after being awarded rugby league's International Player of the Year award last week . 'A few areas (positions) have been thrown around,' he said. 'If I am quite honest, I don't know where I am best suited. Over time, I think that will become clear. 'Nothing is set in stone, and there is no pressure on myself from Mike to do anything. I am just going to get in there, knuckle down and do my best. 'It (England selection) is something I have no control over. There are always going to be outside influences that have their opinion. That's part of the game, part of the sport and part of the challenge to ignore what is going on. 'In rugby league in Australia you are scrutinised in fine detail, so I have learnt a lot in five years over there. Hopefully, I can bring that here with me into my new career at Bath.' Sam Burgess' switch from rugby league to union makes him the latest player to move between the two sports. Here Sportsmail looks at some other converts who have gone on to represent England in the past. Jason Robinson . Joined Sale Sharks from Wigan in 2000. Part of the Lions tour of Australia in 2001 and won the World Cup with England two years later. Scored a total of 28 tries in 51 caps. Arguably England's greatest-ever convert. Chris Ashton . Switched codes in 2007 leaving Wigan Warriors for Northampton Saints. Has scored 19 tries in 39 caps for England to date. Kyle Eastmond . Left St Helens for Bath in 2011 and has won four caps for England so far. Stephen Myler . Joined Northampton in 2006 from Salford City Reds. Has made one England appearance but is in the squad for the autumn internationals. Andy Farrell . Left Wigan for Saracens in 2005 but had a injury-plagued career in union. Featured in the 2007 World Cup and won eight caps for his country. Joel Tomkins . Like Farrell, Tomkins followed the same route in 2011 before returning to Wigan in June. He won three caps for England as he struggled to adjust to the 15-a-side game. Shontayne Hape . Joined Bath in 2008 from Bradford Bulls and started at inside centre for England at the 2011 World Cup. The former New Zealand rugby league international scored two tries in 13 appearances for his adopted country. Lesley Vanikolo . Made the switch from Bradford to Gloucester in 2007 but only won five caps for England. Henry Paul . Joined Gloucester from Bradford in 2001 but endured a miserable time in union, switching back to league with Harlequins in 2006. Returned  to union two years later with Leeds Carnegie. Won six caps for England between 2002-06.","Sam Burgess joined Bath on a three-year contract from Sydney Rabbitohs .

"The numbers are in and the result is a draw. Well, nearly. Not everybody will be swayed by the evidence. The Premier League’s PR department will be quick to insist that the biggest, most important figure of all still points to a very substantial revenue gap between the Premier League and Bundesliga; a gap of £1billion a year. But here’s the thing. Some things are more important than money. German supports, like the ones in Borussia Dortmund, feel part of their clubs . The atmosphere in Bundesliga stadiums isn’t just more exciting because the tickets are cheap, beer is freely available and fans can stand. It’s because supporters feel that it is still their club they’re cheering on. Staffed and run by people they know, brimming with local talent, owned by no one in particular, and thus belonging to everyone. Commercial pressures notwithstanding, the Bundesliga have been careful to protect the deep emotional ties and sense of identity that are unique to football. Germans know the product would play much better internationally if they would swap communal ownership for sheiks, American investors or oligarchs. They are unwilling to do that deal. You don’t sell your soul. Scarves are seen on the seats as a present for the 120th anniversary of Bayern Munich in 2010 . Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp gestures to his team during a Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart . Growing organically is a long, arduous process but it’s also a rewarding one. When you can’t take short-cuts to greatness via Abu Dhabi, you have to be more diligent in your work and smarter with your resources. In the Bundesliga, football hasn’t forgotten the natural order of things. You get ahead and rich by winning, not the other way round. For years, Germans would look on with a mixture of horror and envy as turbo-charged English clubs dominated Europe. Now they’re immensely proud that they’ve caught up with the Premier League without compromising their ideals. OK, almost caught up. Maybe we could settle this by penalties? The atmosphere in Bundesliga stadiums isn’t just more exciting because the tickets are cheap .

"On Sunday, Tiger Woods said that he would definitely get a pick for the Ryder Cup if he was in captain Tom Watson’s shoes. The great ones never lack self-belief, do they? Never mind that Woods had just finished with his worst 72-hole score in a major, taking 24 more shots than he delivered in securing victory at the 2006 Open; he was even five strokes worse than 64-year-old Watson. Perhaps it is as well for America’s Ryder Cup hopes at Gleneagles in September that Watson the wise is looking for something a little more substantial than blind faith. VIDEO Scroll down for Woods holds hand up after poor display . Hopeful: Tiger Woods believes he should be part of the US Ryder Cup team . Nothing certain: Tom Watson, pictured at the Open on Sunday, admits Woods isn't an automatic pick . ‘Everyone thinks I am going to pick Tiger automatically but I can assure you that is not the case,’ said Watson. ‘I’ve said all along I’ll pick Tiger if he’s healthy and playing well. He’s looking like he’s playing without pain, which is good, but what I was also hoping for from this week was that he would make some money and get in the FedEx Cup. How is he doing today? Is he under par?’ Alas, he was not, as he followed up his triple bogey at the seventh on Saturday with a double on his way to a three-over-par 75, a dismal score on a day when, in Watson’s words, ‘the course was there for the taking’. Watson is desperate for Woods to play in the FedEx Cup is as the four play-off events that make up that competition are the principal tournaments leading up to the Ryder Cup. Frustrating: Woods was expected to perform better at the Open despite recently returning from an injury lay-off . VIDEO Woods holds hand up after poor display . The top 125 contest the first one and Woods is currently outside the top 200. His poor finish here will have done little to improve his placing. Woods now has two events left to clamber up the rankings. The good news for Watson is that these two events are the Bridgestone Invitational in 10 days at a Firestone course where he is a serial winner, followed by the USPGA Championship over the same venue at Valhalla where he won in 2000. Asked if he would consider playing in Europe if he didn’t make the FedEx, Woods said: ‘I’ve still got two events to go and I’m planning to be there.’ Disappointing: Woods would have hoped to have performed a lot better at the Open . Watson acknowledged: ‘It would be up to him if he played in Europe. But it would certainly make it tougher for me to pick him if he is not playing.’ The pressure is on in Tiger’s next two events. ‘I just made way too many mistakes to compete,’ said Woods. ‘What was it, two triples and three doubles? But the good news is I got some game time and I am still building and getting stronger all the time. It’s encouraging in terms of getting over the injury but there’s obviously an awful lot to work on.’ Not much time, either. His next two events will surely decide his Ryder Cup fate.

"You’ve had the announcement that Carl Froch and George Groves will meet again in what I believe to be the biggest British fight of all time. They have been slagging each other off privately on Twitter for weeks – more of that later – and now it’s time to work out some of the logistics. I can reveal here that my two frontrunners for the venue on May 31 are the Emirates Stadium and Wembley. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Groves and Froch nearly coming to blows during their first fight weigh-in . War of words: Carl Froch and George Groves have been trading blows already via direct messages on Twitter . Shake on it: Eddie Hearn completed the deal for Froch to fight Groves (pictured signing his contract live on TV) last week . People have suggested that I have ruled out Wembley because England will have a football match there against Peru on May 30. That’s not true. It is a massive logistical challenge to stage a fight of this magnitude just a day later but I am doing everything I can to make sure I have the best options available. That includes Wembley. We are also looking at Old Trafford and the City Ground in Nottingham, but my heart says this is a London fight. This is a statement fight, a fight that will show where boxing stands. Front runner: The 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium could host the British Fight of the Year between Froch and Groves on May 31 . Big event: Wembley Stadium remains in the running to host the big bout too despite England playing Peru there 24 hours beforehand . For me, I want nothing less than the challenge of getting a massive stadium and filling it because I think this fight merits that. As part of making that statement, I think it doesn’t get much bigger than Wembley. The Emirates would be superb as well. I was there at the weekend to watch Arsenal beat Liverpool and the facilities are outstanding. Like anything in boxing, we have to crunch the numbers and see what offers the best value, but, like I said, I do not want to undersell this fight. I believe we can fill a huge arena. Vintage: Late great Henry Cooper and legendary heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali fought twice - the first at Wembley Stadium in 1963 . Rematch: Highbury hosted the 1966 rematch between Cooper and Ali, where the American retain his heavyweight title with victory . Some people in the industry tell me this is a fight for 60,000 people. That would be perfect for the Emirates. But I do think we can do 80,000 people. More than 20,000 people have already signed up to our ticket alert site and I think we could sell 40,000 tickets in a day. That is also why, as much as Carl would love to fight in Nottingham, I want to look at bigger venues. Arsenal would love to stage it. They staged Muhammad Ali-Henry Cooper at Highbury in 1966 and one of their directors, Ken Friar, was telling me how much they want to be involved. It’s going to be a special night. I can also reveal here the depth of the hate between Carl and George. I became aware a few weeks back, while George was making his appeals to the IBF, that they had started sending direct messages to each other on Twitter! George was accusing Carl of ducking him, Carl was biting back and saying he was going to knock him out. They must have sent 12 messages each, George goading Carl and Carl responding. Tricky trees: Froch, pictured with former Nottingham Forest striker Nathan Tyson in 2006, would love to fight at his beloved City Ground... and it remains a possibility . On the list: Old Trafford, home of Man United, could see Froch and Groves return to the city of their first fight . Joshua will prove he is the BEST of British by going after Fury and Chisora... but superstar must wait until next year . Froch-Groves II MUST happen this year... and my dream is to have it at Wembley in front of 80,000 fans . It’s that animosity that has made this the single most challenging promotion I have ever been involved with. There is so much genuine hatred there that every point of negotiation has been a battle. Neither man wanted to give up anything. It got to the point where, among a bunch of other things, they were arguing over what seats their guests would have at ringside and no-one wanted to back down. Thankfully we got there in the end. George has worked tirelessly to force this fight and Carl appreciates what the public wants. He has never ducked a fight in his life and after some of the things that were said following the last one I think he feels he has a few scores to settle. Unfinished business: Froch wants to put the Groves saga behind him once and for good when they meet again . Bitter feeling: Groves remains upset over his controversial stoppage by referee Howard Foster when he lost to Froch last November . It has bothered him, some of the stick he has taken from the public, because Carl has spent his career proving he is one of the great warriors in the history of the sport. Now he is going in with some real purpose. That makes him an extremely dangerous man fighting an extremely talented young fighter who is convinced he can win. I am so excited. This fight is huge and whichever stadium we end up in will reflect that. Imagine the build up, the anticipation and that epic night with the biggest crowd in post-war boxing history as both of these great fighters put it all on the line. It’s making the hairs on my neck stand up just talking about it. Ready to rumble: Froch and Groves can't wait to meet each other in the ring again as they prepare to embark on a huge nationwide roadshow to promote their blockbuster bout . Ricky Burns is back in Glasgow on March 1 for the most important fight of his career. It says everything about the guy that he’s excited to face such a quality fighter as Terence Crawford in his first fight since what happened against Raymundo Beltran. I’ll never forget visiting Ricky in the hospital after that fight, I’ve never seen a man is so much pain. He was lucky and unlucky that night. He was lucky to get a draw, but unlucky to fight for half an hour with a broken jaw. Boxers are different to normal people, but not many could endure what he did that night. Last time out: Ricky Burns managed to keep his world title despite being floored by Raymundo Beltran in his last contest . Pain game: Burns escaped with a draw in a hard-fought warn with Beltran back in September last year . Hurt: Burns suffered a broken jaw during the Beltran clash in Glasgow . When I saw him on the hospital ward, he . was screaming. He was in so much pain, pure agony. The fact he fought . through that just makes you appreciate how tough he is. He needs to be ready for this Crawford fight. Crawford is red hot, dangerous and has won all 22 of his fights - 16 by knockout. He is tough, he is Ricky’s mandatory challenger and I think it is the best fight in the lightweight division. Oddly enough, it’s the kind of fight Ricky will love. He is a raw fighting man. He is so humble. He does nothing flash. I’m sure he doesn’t even spend what we pay him – he doesn’t go in for Ferraris, mansions and all that. He still works each Saturday in his mate’s sports shop. He doesn’t need to do it, but he does. That’s Ricky. Can he win this fight? A lot of people don’t think so, but I think he will, possibly by a late stoppage. It’s interesting that before this fight Crawford didn’t have a passport and has never been outside the US. How will he travel? How will he adapt when he sees and hears 10,000 Scots screaming for Ricky? I think that will be a big factor. From that point of view, I am calling on all Scots to make yourselves heard and get Ricky over the line, he is a true champ. Challenger: American Terence Crawford will arrive in Scotland with an unbeaten record from 22 fights with 16 victories coming by the way of knockout . On the undercard, we have John Murray fighting John Simpson. That is set up to be a belter. And Anthony Joshua fights Hector Alfredo Avila. This guy took Dereck Chisora nine rounds less than a year ago, so people are going to get a real idea of where AJ is in his development. Big time: Unbeaten Anthony Joshua will fight this Saturday in Hull against tough opponent Hector Alfredo Avila . Luke Campbell has his fifth fight on Saturday in Hull. Every time I watch him I admire just how talented he is. Like AJ, he is an Olympic champion, one of the finest talents I have ever seen and we are plotting the early stages of his career. My view is that this will be his last tune-up fight and then we will put him in at title level. I would say that by the end of the year he will have a British title and by the end of 2015 he’ll be a world champion. Heading for the top: London 2012 Olympics gold medal hero Luke Campbell has been tipped to become a world champion by the end of 2015 . Head-to-head: Eddie Hearn captured Campbell (L) sparring with Kevin Mitchell last week and posted this picture on his Twitter account . He is more experienced than Anthony – he had well over 100 amateur fights – and I’ve been amazed by how well he has equipped himself in sparring people like Ricky Burns and Kevin Mitchell. He is a 5ft 9ins southpaw lightweight – he is heading for the top. Eddie Hearn is running this year's London Marathon to raise money for the Haven House Children's Hospice.

"At last Sepp Blatter appears to be coming around to the use of technology. I say appears as the man has said many things in the past which have not materialised, such as not standing for his fifth term as president of the world governing body – something he went back on when he announced he would stand again on Monday. It is often at election time that he comes out with some of these popular proposals which do not materialise - but hopefully this is one that does not fall into that category. New ideas: Sepp Blatter hopes to trial the referral system at the 2015 U20 tournament in New Zealand . Major benefit: Premier League referees such as Mark Clattenburg (pictured) will benefit from technology . For a long time I have advocated football experimenting with systems to see just how, or indeed if, technology can assist referees in their accurate calling of major decisions. This was born out of frustration from my time as a top-flight referee and seeing replays of incidents in my games where I had made a clear error but was unable to change my decision - despite being aware that my initial view was likely to be wrong. That is incredibly frustrating and technological assistance is well overdue. An example of this was during the France versus Ireland World Cup play-off game in November 2009. Thierry Henry clearly handled the ball before crossing it for France to score their winning goal and qualify for South Africa. The referee Martin Hansson  considered giving up refereeing following the incident. He knew that something was wrong, as one does in such situations, but he can do nothing about it other than ask the other officials. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sepp Blatter speak to Sportmail's Jeff Powell . Henry's handball: A review system could stop incidents like this from happening in the future . When they confirm that they have not seen anything untoward you have to allow a goal that you instinctively know should not stand, which has to be wrong. It also seems illogical that the only person who needs to see replays is the one person who cannot currently see them. It is interesting that Blatter is suggesting a system whereby the on-field referee has the final decision after a coach or manager has made a challenge. That might be the best way, although it is open to abuse by unscrupulous coaches who work in a tactical way. There might be a better way and I would encourage Blatter to try a number of review systems and compare the results. Questions that should be considered include: . The ultimate aim must be to correct the clear and obvious inaccurate decisions made in good faith by the on-field referee. If the initiators of reviews are the coaches then a limit on the number of challenges would have to be in place. Once used, this could mean a terrible error cannot be corrected and that would defeat the object of the exercise completely. How should it work? Blatter’s system will require a coach/manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed, rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with Hawk-Eye. At the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident. If there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision, if not it will stand. How many referrals per team/half/match? This is to be confirmed but I would expect no more than two challenges per team  and possibly only one per half. If the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used. When will it be used? Penalties – both those given and those not given, often when simulation is involved. The issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation. Offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals. These happen infrequently as Premier League assistants are so good but the Liverpool-Chelsea game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation. Finally red card tackles and off-the-ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal. Does it strengthen or undermine the referee? The inability to review glaring errors which everyone knows are wrong undermines referees and giving them the ability to review and correct their mistakes can only help the game. Of course if one particular referee keeps losing challenges then he will be exposed as a poor referee and that cannot be a bad thing. The best referees will be highlighted as the best umpires in cricket are. It would be good to see how many times referees are actually right. How might it be exploited? Allowing coaches to be the instigators of challenges could allow them futile appeals to disrupt play and take the momentum away from opponents. Imagine a team is 1-0 up with five minutes to play and under sustained pressure. Their coach has two appeals left, so they will use a referral in order to waste time and get tactical instructions out to his team in order to take the ‘heat’ out of the game. He could then use another review within a minute in order for the game to peter out. We all know the coaches who would attempt to do this.","FIFA could handed managers in-game referrals to challenge decisions .

"Ron Ganfield, take a bow. That was perhaps the worst assistant refereeing performance I have ever seen with so many key incidents judged incorrectly. First of all, he failed to see that Branislav Ivanovic was in an offside position and allowed him to score Chelsea's second goal. Then as Eden Hazard chased a through ball, Tim Howard clearly came out of his penalty area and handled the ball. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho on Diego Cost's feud with Everton players .

Head to head: Referee Jon Moss (left) watches on as Tim Howard (centre) and Cesar Azpilicueta (right) clash . From first viewing it was clear and replays made it look even worse - it is impossible to fathom how it was missed. Howard should have been dismissed and surely would have been had any other Premier League assistant been running the line on Saturday. Later in the first-half Diego Costa was put through and was onside but Ganfield flagged and then repeated his error in the second half when Romelu Lukaku broke away for Everton. There was no favouritism by the officials - both sides were penalised incorrectly. Jon Moss, perhaps caught up in Ganfield's inefficiency, then allowed Howard to escape a red card again following Chelsea's third goal. First, he ran out and grabbed Costa's shirt. Then he went head to head with Azpilcueta. Yet only a yellow card for the American keeper. An incredible game of nine goals, blessed with amazing ebb and flow, was perhaps ironically helped by the consistently poor officiating which also allowed Costa to also escape a red card. He should have been shown two yellows and dismissed. Booking: Tim Howard (left) is only yellow carded by referee Jon Moss (centre) but should have been sent off .

"Three more Premier League managers have given their strong backing to Sportsmail’s Hands Off In The Box campaign. Newcastle’s Alan Pardew, Queens Park Rangers’ Harry Redknapp and Garry Monk of Swansea yesterday all called for tougher action to put an end to wrestling, grabbing and shirt-pulling in the penalty area. They want the rules to be made clearer to officials in charge of their matches and for clubs to be given a detailed explanation of their application. Pardew has called on referees’ chief Mike Riley to make it clear what sanctions will be taken against the practice ahead of this weekend’s round of Premier League fixtures. Pardew said: ‘It’s very important, because there has been the Daily Mail’s campaign and a lot of media talk, a lot of talk on the radio, that Mike Riley actually gives us an indication of what they’re going to do. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has responded to Sportsmail's campaign by calling on referees to act . Harry Redknapp and Garry Monk have also spoken out about illegal defending in the box this week . ‘I would hate for them to do a crackdown without a prior warning. They have done that in the past. Suddenly we start getting decisions: “Oh yeah, we have made it a policy and we’re going to change that”. Why not let us know then? ‘Some managers perhaps think it is an advantage and they can get away with it. ‘It would be nice to know what Mike Riley is going to do. This question is really for him and he needs to answer it.’ Pardew is growing tired of inconsistent decision-making and would accept if his team were penalised for holding in the box against Liverpool tomorrow, provided the same decision is given at the other end. ‘Those big decisions need to be made,’ he added. ‘If we have a decision against us about grappling we are going to have to accept it. Likewise if Liverpool, who are struggling at set plays, decide to use that tactic then I expect to see a penalty.’ Redknapp believes grappling in the box has come into the English game due to players and youngsters watching foreign football on television. Eliaquim Mangala was clearly seen hauling Paul Dummett to the ground on Wednesday night . Stuart Attwell, despite glaring evidence, did not give Newcastle United a penalty during the first half . He claims the practice did not take place back when he was a player and that children are taught from a young age to mark correctly from set pieces — so it is not down to coaching. Redknapp said: ‘No-one grappled in those days, it’s a new thing. It was watching foreign football. In Italian football they used to mark like that years ago. It didn’t happen in England. ‘Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner’s being played in. I’ve said it for years. Inigo Calderon was guilty of pulling Harry Kane down in the Brighton penalty area on Wednesday . Referee Mark Clattenburg, never one to shy away from controversy, did not give a penalty . ‘You don’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That’s happening more and more. Hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.’ Monk, in charge at Swansea, wants referees to be handed clearer rules so they can act when defenders pull back attackers at set pieces. ‘Referees need to be more consistent but the rules can be clearer too,’ Monk said. ‘It’s an art to defend and to take contact away completely with everybody marking zonal would take away from the game. Ryan Shawcross has made a conscious effort to not pull, but was seen with his arms around Graziano Pelle . ‘But there’s a line you don’t cross and it is making sure the line is clear. That line is when you have been beaten by the man, he’s got away from you and you are pulling his shirt and grabbing his arms. That’s what you have to stamp out. The refs need to be given a clear rule as it would be an easier decision for them.’ Leicester boss Nigel Pearson discourages his players from doing it in training. He said: ‘If I see it in training, I give a penalty because that’s what happens in a game’. John Terry, Chelsea captain . 'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.' Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . 'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker . 'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.' Graham Poll, Former top referee . 'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.' Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . 'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.' Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . 'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.' Alan Pardew, Newcastle manager . ‘It’s very important, because there has been the Daily Mail’s campaign and a lot of media talk, a lot of talk on the radio, that Mike Riley actually gives us an indication of what they’re going to do. Harry Redknapp, QPR manager . ‘Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner’s being played in. I’ve said it for years.  You don’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That’s happening more and more. Hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.’ Nigel Pearson, Leicester manager . ‘If I see it in training, I give a penalty because that’s what happens in a game’ And the readers of MailOnline... 'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath . 'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I've been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I've ever seen.'

"Diego Costa was involved in an incident with Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson that left some supporters claiming the Chelsea forward should have been sent off. Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict... Diego Costa is a superb centre-forward who plays like an old-fashioned English target man. He is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at Burnley. There was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson after he was being held in the area. Perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee Kevin Friend been slavish to the law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he should have been sent off. The fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at Turf Moor. Diego Costa and Gylfi Sigurdsson grapple as the hosts prepare to take a free-kick .

"Some players arrive like a whirlwind and then can’t follow it up in the second season. Stevan Jovetic took a season to bed in, but is now ready to make his impact. I first saw him play for Montenegro against England; he’s an allrounder. Quick, athletic, bright around the ball. He will go past a defender and he can score goals. Not playing at the World Cup has helped him. He looks on fire. Star man: Jovetic scores his first of two goals as he explodes into life this season for Manchester City . Improved: Jovetic had a tough first season marred by injury, but he has all the attributes to succeed in England . Stevan's stunner: How Jovetic scored his superb second goal against Liverpool . Already a trip to Spurs in August is looking a key game for Liverpool. That’s where they go next and they need to get a result. They can’t afford to let City and Chelsea get too far away. A £45million star with a £16million fee . You have got to admire the confidence of Brendan Rodgers. Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini and Cesare Prandelli couldn’t turn Mario Balotelli, but the Liverpool manager believes he can. I’m going through the full circle of emotions on this: people say he is a cheap buy for £16m when you think Shane Long cost Southampton £12m, but he’s only cheap if he succeeds. Watching on: Liverpool missed a striker of Balotelli's class tonight, but his behaviour will have to be managed . Milan have dumped him a for a reason. His attitude sucks and Liverpool have built their progress on teamwork. On talent alone, he’s a £45m player. It certainly won’t be quiet with him around. It's not all about Chelsea . It must be a nightmare for a defender. You are given a chasing by Edin Dzeko and Jovetic... and then on comes Sergio Aguero. The little magician now has two goals in two games from the bench. Last night, City had Aguero, Fernandinho, Kolarov and Milner on the bench. I wonder if too many people have been too quick to hand Chelsea the title this season. Qaulity: Sergio Aguero ends the game as a contest just 23 seconds after coming on as a substitute . The bench boys: Aguero was one of a host of stars on the City bench and his impact was instant . You just have to adore Zabaleta . When we talk about the foundation of the modern Manchester City, it is easy to focus on the mighty Vincent Kompany. But Pablo Zabaleta is a warrior too. When they lifted the title last season, he got the biggest cheer and the supporters adore his appetite and passion. Passion: Manchester City have been built around Vincent Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta, who the fans love . Signed by Mark Hughes for around £6m, he has been a brilliant capture. If you have a child who wants to be a footballer, get him to watch Zabaleta. He doesn’t play thinking about what car he’s going to buy. He plays to win.","Stevan Jovetic has hit the ground running this year .

"Meticulous preparation helped Pierluigi Collina become one of the finest referees we have seen in football. And he had certainly done his homework before Chelsea's Champions League encounter with Barcelona at Stamford Bridge in 2005. 'I knew that at corners everything was done by Chelsea to help John Terry head the ball,' says the Italian in an interview prompted by Sportsmail's campaign to put a stop to wrestling in the penalty area. 'Blocking. Certain tactics. My focus had to be around Terry.' In the 76th minute of the second leg of a tense last-16 tie, Chelsea earned what proved the all-important corner. The score was 4-4 on aggregate, with the Catalans set to advance on the away-goals rule. As Damien Duff delivered the ball, Collina had those legendary piercing eyes fixed on Chelsea's captain. Chelsea defender John Terry (left) rises highest to score a header against Barcelona in March, 2005 . Terry's team-mate Ricardo Carvalho (second from right) had pushed over Barca keeper Victor Valdes . Barca's players appealed to referee Pierluigi Collina but the Italian official allowed Terry's goal to stand . 'What I saw was the opponent almost handle the ball in trying to stop Terry — and I saw Terry head the ball cleanly and the ball then finish in the net,' he says. 'I gave the goal and I felt confident I had achieved the correct result. But afterwards, when I watched the video of the game, I realised that what I had completely missed was contact between Ricardo Carvalho and the Barcelona goalkeeper, Victor Valdes. Had I seen that, the goal would not have been given. But it was impossible for me to see something so far away from where I felt my focus needed to be.' Collina recalls this story to illustrate a point after agreeing to join the debate raging in the English game following a spate of high-profile incidents in the Barclays Premier League. Led by Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign, which Collina has been following, there is now a desire among senior English referees and members of the Premier League hierarchy to tackle those masters of the dark arts. Collina believes extra officials can be a big help . Collina does not wish to interfere in what he respectfully recognises as 'a domestic issue'. But he will discuss, in his role as UEFA's chief refereeing officer, how the problem has been addressed by European football's governing body. In Collina's opinion, the introduction of additional officials standing at the side of the goal has gone a long way to eradicating incidents of blocking and wrestling in the Champions and Europa Leagues. Such cheating was something he considered a serious problem, and he was a central figure in finding a solution. 'We introduced additional referees to the Europa League in 2009 and the Champions League in 2010, and we started to see these kinds of incidents less and less,' says Collina. 'Incidents can still occur. They can still be missed because, at the end of the day, we are talking about human beings here. But based on our experience this in no longer a major issue in UEFA competitions. 'My point with that Chelsea game is the fact that, as a referee, you will know which players are most likely to commit these kinds of offences. So with one pair of eyes that is the area you will attempt to concentrate on. You will do your best. 'But a second pair of eyes, in the form of an additional referee, gives you more control of the penalty area, which of course is where most of the important decisions in a game will be made. 'It isn't a perfect system but it is a good system and it works in two ways. Firstly because, of course, it is difficult for one person to see everything. He can focus on the most risky players but an additional referee, who communicates with the referee using a microphone, can see something more. 'I can tell you about Howard Webb, and two games he refereed — one at Euro 2012 and a Champions League semi-final game between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich last season. 'There were two decisions that were made based on what the additional referee had seen. We know this because we have listened to the conversations.' Extra officials placed behind the goals in European competition have helped stop wrestling according to Collina . Collina believes an extra pair of eyes behind each goal gives the referee more control of the penalty area . Collina explains that there is another reason why additional referees are effective in tackling the problem. 'As a deterrent to the players,' he says. 'It's like when you drive your car and you see a policeman on the side of the road. Even if you are not speeding you instinctively slow down. If the players know there is another set of eyes looking for these offences, they are less likely to offend. 'There has been a misconception that additional referees were brought in simply as an alternative to goalline technology. This is not the case but I'll give you an example of where there is a crucial difference. 'In the Scottish Cup final last season additional referees were used. At one point a St Johnstone player has a header saved by the goalkeeper before the ball rebounds back off the player and crosses the line. 'Goalline technology would have said 'no goal' in the first instance and 'goal' in the second. What it would not have seen was the fact that the ball came off the St Johnstone player's hand the second time. The additional referee did see it and the goal was disallowed.

Manchester City supporters get behind Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign outside the Etihad . City defender Eliaquim Mangala (third from right) got physical with Paul Dummett in the Capital One Cup . 'When you had the case of mistaken identity last season involving (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs, in Arsenal's game against Chelsea, I do not believe this would have happened had there been an additional referee. It is very difficult for one person in that area. Mistakes can still be made but fewer important mistakes will be made if the officials have more control in the penalty area.' Additional referees are now employed in domestic leagues in Italy, Belgium and Turkey, as well as the Champions League and Europa League. But Collina says more than 30 domestic leagues now use the additional referees system in what might be considered their more important matches. 'Last season I featured in a television programme for Sky in England with Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness,' adds Collina. 'At first they were very sceptical about the system. But after I showed them a series of incidents on video to illustrate where it can be useful, their opinion completely changed. Then they felt additional referees should be used in all leagues. The benefit to them was clear.'","Former referee Pierluigi Collina has been following Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign .

"Defensively against Swansea, Manchester United were all over the place. But forget three at the back or four at the back. They could play any system they want but it would make no difference — the players are just not good enough. So much has been said about Louis van Gaal and how he is going to take the 3-5-2 that worked so well with Holland at the World Cup and use it with United. But I’m already sick of talking about systems. It doesn’t matter what formation United play, it’s about the quality of the players and at United that quality is sorely lacking at the moment. VIDEO Scroll down for Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with this result . Dejected: Wayne Rooney and team-mates look on after United go 2-1 down against Swansea . Problems: Louis van Gaal has brought a new system to Manchester United, but they need new players . It sounds simplistic, but how many of the United team who started on Sunday would get into the Man City or Chelsea teams? Maybe Wayne Rooney at a push, but that’s about it. In a way having a decent pre-season was the worst thing that could have happened to Van Gaal as all it did was raise expectations. The good news for him, though, is that he still has time to bring in some new faces, but who is going to want to come in? The way United are at the minute you could get Van Gaal, Bob Paisley and Jose Mourinho to manage them together and even they would have a job getting them back into the top four. Tough ask: Even Jose Mourinho (left) and Bob Paisley (right) would have a job lifting United up .

Ramsey can become Arsenal's Lampard . Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Before he broke his leg in 2010, Aaron Ramsey was talked about as one of the best young players in Britain. He is truly living up to that billing. Arsenal did not play that well against Crystal Palace but Ramsey is starting to become like their own Frank Lampard. Frank was so good at scoring vital goals for Chelsea, particularly late on. Now Ramsey is doing the same. He’s full of confidence and he is like a magnet to the ball in the area. He is a phenomenal athlete, as his running stats below show. He covered more ground than any other player in the game and that energy and athleticism is why he is finding himself in the right place at the right time so often. Poached: Aaron Ramsey pumps his fist after grabbing Arsenal's winner against Crystal Palace . City have to keep their spine solid . Of all the top sides to play this weekend, Man City looked the most accomplished. They had the trickiest fixture away at Newcastle but still had more than enough quality to put them away. Lots of people have tipped Chelsea to win it this season but City will make a much better fist of retaining the title than they did the last time they won it. The key for City is keeping the spine of their team fit. Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero only started five Premier League games together last season, but City still won the trophy. If they can keep those boys playing, there is no reason why they can’t go on to defend it this time around. Spine: Manchester City showed their strength during the 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Saints to survive . After the firesale on the south coast this summer, plenty of people expect Southampton to be battling relegation. They will be fine. Victor Wanyama is a beast in midfield, Morgan Schneiderlin is an asset if he stays and James Ward-Prowse is an excellent young player. Nobody expects them to do as well as last season but they proved at Anfield they are still a good side and they were unlucky to lose. Fight: Saints surprised a few with their promising performance at Anfield on Sunday . Credit to Villa . There were some impressive results over the weekend and Aston Villa’s win at Stoke was the second best of the lot, only behind Swansea's victory at Old Trafford. Everybody would have had them down to get beaten three or four-nil but they were set up perfectly, so credit to Paul Lambert and Roy Keane. At Villa Park last year the pressure suffocated them but on the road they are free to sit back and counter. Vital start: Villa took a surprising three points away from Stoke, with many tipping them to go down . VIDEO Lambert delighted with team effort . Penalty problems . It was not a good weekend for penalty takers. Mark Noble missed his first penalty in years for West Ham and Charlie Austin missed the chance to get a vital point on the board for QPR. I missed one or two in my career, but I’ve never understood why players try to place the ball. It’s OK if you send the keeper the wrong way, but if he guesses right you give him a chance with a weaker shot. Sometimes it’s just better to put your foot through it! Disappointing: Allan McGregor saves Charlie Austin's penalty as Hull beat QPR 1-0 on Saturday . Bring on Burnley . We all know what to expect from Chelsea on Monday night, but I think a lot of people are going to enjoy watching Burnley this year. Sean Dyche has done brilliantly to get them back in the Premier League and I like the way they play their football. Keep an eye out for Kieran Trippier and Danny Ings, two youngsters set to impress. At 23, Trippier could go on to be an England right back. He is a good crosser of the ball, is good at set-pieces at both ends of the pitch and he takes a good free-kick. As for Ings, he is a real livewire and after 26 goals last season he means business. Excitement: Sean Dyche faces his first test as a Premier League manager... against Chelsea . 2 - Crystal Palace might have wished Tony Pulis had stuck around a little longer after their opening-day defeat by Arsenal. Both goals they conceded at the Emirates came from set-pieces, but in 26 Premier League games under Pulis last season, Palace let in only one from set-plays. 3 - Formerly known for their steely defence, Stoke have become a bit leaky of late. Mark Hughes’s side have managed to keep only three clean sheets in their last 23 Premier League matches. Rooney is edging closer to Henry's number . 174 - Wayne Rooney scored his 174th Premier League goal. He is now just one short of Thierry Henry in the all-time list. 7 - Some players are clearly more comfortable playing away from home and Gylfi Sigurdsson is one of them. Seven of his eight Premier League goals for Swansea have come on the road. 6 - Steven Naismith has become a useful player for Everton. The Scot has been involved in six goals in his past nine games, scoring four and setting up two. 22 - Luis Suarez was the main man at Liverpool last season but Daniel Sturridge’s goals were more valuable. Including last season and Sunday’s strike against Southampton, Sturridge’s goals have been worth 22 points to Liverpool. 84 - It was not the debut Tyler Blackett would have had in mind, but the young Man United defender completed more passes than any other player in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea.","Van Gaal has brought a new system, but Manchester United need better players .

"Saeed Ajmal has been suspended from bowling for Pakistan after the International Cricket Council ruled his action is illegal. It has been deemed by the ICC that the 36-year-old spinner straightened his arm by more than 15 degrees in all of his deliveries while he was being tested in Brisbane. A statement from the ICC said: 'The International Cricket Council today confirmed that an independent analysis has found the bowling action of Pakistan's off-spinner Saeed Ajmal to be illegal and, as such, the player has been suspended from bowling in international cricket with immediate effect.

'The analysis revealed that all his deliveries exceeded the 15 degrees level of tolerance permitted under the regulations.'

However, there was to be no reprieve this time around for the world's number one ranked bowler in one-day internationals. He was also reported by the match officials during Pakistan's seven-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in the first Test in Galle last month. Ajmal, Worcestershire's overseas player earlier this season, underwent testing Down Under on August 25 by the ICC's accredited team of Human Movement Specialists using the National Cricket Centre, who ruled his action was illegal. The ICC's decision means Ajmal is immediately unavailable to bowl in international cricket and the ban will remain until he modifies his action before he can apply for a re-assessment. Highly regarded: Ajmal is the world's top-ranked one-day international bowler . He is the third cricketer to receive an international bowling ban for an illegal action in recent months, with New Zealand's Kane Williamson and Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake suspended in July. The news will come as a huge blow to Pakistan as Ajmal has been a star performer for them in all three formats. Ajmal, who took five for 166 in the first innings against Sri Lanka in Galle, has played 35 Tests, 111 ODIs and 63 T20 internationals for Pakistan, taking 446 wickets in all three formats. He finished his spell with Worcestershire with 63 wickets in nine LV= County Championship Division Two matches. That is still the leading mark in either division this season, while England all-rounder Moeen Ali has spoken in glowing terms of how Ajmal helped his bowling while they were at New Road together. Ajmal also played for the county in 2011. Ajmal is currently the world's top-ranked one-day international bowler.","Saeed Ajmal has been banned by the ICC for an indefinite period .

Feeling the heat: Alastair Cook could be under real pressure if England lose to India at Trent Bridge . Both sets of fans seem subdued. The English fear for Alastair Cook and the fitness of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. The Indians worry about their ability to claim 20 wickets, and their lack of experience. Either way, we have been spared too much gloating-in-advance. The likelihood is that we will get a cagey series. Cook is lucky to be captain after the fiasco at Headingley, where his blinkered tactics condemned England to their first home series defeat by Sri Lanka. If India go 2-0 up, England will be looking for a new captain. Yet Cook’s one saving grace is that he will be up against a man who has not led his side to a Test victory outside India for three years. Since beating West Indies in Jamaica in June 2011, India have played 14 matches overseas, drawing four and losing 10. And it is a sequence that, for MS Dhoni, includes several days akin to Cook at Headingley. Almost as bad as India’s 4-0 defeats in England and Australia were their failures to win last winter in Johannesburg and Wellington. In the first of those, it was  – mystifyingly – South Africa who stood accused of bottling it after closing on 450 for seven in pursuit of 458 on an up-and-down last-day pitch at the Wanderers. And at Wellington, with New Zealand beginning the fourth day effectively six for five, Dhoni was alarmingly quick to shed his slips. Brendon McCullum responded with a triple-century. Despite his reputation as an aggressive limited-overs batsman, Dhoni is not a man for whom Test-match offence comes naturally. The reason he is still in a job tells you plenty about the different priorities of English and Indian cricket. Under Dhoni, India have been the best limited-overs tournament team in the world, winning the 2011 World Cup, the 2013 Champions Trophy, and almost completing the hat-trick before losing to Sri Lanka in the final of the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in April. Even if England ever manage to reach another World Cup final, it’s unlikely that this success would spare the captain if he were to keep losing Test series – especially to Australia, especially 5-0. That doesn’t make the English way better; it’s just different. Drive to succeed: Cook bats in the nets ahead of the first Test . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . Dhoni also inhabits a different world from Cook’s, straddling the sporting and celebrity nexuses with a calm assurance that may stem, in part, from his own sense of inviolability. Whenever journalists attempt to ask him a politically sensitive question at a press conference, a BCCI minder steps in. Yesterday, the BCCI’s own website published an exclusive interview with him – the first that has appeared anywhere for some time. It goes without saying that his woeful record overseas didn’t get an airing. Yet this, it appears, is how things work: Dhoni speaks on his own terms, or not at all. In one sense, Cook and Dhoni do have something in common. Both have the blessings of higher forces: Dhoni is protected by Srinivasan, while Cook is being cheered on by England MD Paul Downton, who has staked much of his reputation on backing him, while sacking Kevin Pietersen. Limited appeal: MS Dhoni is a superb one-day captain but is less effective in Test matches . And yet you suspect something will have to give over the next seven weeks. Victory for India, and Cook won’t be able to blame a Mitchell Johnson or an Angelo Mathews. Victory for England, and even Srinivasan may reflect that Dhoni’s captaincy just isn’t working at Test level. The whole thing could hinge on how well Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli handle the swinging ball – assuming it swings at all. Their partnerships could provide the sights and sounds of the summer. Otherwise, don’t be surprised if we are not treated to a classic, for this series pits a team that has forgotten how to win against a team that wins only at home. And both captains are – or at least ought to be – concerned about what happens next. May the less fearful side prevail. It’s easy to mock cricketers for being dull interviewees, so let’s hear it for Devon Malcolm, whose response to a question in All Out Cricket magazine prompted uncharitable thoughts of a wind-up. Asked which living person he most admired and why, Dev said: ‘Margaret Beckett (Labour MP for Derby South), she is so honest and consistent. She is a role model of mine – in any decision I think, “What would Margaret Beckett do?”’ And to think we always imagined that the inspiration behind Malcolm’s you-guys-are-history seven for 57 against South Africa at The Oval in 1994 had been Fanie de Villiers… . Centre of attention: Devon Malcolm (centre) walks off at The Oval after taking nine for 57 vs South Africa . Andrew Strauss writes in the Sunday Times that part of the reason Duncan Fletcher is held in ‘high regard’ by the players he has worked with is his ‘healthy disregard for the media’. Strauss uses his – presumably well-paid – column in the media to make this point. Quite obviously cricketers are not going to enjoy every word that’s ever been spoken or written about them. But it seems strange to applaud as ‘healthy’ a disregard for the people who convey the sport to those not lucky enough to attend matches in person – especially when you’re now one of those people yourself. Disregard: Andrew Strauss (left) enjoys taking a pop at the media despite now being part of it . How democratic is the new ICC now that most the power lies in the hands of India, with a little left over for England and Australia? Last week we were reminded of the venues for ICC events in the next cycle of media and sponsorship rights (2015-23) – and provided with an answer to the question. After the forthcoming World Cup early next year in Australia and New Zealand will come the following: the 2016 World Twenty20 (in India); the 2017 Champions Trophy (England); the 2019 World Cup (England); the 2020 World Twenty20 (Australia); the 2021 Champions Trophy (India); and the 2023 World Cup (India). In other words, it will be 10 years at the earliest before the global event takes place anywhere outside the confines of the Big Three. Let’s hope the rest of the world doesn’t lose interest in the meantime. There was uproar last week when people took offence at the way other people had taken offence at the fact that Maria Sharapova had never heard of Sachin Tendulkar. But what did they expect? A sane and rational shrug of the shoulders from manic fans who regard Tendulkar as a deity? No, me neither. Who are ya?

"Kevin Pietersen appears unlikely to play any first-class cricket this summer after Surrey resisted the temptation to draft him into their LV= County Championship squad to travel to Worcestershire. There were suggestions, up until last week, that Pietersen - who has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket since being axed by England last winter - might yet help his county out in their final two championship matches. But third-placed Surrey, still in with only rank outsiders' chances of promotion from Division Two, have decided instead to look to the future by giving younger players another opportunity away to table-toppers Worcestershire in a match starting on Tuesday. Specialist: Pietersen has played for Surrey in T20s this season as well as travelling to play the shortest form . Absent: England's former batsman has not featured in the four-day game for his county at all this year . Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart explained the reasoning to his club's official website, kiaoval.com, saying: 'We discussed it, [head coach] Graham Ford and myself, the possibility of bringing Kevin in. 'But realistically, we've got just an outside chance of promotion. 'So it's better for the future of the club if we give the likes of an an Aneesh Kapil or Arun Harinath two first-class games to gain more experience to see how they can progress - which will stand us in good stead for next season.'

"Cricket took a step into the unknown last week. It was a funny kind of unknown, because everyone knew it was coming. But it was still a step into the unknown. We talk, naturally, of the appointment as ICC chairman of Narayanaswami Srinivasan. Sporting politics can be as dry as a stick. It’s why this story hasn’t received the coverage it should have done, especially in England, where we should be up in arms. But this story matters. And it goes beyond the question of Srinivasan’s involvement – or lack of it – in the IPL spot-fixing scandal currently being investigated by India’s Supreme Court. Let’s begin by reiterating a basic argument: it’s not OK for a man who has been instructed by the highest court in his land to stand down as president of his national board to then assume control of the world game. If Srinivasan is considered unfit to run the BCCI, he should not be handed the reins at the ICC, an organisation which – in theory at least – sits higher up the food chain. Chief: Newly elected International Cricket Council chairman Narayanaswami Srinivasan (left) This is not to judge him guilty in . advance. It is simply to adhere to the basic tenets of good governance, . as spelled out by Lord Woolf in his 2012 report into the way the game . was being run. Needless to say, his report has been all but ignored. No . competent or credible global organisation would dream of appointing . Srinivasan until the question marks hanging over him had been dispelled. That this is even up for debate is part of cricket’s problem. But, . like we said, it goes deeper than this. For it is a question of trust. Do we trust Srinivasan to run world cricket with a multilateral touch, . with more than lip-service paid to the notion that world cricket means . more than India, England and Australia? Do we trust Srinivasan at all? Certainly, . Justice Mudgal was unimpressed with his explanation of the extent of . his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan’s involvement with Chennai Super . Kings. When Srinivasan’s . coronation was rubber-stamped last week in Melbourne, he was asked about . the Supreme Court’s decision to force him out of his BCCI position, . however temporarily. Srinivasan claimed he had ‘voluntarily’ stepped . down. This came as news to . many observers, because the same man who claims he volunteered to be . removed from the BCCI presidency actually appealed against the decision – . twice. Who was he appealing against? Himself? Srinivasan . also poured cold water on the idea that the BCCI would have walked away . from the ICC had they not been able to force through – with the help of . England and Australia – the financial restructuring of the game’s . governing body. The BCCI, he insisted, would not have ‘dreamed’ of such . behaviour. This presented . other administrators – Srinivasan’s own allies, no less – with a problem . on two fronts. Both the ECB and Cricket Australia have tried to spin . the line that their cooperation with the BCCI was necessary in order to . prevent India absconding from cricket’s high table. Question of trust: Srinivasan was forced out of the BCCI over his son-in-law's involvement at Chennai . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . As . luck would have it, of course, this arrangement was also of financial . benefit to the English and Australian boards. But we’re quite sure this . had nothing to do with their decision. No, it was all about keeping . India inside the tent – a tent which, according to Srinivasan, they had . no intention of leaving anyway. Or . did they? In early June, BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel said: ‘We told . [the ICC] that if India is not getting its proper due and importance . then India might be forced to form a second ICC of its own.’ Either . the ECB and CA exaggerated the threat of the BCCI walking away, or . Srinivasan was stringing them along. Both possibilities reflect poorly . on the men who now run our game. Then . there is the question of the executive committee – ‘ExCo’, to give it . its appropriately Orwellian nom de plume. India and its ever-faithful . courtiers England and Australia have a permanent seat on this five-man . committee, which will decide pretty well everything that matters in . cricket. To be invited on . board is to win the acceptance of the Big Three – a ticket to . respectability and influence now that the other Full Member nations of . the ICC have been persuaded into voting for reform. So well done, for . the time being, to Pakistan and West Indies, whose representatives will . make up the initial five. Corrupt: Former India bowler Sri Sreesanth is serving a life ban from cricket due to spot fixing in the IPL . Delivery stride: Sreesanth in action for India in 2011 . Yet . on all the other committees (finance and commercial affairs, governance . review, development, and anti-corruption), there is not a single seat . for the South Africans. Even Peter Chingoka gets to sit on the . development committee, which will raise an eyebrow among those who have . observed with dismay the basket case that is Zimbabwean cricket. Why . this absence of proper democracy in the new all-democratic ICC? No . doubt it has absolutely nothing to do with the identity of Cricket South . Africa’s chief executive Haroon Lorgat, who was a constant thorn in . Srinivasan’s side when Lorgat was chief executive of the ICC. The . upshot of making three countries more powerful than the rest – and, . let’s face it, of making one of those three more powerful than the other . two – is that the concept of checks and balances vanishes altogether. It . never attracted more than a fleeting acknowledgement in the first . place: the old veto owned by England and Australia, followed by India’s . dominance, saw to that. But cricket has now given the thumbs up to a . scenario in which the notion of an independent executive has been tossed . aside like an old pair of batting gloves. Who, . frankly, will look after the global interests of cricket if every . nation is driven primarily by their desire to claim a chunk of the power . and cash handed out to them by the Big Three? Srinivasan . claimed in Melbourne that cricket didn’t have an ‘image problem’. Apparently he wasn’t joking. But he might want to consider this: as FIFA has discovered, when the administrators become the story, you know it’s . time to worry. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Telling it like it is… and isn’t . There’s . no question that Kevin Pietersen’s new column in the Daily Telegraph is . required reading, as much for the between-the-lines interpretations as . for the words themselves. His column on Saturday contained plenty of . salient points, especially about the captaincy of Alastair Cook. But was . there a hint of revisionism about his critique of Cook’s second-innings . declaration during the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord’s? Pietersen . was scornful about Cook’s decision to set Sri Lanka 380 in a day, . arguing that ‘setting out for a target of 320 would have been enough’. Yet when he arrived at Lord’s that day, he tweeted: ‘Want to see SL out . 460 & ENG bat positively to a 380 lead then declare…entertain today . pls, Cook’s men!’ Miserable run: England captain Alastair Cook lost the Test series against Sri Lanka this month . Critic: Former England star Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey in the Natwest T20 Blast . In the . event, Sri Lanka were dismissed for 453 (tick), before England scored at . 3.86 runs per over (tick) to lead by 380 (tick) before declaring . (tick). Part of Pietersen’s beef, he now makes clear, is that Cook . should have declared before stumps, yet the excellence of Shaminda . Eranga that day meant England were forced to recalculate. Sometimes, the . other team can play well too. Pietersen . also claims England scored at ‘3.4 an over’ at Lord’s. Not so. In their . first innings, the figure was 4.4; overall in the Test, it was 4.2. There . are plenty of reasons to worry about this England team, and Pietersen . nails a few of them. But his case would be strengthened if he a) took a . consistent line, and b) got his facts right. Jimmy’s tears . Was . the emotional reaction of Jimmy Anderson after the Headingley defeat by . Sri Lanka evidence, as Pietersen suggested, of an unhappy . dressing-room? Possibly – though it feels like a slightly literal . reading of lachrymosity. This . column feels Cook is no longer the right man to lead England, but . Anderson’s tears are not part of the problem. If anything, a team that . can come within two balls of batting throughout the last day after . beginning it five wickets down is full of spirit. The . issue is not that they want to do well for England – it’s that they are . playing under the wrong man. Another interpretation of Anderson’s . response is that he cares deeply. In other words, all hope is not yet . lost. Hurt: Jimmy Anderson shed tears after England's thrilling, last-gasp Test defeat against Sri Lanka . Brace yourselves… . Why . doesn’t the NatWest T20 Blast come close to replicating the razzmatazz . of the IPL – or even the Big Bash League? There are many reasons, and we . were reminded of one of them last week, when it was made clear that . England’s players, with the exception of Moeen Ali, would not be . released to represent their counties. On . one level, this is understandable: a five-Test series against India . begins next week, and the administrators have deemed it reasonable to . squeeze this into 42 days’ playing time. But let’s not kid ourselves . about the wow-factor of our domestic Twenty20 tournament when the . wow-players tend not to take part. Lone star: Moeen Ali is the only big-name England Test player who will play in the T20 Blast . Damp squib . The . BCCI were in such a rush to send out a self-congratulatory press . release following the appointment of N Srinivasan as ICC chairman that . they neglected to update the subject heading of their email. Thus, a . missive hailing a ‘proud and historic moment for Indian cricket’ (well, . one out of two ain’t bad), will forever sit in our inboxes with the . title: ‘Fwd: Media Release: Pre-departure Media Conference.’","Narayanaswami Srinivasan is new ICC chairman .

"If it is still true that a strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England then Alastair Cook can look forward to a golden era, with the White Rose at the forefront of both the international game and the chase for domestic honours. Yorkshire’s march towards the county championship title, which can be confirmed if they avoid defeat against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge this week, could be the start of something big at Headingley and beyond. Not only are Yorkshire on the verge of clinching the greatest prize in the domestic game but they are doing it with a squad crammed with potential England players and an academy bulging with many more top prospects. Champions elect: Jason Gillespie's Yorkshire could clinch the title this week . At the forefront of Yorkshire’s rise towards their first title in 13 years is an ex-Australian Test bowler who has made it his mission to provide the old enemy with as many aspiring internationals as possible. What’s more, Jason Gillespie is making sure that a county once known for their divisive internal politics have a smile on their face as they march forward with young players very much to the fore. ‘Since I’ve been at the club all I’ve done is tell the lads to back themselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play,’ said Gillespie ahead of Tuesday’s showdown with their biggest rivals for the county title. ‘Be positive, go out with a smile and enjoy the game. ‘I coach because I love cricket and I love helping lads achieve their dreams. And spectators come and watch because they love the game too. For me it’s all about enjoyment. If you’re not enjoying it why are you doing it?’ Homegrown: Sheffield-born Joe Root has gone on to be a key player for England . All-rounder: Gary Ballance is another player from the county to break into the international set-up . It is an ethos that has seen Yorkshire achieve that elusive balance of competing for trophies while recognising their duty to give opportunities to young English players. Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett, rejuvenated after his move from Durham, have all played for England this season while openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees and leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid head the queue of those who could join them. Jonathan Bairstow, meanwhile, has recovered from a nightmare winter in Australia to provide hope that he too could once again represent his country. And this summer’s England Under 19 team included five Yorkshiremen. ‘We’re always keen to give our young lads a crack as often as possible,’ said Gillespie, who is quick to credit the role of director of cricket Martyn Moxon and his support staff for Yorkshire’s rise. ‘I’m a big believer in if they’re good enough they’re old enough. I like to drip feed the young lads into first-team cricket. Prospect: Opener Adam Lyth has become a key player for Yorkshire . ‘As a county we do have a duty to produce as many players for England as we can. At the same time this county is ambitious and wants to win trophies, absolutely. So it’s finding that balance. All counties want to win but we all have to look at the bigger picture.’ The bigger picture for Gillespie is trying to ensure that the likes of Lyth, Rashid and Lees, considered by England to be the best prospect of the lot, join Root and Ballance in competing for the Ashes next summer. Surely that would provide divided loyalties? ‘No question I’d be proud if these guys line up against the Aussies next year,’ said a man who took 259 Test wickets for Australia and hit a Test double hundred. ‘First and foremost I’m the coach of Yorkshire and part of my job is to help my players represent England. I’ll be absolutely chuffed if they are there and I’ll be supporting them. ‘Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and that will never change. Last time in the Ashes there were a few Yorkies playing and I was really hoping they’d do well as well as wanting my country to do well. It can be a tough one but my priority is seeing Yorkshire players succeed.’ Front foot: Youngster Alex Lees has piled on the runs in 2014 . Comeback: Spin king Adil Rashid could return to the England set-up for the first time in five years . Yorkshire’s biggest problem may be keeping hold of their 39-year-old coach. Gillespie has already been sounded out by Darren Lehmann for a role within Australia’s set-up, without success, while Michael Vaughan, for one, believes he could be the next England coach. For now Gillespie is very happy as an adopted Yorkshireman and his wife and four children are settled in Leeds. ‘It’s a fantastic job, a dream job, at a big club with lots of challenges,’ he said. ‘I like to think I’ve got a good rapport with everyone I work with and I love working with this group of lads. ‘I’ll never quite get the accent but my kids are all talking like Yorkshiremen. My four-year-old boy just sounds like one and my older two have both got the twang. There’s no hope of my two-year-old daughter having an Aussie accent whatsoever! ‘Look, we’re very happy here and I feel I owe the club. They took a bit of a punt on me. I’d done some coaching in Zimbabwe but my CV wasn’t strong and I’m thankful for the opportunity to repay their faith. I just want to help them achieve their goals.’ Victory over Notts this week would be the perfect start.","Yorkshire can win the title if they avoid defeat to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge this week .

"Who should be England's next captain? It’s not easy retiring from England. You don’t just pick up the phone and tell the Football Association you have had enough then quietly move on. Ending an England career is big news and I know exactly how Steven Gerrard felt on Monday when he announced that he had reached the end of the line with his country. I made the same move in 2007, even though I briefly returned for the World Cup in 2010. Our respective circumstances could not be more different. My decision was born of frustration. I was not playing for Steve McClaren’s team as much as I felt I deserved; I had just played in two Champions League finals but couldn’t dislodge John Terry and Rio Ferdinand. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard announce his retirement from England duty . Stepping aside: Gerrard has decided to call it a day after competing in six major tournaments for England . Focus: The 34-year-old will now be able to pay full attention to his Liverpool career . Backing: Gerrard's friend and team-mate Carragher thinks he has made the right decision . Steven, on the other hand, has almost . always been a first choice and has pulled the curtain down at time when . he was still a vital member of the team, never mind just being someone . who was around the squad. Steven . has been mulling this over for a while, weighing up what he should do, . but the closer it came to revealing his decision, the more difficult he . found it. When we spoke, my advice to him was that international . retirement would benefit him as much mentally as physically. He is in . great condition at the minute, so I am not sure the extra games would . have been a problem; being England captain, though, comes with huge . responsibility and pressure and those demands can be draining. Now . he will be able to get time to completely switch off and be refreshed . for the Champions League games that will be on Liverpool’s agenda and . recover from the little fitness niggles footballers tend to carry. Liverpool, certainly, will benefit from this decision. Leader: Gerrard captained England at two World Cups and one European Championship . England, . by contrast, will miss him. But how will he be remembered? I described . him as a great servant. Unfortunately for Steven and others, such as . Frank Lampard, Terry, Ferdinand and David Beckham, there will always be . that feeling of what might have been. For players of that quality never . to reach a major semi-final with England, let alone win an international . trophy, will be considered a major disappointment and that is why . Steven once rated his England career as ‘six out of 10, maybe seven’. I . think that is harsh. Winning 114 caps is a phenomenal achievement to . look back on when he finally hangs up his boots. Considering the games . he missed through injury when he was younger, he could have smashed . Peter Shilton’s record of 125 appearances. There . were highlights, too, such as goals at two World Cup finals,  scoring . in the 5-1 win over Germany and the goal that took England to Brazil. He . was unselfish, as he played in a variety of roles in midfield and got . on with his job. Wonderstrike: Gerrard scores in England's 5-1 win over Germany in 2001 .

Having . suffered such disappointment when caretaker Stuart Pearce picked Scott . Parker as skipper against Holland in February 2012, being made permanent . captain brought him such joy. That’s why he didn’t make this . announcement without giving it maximum thought.","Gerrard retires from international football at age of 34 .

"England captain Eoin Morgan hailed the controlled bowling at the death as his side claimed a dramatic three-run win over India at Edgbaston. Chris Woakes, Harry Gurney and Steven Finn kept it tight to restrict India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, as the visitors finished three runs short of England's 180 for seven. 'Throughout the whole game guys have held their nerve very well,' Morgan told Sky Sports 2. Over the line: Woakes celebrates as the ball is fielded securing a win for England that had looked unlikely . Final act: Dhoni hits the last ball of the innings, knowing that anything but a boundary isn't enough . 'We got ourselves a very good score but we felt with the calibre of batsmen India had if they did get going they would be hard to stop. 'Right at the end Woakes, Finn and Gurney held it together really well. 'They were exceptional. There's very little margin for error when MSD (Dhoni) is at the crease.

Beauty: Raina can do nothing to keep out a fabulous yorker from Harry Gurney as England fought back . Out of the ground: Morgan found India's low full tosses easy to hit and got his team to bowl a little shorter . 'We found when we batted the fuller ball whether it was a yorker or a full toss was easy to hit,' he said. 'We went back to what we thought they should have bowled. 'It did play pretty well. We all expected it to turn square but it didn't. It actually played quite nicely and India bowled reasonably well but to get up to 180 was really good.'","England beat India by three runs in one-off T20 .

"Peter Moores has given the biggest backing yet for Alastair Cook to carry on as England’s one-day captain for the World Cup while rounding on the critics who continue to seek to undermine him. England’s coach was in combative mood at the end of his first season back in charge as he was again asked about the position of a captain who continually has to justify himself in some quarters as both a player and leader. ‘Alastair is a very fine one-day player but nobody wants to talk about that,’ said Moores after England’s thrilling Twenty20 victory over India to complete the international season. Under pressure:  Peter Moores has lauded under-fire England captain Alastair Cook . Public backing: Moores believes Cook is the right man to lead England at next year's World Cup . ‘They want to say he’s out of form or talk about whatever he’s not doing right. I think it’s harsh criticising him as a player. ‘He has shown an enormous amount of fortitude to go through some of the criticism he’s had despite being the player he is. All players go through highs and lows. He’s had a tough time and come through the Test series by scoring runs. ‘He would have loved to have gone on and scored hundreds in the one-day series but he’s still scored more hundreds than any other England player since the last World Cup. 'He’s scored four to everybody else’s two and five in all. He’s still in the top 10 runscorers in the world since the last World Cup.’ Moores said after England lost the one-day series 3-1 to India that nobody’s place was safe and Sportsmail understands the coach and selectors will consider three or four changes to the squad that will play in Sri Lanka in November. Yet as far as Moores is concerned Cook’s place is clearly not in doubt. ‘What I said was absolutely clear,’ said Moores. ‘We are going to sit and look at every position, which is right because we’ve got to pick an England team to win a World Cup. 'It would be wrong not to look robustly at every player in that team to make sure we do it right. ‘Alastair has worked extremely hard with the young players coming in and I like the way he has done that, I really do. But it would be wrong for me to start saying now that this is our captain and this is our side.’ Selection changes: Sportsmail understands Moores could make three or four changes to his ODI squad . The selectors plan a series of meetings culminating in picking a squad for the seven-match series in Sri Lanka on September 23. ‘I will go into that meeting and I will have my view,’ said Moores. ‘It’s pretty clear. I’ve got a huge amount of respect for Alastair as a player and captain and I think the questioning of him has been unjust. 'You can hear pretty clearly how I feel about Alastair Cook but I am one of four selectors and this is me being fair to the other three. I will listen to all views then we will do what we think is right.’ England’s tactics have been criticised by some as being out-dated but Moores is adamant that the problems against India were more to do with not executing plans properly rather than any weaknesses of strategy. Opening encounter: England's opening match of the 2015 World Cup sees Moores' side take on Australia . ‘I don’t think the strategy is that complicated,’ said Moores. ‘You need people up front to bat well and go on. They increase their scoring rate the longer they are in and there’s areas you have to be good at. 'We’ve got to be able to find the ropes against spinners in the middle overs and we have to set up the batters who can strike at the end of the innings.’ England will give their players a break before they step up their one-day preparation ahead of that World Cup which starts against Australia in Melbourne on February 14. ‘This is quite an opportunity for us,’ said Moores. ‘Now we’ve got to pick an England team to win a World Cup.’ And that team looks sure to have Cook at the helm.","Peter Moores has labelled Alastair Cook a 'fine' one-day player .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report as a Sergio Aguero goal was enough to hand the home side victory . This was Manchester derby ‘lite’. The derby that never really felt like one or sounded like one and, ultimately, was robbed of any significance or real context by the actions of one player. Maybe it was nerves, a sense of neither club knowing where they stood before kick-off. Maybe football is just becoming more gentrified with each passing season. Whatever the case, there was never any fizz about this occasion. Both clubs — both sets of supporters — seemed rather anxious to get it over with and move on. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal slam Chris Smalling for stupid red card . Chris Smalling was shown a second yellow card for this first half challenge on James Milner . Referee Michael Oliver had no choice but to give Smalling his marching orders following the tackle . Then, when it started, Chris Smalling ruined it. A senseless sending off for two pieces of brainless football. The first offence was always going to have one outcome. The second, a tackle so late the TV cameras did well to catch it, was particularly reckless given what had already happened. ‘It wasn’t very smart,’ said Louis van Gaal. The Manchester United manager added that Smalling had apologised. His face suggested the apology had not necessarily been accepted. Smalling’s red card certainly robbed his team. They had some momentum prior to that moment. They had started brightly, seeking to exploit some hesitancy in a strangely lifeless Manchester City. In the wider context, though, Smalling’s dismissal left the occasion and the game distorted. You can never learn much from a 10 versus 11 contest and so it was here. The happiest coach in the land may well be Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho. His team are now 13 points ahead of United so we can presume the Barclays Premier League title challenge for Van Gaal’s side is now over — if it ever existed. Chelsea are as unlikely to lose five times between now and next May as United are to win every game. Smalling was shown his first yellow card of the game for the challenge of Manchester City keeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Wayne Rooney shortly after Smalling's red card . There were no players from Manchester in either side’s starting XI, but five from Argentina — Aguero, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Rojo and Di Maria. Mourinho will also have sensed ongoing issues among Sunday’s victors. City were only truly effective for half an hour. Certainly they should have had penalties and David de Gea made a couple of very good saves when the teams were numerically equal. In the wake of an excellent Sergio Aguero goal, however, they lost their way. Aimless, unintelligent football returned and if they were not exactly hanging on at the full-time, they were certainly happy to hear Michael Oliver’s whistle. As United pressed late on, Wayne Rooney may have scored — choosing to cut inside instead of shooting — Joe Hart made a super save from Angel di Maria and Marouane Fellaini somehow managed to connect only with his shoulder when escaping from Vincent Kompany at a set piece right in front of goal. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring City's winning goal at the Etihad on Sunday . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho will have sensed that there are ongoing issues at City . Had any of those incidents led to a goal, City manager Manuel Pellegrini would have been thinking introspectively yet again on Monday morning. The line his team is walking between good and bad is very fine at the moment and it will be interesting to see if they can find the performance they need at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday. From a statistical point of view, there are some numbers to trouble United. This was the fourth time on the spin City have beaten them — the last time that happened was in 1970 — while their own league tally of 13 points represents their worst start to a domestic season since 1986. Manchester United are now 13 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea . Neither of these stats really seemed to fit the mood at full-time on Sunday, though. If you are of a red persuasion you may not feel quite that glum. United do have issues. Players continue to get injured, on the training pitch and in combat, while Robin van Persie continues to look like somebody who has just walked on to the set of Stars in Their Eyes. For the moment at least, meanwhile, the previously excellent Di Maria looks in need of some direction and a more easily identifiable role in Van Gaal’s formation. There is a feeling, though, that Van Gaal does have United stuttering along gently in the right direction. Robin van Persie (right) has struggled to make an impact for United so far this season . As he said on Sunday, they continue to have problems with retaining the ball but the calamity football of early season does seem a little distant now. The return of their captain helped. Rooney was excellent in a withdrawn position and one wonders how long it will be before Van Gaal decides to choose Radamel Falcao ahead of him rather than Van Persie. United may yet benefit from not playing European football. Van Gaal clearly needs time on the training field and he perhaps will not mind too much the lack of clutter on the schedule. City do not have that luxury and, it has to be said, they do look a little leggy. Maybe this result will nudge them into gear again and certainly their celebrations at the end were indicative of relief. This will not be a derby that lives long in the memory. Unanswered questions hang heavy for blue and for red. Rooney, who has missed United's last three Premier League games, was excellent in a withdrawn position .

"Click here to read Sami Mokbel's match report from the Emirates . When 5ft 7in Alexis Sanchez hoisted himself above a hulking pair of Burnley defenders to head in the opener and put Arsenal on the path to victory even his own manager was surprised. Arsene Wenger has seen the Chilean’s skill and hunger for goals, confounding defenders with quick feet and a fizzing shot. But here he acted as an English No 9, adding another feather to his cap. ‘It was a typical English goal and I didn’t expect that from him,’ said Wenger. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Wenger: Alexis Sanchez dangerous playing in the middle . Alexis Sanchez celebrates his second, and Arsenal's third, goal at the Emirates against Burnley . Sanchez's stats at the weekend were impressive, with the Chilean proving a real handful for Sean Dyche's side . Arsenal had more shots on goal - 32 -than in any league game since the 1-0 defeat by West Ham in 2007 . ‘I didn’t count on him in the air at all. But I know that in the air it is more about desire and he has that. He is a winner and finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0-0. That’s what is important.’ Wenger had praised Sanchez’s street-fighting qualities in the lead-up to the game and it was his willingness to scrap for a goal that provided the breakthrough on 70 minutes. After Calum Chambers had doubled Arsenal’s lead Sanchez added a third in stoppage-time, his seventh goal in eight Premier League starts. The £30million signing is starting to look priceless for Arsenal and Wenger believes he is only going to get better. ‘We are in a job where you can always improve,’ said Wenger. ‘He is unbelievably keen and every day wants to practise.’ Sean Dyche, whose Burnley side are without a win in 10 league games, admitted it was a mismatch after they came undone in the final 20 minutes. ‘Teams like Arsenal are beyond us,’ he said. ‘But there’s no point being down in the dumps because they have hurt bigger sides than us.’ The Burnley defence can only look on as Sanchez opens the scoring for Arsenal .

"This time last year at Gillingham we sat four points clear at the top of League Two, but it got mentioned on several occasions that the players looked edgy, nervous and were playing with fear. On Wednesday night I was at Anfield, kindly invited by Brendan Rodgers for Liverpool's game against Sunderland. The fans sung their hearts out, they appealed for every decision, they lauded every tackle. But the more they did that, the more passes went astray and the less the players moved with the speed and fluidity they are used to. Wobbling: Ki Sung-Yeung celebrates after pulling one back against Liverpool on Wednesday evening . Enough: Luis Suarez and Brendan Rodgers (right) celebrate after Liverpool just got over the line . Back in top form: Jordan Henderson netted Liverpool's fourth goal against Tottenham on Sunday . The wobbles had set in at Anfield. They managed to hang on for the victory, but were not jumping for joy. It was sighs of relief to get three more points on the table. It happens at all levels and you can't do anything about it, but you get better at dealing with it and taking the pressure off your players as much as you can. Chelsea got the wobbles when they slipped up against Crystal Palace on Saturday. When I talk to my players I always use the example of Amen Corner at the Augusta Masters when we see what happens to the world's very best golfers. We sit, with our feet tucked up on the sofa, watching them hook and slice, duffing chips and fluffing putts on the billiard table greens. Wobbling? Manchester City dropped points at Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . Back of the net: John Terry nods the ball into his own net against Crystal Palace . But Liverpool did anything but wobble as they took apart Tottenham to move top of the table. That's the 20th time the lead has changed hands this season. There will be plenty more twists and turns through to the end of the season though, as the jelly wobbles set in. PATHETIC PLANE PLAN BACKFIRES . How pathetic and idiotic can you get, hiring an aeroplane with a negative message about David Moyes? After every game all everyone talks about nowadays is when Moyes will get the sack and that everyone wants him out. Yes, he has made mistakes. Yes, he has made errors in the transfer market. But he's taken over from the most successful and longest-serving manager in world football. The shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson and how he did things will be looming large all over Old Trafford and and in every corner at Carrington, day in and day out. Golden boy: Wayne Rooney netted twice for Manchester United against Aston Villa at Old Trafford . Point taken: Moyes' Manchester United side battered the Villans 4-1 at Old Trafford . Standing strong: There has been mounting pressure to take down the 'CHOSEN ONE' banner . Unhelpful: Fans commissioned a banner calling for Moyes' job to fly over the ground on match day . It will take a couple of years for Moyes to put his own imprint on the whole club and it will take him time to adjust from managing a big club like Everton to managing a global institution like Manchester United. At least the real fans showed their support by applauding Moyes on to the pitch at Old Trafford and booing the plane. What better way to reward them than with a 4-1 win against Aston Villa. BORE OFF, BOO BOYS . The supporters at West Ham were also having a go at their manager Sam Allardyce despite winning a game. I must admit I was not there to see it, but I read that the performance against Hull that evening was not good. After three defeats and the teams at the bottom catching up, the only important thing is to win, whether it be with pretty passing triangles or 11 behind the ball against 10 men. Staying in the Premier League for West Ham is worth millions of pounds and Karren Brady knows when she does her spread sheets that, with Allardyce, top flight survival is nailed on year after year. Do they want to change a style and risk that much money? It reminds me of last year at Gillingham when some middle-aged gentleman at the end of a game leaned over, pointed his finger straight at me, and said: 'Allen you're a f****** muppet and you don't know what you're doing.' At the time, we were four points clear at the top of the league. Thankfully, I controlled myself, didn't turn back and just kept walking forward. Of course, the temptation was to do a Cantona on him, but that would've been Mad. Enjoy the silence: Sam Allardyce cups his ear to booing West Ham fans during the win against Hull City . Letting fly: Eric Cantona lunges at a Crystal Palace fan during a 1995 match at Selhurst Park . TIME TO STEP UP . I still cannot get my head around how more footballers have not opened up about being gay. Nowadays in society I can't imagine anybody would care one little bit and I include team-mates, supporters, owners, and anyone else. I hope the law change over the weekend to allow same-sex marriages to take place will help the first Premier League player to step up. Let's be honest, who's bothered? MY WEEK... My Saturday afternoons whilst I've been between jobs have often been spent relaxing. I'd usually take a stroll walking my dog Monty before going to a local hotel leisure club. There I'd do a few lengths, enjoy a steam and a sauna, and then grab as many newspapers as I could and have a read. Generally chillaxing, as I like to put it. Open: American Robbie Rogers is one of the few openly gay professional footballers . Back in the game: Allen is loving life as Barnet manager after a roller coaster couple of weeks in charge . There would be no anxiety about a refereeing decision, no anger about a defeat when we should've won, it was all about calm and quiet. Well, in the past two weeks since I've returned to Barnet as manager there couldn't have been a greater contrast between the man going through 95 minutes in the technical area and the whale laid by the pool. Our 2-0 win against Hereford and a draw on Saturday, away at second-placed Cambridge, has kept Barnet in with an outside chance of sneaking into the play-offs. I'd take this excited stress any day.","Title-chasing sides prone to slip-ups late in season .

"Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg will miss next weekend’s round of fixtures for breaking protocol so he could watch an Ed Sheeran concert. January 1, 2013, three minutes into the match between West Ham United and Norwich City, Mark Clattenburg gave a penalty. Guy Demel looped a long ball into the area and Clattenburg judged Ryan Bennett to have grappled unfairly with Winston Reid. It seemed like a brave new world.

"World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi has retired from football management. The 66-year-old Italian announced his decision on Sunday, after winning a third successive Chinese league title with Guangzhou Evergrande. Lippi, who spent most of his playing career with Sampdoria, entered management in in 1982. He went on to coach 13 different teams including Italy, Juventus, Napoli and Inter. Marcello Lippi secured his third straight Chinese league title and then immediately announced his retirement . Marcello Lippi won the World Cup with Italy in 2006, his side beat France in the final in Germany . Lippi, smoking one of his trademark cigars, talks to goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon after winning the World Cup . 1995: Wins Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercopa with Juventus. 1996: Wins Champions League, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup with Juventus. 1997: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 1998: Wins Serie A for third time with Juventus. 2002: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2003: Wins Serie A and Supercopa with Juventus. 2006: Wins World Cup with Italy. 2012: Wins Chinese Super League and Chinese FA Cup with Guangzhou Evergrande. 2013: Wins Chinese Super League and Asian Champions League. 2014: Wins third consecutive Chinese Super League title. Lippi, the only coach in history to have won both the European and Asian versions of the Champions League, said: 'I don't want to coach any more, I'm too old. 'Guangzhou Evergrande will have a new coach next season.' He added that he will take over as technical director. Former Italy and Juventus defender Fabio Cannavaro is among the favourites to replace him as coach of the Chinese team. Lippi steered Italy to World Cup success in 2006 where they defeated France in a final that will be remembered for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italian defender Marco Materazzi. Unfortunately for Lippi, he could not emulate that success in his second spell in charge of the Azzurri - they were eliminated in the group stage four years later in South Africa. By far his most successful periods as a club manager came in Turin. In two spells at Juventus (1994-99 and 2001-04) Lippi won the Champions League, five Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, Superopa Italiana, European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup. He also won the Serie A Coach of the Year three times while in charge of the The Old Lady. Lippi will become technical director of Guangzhou Evergrande, the team he has been managing since 2012 . Lippi won five Serie A titles with Juventus as well as the Champions League and Coppa Italia and Supercopa . Lippi celebrates winning the Italian league with Gianluca Pessotto at the Stadio Delle Alpi in 2003 .

"In the first of a new weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver... HOT . Bayern Munich . Bayern Munich are currently gaining 0.5 points more each week than any rival in the Bundesliga, meaning they are on course to be crowned champions before the end of April. Last season, they had it won by March. Are they slipping? Not if you saw events at the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday. Roma looked good against Manchester City didn’t they? Ashley Cole played like the best English left back, still. Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw, Kieran Gibbs? Ashley was in a different class. But did you see the poor old soul by the time Arjen Robben had finished with him on Tuesday? He looked like he’d just been told Cheryl wanted him back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Erik Lamela stun White Hart Lane with brilliant 'rabona' Robert Lewandowski (centre) heads in Bayern Munich's third goal as Ashley Cole (left) looks on helplessly . Bayern were 5-0 up at half-time when Cole was withdrawn by coach Rudi Garcia on compassionate grounds. And this is a Munich team that lost Toni Kroos, their midfield heartbeat, to Real Madrid in the summer, remember. Later, they were granted an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican: as if Pep Guardiola needs help from on high. The Rabona . You see it in real time and you’re not sure. You watch the action replay and, well, now I’m confused. Was that what I thought it was? Did he? And after the second replay – he did, you know. It was a rabona. Erik Lamela scored for Tottenham Hotspur against Asteras Tripolis from just outside the penalty area: with a 36 mph rabona. What’s a rabona? It’s a shot or cross in which the kicking leg is wrapped behind the standing leg: effectively a crossed leg kick. Erik Lamela scores his amazing 'rabona' goal for Tottenham on Thursday night . Rabona is a Spanish word meaning to skip school, and is named after Ricardo Infante, a striker for Argentina and Estudiantes, who scored from 35 yards using this method against Rosario in 1948. The following week the football magazine El Grafico produced a front cover playing on Infante’s surname (which translates as ‘child’) with the playing dressed as a schoolboy and the headline El infante que se hizo la rabona (the child plays hooky). The rabona was born. Maurico Pochettino, the Tottenham coach, later lavished praise on Lamela but appeared distinctly stone-faced at the time: probably because he knew the nightmare that awaited him at the next training ground shooting drill. Steve McClaren . During the match between Liverpool and Real Madrid an email dropped in What’s Hot’s in-tray from two people with a very keen sense of priorities. Eschewing any desire to see Cristiano Ronaldo score one of the greatest goals in the history of European nights at Anfield, Sid and Doris Bonkers (not their real name) wanted to know why the Daily Mail continued to give more column inches to Nottingham Forest, at the expense of their beloved Derby County. Steve McClaren on the touchline during the 1-0 victory at Blackpool which sent Derby top of the Championship . They were particularly unhappy that on the night Derby went top of the league their team was allocated space equivalent to the round-up from Catford dogs. Usually, What’s Hot has a standard response to complaints of this nature – he sends the boys round – but on this occasion, they had a point. Derby are top of the Championship and Steve McClaren, their coach, is doing an outstanding job. As mention of McClaren’s name is usually the cue for fans to pick up flaming torches and attack the owner’s Roller, Derby deserve credit for giving McClaren the break he deserved. It might not have felt that way at the time, but not making it through the play-off final was quite the stroke of luck. It has given a young team time to grow. Queens Park Rangers might be regretting that late Bobby Zamora goal too, considering recent events. Which brings us to... WHAT’S NOT . Adel Taarabt’s Six-Pack . After Harry Redknapp questioned his fitness, noted Queens Park Rangers reserve Adel Taarabt conducted a round of interviews displaying his fine physique. Redknapp gave the impression Taarabt looked like this: . This is how Harry Redknapp said Adel Taarabt looked . While Taarabt thought he looked more like this: . Taarabt seemed to think he looked more like the Incredible Hulk . The reality, as you can see, is that he looks like this. This is the reality of how QPR forward Taarabt looks, pictured by Sportsmail . While a properly ripped footballer looks like this. This is a properly ripped footballer (and not a bad one, too) Cristiano Ronaldo . All of which makes Taarabt and QPR seem a bit like this. It's all left QPR and Taarabt looking a bit Mickey Mouse . (Next week: Puppets) Alex Horne . The tiny violins were out this week for the departure of Football Association general secretary, Alex Horne, a man whose title says all you need to know about his dynamism. Horne used to be the chief executive. But then it was considered having a general secretary might curry favour with UEFA and FIFA because they also had one. So Horne became that instead. Apart from a key role in moving the FA Cup final to a kick-off time that makes the match inaccessible to anybody residing north of Stanmore, establishing Burton Albion’s training ground and overseeing a national football stadium so popular it may need bailing out by the Denver Broncos, Horne will mainly be remembered as the man who said Roy Hodgson had done enough to keep his job as England manager just by getting to the World Cup. This statement made turning up something of an irrelevance, a fact later confirmed by results. Horne was not a high-profile figure and to those still unsure of his identity, here is a memory jogger: at press conferences, he was the one who sat on the far right of the group of four and never got asked a question. He will be missed. Not hot, never hot - Rape . Now don’t get What’s Not wrong, if you are currently engaged in a game of ‘Nazi stormtrooper and the lonely Russian peasant girl’ with your partner, he’s not judging. Knock yourselves out. Seriously, he means that. As long as everyone’s into it, What’s Not admires the effort in sourcing the costumery alone. On you go. But if you are one of the brigade at Sheffield United currently chanting Ched Evans' name as if he is some kind of returning hero, you may need to take a long look at yourself. Ched Evans with his girlfriend Natasha Massey in his video statement this week . Perhaps at the people around you, too. Their faces, their voices, their personalities. Try to achieve a basic human empathy. Because, even if you believe Evans is innocent, the best that can be said is he treated another human being with such crass contempt and mercilessness that it bordered on criminal. So either it’s rape or it’s the most horrid cruelty. Yet still no apology, even for that. So he’s no hero, no victim and no role model. And there really are better songs to sing. Join in on the chorus of this, if you like. See you next week.","Bayern Munich walloped Roma in the Champions League .

"Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has provided player ratings for Tottenham's home match against Liverpool.

His kicking was not the best though he had little chance with the goals. Eric Dier - 5.5 . Was solid until giving away the penalty, which seemed to affect his performance. Younes Kaboul - 5 . Looked rocky at times and always seemed nervous in possession. Struggling to cope: Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul attempts to wrestle Mario Balotelli off of the ball . Jan Vertonghen - 5.5 . Shaky in defence and was easily beaten on too many occasions. Danny Rose - 5.5 . Not the best of showings in front of the watching England manager. Etienne Capoue - 6.5 . Despite the score he tried to keep his team going, but Liverpool's movement was too good. Passion: Tottenham Etienne Capoue did not give up hope of helping Tottenham get back into the game . Nabil Bentaleb - 6.5 . Impressed with his quick passing of the ball but against Liverpool bossed the middle. Eric Lamela - 6 . Put in a shift but struggled to get any joy in attacking areas of the pitch. Christian Eriksen - 5.5 . Had a very quiet game by his standards. Failed to get on the ball enough to create. Nacer Chadli - 6.5 . Showed the most potential of Spurs' attacking players but missed a good chance. Emmanuel Adebayor - 6.5 . Can't question his work-rate but too often drifted away from the centre. Eyes on the ball: Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor worked hard but couldn't break down Liverpool's defence . Subs: Townsend (for Eriksen 59, 5.5), Dembele (for Bentaleb 59, 6), Davies (for Rose 72, 6). Not used: Friedel, Chiriches, Holtby, Kane. Mauricio Pochettino - 6 . A tough test after initial success. He’s the right man for the job but still finding out his best XI. LIVERPOOL (Team average - 7) Simon Mignolet - 6.5 . Untroubled for the most part but made a smart first-half save to deny Chadli. Javier Manquillo - 6 . Had a quiet game but played his part in a solid defensive display. Dejan Lovren - 7.5 . Caught out by the odd long ball but tidied up brilliantly and made good interceptions. Solid display: Liverpool new boy Dejan Lovren showed why Brendan Rodgers wanted to sign him . Mamadou Sakho - 7 . Sometimes looks uncomfortable in possession but was very solid defensively. Alberto Moreno - 6.5 . Learned from his mistake at City and showed blistering pace for his goal. Steven Gerrard - 7 . The perfect player for the base of a diamond. Nobody in Britain does it better. Jordan Henderson - 7 . Made intelligent runs, particularly for the first goal and played with real confidence. Key player: Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson is now one of the first names on Rodgers' teamsheet . Joe Allen - 6.5 . A key ingredient in midfield. Used the ball quickly and effectively. Raheem Sterling - 8 . Gets people off their seats with blistering runs. Grows every game. Mario Balotelli - 7 . Showed flashes of pace and power and only rustiness stopped him scoring a couple. Daniel Sturridge - 7.5 . Like Sterling he beat defenders with ease. Was not put off by Balotelli's arrival. Running man: The pace of England international Raheem Sterling troubled Tottenham's defence .

"Stewart Downing thought occasions like this had passed him by and you might say it passed him by again. First start for two-and-a-half years and then hooked after 45 minutes.

Across the back four on the left, Luke Shaw offered a reminder of his talent and a warning to Leighton Baines and Kieran Gibbs, who replaced him after an hour. Shaw is strong and quick and more composed on the ball in the heat of Celtic Park than a teenager has any right to be. He will surely improve as a defender as he matures, just as Jack Wilshere has rapidly developed as a deep-lying playmaker, because he has the necessary tools and a good football brain. Wilshere has been outstanding in the last four England games, dictating tempo, organising those around him, passing the ball, biting in the tackle and controlling his instinct to dribble the dangerous areas. Nathaniel Clyne extinguished the threat of  Ikechi Anya on Tuesday night in his second England game . He also produced the pass of the match for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to score the opener. It was an England goal made in Arsenal, with a little help from Southampton. Eight of Roy Hodgson’s 22-man squad have strong connections to Saints. But where the Ox flourished, with a reminder of his energy and his goal threat, Downing’s chance came and went. He did nothing wrong. He held his shape on the left of a tight midfield trio, with Wilshere and James Milner, and patrolled the areas he was expected to. But the ability to produce something special under intense scrutiny is what international football is about, especially if your role carries creative responsibilities. Luke Shaw's hour on the pitch issued a warning to left back rivals Leighton Baines and Kieran Gibbs . Adam Lallana came on and immediately the team played with a happier rhythm, with more balance. Downing is entitled to counter that the hardest part of Tuesday night’s game was the opening half-hour, where England had to be disciplined. He played his part in helping England take the lead and take a grip. They were two up within minutes of Lallana coming on, and he was able to play with more freedom. He may not have Downing’s determination to track back to the edges of his own penalty box simply to deny the opponents space, but Scotland were a wilting force by then. Spaces were starting to open up and Lallana’s fluency does not help Downing’s chances of adding to his 35 caps. At the age of 30, will he be back? Who knows who will be fit and in form by the time these players meet again for international duty in March. Downing did nothing wrong but lacked the creativity to produce something special when it matters . Downing’s confidence has been built at West Ham. The test is to return to Upton Park and impress again. According to Opta’s statistics, he has created 34 chances, more than any other English player in the Premier League this season. Modern coaches love to have tactical flexibility at their disposal and his ability to play in different roles is an advantage. It has helped him into tournament squads in the past, but it will only help again if his form holds. Too often in this match his touch let him down. It might have been nerves playing their part. He found it hard to get on the ball as Scotland disrupted England during an opening passage of play which was still reverberating from an extraordinary pre-match atmosphere featuring flames and bagpipes (together at last, although perhaps not in a way the English were hoping). Downing falls over a ducking Steven Naismith during an unimpressive performance for the West Ham star . Amid the din, Downing’s first touch was inconsistent. Poor control encouraged Shaun Maloney to snap into an early tackle which had England’s No 8 hopping around in pain. Having aggravated an injury during the warm-up at Wembley on Saturday, he did not want another setback. Perhaps this was a factor in his subdued performance. Others were able to thrive in the atmosphere and Hodgson will be delighted with the work-rate and willingness to match Scotland’s aggression and desire. Fraser Forster, another enjoying the rare treat of an international start, might have liked more activity to prove what he can do but it is a fine line for a goalkeeper . Forster was alert to save from Russell Martin, when he needed to be, but could not protect his clean sheet. As for Downing, he will hope there is another chance to come next year. If there isn’t, this was a night for all England players to savour: an England win in Glasgow.","England defeated Scotland 3-1 at Celtic Park on Tuesday night .

"ENGLAND . ALASTAIR COOK - 5 . Captained pretty well in the first innings, appearing to have learned the lessons from Headingley. In the second innings, he was too reactionary. Was unlucky to be bowled round his legs and dropping Dhoni reflected a scrambled mind. SAM ROBSON - 7 . An old-fashioned opener and judging by the way he batted after such a long stint in the field, he appears to be mentallytough. There is still a concern when the ball is full around off stump. GARY BALLANCE - 7 . Was very composed in the first innings — just what you need from your No 3. Still susceptible to the inswinger, but if he keeps going like this England will have found a decent replacement for Jonathan Trott. Drop in form: England captain Alastair Cook looks on after drawing the first Test against India . IAN BELL - 6 . Got to be careful he does not go back to the Ian Bell of old — the maker of pretty but infuriating 20s and 30s. That is especially important now that Trott and Kevin Pietersen are no longer there and Cook is struggling. Fielding getting better with age. JOE ROOT - 9.5 . He was brilliant on a surface that did not suit his back-foot tendencies. The tempo of his 154 was helped by the aggression of Stuart Broad, but he shepherded the last few wickets superbly. After his 200 against Sri Lanka, it’s all very encouraging. I also like his feistiness. Stunning: England batsman Joe Root is congratulated by James Anderson after reaching his century at Trent Bridge . Saluting the fans: Root leaves the field at Trent Bridge after scoring 154 not out in the first Test . MOEEN ALI - 5 . Will be disappointed with his first-innings dismissal. He should have known that this was a surface where you stand up and ride the bounce, not turn your back on it. Bowling improved, and took some vital wickets, including both India’s openers in the second innings. MATT PRIOR - 4 . His keeping reflected where his body is at: he took a good one to his left on the first morning, then dropped three to his right as the game progressed. He needs a good series, because Jos Buttler is breathing down his neck. BEN STOKES - 5 . Looks low in confidence with the bat, but has knack of taking wickets. Not sure England have worked him out. If he is a batting all-rounder, he can go in at No 6 and England can play a frontline spinner. If he is a bowling all-rounder, he is vulnerable if they do draft in Simon Kerrigan. One of England's better performers: Stuart Broad emerged with credit from the India Test . STUART BROAD - 9 . Just a fantastic player, with a great cricket brain. Never gives up. If I was captaining against him, I would always be doubly switched on. LIAM PLUNKETT - 5 . He showed with that second-innings dismissal of Dhoni that he does not just have to be a bang-it-in bowler. I did wonder why he kept trying bouncers and I just hope he gets a surface later on in this series where he can show he is not one-dimensional. JIMMY ANDERSON - 9 . The world’s gone mad: I can’t believe I’m giving Jimmy nine out of 10 mainly for his batting. His 81 on Saturday really lifted the country after what has happened these last eight months. And the way he kept running in was a reminder of his excellent levels of fitness. Impressive innings: James Anderson scores some runs during his stand of 81 on Saturday at Trent Bridge . INDIA . SHIKHAR DHAWAN - 4 . Two soft dismissals — and he will always be vulnerable if he keeps staying leg side of the swinging ball. MURALI VIJAY - 9.5 . Did brilliantly to score more than 200 runs. Yes, the pitch suited him, but if India can find another superstar batsman they are going to take some series bowling out. Star batsman: Murali Vijay scored more than 200 runs for India, although the pitch did favour his style . VIDEO Vijay puts India in control . CHETESHWAR PUJARA - 6 . Both his dismissals were a bit lame but he looks organised and loves to just bat and bat. Big score just around the corner. VIRAT KOHLI - 4 . He likes to feel bat on ball and that strong bottom hand can get him into trouble in this series. AJINKYA RAHANE - 5 . Unlucky dismissal in the first innings but enough to suggest he will get runs. Looks organised and well-balanced. MS DHONI - 8 . Captained well, apart from when he lost the plot during the last-wicket stand between Root and Anderson. Vulnerable when there is a bit of bounce. Run out: India captain MS Dhoni was run out by a direct throw in the first Test against England . RAVINDRA JADEJA - 6 . Struggles outside off with the ball going across him and played an ugly flash in the first innings to one that was too close to cut. STUART BINNY - 6 . Showed yesterday why he was in the side but had a bit of a shocker before. Out for a duck and virtually ignored by his captain. BHUVNESHWAR KUMAR - 9 . Looks a really good player and could trouble Cook if the ball swings. Quicker than he looks and a very handy, gutsy No 9. Bowled over: England's Matt Prior walks back to the pavilion after being bowled by Bhuvneshwar Kumar . ISHANT SHARMA - 8 . Possibly the most dangerous bowler on either side, especially bowling a fuller length, but still struggling with no-balls. MOHAMMED SHAMI - 6 .

"CLICK HERE to to read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's column on why football owners like Massimo Cellino are ruining great clubs such as Leeds United. It was long before the match in Moscow that Manchester City raised the compensation issue with UEFA. The club found out the fixture would be played behind closed doors on October 3, after CSKA were disciplined for the racist behaviour of their fans during a match against Roma in September. By then quite a few City supporters were committed to travel. Russia is one of the most problematic European trips. It is expensive and requires a visa. The only way to keep costs down and complete the paperwork in time is to book well in advance. One imagines many of City’s travelling fans would have been making the necessary arrangements not long after August 28 when the draw was made. Manchester City fans weren't allowed to travel to watch their side play against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday . Michel Platini's UEFA said they had no policy in place to help compensate City fans who had booked the trip . Moscow were also fined £158,000 by UEFA, leading Manchester City to ask, not unreasonably, what part of that might be set aside to compensate their followers for non-refundable expenses. Michel Platini’s UEFA replied they had no policy on this matter. Isn’t that incredible, when you consider the issues that have vexed UEFA over the years; the reams of regulations that clubs must obey when competing in the Champions League, 41 pages in total before sweating the small stuff like car park allocations and mixed zones? Did you know clubs are told precisely when to begin and end the ‘walk on’ music and the Champions League anthem? And yet nobody thought it necessary to draw up a process to give innocent fans their money back if UEFA cancel access to a fixture at late notice. A rough estimate of the reimbursement cost for City’s support is £50,000. Roughly 100 were already booked for Moscow when UEFA intervened, with average costs of £500. That would still leave UEFA with £100,000 spare, even after a show of goodwill. While they were at it, they could cover the costs of the Bayern Munich fans, too, also barred from the Arena Khimki having done nothing wrong. Around 300 CSKA Moscow fans were in the main stand, despite the match being played behind closed doors . UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans . To add insult to injury, Moscow’s stadium was not satisfactorily sealed when City visited. There were roughly 650 tickets available, divided between representatives of the two clubs, media, the parents of ball boys and sponsors. It would appear a high percentage of those tickets ended up on the black market, judging by the sprinkling of Moscow fans, wearing colours and carrying banners. City, meanwhile, were laying on a function back home for the fans who could not travel, complete with match coverage, food, drink and club celebrities. Their reaction on hearing the noise from the interlopers in Moscow was bemusement at best. City may well decide to compensate their fans anyway, but it should not be down to them. When the club were fined £50million for breaking UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules it quickly became apparent where that money was going — to their wealthy rivals. What about Moscow’s £158,000 — and why don’t UEFA have rules in place to govern compensation in the event of ground closure? It is almost as if it suits them to be so careless. It certainly profits them. Sergio Aguero scored City's opener as they took a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow on Tuesday .

"World Cup-winning coach and Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward runs his expert eye over England's 28-27 loss to New Zealand on Saturday and looks ahead to the next challenges facing Stuart Lancaster's side against the Crusaders on Tuesday and Saturday's third Test. Heads up: Stuart Lancaster (right) and Chris Robshaw (left) lead England off the pitch after their All Blacks defeat . Ben Smith by some distance. Smith is a classic modern-day back-three player who can switch positions but on Saturday he was peerless at full-back and epitomises New Zealand rugby. He’s comparatively lightweight but is quick, hugely skilful and has a wonderful rugby brain. That try-saving tackle on Manu Tuilagi just before half-time when England were 10-3 up was  masterful. Many commentators criticised Tuilagi for not making more of a gilt-edged scoring chance. Wrong, the praise should go to Smith. Try-saver: All Blacks full-back Ben Smith is world class, as his crunch-time tackle on Manu Tuilagi showed . Was their inner belief which says ‘if we produce our best game we can beat anybody’. New Zealand can be a horribly difficult place to play but there has been no fear or inferiority complex and that is a big box to tick. I like the way England conduct themselves on and off the field, they are clearly proud and inspired by the shirt and we can be proud of them. Gather round: Robshaw calls in his troops for a pep talk after they lost the three-Test series in Dunedin . I applaud the coaches for being willing to experiment with Tuilagi on the wing against the best team in the world and there need be no regrets over that decision. That did not cost them the Test match but there must be no backward step now. Do not think you can beat New Zealand by power alone. That is such old-school thinking, as the Smith tackle on Tuilagi showed. Was England’s use of the bench which stemmed from the original selection. Courtney Lawes, Dylan Hartley and Billy Vunipola should have started and because they didn’t a confused bench strategy resulted once again, taking off guys who were going well to replace them with first choices who then struggled to get into the game. Bench warmer: Billy Vunipola should have started rather than come on late to try and get into the game . England’s execution was also poor on occasions. Billy Twelvetrees’ decision to offload to Tom Wood early in the second half was absolutely correct, it should have created a try, but the execution was poor. England were turned over and the All Blacks were away for a try. The margins are very small at this level but let’s hope England keep faith with this approach. Because their basic skill levels are still superior. It’s not instinctive or God-given, they work  constantly at the little things from an early age until those skills become second nature. They understand better than any team in the world that talent alone is not enough. And then, when they go down the tunnel losing 10-6 at half-time against a good England team, they come out firing with 20 minutes of rugby that nobody can match. Supreme skills enable you to play at another level under extreme pressure and New Zealand do that constantly. Blitz: The All Blacks showed their class, coming out 10-6 down at half-time to have the game won in 20 minutes . Is for Stuart Lancaster to get his first team out against New Zealand on Saturday. We still haven’t seen England start with their ‘Gun XV’ which, considering who they are playing and the importance of this tour, is a nonsense. The first Test was arguably beyond his control, last Saturday’s selection was a compromise that didn’t work but as a parting shot let’s nail down our best team and throw the kitchen sink at the All Blacks. Start with Hartley, Lawes and Vunipola, bring Tuilagi back to centre. This is a huge week. Lancaster has 46 players down there now to manage and a big match against Canterbury on Tuesday, which is not easy. The tour must finish on a positive note.","All Blacks full-back Ben Smith was man of the match by a long way .

"Samoa coach Stephen Betham believes England are the complete package and is expecting a backlash from Stuart Lancaster's side at Twickenham on Saturday. England will be desperate to end a run of five consecutive Test defeats when they meet the Samoans, including four at the hands of world champions New Zealand and one against South Africa. A particularly disappointing display against the Springboks last Saturday suggests Lancaster's side are a long way off winning the World Cup on home soil next year. Betham disagrees, however. Owen Farrell makes a pass as England train at Twickenham on Friday ahead of their clash against Samoa . George Ford (left) chats to Farrell as the duo look on before Saturday's Autumn international with Samoa . 'England are pretty complete at the moment,' the Samoa coach said. 'Although they had five losses, those losses were very close and could have gone either way. 'We are expecting England to be at their strongest. Although they've had some positional changes, I'm sure the coaching staff have some tricks up their sleeve. 'England are still ranked going into the next World Cup in the top five in the world which we haven't achieved, so it is a good test for us to know where we stand.' The last time Samoa played at Twickenham was November 2010, when England had to come from behind in the second half to win 26-13. Stephen Betham is expecting a backlash from England after their poor form of late . The England players enjoyed a joke during training - they face Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday . Lancaster's side will be hoping a strong performance on Saturday can kick-start their autumn campaign ahead of a crunch final fixture against Australia. 'Are England under pressure? In any Test match there is pressure especially when you lose a few games in a row,' Betham said. 'Good sides always get up again though, and we are expecting a really fired-up English team this weekend. 'We are not there to make up the numbers - we are going there to compete.' Lancaster has made six changes to his starting XV, with George Ford set to make his full international debut at fly-half alongside Owen Farrell at inside centre. All eyes will be on England's back-line which has lacked cohesion and creativity in recent matches, but Betham insists Samoa have to focus on themselves. 'Playing Ford and Farrell together is unusual but sometimes we can get carried away with what England are doing,' Betham said. 'We can be our own worst enemies so we have concentrated a lot on what we can do better.'","England look to end a run of five consecutive Test defeats on Saturday .

"Former England captain Mike Gatting believes the time has come to consign the Kevin Pietersen chapter to the past once and for all. Amid the off-field issues, Pietersen remains England's highest run-scorer and there is some talk about a national return despite the troubles, not least from the player himself. In his time away from England cricket, Pietersen has turned out for Twenty20 sides in different countries, including in the Indian Premier League, and has played in the same format for Surrey this year. VIDEO: Scroll down to get the view of figures from around the world of cricket on KP . Mike Gatting has poured cold water on a possible international return for Kevin Pietersen . Pietersen has turned out for Surrey (left) and Delhi Daredevils since his England sacking back in February . Pietersen has criticised several of his former England team-mates, including Matt Prior (right), in his new book . However, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is unlikely to grant him a return, and Gatting has little doubt as to the reasons. 'He spent a whole summer here with Surrey supposedly but didn't play championship cricket or anything else,' Gatting said. 'He says he would like to play for England, but sometimes his actions haven't coupled with the words, which is sad because he's a hugely talented cricketer. 'Perhaps if he'd played for Surrey and got a few hundreds for them, perhaps that might have promoted his case a bit more.' Pietersen, writing in his autobiography which is released this week, also claimed there was a culture of bullying in the England squad and pointed the finger at Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, James Anderson and Stuart Broad. Swann has since rejected the claims as 'codswallop', and even accused Pietersen of indulging in bullying himself.

The furore around Pietersen's autobiography reached new levels on Tuesday with the emergence of a document cataloguing his alleged behaviour during last winter's Ashes. However, with England set to tour Sri Lanka in the build-up to next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, Gatting has little time to dwell on the past. He told Press Association Sport: 'I just hope we look forward and not back. 'I'm more concerned that we look at the players we've got - Moeen Ali, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, (Jos) Buttler. 'All these guys are who we want to see now because that's where they are now. 'They're in the team and we'd like to see them go forward. History is the past and we're looking to the present.' When asked if the Pietersen saga could adversely affect England's preparation for the winter tours, Gatting said: 'I hope not. 'Having watched the young guys in the summer, they look very capable of doing it. 'When you have the likes of (Alex) Hales, Buttler, (Ben) Stokes, (Ian) Bell and (Alastair) Cook - lots of fine players. 'It's quite an interesting period for England cricket.

"A new book Cyril Smith has revealed how the former Lib Dem leader David (now Lord) Steel recommended Smith for a knighthood . For far longer than should have been possible, the Liberal Democratic Party has passed itself off as the home of political virtue: more honest and less corrupt than what its leader Nick Clegg at the last election referred to dismissively as ‘the two old parties’. That veil of purity has been stripped away by the exigencies of power. For those on the Left who voted Lib Dem at the last election because of its pledge to scrap student fees, the party’s decision in government to support their tripling to £9,000 has destroyed its reputation for integrity. Those on the Right who felt the party could be trusted to keep their word as partner with the Conservatives say ‘never again’, following Nick Clegg’s abrupt abrogation of the Coalition agreement to support a Bill for the creation of fewer and more equal-sized constituencies. So much for the Lib Dems’ commitment to a ‘fairer electoral system’. Those of no particular political leaning, who simply admired the Lib Dems’ critique of the way the ‘old parties’ handed out House of Lords seats to their financial backers, have seen how Clegg and Co have done exactly the same: the latest batch of Lib Dem nominated peerages for donors includes a faintly sinister nightclub owner. Now one of the party’s previous nominations for honours has come back to haunt it. In its serialisation of Smile For the Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, the Daily Mail has revealed how the former Lib Dem leader David (now Lord) Steel recommended Smith for a knighthood, despite knowing of the sordid stories about the way the former Rochdale Lib Dem MP had sexually abused a number of boys, some from a children’s home he had co-founded. The book, co-written by Simon Danczuk, Smith’s successor as MP for Rochdale, gives horrifying accounts of how this 29st man, the single most recognisable figure in his party, sadistically forced himself on some of his most vulnerable constituents. It also contains compelling evidence of how Rochdale’s Mr Big — in every sense — was protected by senior figures in politics and the criminal justice system, to the disgust of local police officers who believed they had enough witness statements to bring a cast-iron case of serial sexual abuse. Scroll down for video . David Steel sat in the background right listening to a speech by Cyril Smith at the Joint Liberal Assembly in Brighton . As with Jimmy Savile, Smith’s perverted exploitation of a position of influence was something of an open secret. Back in 1979, Private Eye published details of witness statements of Smith’s abuse on its main news page. By no means are all stories in that periodical true in every particular — and it has the libel bills to show for that — but the striking thing about this one was that Smith neither publicly denied the accusations nor sued the magazine. Danczuk’s conclusion is that the Liberal (later Lib Dem) leadership turned a blind eye to the whole story because Smith was too central a figure in the party and an irreplaceable element in its attempt to appeal to working-class voters especially in the North, where it had found it hard to make an electoral breakthrough. On Saturday, a spokesman for the Lib Dem leader told the Mail: ¿Clearly he  would never have paid tribute to Cyril Smith if he¿d had any idea about these horrible allegations' Indeed, Smith, a former mayor of Rochdale, was the prototype of what the party later made its modus operandi: a ferocious concentration on a select band of constituencies where every street would be intensively wooed with all manner of promises of a purely local nature. It was a British version of what in America is called pork barrel politics; and it has the same risks. It is clear that one reason why Smith was so protected was that he had a pudgy finger in every local pie: he had done countless favours — and they could be called in. Coincidentally, the man who masterminded this localised brand of electioneering for the Lib Dems, Lord Rennard, faces accusations of sexual harassment of party workers — though of an infinitely less serious nature. Nick Clegg has already admitted the party had been far too slow to investigate the complaints against Rennard. But that is as nothing to the embarrassment he now faces: reminded of how, in 2008, he sent a message to be read out at Smith’s 80th birthday party, declaring: ‘You were a beacon for our party in the Seventies and Eighties and continue to be an inspiration to the people of Rochdale.’ On Saturday, a spokesman for the Lib Dem leader told the Mail: ‘Clearly he would never have paid tribute to Cyril Smith if he’d had any idea about these horrible allegations.’ How can that be true? As noted above, the allegations had been known since at least 1979. All that can be said is that Clegg (and, indeed, Lord Steel) found it convenient to disregard or forget them. Obviously, it is not the case that every unpleasant person is automatically guilty of anything levelled against them. Yet even leaving aside the allegations of sexual abuse, Smith was a byword in the party for egomania, bullying and bluster, cordially loathed by the leadership. He was, though, a formidable vote- winner: and for them, that is what counted. Like Smith himself, they just kept smiling. Now, however, the party’s leadership has very little to smile about. The latest opinion polls have their public support at a derisory 7 per cent. They face annihilation in the imminent elections to the European Parliament. Given that almost the sole intact principle of the Lib Dems is their belief in ever greater harmonisation of Britain within the EU, this would represent a special humiliation. Cyril Smith at the Liberal Democrat Party Conference in 1990 (left) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) It is too early to say they face similar extinction in the General Election, scheduled for June 2015. But if that were to happen, most of their leading figures could easily find accommodation in one or other of the ‘two old parties’. Of the Lib Dem Coalition ministers, Business Secretary Vince Cable used to be a Labour party member and would have no trouble being a colleague of Ed Miliband; Education minister David Laws would fit snugly into the Conservative party (as Michael Gove regularly tells him). Besides which, the Lib Dems’ financial solvency is hardly guaranteed, especially if Cyril Smith’s victims are successful in suing the party for compensation. The truth is that if it were a business, this unhappy merger between the Liberal and Social Democratic parties would be wound up and its assets (such as they are) distributed among other interested parties. If such an outcome could in any way be attributed to Cyril Smith’s misdeeds, then some good would have come out of his depravity. Anger: Lord Melchett opposes the use of pesticides on crops . Lord Melchett, a lobbyist for organic food growers, last week had a letter published in the Mail, insisting: ‘The claim that the Soil Association is telling consumers to buy organic food “to avoid getting cancer” is untrue.’ He was responding to this column, which noted Cancer Research UK’s announcement that in a large study of middle-aged women in the UK ‘we found no evidence that a woman’s overall cancer risk was decreased if she generally ate organic food’. I repeat what I wrote then: that the Soil Association responded on its website that the public should treat this report from the pre-eminent British cancer research charity ‘with a pinch of organic salt’. What else is this but an attempt to continue to persuade families that they should be scared of getting cancer from eating food grown with pesticides? Indeed, on its website, under the headline ‘Effects on Health’ the Soil Association states: ‘The most dangerous chemicals used in farming, such as organophosphates, have been linked with a range of problems, including cancer.’ Again, this is a clear attempt to scare the public about the (non-existent) enhanced risk of cancer from food grown with chemicals. Lord Melchett’s grandfather and great-grandfather must be turning in their graves: both were chairmen of Imperial Chemical Industries. Venera Minakhmetova, 24, was killed five months ago on a roundabout in East London, when her bike was struck by a lorry. Last week a coroner found that ‘the fundamental cause of this collision was Venera going through a red light.’ Ghastly for her family to be told that it was her own fault: but perhaps the coroner’s verdict will cause more cyclists to realise that traffic lights are for their own protection, as well as that of pedestrians. As one of the latter group, I have three times in recent months been forced to take evasive action so as not to be struck by a cyclist hurtling through a red light. The most annoying aspect is that they tend to shout out as if you were the one committing an offence.

"South Africa's Bakkies Botha, renowned for his fearsome physical presence in the second row, announced his international retirement on Saturday but will continue to play for French Top 14 side Toulon. The 35-year-old World Cup-winning lock made his final appearance for the Springboks when coming off the bench in their 31-28 victory over England last weekend and finishes his career with 85 caps, the seventh highest total for South Africa. Coach Heyneke Meyer had brought him out of the international wilderness in November last year after an absence of two years as a mentor to the country's up-and-coming young locks. Bakkies Botha takes a catch in South Africa's 31-28 victory over England on November 15 . Botha shakes hands with England's Ben Morgan in what proved to be his last game for South Africa . Botha is all smiles despite a nasty cut as he poses with team-mates JP Pietersen and Bismarck du Plessis . That role, though, has now been taken by Botha's long-time second row partner, 37-year-old Victor Matfield, who is expected to be a starter at the World Cup in England next year. 'The news of my retirement will probably be described as sudden and unexpected, but it is a decision that I've been mulling over since 2011,' said Botha in a press release from the South African Rugby Union (SARU) on Saturday. 'To be able to make this decision on my own terms, knowing I'm still good enough to play Test rugby, is a huge blessing. 'I'm planning to finish my contract with Toulon and defend our titles this season. And who knows, perhaps there is a province in South Africa who can see me add value to their Currie Cup campaign next year and I can play my final match in my beloved country of birth before finally hanging up my boots at the end of 2015 at all levels of the game.' Botha made his Springbok debut in 2002 and became known for his sometimes overly aggressive play but alongside Matfield he formed arguably the best second row pairing in world rugby.","Bakkies Botha will continue to play Top 14 rugby with Toulon .

"Steffon Armitage has reiterated his desire to play for England but appears increasingly pessimistic about his chances of doing so ahead of next year's World Cup. The European Player of the Year, without a cap since moving to Toulon in 2011 owing to the RFU's strict policy on selecting overseas players, came close to joining Bath last month. But that move fell through and the 29-year-old, rated among the world's best back row forwards, remains in international exile as England struggle through a testing autumn series. Steffon Armitage celebrates scoring a try for Toulon against Scarlets in the European Rugby Cup last month . England head coach Stuart Lancaster (centre) has resisted the temptation to select Armitage . 'It would have been a lot easier if things had worked out with Bath,' Armitage admitted in an interview with The Times. 'But it didn't. At this point, I have to move past that.' Armitage, who moved to the two-time European champions from London Irish having earned five caps while at the Premiership club, gave an impassioned defence of his desire to play for his country in the face of interest in his services from France. 'Maybe I spent time in France, but that is nothing, my heart was always with England,' he insists. 'I definitely still want to play for England,' he added. 'As a rugby player, you want to play at the top of the game, and the top of the game is your country.' England captain Chris Robshaw reflects on their fifth successive Test defeat on Saturday . Perhaps more worryingly for England fans though, Armitage revealed his frustration at a lack of contact from England and head coach Stuart Lancaster, particularly when he was mulling over his future this time last year. 'That was on my mind, knowing there was a World Cup, but we heard nothing, no feedback from England,' he said. 'That made the decision to stay on in France quite easy.' If England's performance in the defeat by South Africa on Saturday - their fifth Test loss in a row - was concern enough with a World Cup around the corner, then Armitage's consistent use of the past tense despite insisting he still wants to play for England is another blow to the Red Rose's hopes next year. Armitage says he had no contact from England when he was mulling over his future last year . 'It did bother me,' Armitage adds. 'But it has got to the point now where I have accepted it.' For now, Armitage seems to have accepted his fate. It appears the ball is well and truly in England and Lancaster's court.

"A pensioner blinded in one eye after being struck by a cricket ball has regained his sight almost half a century after he lost it thanks to a routine check-up. Alan Read from Sowerby, near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, was 36 when he was hit above his left eye with a cricket ball while playing for village team East Burgholt, in Suffolk. He was told by doctors that the freak accident meant he would never see out of his eye again due to the pressure which had built up behind it. Alan Read, who has regained the sight in his left eye, 48 years after being struck in the head with the cricket ball . Mr Read, 84, continued to work and play sport throughout his life while coming to terms with the fact he would never see again out of his left eye. However decades later when a cataract began to grow on his healthy eye, surgeons assessed the damaged one and realised they could give the pensioner his sight back after 48-years by relieving the pressure. His sight was restored after a three hour operation after he was sent to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough and operated on by Dr Vaideanie Collins. Now aged 84, Mr Read said: 'Getting my sight back was incredible. 'After the operation I came round and my sight was fine, and I could see things I couldn't see before. 'I still wake up in the morning and close my right eye to check if I can see out of my left. I feel like I have a new lease of life now and it's marvellous. The pensioner had an operation to relieve the pressure behind his eye following a routine check up . 'I was the first person she had done the operation on and when I went back to see her she told me she could do it on two or three others.' Although the father-of-two can now boast of his clear vision for the first time since the accident, he said he had not longed for his sight to come back over the years and had to accept what had happened. 'It was one of those things and I had to cope,' he said. 'I couldn't see very well and I had to adapt to that. 'I had my own cleaning business with ladies working for me, so it didn't affect work. 'I continued to play cricket and was hit on the head a couple of times, but I was never as good as before the accident.' I don't even remember this, but someone later told me I was on my knees on the ground and I said 'I am looking for my eye'. ''I had a cut across my left eyebrow and was taken to hospital for an x-ray. Mr Read was operate on by Dr Vaideanie Collins at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesborough . The doctors said at the time it was likely my eye would burst because of the pressure behind it. ''All I could see out of it was a grey light, and I had to just lie down and rest for nearly week. ''I was not really shocked when I was told I wouldn't be able to see out of it again. I think I realised that myself and I did get used to it very quickly, because what can you do? ''There are people worse off than me so I didn't get sad or upset. I just' thought 'well that's it', there's nothing you can do about it.' Mr Read's wife, Jo, 85, said that because of his age she feared he might die during the operation, but was relieved when her husband came round. She said: 'I was thrilled with the result and couldn't believe it. 'It's marvellous he's got his sight back and he can now stand at the window and look at the hills to pick out things he has never seen before.'","Alan Read lost the sight in his left eye after being struck by a cricket ball .

"The location is Maracaibo in Venezuela. It’s 2007 and Argentina are in this hotel because they are competing in the Copa America. One in which they will cruise to the final, start as favourites but be whipped by Brazil. From the macro to the micro. We are in Juan Sebastian Veron room and it’s already well past midnight. It’s a sizeable ‘habitación’ and the bed has been moved. Anyone next door or in the floor below can forget sleep — but not because of loud rock and roll, not because of a telly being thrown out of the window, nor because the lads have snuck co-eds into the room. Carlos Tevez scores Juventus's second goal in their 3-0 winner over Lazio on Saturday . Tevez (right) celebrates his goal which capped another impressive display from the Argentine . Tevez avoids the challenge of Lazio's Stefan De Vrij during Saturday's Serie A clash . Verón, Lionel Messi, Roberto Abbondanzieri and Carlos ‘Apache’ Tevez are playing two-a-side foot-volley using the bed in the middle of the room as a net and the competition is not only fierce it’ll go on for hours yet. Interestingly Verón, then very much the Padrino of that entire squad, chose Tevez as his playing partner, not the infinitely gifted Messi. ‘It’s a memory I’ll never forget,’ Verón now admits. ‘Beyond his technical ability, Carlos possesses the mentality of a champion. ‘He’ll stand back up again every time you try to knock him down.’ Which is probably no bad thing. Since 2007, Tevez has racked up trophies, just like Messi. But the latter has gone on to dominate the football world, or at least do galactic battle with Cristiano Ronaldo, while Tevez’s 11 trophies have not gained him the same respect or adoration. In fact, he has been mired in controversy and opprobrium. Till now. During the week he made his return to the Argentina squad — from which his country’s media largely think he has been excluded because of bad feeling between him and Messi. Perhaps a disputed point in room 427 in Maracaibo. Perhaps some more of football’s ‘this town ain’t big enough for the both of us’. Or perhaps fiction. Tevez waves to fans as he takes his place on the bench for Argentina at former club West Ham . Tevez shoots at goal during Argentina's 2-1 victory over Croatia at Upton Park last week . Tevez made his return to the national team for the first time in three years . The fact remains that Tevez finds himself at Juve because United didn’t rate him sufficiently highly to pay a fee which is still disputed (figures range from £30-40million) and because he then fell out spectacularly with Roberto Mancini at Manchester City. By the way, January 6, 2015, is the date for those of you who like schadenfreude — Juventus (Tevez) v Inter (Mancini) in Torino. Book now to avoid disappointment. Juve are in position to win their fourth consecutive Scudetto but, for one reason or another, their return to national dominance hasn’t seen a rise in their competitive ability in European terms. New coach Maxi Allegri admits: ‘When I took over, president Agnelli told me something which impacted. He said: “It’s impossible to win every year but we must be in contention for everything when March comes around"". We need to think as little as possible about the fact that this is our chance to win four Scudetti on the bounce and concentrate on our primary objective which is to ensure that we get through the Champions League group stage.' Winning the Champions League this year seems a big ask, although on paper this is a squad which, if it was fully firing, should theoretically ask questions of any team. Juventus captain Gianluca Vialli (centre) holds Champions League trophy after victory over Ajax in 1996 . Roberto Mancini and Tevez (right) celebrate winning the Premier League in 2012 . Tevez and Mancini fell out and it led to the striker leaving Manchester City for Juventus . Tevez and his Manchester United team-mates celebrate winning the Premier League in 2009 . But the drive is to be properly Euro-muscular in time to lift the Coppa with the big ears 20 years on from the last time (in 1996) and the question is: Exactly where are they? To begin with they are in Sweden this week, facing Malmö in a Group A position where — while a defeat won’t eliminate them — a win seems vital to their progress. Step forward Tevez? Verón says: ‘He’s playing the best football of his life and in this club he seems to have found a new Boca Juniors (the club to which Carlitos swears undying allegiance). I can see it in his eyes.’ All fine and dandy. But as he showed two weeks ago in the 7-0 demolition of Parma with a brace, one of which was both Messi-esque and utterly sublime, Tevez needs to be Juve’s ‘extra’ element. To lift them. Thus far in all his European competition experience, at West Ham, Manchester United, City and Juventus he has managed a measly nine goals in 53 appearances. For the Old Lady of Italian football it needs to be Apache time. Vamos Carlitos.","Juan Sebastian Veron says Carlos Tevez is in form of his life for Juventus .

"David Moyes picked up his first point as Real Sociedad manager and provoked a touchline tantrum from Deportivo assistant coach Roberto Cabellud with his adversary storming down the tunnel after being sent off. Sociedad hired Moyes to provoke a reaction and he got one from his team who gave a much improved display that so nearly delivered their first win on the road this season but there was also a reaction from former Basketball player Cabellud when Moyes suggested he calmed down 29 minutes into the first half. Deportivo coach Victor Fernandez had upset the fourth official and when the referee came across to speak to the home team’s bench Cabellud said something and was sent off. When he walked past the Real Sociedad bench Moyes gestured with his hands for the former fitness coach to calm down at which point he approached the former Everton and Manchester United manager before being ushered away from the field of play.

'I don’t know [what the sending off was for] I was in my dug-out and he was in his dug-out. I don’t not what the problem was but he seemed quite angry about something,' said Moyes about the incident after full-time. On the pitch Moyes’ first game in charge might easily have offered up all three points had his team coupled dogged defending with better finishing. Sergio Canales, Carlos Vela and Esteban Granero combined on 12 minutes only for Deportivo keeper Fabricio to save Canales’ shot with his face. Chory Castro then teed up Granero only for the former QPR man to fire over. The visitors were not having it all their own way and Zubikarai saved well from Luisinho. They also grew in confidence in the second half but Real better than they have down so far this season and they still forced chances at the other end with Canales’ shot saved by Fabricio and Vela shooting just wide. Sociedad also had keeper Zubikarrai to thank for the point after he made a brilliant late save from Jose Rodriguez. They had earned their point throwing themselves in front of Deportivo shots late on to ensure Moyes didn’t go back to San Sebastian empy-handed. It wasn’t quite the start of some of Britain’s greatest coaching imports. Bobby Robson won his first game in charge of Barcelona 4-2, Terry Venables won his 3-0 and Howard Kendall enjoyed a 2-1 victory on his bow as Athletic Bilbao coach. But there was plenty about the performance to encourage Moyes who has only had a week to work with the players and was hit by injuries in the build up to the game. He was without experienced midfielders Xabi Prieto and David Zurutuza. And central defender Inigo Martinez pulled out late with a bruised left leg. As far as Moyes’ overseas predecessors in the Real Sociedad hot-seat are concerned a draw was as well as both Harry Lowe in the 1930-31 season and John Toshack in the 1985-86 campaign did. It was also better than the start made by Chris Coleman whose team lost 2-0 to Castellon on the first day of the 2007-08 season.

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has warned against Gareth Southgate and Roy Hodgson picking his young England stars for next summer's European Under 21 Championships and then, if qualified, Euro 2016 the following campaign.

"Newcastle winger Rolando Aarons is still waiting for the club to open talks over a new contract, with Bundesliga side Schalke interested in signing the player who first caught the eye during a pre-season tournament in Gelsenkirchen. Sportsmail understands that Aarons and United are yet to sit down to discuss an improvement to his first professional deal, signed only in April and set to expire in the summer of 2016. The player’s representatives are surprised by the delay and hope the 19-year-old will be rewarded for his senior breakthrough and involvement in the England Under 20 set-up, where he has won an admirer in Roy Hodgson. Newcastle's Rolando Aarons tussles with Manchester City's Bacary Sagna in the league cup game in October . Aarons scored his first competitive goal for Newcastle against Manchester City in the league cup in October . The Three Lions boss is not the only one impressed by the Jamaican-born teenager. Manchester City and Liverpool are both circling, but it is the interest from Schalke which is strongest. They noted Aarons’ name back in August when the then unknown wideman lit up a four-team tournament at the Veltins Arena. Indeed, he scored his first senior goal in a 3-1 win over the hosts and his performance that weekend won him permanent elevation to Alan Pardew’s first-team ranks. Aarons, though, is currently sidelined with a hamstring problem and will miss Saturday's visit of Queens Park Rangers. The 19-year-old is congratulated by Newcastle manager Alan Pardew after scoring against Manchester City . Newcastle – victorious in their last five in all competitions – will be without injured skipper Fabricio Coloccini and vice-captain Cheick Tiote, while Steven Taylor and Mehdi Abeid are also absent. Striker Papiss Cisse is still struggling for his fitness – despite scoring in midweek for Senegal – and will not start, meaning Ayoze Perez will again lead the line. The 21-year-old Spaniard has scored three in three – his last an exquisite back-heel in the victory at West Brom – and has been the subject of headlines comparing him to some of the club’s great No 9s, not that Pardew welcomes such exposure. ‘Some of the headlines have been way off the mark – the new Alan Shearer, the new Andy Cole,’ said the United boss. Ayoze Perez scores with an exquisite back-heel against West Brom in Newcastle's last Premier League game . The 21-year-old celebrates with Aarons after scoring the winning goal against Liverpool this month . ‘This is a boy who has played three games. Those players are legends and have done it all. ‘But at the moment he’s fearless. He’s got the wind in his sails and is going along very nicely. He’s been very sharp in training. He’s a threat. ‘If you take your eye off him he’s a predator. I’m sure QPR will be having conversations of how to look after him. He’s difficult to pin down, his movement is very clever. ‘He is just setting foot in the Premier League, but I have to say he’s done really well so far. I’m pleased with him. He’s a smashing player and is low maintenance.’ Meanwhile, Pardew has defended his decision to tell Jonas Gutierrez to find a new club after the player first returned from testicular cancer treatment last December. Jonas Gutierrez was told that he did not feature in Newcastle's plans last December . Pardew, pictured taking a Newcastle training session, insists the decision was 'purely football' The 31-year-old is due back on Tyneside next month having successfully fought the illness for a second time and has spoken in his homeland of his disappointment with events of 12 months ago. But Pardew said: ‘It was a pure football decision and those are decisions that have to be made. ‘It’s difficult – when you’ve said to a player to get a new club and unfortunately the illness has come. ‘You try to be supportive but, of course, the players wants to find a bit more assurance than that. ‘But that decision was a 100 per cent football decision. I want to invite Jonas back and give him the best possible chance when he returns. ‘What he has done is absolutely marvellous, to recover like he has. ‘We’re very proud of what he’s done.’","Aarons signed his first professional contract with Newcastle in April .

In front of a raucous home crowd, Bellew boxed his way to victory over the Welshman who faded in the second half of a fight that didn't quite live up to the hype. There was surprise at the announcement of a split decision but despite one judge giving Cleverly the nod, Bellew deservedly took the spoils in the rematch. The victor said: 'It's over. I'll fight anywhere, he's not a cruiserweight. It's been a long camp, 12 weeks, he was pacing himself and he looked at the belly and thought I would tire – I don’t tire at cruiserweight.' After beating Bellew in 2011, Cleverly made three routine defences of his light-heavyweight world title, barely losing a round against uninspiring opponents. With a fight against Bernard Hopkins seemingly further away than ever, Cleverly took an unnecessary risk by facing hard-hitting Sergey Kovalev last summer. But the gamble backfired spectacularly as the Welshman was dismantled over four brutal rounds in front of his home crowd in Cardiff.

Bellew throws his hands in the air after winning the WBO and WBA cruiserweight titles . Bellew had Cleverly on the ropes during the ninth round of the bout . Cleverly struggled to cope with Bellew throughout the cruiserweight showdown . Bellew, meanwhile, regrouped and plotted his path to a second world title shot. He was untroubled until struggling to a draw with the tricky Isaac Chilemba but won a unanimous decision in the rematch two months later. Then, 12 months ago, on his birthday on the last day of November, he fought world champion Adonis Stevenson in Quebec but was stopped in the sixth round, prompting a move to cruiserweight where he would soon be joined by Cleverly. By now, both were promoted by Eddie Hearn and a rematch was inevitable. A three-fight plan was set and after each enjoyed two routine stoppage victories, the waiting was over. Much has been made of Bellew's apparently superior power at cruiserweight but Cleverly was confident he had grown into the weight after adding almost two stone of muscle. The 27-year-old is now under the tutelage of former strength and conditioning coach Darren Wilson having split from father Vince who had guided him to his world title. And it was he made the better start, winning the jab exchanges in the opening round as Bellew looked to land his dynamite left hook. But the home favourite settled in the second session, forcing Cleverly back, preventing him from measuring the distance and finding his range. And the former world champion looked uncomfortable under pressure while his own attack amounted to little more than a pawing jab. In the fourth round, however, he slung his hands low in defiance, as if to show Bellew his power was having little effect. In the next, Cleverly appeared to settle on the back foot, outboxing and outfoxing Bellew to enjoy his best spell since the opening session.

And he continued to frustrate the home favourite who, despite throwing more punches, was struggling to make them count. But his persistence paid off in round eight as he forced Cleverly to cling on in the centre of the ring. It would prove to be a turning point. Tiredness set in and Cleverly struggled to hold off the bigger man's advances. At first he traded on the ropes, toe-to-toe, punch-for-punch.

He needed a big response going into the last two stanzas but opted to stand in the same spot against the ropes for the next two rounds. Cleverly later revealed he hurt his right hand in the second round. At the bell it was Bellew who celebrated; Cleverly simply looked beaten. He said: 'I said it would be a replica of the first.

"Ched Evan's mother Helen Roberts has praised Judy Finnigan after the TV presenter made controversial comments that the footballer's rape was not 'violent' The mother of Ched Evans eagerly backed Judy Finnigan’s ‘level-headed’ claim that his offence was ‘not violent’. Helen Roberts, who has consistently defended her son’s name, also took to Twitter to highlight vitriolic comments by other users about Evans’ victim. Mrs Roberts posted a remark on Twitter on Monday, which appeared to be deleted later, praising Miss Finnigan and criticising her fellow Loose Women presenter Ruth Langsford. She wrote: ‘Judy Finnigan thank you for being level-headed and not joining the hysteria. Ruth Langsford was trying to achieve. She was totally biased #chedevans.’ She also retweeted comments likely to be seen as questioning whether the ordeal of Evans’ victim – who suffered vicious slurs on social media following the former Sheffield United footballer’s conviction – actually constituted rape. One user whose comments Mrs Roberts quoted several times on her Twitter account is a female Sheffield United supporter, who wrote: ‘[The victim] didn’t suffer, she said she couldn’t remember. 'This is so frustrating.’ She retweeted a comment from another user, which said: ‘[Judy Finnigan] has got it right #JusticeForChed. Many men in prison after joint night of pleasure.’ Earlier in the week, Mrs Roberts had directed her anger at women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet, who set up the online petition calling for Evans to be barred from returning to football when he is released from prison. Mrs Roberts wrote: ‘So a non-existent “woman” has got thousands of people to sign a petition against something that she read in the paper might happen #getalife.’ Later Mrs Roberts wrote: ‘She hates men until she needs them to sign her false petition. Sign as long as you don’t look at her.’ Rapist: Footballer Ched Evans is due to be released within days. He attacked the woman in a hotel room in 2011 . She also highlighted an attack on the campaigner by another Twitter user, which said: ‘When you lose sight of real feminism and become a man-hater like Hatchet, you become the oppressor you once fought against.’ Another comment retweeted by Mrs Roberts seemed to show support for her belief that her son’s conviction was wrong, saying: ‘Wow, apart from Ruth, the panellists were so level-headed. Shame they weren’t on the jury!’ A Sheffield United fan commented: ‘Massive respect to Judy Finnigan for giving her genuine opinion on the Ched Evans case #JusticeForChed’ Later Mrs Roberts posted: ‘There is nothing better to keep you going then receiving support and kind words from people that you have never met. #appreciated.’ Some Twitter users called for Miss Finnigan to be fired, but ITV said she will still appear on the show next week. Yesterday Mrs Roberts declined to comment at her £250,000 detached house in the seaside town of Rhyl in North Wales.","Helen Roberts has consistently defended her son’s name .

"Nicolas Sanchez's virtuoso kicking display led Argentina to a deserved 18-13 win at France - their first against Les Bleus on French soil since 2007. The Toulon fly-half converted three of Argentina's four drop goals on the night and kicked over two penalties as the Pumas led 18-3 early in the second half. The hosts, who failed to display the same intensity that had seen them comfortably beat Fiji and edge Australia earlier this month, did not give up with Wesley Fofana scoring the only try of the game in the 57th minute. Les Bleus cut the gap to 18-13 in the 64th minute and almost pulled off a late comeback but Scott Spedding's try in the last play of the game was overruled by touch judge Steve Walsh as the player was deemed to have been held up. Juan Martin Hernandez (left) celebrates a famous victory with man of the match Nicolas Sanchez . Sanchez fired the away side to victory, kicking all of Argentina's 18 points . The win is Argentina's second this autumn after they beat Italy 20-18 last week after previously falling 41-31 to Scotland. France went into the game at the Stade de France without 21-year-old Racing Metro wing Teddy Thomas, who was dropped by coach Philippe Saint-Andre because he had missed a training session this week. The South Americans welcomed back Agustin Creevy from injury and the Argentina captain earned a penalty in the opening minute, which was slotted over by Sanchez. France could have tied the game in the 12th minute but Lopez missed with his own penalty attempt and five minutes later Sanchez's drop goal doubled Argentina's lead. The visitors were forced to make a substitution shortly after with Marcelo Bosch sustaining a shoulder injury. He was replaced by Gonzalez Iglesias. In the 26th minute, Les Bleus were penalised for offside and Sanchez made no mistake to extend his team's lead. Argentina then hit France with two consecutive drop goals - the first from Juan Martin Hernandez and the next by Sanchez to go 15-0 up. Camille Lopez kicked the hosts' first points of the game after Argentina were penalised for pulling down a maul. But the Pumas picked up where they left off after the re-start and in the 45th minute, Sanchez missed a penalty for the first time to give the French hope. Two minutes later, a third drop goal by Sanchez - and fourth overall for the Pumas - extended Argentina's lead to 18-3. The French reacted and got a try in the 57th minute. Fofana bulldozed his way over after hitting substitute Rory Kockott's pop pass at pace. Lopez kicked the resulting conversion to make it 18-10. The French continued to press forward and a Kockott penalty closed the gap to 18-13 with 16 minutes remaining. Roared by the fans, Les Bleus made a last-ditch effort to get a try. The crowd and the players believed they had won the game when Spedding went over but their claims were waved away without the use of the Television Match Official and Argentina were left celebrating a huge victory.","Sanchez kicked all 18 points to give the Pumas a first win in France since 2007 .

"Five hundred Paratroopers are to march on Downing Street in a bid to persuade David Cameron to give a gallantry medal to a soldier who died in a ferocious battle during the Falklands War. Corporal Stewart ‘Bulletproof’ McLaughlin, 27, was killed by rocket fire after leading a succession of daredevil charges towards Argentine machine-gun and sniper posts during the Battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982. The Paras routed enemy positions and secured a heroic victory. Courage under fire: Cpl Stewart 'bulletproof' McLaughlin was killed by rocket fire after leading a succession of daredevil charges during the Battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982 . The capture of Mount Longdon proved hugely significant. The peak overlooks the Falklands’ capital, Port Stanley, and within two days of the battle UK soldiers were able to force the Argentinians to surrender. After the battle, Cpl McLaughlin’s commanding officer put him forward for a medal. But the soldier’s family claim the handwritten citation was lost before it could be typed and sent to London for approval. The march to No 10 in July is in protest against the Ministry of Defence’s refusal to consider a retrospective medal. The Prime Minister has the authority to grant awards to veterans in exceptional circumstances. After the battle, Cpl McLaughlin's commanding officer put him forward for a medal. But the soldier's family claim the handwritten citation was lost before it could be typed and sent to London for approval . Decisive: The capture of Mount Longdon proved hugely significant and within two days of the battle UK soldiers were able to force the Argentinians to surrender . Cpl McLaughlin’s commanding officer, . Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, has now taken the unprecedented step of . writing a new citation, insisting the soldier deserves formal . recognition and that his actions were ‘absolutely instrumental’ in . determining the outcome of the battle. ‘At one point he ran forward under fire . to pull a wounded man back into cover by grabbing his webbing [a . waistband with storage pouches], his example reassuring those around him . that he did not seem fazed by anything and if they too were hit he . would get them back to relative safety,’ writes Sir Hew. A commemorative plaque for Cpl McLaughlin close to the spot where he fell at Mount Longdon . ‘McLaughlin realised that it was only . a matter of time before they incurred more casualties so he shouted, . “I’ll count one, two, three, then we all go.” 'About a minute later he did the countdown and shouted, “Come on lads, I’m bulletproof, follow me!” ‘He then ran forward towards the gunfire, followed by the rest of the section, who all reached the cover of the rocks unscathed. Members of the section commented later that it was the bravest thing they had ever seen. ‘Cpl McLaughlin’s leadership through a terrible battle, of which his young soldiers had no previous experience, inspired confidence in all and sustained those who might otherwise have faltered.’ Cpl McLaughlin, from Liverpool, was among 23 Paras killed that night. After the battle, regimental officers recommended which soldiers deserved medals – but Army top brass ruled that only those citations typed on the appropriate forms would be considered. In the end, just nine awards were made. The soldier’s son, also called Stewart, said: ‘At the time they didn’t have a typewriter, so they liberated an Olivetti from the Argentinians. ‘There was then a mad rush to type up as many of the citations as possible before the Paras came home. ‘A citation was never typed up for my father so I’d like the Prime Minister to right a wrong that has stood for so long. Mr Cameron is our only hope because the Ministry of Defence doesn’t consider appeals for medals.’ Para's evacuate wounded comrades from Mount Longdon . The Prime Minister can make extraordinary awards. In 2012, Mr Cameron announced that sailors who delivered supplies to Russia during the Second World War should receive the Arctic Star. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘Citations for operational gallantry awards are written at the time of the operation and there are clear opportunities to ensure any omissions are addressed at the time. ‘Any changes now would undermine the integrity of the awards.’","Stewart McLaughlin, 27, was killed during the Battle of Mount Longdon .

"With Fred's straight brown hair and Gus's curly ginger mane, the teasing the Turner brothers got from their friends was rather predictable. Less predictable, however, was Fred's response to it. After putting up with endless jokes about the boys having different fathers, 17-year-old Fred settled the matter once and for all – by designing his very own DNA testing machine. Fred Turner, 17, (right) built a DNA testing machine in his bedroom to establish why his brother, Gus, 14, (left) is ginger . The budding scientist used it to . analyse Gus's DNA, proving that the 14-year-old had the genetic mutation . which gives a person ginger hair. And as well as silencing his friends, . Fred's ingenuity earned him a top engineering prize – and a place to . study biochemistry at Oxford. He said: 'After years of jokes from my . friends saying me and Gus have different dads, I built the machine to . test once and for all why my brother is ginger and I'm not. 'The theory is that red hair appears . in people with a mutated gene. They have two copies of a recessive gene . which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein in DNA. 'I built the machine . so I could put that theory to the test and see for myself if Gus has . that mutation, which would explain why Gus has ginger hair.' Fred built the machine from items he found around his house, including an old video player . The machine, known as a Polymerase Chain Reaction machine, cost Fred just £250 to build - compared to the £3,000 he would have had to fork out for a new one . Fred, from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, . spent a year and £400 building the polymerase chain reaction machine, . one component of which was an old video player he found at home. He got . the idea after reading about a similar one built by a man in America. Fred describes the device, which would . cost £3,000 to buy new, as a 'DNA photocopier'. It amplifies the DNA . strands so they can be analysed in a lab. Once he had built the machine, Fred . collected cells from the inside of his brother's cheek with a swab, then . released the DNA from these cells by heating them to 95C in a solution . Next, the DNA was added to an enzyme and a primer and put in the machine for a two-hour cycle. Finally he sent the sample to a lab. Analysis there showed that Gus's DNA did have the ginger mutation in its sequencing code. Fred fitted in his work on the machine alongside studying for A-levels in biology, maths, further maths, physics and chemistry. He has now been named UK Young Engineer of the Year, with celebrity judge Ben Miller praising him for his 'outstanding project'. The bright pupil credits his mother . Louise, a 49-year-old account manager, and father David, a 50-year-old . self-employed businessman, with fuelling his enthusiasm for science as a . child. Scientists were so impressed that they named Fred the UK's Young Engineer of the Year . Speaking about his award winning invention, Fred Turner described it as a 'DNA photocopier'. He . explained that his first task was to extract buccal cells from his . brother's cheek which he did by getting Gus to swirl saltwater around . his mouth and spit it out. He then added various chemicals and put it into the centrifuge of his machine. He . said: 'When you spin it really fast in this tiny tube all the cells . collect in the bottom in what is called a pellet of cells. 'After . taking it out and putting a solution in I heat the tube to 95 degrees . centigrade, further breaking down the cells and releasing the DNA into . the solution. 'There is a . further centrifuge step which essentially removes broken bits of the . cells that don't contain DNA, they go to the bottom of the solution. 'In . an even smaller tube you put the solution, that has just got DNA in it, . into the machine along with an enzyme and a primer and set the machine . to go through the cycle. 'The . cycle takes two hours and after, while there is nothing you can see . because DNA is transparent, there is more DNA than you started with - . you have effectively amplified the DNA. 'It is a DNA photocopier, amplifying the DNA you have to see what you've got. 'If you start with one copy you will end up with a billion copies after approximately 30 cycles (the two hour process). 'Once the cycle is finished you have two options depending on what gene you are targeting - sequencing and electrophoresis. 'To identify my brother's mutation I opted for sequencing which I couldn't do at home so I had to send the sample to a lab. 'The . sequencing gives you a genetic code of As, Gs, Cs, Ts. The ginger . mutation is just one letter different in the code, called an SNP, and . when I sent Gus's sample away it was identified. 'I . already knew what I was looking for because you can look up the genome . on the internet so when I got my sample back I could see the mutation . that causes Gus's ginger hair.' Fred was able to use the machine to prove that Gus has the genetic mutation that causes ginger hair . Fred will now go to Oxford University to study biochemistry .","Fred Turner, 17, from Yorkshire built a DNA testing machine in his bedroom .

The claims have been made by the South Korean state-run Korean Institute for National Unification. It’s white paper on human rights outlines information from 230 defectors who reported seeing the public executions which had been carried out since 2006. Shortages: A North Korean boy working at a collective farm in the southern province of South Hwanghae which was damaged by floods and typhoons last year that wiped out 65 percent of its barley, wheat and potato crops . The report was reviewed by the Yonhap News Agency which said some of those interviewed claimed the executions were for eating or selling human flesh. Authorities executed one man for killing and eating parts of a co-worker then trying to sell the rest at a market as mutton. Widespread food shortages forced another to kill and eat a girl three years ago in Hyesan, Yonhap reported. A third incident of cannibalism was reported in 2011, but researchers were unable to uncover more details. Yonhap could not verify the allegations because of strict clampdowns on information coming from the North Korea, according to Global Post. Pariah state: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, pictured left riding a navy boat in February this year, took over from his father Kim Jong il last year . The internationally isolated country has long battled food shortages, especially after an attempt to reform its currency in 2009.

Forgoing maternity clothes yet again, Kate looked chic in a £169 mac from High Street store Hobbs. The water-resistant coat was the ideal choice for the blustery conditions at the waterside where Kate listened to a brass band play out before smashing a £1,250 Nebuchadnezzar - a 15 litre bottle of champagne the equivalent of 20 regular 75cl bottles - on the ship's hull. She paired her coat with a sinemay hat with bow detail from royal favourite milliner Jane Taylor and black court shoes. As has become her signature maternity style, Kate chose a dress shorter than the styles she wore prior to her pregnancy. While the generously cut coat skimmed her bump, her legs, carefully clad in those nude tights she (or Pippa, or Carole) is never without. Scroll down for video . Looking good!

This was to be the Duchess of Cambridge's last solo engagement before her baby is born. Kate looked relaxed as she stepped from her chauffeur-driven vehicle to the quayside in Southampton. She made the journey from London by helicopter for the naming ceremony of Princess Cruises' 3,600-passenger vessel Royal Princess. A musical extravaganza was staged ahead of the christening of the new vessel and blue carpet, not the customary red, was laid out for her arrival. Good show!

Spectators were from East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Kate's charity, SkillForce which has William as its figurehead, and Harry's organisation WellChild. Kate is the new liner's godmother, a symbolic position similar to a patron or sponsor that dates back to the mid-19th century when leading women were selected for the honour. Princess Cruises has a history of illustrious godmothers for past ships including Diana, Princess of Wales, who named the first Princess Royal in 1984, actress Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, and Baroness Thatcher. The Band of her Majesty's Royal Marines Portsmouth accompanied by the Pipers of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards gave the start of the ceremonies a military flavour. They lined Kate's route to her seat after playing rousing tunes such as Pomp And Circumstance, sea shanties and a march called HMS Queen Elizabeth.

"The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and last Tuesday, the 2014-15 season commenced. Every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside. HEADLINE-MAKER . Lebron James - The four-time NBA MVP made his long awaited return for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Four years, three months and 21 days on from his last match for the club, the Cavs fell to a 95-90 defeat at the hands of the London-bound New York Knicks in their season-opener. LeBron James played his first game for Cleveland in over four years, after a spell with the Miami Heat . James' return has not started as well as he would have hoped, with the Cavs losing their first game . The Cavs did hit back to win one game this week, but they are 1-3, despite a promising pre-season . Never afraid of hyperbole, the 10-time NBA All-Star told reporters before the game that the match was 'probably one of the biggest sporting events that's up there ever.' The hyped Cavs, after looking so connected during the pre-season, have underwhelmed so far and their record stands at 1-3. GOOD WEEK . The Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors may still be unbeaten but the NBA's global expansion was the week's big winner. Tickets for 'NBA Global Games London 2015' featuring the Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks sold out in a new record time. Stephen Curry drives to the basket as the Golden State Warriors enjoyed an unbeaten start to the season . The game, which will be played at The O2 on Thursday January 15, sold out inside an hour. It will be the fifth NBA regular-season game to be played in the capital and marks the ninth consecutive sell-out NBA contest at The O2, dating back to 2007. BAD WEEK . The Los Angeles Lakers have won five NBA titles in the 21st century but have started with five consecutive losses for the first time since 1957, when they were still in Minneapolis. Their miserable start was compounded as rookie power forward Julius Randle crumbled to the hardwood after landing awkwardly on his right leg midway through the fourth quarter of the opening 108-90 loss to the Houston Rockets. LA Lakers talisman Kobe Bryant looks unimpressed as his team slumped to their worst start since 1957 . Bryant could be tempted to leave the franchise in 2016, despite previously stating he would stay for life . The Lakers confirmed that Randle had fractured his tibia and would be out for four to six months. Star man Kobe Bryant has said he'll remain a Laker for life but there is a definite possibility that the 16-time All-Star could look to leave the franchise in 2016. BRIT WATCH . A record 101 international players from 37 countries were on opening night rosters for the 2014-15 season and they include two Brits. Luol Deng, who went to school in Croydon, made his Miami Heat debut as they defeated the Washington Wizards 107-95. Britain's only representative Luol Deng throws down a dunk for the Miami Heat against the Toronto Raptors . The two-time NBA All-Star scored 12 points as Miami began life without LeBron. Deng has averaged nearly 30 minutes on court per match as the defending champions have started the season with a 3-2 record. However Surrey's Joel Freeland, a power forward for the Portland Trail Blazers, has been sidelined because of a foot injury after playing six minutes in the opening two matches. AND FINALLY .

"Take That frontman Gary Barlow does not believe the band's £20million tax scandal will affect their popularity because fans are simply 'not interested'. Barlow, 43, who invested in a tax avoidance scheme along with fellow bandmates Mark Owen and Howard Donald, as well as manager Jonathan Wild, said fans are more interested in 'records and tours'. It comes as the band prepared to launch their new single as a trio after Jason Orange – the only member of the group not to have invested in the controversial scheme – quit last month. Scroll down for video . Take That star Gary Barlow, who invested in a tax avoidance scheme along with fellow bandmates Mark Owen and Howard Donald, as well as manager Jonathan Wild, said fans are more interested in 'records and tours' Speaking for the first time since news of the tax avoidance scandal broke in May, Barlow said 'it's something we've got to get to the bottom of'. He told The Sun: 'Our fans, they want to buy our records and watch our tours. They're not interested.' Bandmate Owen, 42, added: 'It has been a bit tricky what's gone on – it's not the easiest. 'Hopefully by this time next year, the tax thing will be sorted out, we'll be doing live shows and it will be a positive time for us.' Earlier this year it was revealed that Barlow, Owen, Donald, 46, and Mr Wild faced a multimillion-pound tax bill for attempting to shelter £66million in a tax-avoidance scheme called Icebreaker Management. Mr Barlow appeared at BBC Radio 2 Studios in London today to greet fans after his controversial remarks . Band mate Mark Owen said the situation had been 'a bit tricky' and 'not the easiest' to endure . Howard Donald arrives at the studios this morning to crowds of excited fans. His band mate previously said he hoped they could move on from the scandal to start touring again . While Icebreaker styled itself as a music-industry investment scheme, a judge ruled in May that it was 'known and understood by all concerned to be a tax avoidance scheme'. It allegedly allowed the Take That members to avoid tax on around £63million made through world tours and CD sales. In 2012, lawyers representing the four men confirmed they were investors in the partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes. They added that their clients paid significant amounts of tax. There has never been any suggestion that the former Take That band members, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams, invested in the Icebreaker scheme. Orange, 44, left the group after 23 years last month after apparently becoming 'disillusioned' with the music industry. Jason Orange (pictured centre right with his former bandmates) left Take That last month after 23 years . The band's new single, These Days, (pictured above) is to be played for the first time on the radio today . Despite his exit being linked to the tax scandal, his bandmates have continually insisted it had 'absolutely nothing' to do with his reasons for leaving. The trio, who started work on their new album earlier this year with Orange's 'blessing', today prepared to launch the first single from the new record. The new song, These Days, is to be played for the first time on the radio today ahead of its official release in November. All three of the group share vocal duties on the song, which is described as 'a nod to the sound that defined their early years' and 'out-and-out feelgood pop'. It is the first single of the band's new album, called III, which will be released on December 1.","Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald invested in tax avoidance scheme .

"Almost twenty thousands people in Bermuda had their power cut off, and thousands were assailed by falling roof tiles and uprooting trees as Hurricane Gonzalo battered the tiny island. More than 18,000 homes still have no electricity after the storm, which passed directly over the island Friday, hitting it with 110mph winds, which continued to strike hours after the storm left. In the harbor, boats were dragged away from them moorings and crashed into one another. Premier Michael Dunkley said cleanup efforts were going smoothly. He said the U.S., Britain and other nations have offered assistance. Bermuda is a British territory with 65,000 inhabitants. Scroll down for video . Damage: The 110mph storm roared over the Atlantic island, uprooting trees and damaging power lines . Battered: Hurricane Gonzalo left most of the residents in Bermuda without power as it hit the tiny island territory Friday night and early Saturday (above) Dunkley tweeted: 'All hands were on deck and worked very well. Much to be done but we are roaring back!' Nobody in Bermuda has been killed or seriously injured by the extreme weather. Earlier today residents were still urged to stay inside and keep off the roads. Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110 mph. Even after beginning to move away, its fierce winds battered the island for hours. Aftermath: Hurricane battered Bermuda for hours - and around 18,000 are still without power . Bad luck: The storm was the second to hit Bermuda in just a week, having been struck by Tropical Storm Fay last weekend . Fallen: Tiles were knocked off this church roof by Gonzalo, which has now tacked north into the Atlantic . Maria Frith, who owns Grape Bay Cottages on Bermuda's south coast, said that the hurricane woke her up before dawn when it tore the patio roof off her house. 'To be perfectly honest with you, I was terrified, partly because of the noise. 'It was really scary.' Taking it in: A man is seen on the coast of Bermuda looking out at the surf as the hurricane makes its approach . Officials have not yet announced whether government offices and schools would reopen Monday. The island's international airport remained closed Saturday night but officials said it might reopen Sunday afternoon. The island was still recovering from last weekend's blast from Tropical Storm Fay, which also damaged homes and toppled power lines. Boats rocked: A look at some damaged boats that came loose from their mooring . Not sailing away: Though tress are down all over the island the damage is not catastrophic . ‘To be struck twice by two different cyclones is unusual, to say the least,’ said Max Mayfield, a former director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami . The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Gonzalo weakened as it moved away from Bermuda on a track that would take it past Newfoundland and then across the Atlantic to Britain and Ireland. Late Saturday, the storm was centered 360 miles southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mphas it moved northeast at 39 mph. From above: A satellite image of Gonzalo as it hit the island . Past problems: A beachfront property that was destroyed when Hurricane Fabian hit the island in 2003 . Much worse: Fabian, which caused waves to pound the island's shore as seen above, came ashore with higher wind speeds than Gonzalo .","Hurricane hit Friday night, causing damage across the Atlantic island .

"The billionaire owner of the Indianapolis Colts is seen struggling to stand in video that has just been released from his Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated arrest earlier this year. Jim Irsay was stopped shortly before midnight on March 16 in Carmel, Indiana, for going 10 mph in a 35 mph zone, and, after failing a field sobriety test, he was arrested under suspicion of DUI and drug possession. Officers found prescription pills in his car, along with $29,000 cash. Scroll down for video . Stopped: Indianpolis Colts owner Jim Irsay (circled in red) was pulled over on March 16 of this year on suspicion of DUI . Revealed: Now, dashcam footage of the arrest has been released (above) that shows him struggling to stand . Booked: Irsay would ultimately fail his field sobriety test . Now, dashcam footage from the cop car shows just how bad Irsay appeared that evening, as he stumbles and comes close to falling in the first few minutes of the video, which is almost an hour long. Later, he sits on the hood of the police car and seems to have difficulty following the officer's flash light as the move it from side to side. He told officers that he had not been drinking and had not taken any pills that evening. The officer reported Irsay, 55, had glassy eyes and that a pill bottle was present in a briefcase on the passenger side of his vehicle, a Toyota Highlander. Oddly enough, the starting cost to purchase a Highlander is almost exactly how much cash Irsay had on him at the time of the arrest. Past glory: Irsay (above with former Colts coach Tony Dungy and former quarterback Peyton Manning) watched his team as they won the 2007 Super Bowl . Shortly after his arrest he decided to enter rehab, no doubt a smart decision as one area sports writer from the Indy Star penned a column just two days after the incident saying, 'For years, Colts insiders have known that Irsay was struggling again with drugs.' While he was away, his daughter Carlie began to handle the day-to-day operations of the team. Touch and go: Irsay (with his back to the camera) attempts to touch the tip of his finger to the officer's hand in this still . Hunched: Even sitting down, Irsay still seems to be having trouble, here as he tries to follow the officer's flashlight . In September, Irsay pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of driving while under the influence of prescription drugs. And while the court went somewhat easy on him, giving him just a year of probation and no jail time, the NFL gave him the biggest punishment they can dole out on a team's owner under the league's personal conduct policy - a six game suspension and $500,000 fine. Irsay, whose team won the Super Bowl in 2007, has been the Colts owner since the death of their previous owner, his father Robert, in 1997.","Jim Irsay was arrested on suspicion of DUI and drug possession shortly before midnight on March 16 in Caramel, Indiana .

"A woman who disappeared in Idaho last week has been found 2,000 miles away disoriented in the small Mississippi town where her father was once a minister in the 1960s. Cynthia Adams, 52, was reported missing by her husband on Tuesday when she didn't return from a doctor's appointment near her home in Boise. She told police in fits and starts she didn't know how she traveled the 2,160 miles to a home deep in the woods outside Clara, Mississippi. Found: Cynthia Adams, 52, was found on Saturday in Clara, Mississippi, more than 2,000 miles from her home in Boise, Idaho, after she went missing on Tuesday. She doesn't remember how she got there . Adams, who has no history of memory problems,  could not remember her family in Idaho, police said. Detectives discovered she made three cash withdrawals along the way, one in Idaho and two in Wyoming, according to Stan Niccolls of the Boise Police Department. On Saturday, she appeared at the home of a woman she grew up with in Clara. Wayne County, Mississippi, sheriff's deputy Michael Patton said Adams is lucky the same people lived at the house as in the 1960s. Adams' husband told the Idaho Statesman newspaper he had no reason to believe Cynthia would simply disappear. The couple hadn't fought, and though she had health problems and a guide dog, she didn't have issues with her memory. On Thursday, she was officially a missing person. On Friday, there was no update. But when Tina Brewer opened the Clara Grocery on Saturday morning, Adams was her first customer. 'She told us that she had got in at 1 o'clock in the morning and slept in her truck the night before,' Brewer said. 'She looked like somebody who'd been up all night. It was kinda strange.' She started listing names, Brewer said, and though Brewer didn't know the people she was talking about, older men in the store did. 'She kinda knew everybody they knew, she'd say first names and they'd say last names,' Brewer said. She asked for the McCarty girls. One man asked her, 'do you mean Bug?' She did indeed mean Bug, the nickname of Elizabeth McCarty, who married and became Elizabeth Singleton. Journey: Police said Adams made cash withdrawals in Idaho and Wyoming before appearing in Mississippi . Memory loss? Adams could not remember her husband in Idaho but knew people from her childhood . Adams then went straight to Singleton's home, deep in the woods outside of Clara, which is on the Pine Belt on the edge of the DeSoto National Forest, 20 miles west of the Alabama state line. Singleton said: 'She told me, these are the only clothes I've got. I said, well, honey, come on in.' Adams  couldn't remember her family in Idaho, but she did remember the people she grew up with. She said she had slept in the parking lot of her father's church on Friday night. The pastor's home used to be on the same property, along with a small religious school. 'She kept saying, ""My home is gone and the school is burned,''' Singleton said. 'I didn't understand. I asked her, were you in a tornado?' Then she went to Adams' Facebook page and saw the notices about her missing. She called police. Wayne County Deputy Michael Patton pulled up to Singleton's house on Saturday afternoon. 'I didn't want to scare her,' Patton said. 'She appeared a little confused. She was dressed OK, normal. But I got her name, and then saw she was the lady that was missing from Idaho.' Patton called an ambulance and watched them load her inside. Police reached her husband, who told the Idaho Statesman he planned to fly in as soon as he could. Staff at Wayne General Hospital in Waynesboro, Mississippi, declined to identify themselves or say whether Adams was a patient, citing federal privacy laws. For the residents of Clara, word of the stranger in town was just beginning to get around after church on Sunday afternoon. Niccolls, of the Boise police, said that since Adams has been found safe, the investigation is over and no criminal charges are pending. 'Really,' Niccolls said, 'it's up to her now what she does.' Singleton is still reeling from Adams' surprise visit. 'It was really crazy,' Singleton said. 'I'm hoping she'll get help. She's welcome to drop back by.'","Cynthia Adams, 52, reported missing in Boise, Idaho, on Tuesday .

"A couple were horrified to discover a baby rat cooking in their toaster as they made breakfast after smelling the rodent's hair burning. Jason Clark was preparing the meal with his wife Victoria when the 33-year-old noticed a 'disgusting' smell coming from the toaster. With a burning smell filling their flat in Peacehaven, East Sussex, the rodent squeaked and jumped out from the appliance as the two pieces of bread popped up. Jason and Victoria Clark were horrified when the tiny rodent squeaked and jumped out of the toaster along with two pieces of bread as they made breakfast . It is the latest in a string of rat sightings in their home, he said. 'I thought the smell was odd because my toast couldn't have burned that quickly, so went over to have a look. 'I popped the toast back up, and couldn't believe it when a rat squeaked and jumped out, then ran away behind the boiler. 'The rat hadn't made a sound when I put the toaster down and it’s only a small toaster. 'I threw the toaster away immediately but the experience hasn't put me off toast - but I make sure I check inside my new toaster before I use it.' Earlier this year Mr Clark had to go to hospital after being bitten by a rat as he took washing up liquid out of a cupboard under the sink. Jason and Victoria Clark said their flat has been infested with rodents for months and that they can hear them when they are in bed . The couple have laid traps in their flat but say there has been no improvement. Their housing association is investigating the issue . His 25-year-old wife, meanwhile, said they have trouble sleeping with the sound of the rodents in the walls. Orchard and Shipman, the housing association through which the couple rent their home, is investigating the alleged rat infestation. 'We have a pest control company attending the property and the baiting process has been ongoing on a weekly basis since early October. 'Once specialist investigations confirm the source, we will liaise to get the necessary works carried out immediately,' a spokesman said.","Jason and Victoria Clark were cooking breakfast when they noticed smell .

"England suffered another blow on Thursday morning when Andros Townsend pulled out of the squad to face Slovenia and Scotland through injury. Townsend was unable to train with England for the last two days because of a slight ankle injury he suffered while playing for Tottenham. And the Football Association confirmed on Thursday that the player would not be fit for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley or the friendly in Glasgow three days later. Andros Townsend has had to withdrwa from the England squad due to an ankle injury . Michael Carrick is also a doubt for the games against Slovenia and Scotland . An FA spokesman said: 'Andros Townsend will today leave the England squad and return to his club. 'Townsend reported for duty on Monday with a minor injury and will go back to Tottenham Hotspur for further treatment. 'He will miss England's games against Slovenia and Scotland.' Roy Hodgson's preparations for the double-header were disrupted on Wednesday when Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick was ruled out because of what the FA called a 'minor groin injury'. And 24 hours later, he learned Townsend would have to withdraw. It is understood that Hodgson will not call up a replacement for Townsend, who scored a stunning goal on his England debut against Montenegro last year. Townsend has endured a frustrating season with Tottenham but impressed for the Three Lions last season . Although Townsend was unlikely to have started this weekend's Euro 2016 qualifier, he would have probably featured at some stage against the Scots at Celtic Park on Tuesday night. The Spurs midfielder missed the World Cup with an ankle injury, but returned to the squad in August and scored his second England goal in the 5-0 win over San Marino last month. Townsend has struggled for form domestically this season and has started just one game in the Barclays Premier League.","Andros Townsend out of squad to play Slovenia and Scotland .

"This was the white wedding to end all white weddings, with even the guests being asked to become matching accessories to the bride. But that dress code was about as modest as Tamara Ecclestone’s raunchy, bacchanalian wedding feast was to be. But then with a £2.5 billion fortune, courtesy of her Formula 1 supremo father Bernie, her marriage to disgraced City stockbroker Jay Rutland was always going to be a little less than discreet. Just married: Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland down rose champagne on a boat on the French Riviera on Wednesday . Introducing Mr and Mrs Rutland! Jay Rutland and new bride Tamara Ecclestone were seen celebrating their marriage at a beach party on Wednesday following their Tuesday nuptials . A stumble here and there: Tamara looks a little unsteady on her feet as the couple head down to the shore . That, of course, is not her style. Tamara subscribes to the ‘if you’ve got it, flaunt it’ philosophy, and . she decided to mark the occasion with all the flamboyance money can buy. The trouble is, of course, that you can’t buy taste. Yesterday, the famous Grand-Hotel du . Cap-Ferrat, once a byword for Hollywood glamour, was surrendering to . Tamara’s new-money crowd. From the bridegroom pulling on a large cigar . to the muscled, tattooed guests and superannuated models, it was excess . all areas. The pictures barely do justice to the . extraordinary scenes of yesterday’s beach party, which followed the . sumptuous wedding of the previous night. It-girl Caroline Stanbury, a former fancy of Prince Andrew, who was among the guests, tweeted: ‘Still partying, Essex style.’ There was plenty of laughter, of . course, but perhaps the biggest smile came when the groom, who appeared . to be wearing a platinum band on his finger to match Tamara’s wedding . ring, declared of his new wife: ‘I admire her enormously. She does not . show her wealth . . . Money is not important. It’s not what attracted me . to her.’ Yet from the moment the two had . touched down in the South of France, where one Rolls-Royce was waiting . to whisk them away, and another to take their luggage, money was at the . heart of the celebration. On Tuesday, Tamara, 28, was sheathed . in a couture Vera Wang gown complete with 30 ft train and crystals on . the bodice. And she took her first dance as Mrs Rutland to a cover of . Lionel Richie’s Endless Love, performed live by Mariah Carey — hired for . £2.5 million. Miss Carey also sang her new single Beautiful. Sir Elton John also played an . hour-long set on Monday night, dedicating his song Circle Of Life, from . the soundtrack to Disney film The Lion King, to the happy couple. It is . thought the singer was paid £1 million to attend. Some guests claimed that Tamara had . been irritated over absent guests of honour Princesses Beatrice and . Eugenie and their mother, Sarah, Duchess of York — who failed to turn . up. A source said: ‘Tamara was livid that Fergie and her girls did not . attend. For her fairytale wedding she wanted royalty to attend.’ But yesterday the bride was on the beach and turning up the volume. Cheeky! Jay gives his new wife an affectionate bottom pinch . Strict dress code: It looked like everyone had adhered to the white theme . Although it was undeniably lavish, . exceeding its £5 million budget (the hotel rooms alone cost £600,000 and . some observers put the total cost at around £7 million), some . complained the three-day event failed to live up to expectations. Some . suggested that Mr Rutland’s guests behaved like ‘chavs’, jostling at the . free bar, exposing their behinds and being sick after drinking too much . alcohol. Former financier Mr Rutland, 31, was . banned for insider trading last year. The Financial Services Authority . reduced his fine from £160,000 to £30,000 due to his ‘financial . circumstances’ and a ‘debilitating illness’. He proposed within a month of meeting . Miss Ecclestone in January this year. In a 15-minute speech after the . wedding ceremony, he explained how they fell in love, and praised her . charity work, adding: ‘She owes her character to both her very . remarkable parents.’ Miss Ecclestone helps fundraise for Great Ormond . Street Hospital in London — by auctioning off her old clothes. Your carriage awaits: After grabbing a towel, Tamara joins her husband on the boat . You may kiss the bride: Tamara and Jay struggled to keep their hands off each other during the party . Mr Rutland joked about his bride’s . notorious shopping habits. In the same evening, she wore three couture . gowns — the Vera Wang dress, another long, white gown believed to be . designed by Versace, and a short sequinned ‘flapper’ dress, thought to . be by Alexander McQueen, for the dancing — but he denied she was . ‘shallow’, saying: ‘Tamara is the most caring and sensitive person I . know by a mile. 'She is incredibly faithful and loyal, and is an . incredible sister, daughter and friend. I love you with all my heart.’ Mr Rutland has reportedly signed a . pre-nuptial agreement, meaning he will not take any of Miss Ecclestone’s . wealth if they divorce. But as her husband, he is now free to enjoy her . opulent lifestyle to the full. Miss Ecclestone’s sister Petra, 24, . who also gave a speech, and her 55-year-old mother Slavica — who is . divorced from Bernie — arrived on Sunday to help with preparations. Loving the party: Tamara certainly seems like she is enjoying her time celebrating her big day . Mr Rutland’s friends from Essex . mingled with Miss Ecclestone’s celebrity guests, who included model and . TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, former It-girl Tamara Beckwith, Girls Aloud . singer Nicola Roberts, actor Jason Statham and his girlfriend, model . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. By day, the younger guests partied . next to the Grand Hotel’s 50 m infinity pool. The women had white . dresses, the men white shorts and bare chests. As the guests sipped on strawberry . daiquiris and snacked on squid and oysters, nearby ramblers were heard . complaining that the blaring music had disrupted the peaceful setting. Yesterday, the wedding party dressed . in white for a relaxed barbecue on Passable Beach, a mile away from the . hotel. However, some guests complained the event did not quite match up . to the grandeur expected of the Cap-Ferrat, one of the most exclusive . stretches of the French Riviera. One said: ‘It felt like a free-for-all. It was all very informal and relaxed, and guests were left to go up and . get their own drinks. ‘It was almost too informal. There were around 150 guests in total and around 40 to 50 were Jay’s friends. ‘It was very chavvy. During the . three-day event, some of them were mooning — and one was seen throwing . up after over-indulging. A lot of Tamara’s friends thought there might . be eligible bachelors they could meet, but many couldn’t wait to leave . the party.’ One figure remained above it all — . Tamara’s billionaire father Bernie. Despite reports to the contrary, the . wedding was not funded by the deep pockets of Mr Rutland’s new . father-in-law, 82-year-old Mr Ecclestone, who arrived late after . attending the Montreal Grand Prix. ‘He’s not paying a penny towards it,’ says a close friend. ‘Tamara has paid for it all herself.’","Heiress wed former banker on Tuesday in front of 150 guests at the Riviera's most luxurious hotel .

"Britain is facing a growing exodus of middle-class professionals and managers who are leaving the country to work abroad. The ‘brain drain’ of executives and middle managers means about 1,500 are leaving the country every week. In total, 75,000 left in 2010 – making them the biggest single group of individuals departing Britain, a Home Office report revealed. Britain is facing an exodus of middle class professionals and managers who are leaving the country to work abroad (File picture) They made up more than half of the 149,000 British emigrants last year. Most moved because they had been offered a job overseas and intended to stay for the long term. Business groups said high tax rates were acting as a spur for people to depart the country. The report said: ‘A large and increasing proportion of British citizens emigrating from the UK are those from professional or managerial occupations and this may have implications for the availability of skills in the UK.’ Two decades earlier, in 1991, this group made up about one in three British departures. Britons leaving the UK are most likely to be going to Australia, followed by the US and Spain. France, Germany, Canada and New Zealand are also popular destinations. John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said he hoped that cuts to personal tax rates would stem the tide of emigrants. ‘These are disturbing figures,’ he said. ‘There is no doubt that the spike in recent years was due in part to high personal tax rates, which the Chancellor is now tackling.’ The report said high house prices in the UK made emigration attractive to homeowners who were also entrepreneurs, because they could sell up and set up small businesses in expatriate communities. ‘The growth in house values in the UK compared to elsewhere in Europe may have enabled British property owners to sell up and live more cheaply abroad, while enjoying a better climate and quality of life. However, this may have changed since the recession, the report said. Around 1,500 executives and middle-managers are packing their briefcases and heading to work in foreign climes every week . The UK has 4.7million expats living overseas, putting it eighth in the world for the number of its citizens living abroad. Emigration from the UK peaked in 2008 at 427,000 but has dropped to about 350,000 a year since then. Last year around 201,000 leavers were non-British citizens. The Home Office report also showed that migrants from the Indian sub-continent are much less likely to return home once here than those from any other country. Arrivals from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan were ‘much more likely to stay permanently in the UK’ than migrants from the wealthier Old Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, the report found. British workers leaving the UK are most likely to be heading to Australia, pictured, followed by the US, Spain France, Germany, Canada and New Zealand . Just one in ten migrants from the Indian sub-continent in the 1980s and 1990s left within two years of arriving, and only 15 per cent left within five years, the figures showed. Some 86 per cent of Bangladeshis, 81 per cent of Pakistanis, and 70 per cent of Indian migrants entering the UK on a family visa in 2004 had settled in the UK within five years. More than four in ten of arrivals from Australia and New Zealand left the UK within two years of arriving. Many were young people on two-year working visas. Nearly six in ten left within five years. Two-thirds of those from the US and Canada also returned home within five years. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We actively encourage the brightest and the best migrants and the UK remains an attractive destination. ‘But to continue competing and thriving in a global race businesses must invest in the skills of UK workers, and retain our own highly skilled workforce.’","In total, 75,000 middle-class professionals left the country in 2010 making them the biggest single group of individuals leaving Britain .

"A man with the word 'MURDER' prominently tattooed on his neck has been accused of killing a man - and now he wants the inking removed before his trial. Jeffrey Wade Chapman's lawyers have filed a motion in Barton County District Court asking that his body art not be seen or mentioned during his trial, which begins next week. They're worried the tattoo, a mirror image of the word 'murder' in capital letters, will prejudice the jury. Chapman is charged with first degree murder in the November 2011 shooting death of Damon Galyardt, whose body was found by hunters in a Kansas field. Charged: Before he goes on trial for first degree murder, Jeffrey Wade Chapman (pictured) wants a professional tattoo artist to remove a prominent 'murder' tattoo on his neck . The inking: Chapman's lawyers say the tattoo, a mirror image of the word 'murder' in capital letters, would prejudice the jury . According to the motion filed by defense . attorney Kurt Kerns, Chapman has asked the jail to allow a . professional tattoo artist to remove or cover up the tattoo. They claim the inking is too large to be covered with clothing. 'Mr. Chapman has . secured a licensed tattoo artist from Hays who is willing to go to the . jail,' the motion states, GB Tribune reported. Victim: Chapman is accused murdering Damon Galyardt (pictured) in November 2011. Galyardt was reportedly a suspect in a counterfeit money scheme and fled from police the night before his body was found . 'The fact that he has ‘murder’ tattooed . across his neck is irrelevant to the State’s case and extremely . prejudicial to Mr. Chapman if introduced at trial or observed by the . jury.' However . State prosecutors argue Chapman can simply cover up the tat with 'clothing, . bandage or other means compliant with jail policy'. Sheriff . Brian Bellendir told the . court that Kansas Administrative Code 69-15-14 precludes tattoo artists . from performing inkings outside of licensed facilities due to strict . cleanliness standards. He also refused to transport Chapman to a . licensed facility. Chapman's lawyers have also filed a motion seeking a change of venue, claiming the pre-trial publicity will make it impossible for Chapman to get an impartial jury in Barton County. It is not clear if Chapman has a criminal history or why he had the tattoo done. Scene: Hunters found 25-year-old Damon Galyardt's body in a field on South West 60 Road and 30 Avenue in Barton County, Kansas (pictured) on November 12, 2011 . Chapman was arrested on November 16, 2011 and charged with first degree murder in the shooting death of 25-year-old Damon Galyardt, KAKE.com reported. Hunters found Galyardt's body in a roadside ditch near South West 60 Road and 30 Avenue in Barton County, Kansas on November 12. He died from a single gun shot wound. During Chapman's preliminary hearing in October 2012, testimony indicated he was angry because of the way Galyardt, a drug user, treated Chapman's friend, a woman with whom Galyardt was living, according to Hutchnews.com. Meanwhile, Hutch Post reported that the night before his body was found, Galyardt and an unidentified female tried to used counterfeit money at a convenience store. He fled from police. The news site also reported that Galyardt had served time for drugs and criminal possession of a firearm for cases out of Edwards County. Scene: The defense attorney for Jeffrey Wade Chapman has filed a motion in Barton County District Court (pictured) asking that Chapman's tattoo not be seen or mentioned during his upcoming jury trial .

"It has had more than £9 billion spent on its regeneration, and boasts a modern transport hub, Europe’s biggest shopping mall and the vast Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. But today Stratford in East London is awarded a less welcome accolade as the country’s worst crime hotspot – a magnet for muggers, pickpockets and thieves. Analysis of official police figures by The Mail on Sunday reveals that the postcode covering the huge Westfield Stratford City mall is plagued by almost 200 offences every month. Revealing: Crime rates have been compared for every postcode in England, Wales and Northern Ireland over the course of more than a year . Scotland Yard has recorded 3,440 crimes in the area over the past 18 months, including 500 shoplifting offences, almost 300 violent crimes and hundreds of pick-pocketings and muggings. Just last week five thugs were jailed over a gang fight inside the Westfield Stratford centre in which a young man, Liam Woodards, was stabbed to death in front of horrified shoppers. In a further blow to the mall’s Australian owners Westfield Group, its other London shopping centre in Shepherd’s Bush emerges as the site with the second-highest number of crimes – 2,524. Airports where weapons are often seized from foreign visitors, railway stations haunted by beggars and football hooligans, and high streets where drinkers gather also see large numbers of arrests. But this newspaper’s pioneering research has also uncovered some unlikely crime hotspots. They include a hospital in Northern Ireland where hundreds of violent attacks have been recorded, and a seaside resort on the South Coast that has suffered more  burglaries than anywhere else. Music festivals such as Glastonbury also trigger huge spikes in the usually sleepy countryside. It is the first time that crime rates have been compared for every postcode in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, each covering just a few hundred yards, over the course of more than a year. The data was taken from details uploaded by every police force in the country to a website maintained by the Home Office. Nick Herbert, the former Policing . Minister who has championed crime maps, said last night: ‘The power of . crime mapping is putting information in the hands of people. 'The information is no longer controlled by the authorities. It also means they are able to hold the authorities, including the police, to account. I think it’s a brilliant example of opening up government and using data as a way of empowering citizens.’ Labour first developed the idea  of plotting police records on maps that residents could search online to see how safe their neighbourhoods were, following successful projects in America. The website crashed from high demand when it was launched nationwide in 2009. But it initially showed only offences across wide districts in a single month, and even when the Coalition unveiled more precise data in 2011 there was criticism that some streets were wrongly being labelled crime hotspots. A quiet street in Gloucester was branded the country’s worst place for anti-social behaviour – but only because dozens of hoax 999 calls had been included in statistics. Householders feared the maps could damage property prices and even put up their insurance premiums. Since then forces and Home Office statisticians have improved the site so it narrowed down the location of incidents, listed a greater number of crime types and even revealed if the perpetrator has been caught. Public places including railway stations and parks were added. The website, which costs £28,000 a month to maintain, was visited an estimated 548 million times in its first two years. It also allows anyone to upload the specific details of every offence to  a spreadsheet, where they can be separated by type of offence and where the changing level of disorder can be plotted over time. The Home Office website, police.uk, allows anyone to export details of crimes to  a spreadsheet. These records include the type of offence, the force which recorded it, the month in which it took place and – crucially – its location. Police plot the crime to  one of more than 750,000 points on a map, which they anonymise slightly so that individual houses are not identified, in order to protect victims. This mapping information was translated into individual postcode data by The Mail on Sunday, so that every area’s crime rates and trends could be compared and studied over time. Police pinpoint the exact location of every crime they investigate, but to preserve the privacy of individual victims the setting is widened slightly when it is published online. The Mail on Sunday has studied the details of all the offences recorded between January 2012 and June 2013 by the 44 forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus the British Transport Police. They show that 8,950,327 crimes took place in 548,171 individual postcodes, with more than half of areas suffering fewer than ten offences over the past year and a half. Meridian Square – the public area that links Stratford’s bus and rail stations, the Westfield shopping centre and the entrance to the Olympic Park – emerged as the place with the highest number of crimes to its name: 3,440, or 6.7 a day. This postcode, E15 1AZ, saw a record 291 offences in January this year. Twelve months earlier there had been just 73, while criminality also increased last summer as millions of spectators arrived to witness the London Olympics. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: ‘In addition to the Olympic Games which attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors, 12 concerts and anniversary athletic events have recently taken place, with an extra 660,000 people attending. ‘Because of the high footfall, these areas attract criminal opportunists and therefore experience proportionately higher levels of crime. The Met tackles this by deploying its resources to the areas where they are most needed.’ The Met added that robbery had fallen by 5 per cent over the past 12 months in Newham, the borough where Stratford is situated, and that anti-social behaviour orders were being used to tackle ‘prolific shoplifters’ as crime across the capital fell to its lowest level for a decade. Senior Newham councillor Richard Crawford said: ‘We have a zero- tolerance approach to crime and anti-social behaviour in Stratford and across Newham. ‘Safety remains our residents’ No 1  concern and we are investing more in making Newham safer. ‘Crime and anti-social behaviour is unacceptable and we will never apologise for being tough on those who make the lives of the hard-working majority a misery.’ The council funds police community support officers and has set up a ‘dispersal zone’ so gangs of youths can be kept away from the centre of Stratford. A spokesman for Westfield insisted the postcode covered a wider area than its shopping centre alone, and added: ‘As a proportion of high customer numbers visiting our centres, the incident levels at Westfield are very low. ‘The safety of our customers, retailers and residents is a key priority. Westfield has on-site police teams and works closely with the Met Police, local authorities and retailers to ensure its centres are  a safe and enjoyable place for  our customers.’ Britain’s crime maps show slightly different pictures when larger districts are compared. The postcode area – covering dozens of buildings – registering the highest number of crimes is still E15 1, but it is followed by NE1 5 in central Newcastle and DE1 1 in Derby. The wider postcode district – covering areas where about 20,000  people live – with the highest number of crimes turns out to be CR0 in Croydon in South London, followed by SE1 on the south bank of the Thames and NW1 in Camden, North London. In the most recent month for which figures are available – June this year – Castle Donington in Leicestershire was the postcode with the highest number of crimes (300) as the Download music festival came to town, followed by Pilton in Somerset, with 220 – site of the Glastonbury music festival. Third was Meridian Square in Stratford (202 offences) and fourth was Finsbury Park in North London, where the Stone Roses played two gigs (167 crimes). We said a street in Cardiff near a large police station, Judkin Court, records high levels of drug crime – in fact the offences were recorded at Cardiff Bay station when offenders were arrested and found to have drugs on them. We also said an airport in Belfast had high levels of violence but the offences in fact related to nearby Queens Road.","Stratford in East London is .

"A relic hunter dubbed 'Indiana Bones' has lifted the lid on a macabre collection of 400-year-old jewel-encrusted skeletons unearthed in churches across Europe. Art historian Paul Koudounaris hunted down and photographed dozens of gruesome skeletons in some of the world's most secretive religious establishments. Incredibly, some of the skeletons, said to be the remains of early Christian martyrs, were even found hidden away in lock-ups and containers.

"'You're doing this through text message????' That was the message 38-year-old Christa M. Clark sent in response to a text message she received from her now-ex-fiancee, Buffalo, New York, restaurateur Louis J. Billittier Jr., when he ended their 14-month engagement via-text in July of 2012. But the message Billittier sent next ended up costing him the $53,000 engagement ring he bought for his now-jilted ex-fiancee. 'Parting ring': A text message Louis Billitier (pictured) sent his ex-fiancee referring to her engagement ring as a 'parting ring' cost him more than $50,000 . Prenup: Billittier called off his engagement to Christa Clark (pictured) after the 38-year-old nail technician refused to sign a prenuptial agreement . A New York State Supreme Court judge last week awarded Clark - a nail technician who met Billittier at golf tournament in 2009 - the white gold, 2.97-carat diamond ring, or its fair, market value, based on a text Billittier sent Clark after their breakup, in which he referred to the pricy ring as a 'parting ring,' implying that it was a gift. Billttier reportedly ended the engagement after his much-younger would-be-bride refused to sign a prenuptial agreement. However, Clark's attorney, Beverly Braun, tells MailOnline that isn't true. '[Clark] did agree to the prenup,' Braun says. When asked why Billittier ended the engagement - if Clark agreed to the prenup - Braun said she '[doesn't] want to speculate.' 'The decision speaks for itself,' she said. Billittier's attorney, Richard Sullivan, tells MailOnline that he is 'surprised [Braun] would even say something like that' when told that Braun claims her client agreed to sign the prenup. However, Sullivan says his client has 'no reaction to the [judge's] ruling.' Under the law, courts are typically inclined to side with the groom in disputes over engagement rings - legally, the groom is still entitled to the ring, even if he is the one who calls off the wedding. And just weeks after calling off the wedding - and despite his assurance that it was a 'parting ring' - the 55-year-old co-owner of Buffalo's Chef's Restaurant wanted the ring back. However, because Billittier responded to Clark's outrage over being dumped in a text message by telling her 'plus you get a $50,000 parting ring. Enough for a down payment on a house,' Judge Russell P. Buscaglia ruled that the ring had become a gift, and was no longer part of a contract for marriage. Ladies man: Billittier claimed that the text calling the ring a 'parting ring' was a joke, like a game-show contestant's parting gift . Just weeks after ending their engagement, Billittier began sending Clark text messages threatening to take back the ring if she continued to insult him following the breakup. 'Keep it up, and I will take back the ring as well,' he wrote in one text message dated July 20, 2012. After deciding he wanted the ring back, Billittier sent Clark a text message stating that 'by law have to give it back. You’re nowhere near the person I thought you were. You don’t deserve it.' In his ruling, Judge Buscaglia said that messages were further proof that 'the ring had been re-gifted,' according to BuffaloNews.com. The judge found that Billittier's text messages demanding the ring back indicated that he was suffering from 'giver's remorse,' but that didn't mean he was entitled to the ring. The law typically favors the groom in disputes over engagement rings, even if it is he who calls off the wedding . 'Many gifts are given for reasons that sour with the passage of time,' Buscaglia said in his ruling. However, gift law doesn't entitle to the gifter to recoup the gift just because feelings have changed, Buscaglia ruled. 'Once a gift is given, it is irrevocable,' the judge concluded. Of the text referring to the 'parting ring' - the text that ultimately cost him more than $50,000 - Billittier claimed in court that he meant it as a joke. 'I was being sarcastic, like a game show host – you get a parting gift,' Billittier said.","Buffalo restaurateur Louis Billittier Jr. called off his engagement to his 38-year-old ex-fiancee in a text message after she refused to sign a prenuptial agreement .

"Alan Pardew will reward the Newcastle players who saved his job by allowing them to go on a Christmas jaunt to Amsterdam. The Magpies boss has given his squad the green light to hit the Dutch capital following their fine run of form. United – who traditionally enjoy a fancy-dress bash every December – will be led on their European getaway by the Dutch quartet of Tim Krul, Daryl Janmaat, Siem de Jong and Vurnon Anita. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Pardew poke fun at a journalist whose phone goes off . Alan Pardew will reward the Newcastle players who saved his job by allowing them to go on a Christmas trip . The Magpies boss has given his squad the green light to hit Dutch capital city Amsterdam . Indeed, De Jong only signed for Newcastle from Ajax during the summer after leading them to the Eredivise title, while Anita joined from the Amsterdam club two years ago. Newcastle will head off on their festive party after taking on current league leaders Chelsea at St James’ Park a week on Saturday. Twelve months ago they celebrated Christmas following a 1-0 win at Manchester United with the likes of Krul dressed as a gangster, Steven Taylor as The Joker and Sammy Ameobi a Teenage Mutant Hero Turtle. Pardew’s players have thus far avoided any scrapes during their yearly jolly and the manager will be hoping they are again on their best behaviour ahead of a busy December. Following the visit of Chelsea they face Arsenal, Spurs – in the League Cup quarter-final – and Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. United will be led on their getaway by the Dutch players including keeper Tim Krul (2nd left) Newcastle will head off on their festive party after taking on league leaders Chelsea at St James’ Park . Newcastle are up to fifth in the Premier League following their fifth straight league win - against QPR on Saturday. Five weeks ago they were in the bottom three and Pardew’s position was under intense scrutiny. But the 53-year-old has been thrilled with the response of his players, insisting he always had faith in the squad. ‘As a manager when you’re on the training ground you see and think, “this could be something”,’ he said. Then you have a run of disappointments even though we played quite well. Then you start questioning your own eyes and management experience. ‘But we felt there was something here. Suddenly we have hit the ground, got a win and just built on that. The spirit in the group is just fantastic. ‘From where we were, the run we’ve been on is very difficult to achieve. But that is down to the belief we have here, among the players and the staff.’ Newcastle boss Pardew has seen his side go from the bottom three to sitting fifth in the Premier League . Jack Colback has appeared in every minute of United’s six wins on the spin in all competitions and the former Sunderland midfielder – a free-transfer arrival in the summer – believes his new club should be populating the top eight. ‘Momentum is how football works,’ he said. ‘We were not fantastic against QPR, but with the spirit around the place we always believe that at the very least we are not going to get beaten. ‘That is a massive thing and we maybe didn't have it at the start of the season. Everyone is pulling in the right direction and knows their role. ‘There have been a lot of players come in because of injury and they have all done fantastically well. Everyone is playing well. We are getting our rewards for that now. ‘That is great and it is nice to give something back for the fans. This is a big club with big expectations and we should be up there challenging within the top eight.’ Free transfer Jack Colback has appeared in every minute of United’s six wins on the spin in all competitions .

Up to 15 per cent actually sat down as a family to watch the first screening and as a sign of the times a further seven per cent go online to watch the advert as it is released. Parenting site Netmums set out to find out what made the perfect Christmas commercial and found it should contain heaps of humour, lots of children, a snapshots of special moments, feature well known songs, and use real mums, not actors. But a celebrity backed campaign was not important with only four per cent saying it contributed to the occasion. Heart-warming: The advert tells the story of a snowman who goes to huge efforts to buy a gift for his snowlady . With retailers spending millions on their Christmas advertising campaign it is important to get the message right as a quarter get gift ideas from the festive ads while one in five change where they buy their Christmas presents according to their favourite ad.

Netmums' Siobhan Freegard said: 'For millions of families, the first screening of Xmas ads now marks the start of the Christmas countdown. Families love the festive feeling the ads create. 'The annual battle of the ads is getting bigger each year and becoming a national event. Although John Lewis is the winner again this year, the competition are closing in with popular efforts from smaller stores including Aldi - which proves it isn't about budget but about how it makes mums and families feel inside. 'Mums also said they enjoyed the Asda and Morrisons ads showing they understand the dynamics of family life and how most families really run behind closed doors! Controversial: Meanwhile, Asda's offering has drawn more than 1,000 complaints saying it is sexist because the mother does most of the preparations . 'A retailer who gets their festive ad right will ensure families warm to them and spend with them long after the festive decorations have been taken down.'

"Manchester City face the ignominy of being relegated to a third-placed Champions League seeding for next season’s competition if they don’t beat Bayern Munich at home on Tuesday night. Manuel Pellegrini’s side need victory over the German champions at the Etihad to have any hope at all of qualifying for the next stage of the tournament after losing two games and drawing two so far. However, City also need to make sure that if they don’t qualify then they at least finish third in the group and go in to the Europa League. If they were to finish bottom, they will be in grave danger of seeing their coefficient dropping so low that they would go back to being a third seed in next summer’s draw.

"Jessica Livings was struck down with pneumonia linked to bovine TB after being infected by her pet kitten . More people will catch potentially-fatal tuberculosis from their cats because the disease is so widespread in wildlife, pet owners were warned last night. Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is going to happen again. It’s low risk, but not no risk.’ His warning came after public health chiefs revealed that cats suffering from the bovine form of the disease had passed it to their owners for the first time. Calling on vets to ensure the problem was ‘on their radar,’ Mr Hargreaves said bovine TB would persist in family pets even if it was eradicated in cattle because there is a ‘high endemic problem’ in wildlife. Although the focus has been on badgers because they have long been linked to TB in cows, other animals – such as foxes, hedgehogs, rats, mice and voles – can contract tuberculosis. A cat owner himself, Mr Hargreaves said infected animals should be put down and added he would even put his own pet to sleep, ‘with a heavy heart,’ to minimise the health risks to family and neighbours. Unlike cattle with TB, it is not compulsory for infected cats or dogs to be put to sleep. Many pet owners resist the advice, but vets believe that if there are more such cases the law will be changed. In what is thought to be the first case of its kind in the world, 19-year-old Jessica Livings told this week how she was struck down with  agonising pneumonia linked to bovine tuberculosis after being infected by her pet kitten. She had to have emergency surgery followed by further treatment. Miss Livings' cat Onyx died two days after his owners discovered a wound on his stomach . Another victim suffered similar symptoms and Jessica’s mother Claire contracted a dormant form of the disease, which attacks the lungs and can cause fatal complications. The kitten was one of nine cats infected in the Newbury area of Berkshire last year – probably after coming into contact with diseased wildlife around Greenham Common. Five of the cats died, one is missing and the other three have been treated and are being kept as pets – despite the continuing risks. Experts say cats are more likely to be infected with bovine TB than other household pets because they are predators that hunt rodents which might have the disease, though it is possible for dogs to pass it on to humans. Latest Government figures show that from 2008 to 2012, 91 cats and seven dogs caught bovine TB. Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, says vets need to have risk 'on their radar' There are other strains of tuberculosis that pets and other animals can pick up but they are not serious notifiable diseases and pose no threat to humans or other animals. While the risk to humans from an infected cat is low, most vets would advise against keeping such an animal if there were babies, children or other vulnerable people in the household. Mr Hargreaves said: ‘Cats are particularly vulnerable because they chase after mice and voles. In the past, most cases of bovine TB in cats have occurred in hotspot areas of the disease such as the South-West and Wales. ‘What is unusual about the Newbury case is that Berkshire is not considered a TB hotspot area yet there was a cluster of nine infected cats.’ Carl Gorman, the Newbury vet who reported the outbreak, and whose own cat Milhouse was infected and has gone missing, said: ‘We live near Greenham Common where cattle graze. There have been some cases of TB in cattle on the common. But my theory is that a stray cat became infected and passed it on to the others. ‘That stray cat has never been identified and has now probably died of the disease and that is why we have not had any cases for a year.’ Two of the other cats to have died in the Newbury outbreak were Mocha, owned by Julie Foster, 38, and Jasper, owned by Clare Farley. Dr Dilys Morgan, head of gastrointestinal, emerging and zoonotic diseases at Public Health England, said: ‘This was a very unusual cluster of TB in domestic cats. Mocha (left) died after contracting bovine TB and Jasper (right) also caught the disease - possibly from cattle . ‘These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission. Although PHE has assessed the risk of people catching this infection from infected cats as being very low, we are recommending that households and close contacts of cats with confirmed infection should be assessed and receive advice.’ Mr Gorman added that owners worried their pet has bovine TB should only contact a vet if the cat has a wound that is not healing, respiratory problems or chronic weight loss. Previously, most human cases of bovine TB in humans have been among farmers and vets who work with cattle or Government scientists who have worked with badgers. However, five years ago, a former veterinary nurse from Cornwall, her daughter and the family dog were reported to have caught the disease from a badger that wandered into their garden. Britain has one of the highest rates of human TB in Western Europe, though the vast majority of sufferers people not inoculated against the disease, including migrants from Africa and Eastern Europe. Bulgaria and Romania have some of the highest TB rates in Europe. Dog owners are being urged to hose their pets after taking them for walks to protect them from a mystery illness that has so far killed 28 dogs in Britain. Experts investigating the outbreak suspect it is similar to Alabama Rot which struck greyhounds in America. The disease is believed to be caused by E.coli. Jess, a springer spaniel owned by Worcestershire's Steve Smith died after a muddy walk . One owner has warned he is convinced it can be picked up by dogs licking mud off their fur. The earliest signs of Alabama Rot are lesions on the legs, chest and abdomen, which spread across the skin. This is followed by lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting and kidney failure. Among the victims are two springer spaniels owned by forester Steve Smith, from Wadborough, Worcester. The dogs, Polly and Jess, had been put straight into their outdoor kennels after a walk and not washed. Mr Smith says this cost them their lives as a third dog, Judy, survived after being cleaned and allowed into the house after the same walk. He said: ‘I’m convinced the link is E.coli. Polly and Jess were not washed, they groomed themselves, licked their coats and ingested the mud and soil. ‘Judy also became ill but did not get kidney failure. I believe giving her a bath saved her life.’ He added: ‘Tissue samples from my dogs were sent to experts in America who confirmed their condition “mimicked” Alabama Rot. Experts in the US believe the greyhounds died after eating raw meat infected with E.coli. I didn’t feed raw meat to my dogs but E.coli is a common bacteria and it can trigger a toxin which affects the kidneys.’ Vets have investigated E.coli as the trigger for the disease in the UK but there is no proof the bacteria is linked to the dog deaths.","Pets will keep catching disease because of 'endemic problem' in nature .

"'Sexy convict' Jeremy Meeks, meet 'the Hot Cop of the Castro' Chris Kohrs. The handsome, astonishingly fit Officer Kohrs, with the San Francisco Police Department, has been sending hearts aflutter ever since one of his admirers shared a picture of the photogenic law enforcement official in the line of duty. The photo that began the 'hot cop' craze was taken by Mark Abramson, who caught a glimpse of Kohrs, a six-year veteran on the force, as he was guarding a construction site in the Castro District. Avert your eyes, Channing Tatum: San Francisco officer Chris Kohrs, 36, became a viral sensation after one of his admirers created a fan page on Facebook with pictures of the photogenic cop on the job . Armed and ready: Kohr's Internet fame could be traced back to a chance encounter with Castro District resident Mark Abramson, who snapped a photo of the cop as he was guarding a construction site . 'He's so amazing looking, but also radiates,' Abramson gushed to NBC Bay Area. The snapshots of the eye-catching policeman worthy of a magazine cover were shared by other Facebook users until Nathan Tatterson started an appreciation page dedicated to Kohrs. As of Thursday morning, the fan page boasted more than 14,000 ‘likes,’ and counting. In photos posted by Kohrs' fans on the page, he is seen flashing his pearly whites over a Sunday breakfast at a diner, posing with a baby and drilling a wall with his shirt off. ‘Chris himself is not on Facebook. So no one had a forum for them to show their appreciation for him,’ Tatterson told the station. ‘So I thought it would be fun to create one. It took five minutes. No big deal. That got the ball rolling.’ Mr Kohrs, 36, has been described as law enforcement’s answer to convicted felon Jeremy Meeks, 30, whose mugshot shared on Facebook last month became a social media phenomenon. Blindsided by fame: Kohrs, who is not on Facebook, did not know he has become a local celebrity until his colleagues plastered the walls of the police station with his pictures . Seal of approval: Kohrs himself asked the operator of the Facebook page to post this photo of him during the Pride parade to show his support for the gay community . Meeks, who is facing a federal gun possession charge, has been signed by a Hollywood agent from behind bars. Kohrs also has been enjoying his newfound fame, which so far has earned him fawning media coverage in the local press and an offer to appear on Good Morning America. But the buff cop with movie-star good looks is not just a pretty face: in his years on the force Kohrs came to the aid of a woman who was being mugged and restrained a would-be robber with his bare hands. Mr Nice Guy: Those who know Kohrs say he is not only handsome but also very professional and charming . Mr Kohrs told the website The Daily Beast that when a man approached him on the street recently asking to take his picture, he thought nothing of it. When the photo taken by novelist Mark Abramson went viral online, Kohrs remained in the dark about it since he does not have a personal Facebook account. That is why the 36-year-old was blindsided when one day he arrived at his police precinct only to discover his pictures and articles about the 'hot cop' plastered all over the walls. 'I was never going to live that down,' Kohrs said. The gay community of the Castro District took notice, especially after famed writer Armistead Maupin, the author of the series Tales of the City, posted a photo of Kohrs on his Facebook page with the caption: 'I finally got to lay eyes on the legendary Hot Cop of Castro Street.' Before long, the humble officer of the law has become a tourist attraction for members of the LGBT community, who flocked to the Castro in droves hoping to catch a glimpse of his toothpaste-commercial smile, chiseled face and muscular body. Those who know Kohrs say that no only is he easy on the eyes, but he is also charming and good at his job. The good and the bad: Officer Kohrs has been described as law enforcement's answer to 'handsome felon' Jeremy Meeks, 30 (right), whose mugshot has made him a household name . Kohrs now has fans from coast to coast and far beyond, including in France (where he is said to be huge), in Yemen and even in Saudi Arabia. Residents of the Castro have had a difficult relationship with the police force, punctuated by  instances of violence targeting the gay community in the 80s. Now, they are hoping that Kohrs could help change the negative image of the SFPD. ‘I think that it’s a great story, that we have an officer with a fan base in the Castro,’ said police spokesperson Albie Esparza. On his part, Chris Kohrs said he is flattered by all the attention.","Officer Chris Kohrs, 36, became a major attraction in Castro District after a local writer took a photo of him and posted it on Facebook .

"A year after the dance became a global phenomenon, a group of competitors have taken part in the second UK National Twerking Championships. Thirteen dancers wowed crowds with their eye-popping moves at the competition held in north London last night. The women bounced and jiggled their way through five rounds in a bid to win first place and a chance to dance on stage with twerking sensation Nicki Minaj. Scroll down for video . The National Twerking Championships were held in London last night and attracted a crowd of almost 500 . The first round, Freestyle, allows dancers to move around the stage in a solo performance or with a partner. The 45-second segment to a song of their choice is where dancers can show off their 'tricks' said the event's organiser, Harry Anthony of Jump Off TV. 'They can do whatever they want, they can put choreography together or demonstrate tricks,' he said. Next is the 'jiggle and pop round' - formerly known as the jelly round - during which competitors have to shake their behinds without moving their feet. 'There are ways when you just kind of curl your knees in and your bum will shake, some girls can pop each cheek to the rhythm.' 'It's very technical,' Mr Anthony added. Thirteen dancers took part in the competition, twerking their way through five different themed rounds . Jelly Melly (pictured)  came joint second in the competition held at Scala in north London last night . Two girls wait to perform in one of the five rounds at the event which was organised by Jump Off . Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes. To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward. To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone. Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section. For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out. Then up the tempo and shake the butt. Directions provided by HowCast . The upside down round follows and is one of the most popular parts of the competition with dancers propping themselves up against the wall in a handstand to twerk. The fourth round, domination, sees the girls 'dominate' a partner with their twerking abilities. After tallying up scores, the best six girls went on to compete in the final round, the Nicki Minaj Anaconda round. To the background of the singer's new hit, the dancers have a 30 seconds to come up with their own choreography. Jemini, a 21-year-old  dance hall performer, was crowned the winner and took home £1,000 in cash. She will perform with the singer when she next visits the UK. Mr Anthony, who organised last year's sold out event, said he'd noticed a spike in interest in the dance over the past 12 months. 'We had much more interest from people sending videos. I like to compare it to planking. Jemini, a 21-year-old former dance hall performer, took home first prize and £1,000 after receiving the highest score . The event's organiser said more people were comfortable with the style of dance than ever before . Nicki Minaj is known for her twerking skills . 'People don't do it anymore because it was an internet fad and people thought twerking was going to be that too because of Miley Cyrus. 'But because it is actually a dance and requires skill  people have embraced it. 'I don't think it'll ever go away. It's acceptable in mainstream culture. 'What we saw last year was the fad of twerking celebrities who just did it for publicity but this year with twerking fitness classes and competitions you're seeing more people who are comfortable with it.' Winner Jemini, who has been twerking since she was 15 said: 'I didn't think I was going to win at all. 'I'm really excited about performing with Nicki Minaj, just over the moon. 'Words can't explain it, it's amazing.' 'I started out doing hip hop and R&B when I was about 12 and then got into twerking when I was 15 in the dance hall scene because it's a big part of that. 'I didn't really practise too much I just thought about what songs I wanted to dance to and went with it that way.' Jemima came second in last year's championship. Mizz Versatile and Jelly Melly won joint second place at this year's competition and shared £200 in prize money. Nicki Minaj's record label increased the first place prize from £300 to £1,000 after last year's competition. The singer is known for her twerking skills. Her new song, Anaconda, is very much based around the dance.","Thirteen dancers took part in the competition held in north London .

"A group of young YouTubers is revolutionizing the toy industry and raking in millions of dollars in profits in the process. According to industry experts, at a time when toy sales have hit a long-term period of stagnation - profits have remained at $22 billion for a number of years - children who review the latest and greatest creations on YouTube are wielding increasing influence over the industry, thanks to their incredible viewing figures and ability to sell almost any toy around. Some of the world's biggest toy makers have begun courting YouTube's most popular child stars in the hopes that they will be able to better connect with a generation that views the online video shows as much - if not more - than they do the most popular shows on TV. Scroll down for video . Mini millionaire: According to Business Insider, eight-year-old Evan earns more than $1.3m from his YouTube channels . Family business: Evan (L) and his younger sister Jillian both make videos for the YouTube channel . 'Kids trust other kids more so than they would an adult,' says Marc Rosenberg, a Chicago-based toy consultant. Leading the pack of pint-sized YouTube personalities is eight-year-old Evan, who started his first YouTube channel three years ago along with his father Jared. Three YouTube channels later and Evan - whose younger sister Jillian also appears in his videos - has amassed more than 1 billion views and boasts nearly 1 million subscribers for his main toy review channel alone. EvanTubeHD, which features special effects created by his dad, who runs a video production company full-time, is known for telling kids how to play with toys. Evan speaks directly to them, offering his thoughts and opinions on each plaything. The youngster appears completely confident in front of the camera, giving just a few occasional reminders of his young age. In a review of Angry Birds Space Softee Dough playset, Evan apologized for a noticeable lisp throughout the recording, saying: 'Sorry if I'm talking a little funny today because I just lost my tooth.' According to Business Insider, Evan's three YouTube channels - which include his main toy review channel, a gaming channel and a vlogging channel - currently make the young star more than $1.3 million dollars each year. Behind Evan are a few other young YouTube prodigies. Most of the children are identified by first name because their parents don't want to risk their safety. Beauty guru: In addition to her toy reviews, 11-year-old Emma, who stars alongside her siblings on YouTube channel KittiesMama, also does costume and make-up tutorials . Siblings Noah, 14, Jonah, 12, and Emma, 11 star in KittiesMama, which has nearly 400 million views. The online reality show, which is made with the help of the trio's parents, chronicles the kids' daily lives, including birthday parties, shopping trips and extra curricular activites. They also review toys and beauty lover Emma shows kids howto dress up like their favorite toys. Gracie Hunter, 11, pairs up with her mother, Melissa, in 'Mommy and Gracie,' which has close to 90 million views. Gracie, an enthusiastic and energetic redhead, searches for hard-to-find dolls with her mom. They've even traveled to Canada from their New Jersey home in order to find a rare Monster High doll. RadioJH Audrey, which is run by 11-year-old toy fan Audrey, has over 60 million views. The youngster has found herself particularly popular with tweens and offers slightly more 'mature' reviews of her toys - frequently throwing in words like 'cool' and 'awesome' into her videos. Mother and daughter: Grace and her mother Melissa search for rare dolls and travel across the country in order to find them . Money makers: The pair have never revealed just how much profit their YouTube channel generates but the two are estimated to be among the top earners . She also streaks her bobbed hair in a rainbow of colors and wears big jewelry and studded tees. Audrey's trademark: reviewing mystery toy bags that are sold at places like Toys R Us. Julie Krueger, industry director of retail at Google, which owns YouTube, says the channels have 'huge followings of fans' and many of the world's biggest toy manufacturers have noticed. In fact, Canada-based toy company Spin Master says Evan's reviews helped boost sales of its Spy Gear toys 65 percent this year. The private company declined to disclose sales numbers. From playtime to profits: Evan's younger sister Jillian (pictured with their mother) is started to bring in her own viewers, thanks to her reviews of the latest girls' toys . 'It gives the item more widespread exposure,' says Jim Silver, editor-in-chief and CEO of TTPM.com, a toy review website. Toy makers regularly send the young reviewers products - and some have even inked paid marketing deals with them and their parents. Spin Master hired Evan to appear in a TV ad for its latest Spy Gear toys, Anki, which makes robotic toy cars, teamed up with Evan and KittiesMama for reviews on a race car, while WowWee is working with 'Mommy and Gracie' on promotional videos for Elektrokidz collectible dolls. Stay in school: The KittiesMama channel documents almost every aspect of the children's lives, including back-to-school supply shopping . The parents and companies have all declined to disclose financial terms, however most of the parents, who also declined to say how much ad revenue the channels make, have quit their jobs in order to focus on the booming homemade businesses. But Mr Rosenberg says kids 'risk crossing the line of trust' with their audience when deals are made with toy makers. For their part, the toy brands say that they're careful to preserve the kids' voices. Spin Master's chief marketing officer, Krista DiBeradino, says it tries to maintain 'the authenticity intended with each relationship.' Parents also say they try to maintain authenticity. Jason, the father behind RadioJH, says the channel is doing so well with ad revenue that he doesn't focus on partnerships, while Jennifer, the mother behind KittiesMamma, says she'd only partner with brands that her kids enjoy. Tween queen: 11-year-old Audrey appeals to a slightly older audience and often reviews toys that are aimed at more mature fans . Melissa Hunter of 'Mommy and Gracie' says her family will only accept deals to benefit children's charities. 'We aren't just faces for hire,' she says. Evan's dad, Jared, says he works with partners that resonate with the audience and that he invests any money that the channels make toward his children's futures. 'It's kind of surreal,' he says of his family's YouTube success, while Evan added: 'I didn't think it would turn out like this when I first made the channel. I thought I would just get four views.'","Children's toy reviews have become some of YouTube's most-watched videos .

"Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard . A famous artist . sexually abused young girls after blindfolding them and dressing them in . Victorian-style nighties, a jury heard today. Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of offences against four children aged from six to 14 who posed for him between 1972 and 1985. Ovenden's work includes nude and semi-nude portraits of young girls. Ramsay . Quaife, prosecuting, said the offences took place at his homes . in London and Cornwall and the alleged victims - all now adults - had . similar accounts of the alleged abuse. He . added that the accused told police he still has ‘a very major . reputation’ for painting some of the best portraits of children in the . last 200 years. Mr Quaife told . Truro Crown Court in Cornwall that the offences took place as the . youngsters modelled for Ovenden, who is also a renowned fine art . photographer. He said: 'What . we say is that Mr Ovenden is a paedophile, that is a sexual abuser of . children, and we say in this case the target of his abuse was young . girls.' He described how . Ovenden would dress the children up in Victorian style nighties before . leaving them naked and blindfolded. He said of one alleged victim: 'The . defendant would put the tape down over her eyes. She could not see . anything. The tape was black, stretchy and smelt of glue. 'Although she could not see, she could hear the defendant and she could remember the sound of his belt buckle.' Mr. Quaife added that Ovenden was actually performing an indecent assault on the children. Court appearance: The Cornish artist's work includes nude and semi-nude portraits of young girls . He . said in some cases the naked girls whose eyes were taped were moved . into different positions and pictured where their genitals could be . seen.

"A little boy smiles as he holds an assault rifle as if it were a harmless toy. This shocking photograph was posted on Twitter by the child’s British mother, who is so proud of him that she has put the snap on her profile page. No older than three or four, the youngster is seemingly being groomed to join the ranks of the Isis extremists in Iraq. For him, a game of soldiers involves messing around with an AK-47 rifle. Chilling: A child smiles as he poses with an AK-47 assault rifle in an image posted online by his British mother . According to an investigation by The . Sunday Times, the boy named Isa – the Arabic version of Jesus – is the . son of a former London student and her Swedish husband. He also has a younger brother, aged about 12 months, who his mother refers to as a ‘mini mujahid’, or holy warrior. The . family are said to be living in Syria and are disciples of the Isis . cause. Isa’s mother calls herself Umm Isa (Mother of Isa) and her . Twitter name is Muhajirah fi Sham, which means ‘immigrant in Syria’. She . is married to a Swedish Islamic fighter called Abu Bakr and is reported . to be a convert who previously attended a mosque in South London.

On Twitter, Umm Isa has also shared a photograph of an Isis crucifixion and boasted about witnessing a public execution. In . one post, using barely comprehensible text speak, she complains that . not enough fellow Muslims have joined the Isis cause in Syria.

"What did you eat for breakfast this morning? Tea and toast? Coffee and cereal? I don’t mean to sound smug, but here’s what I had: alfalfa, spinach, wheatgrass, pineapple, apple, goji berry, beetroot, broccoli, some ‘alkalising super greens’, and, er some maitake mushroom; all on top of my cereal. Thankfully, I wasn’t chopping for hours: all these mega-healthy ingredients came in a magical powder form, ready for me to sprinkle on my Weetabix. Scroll down for video . Super-supplement: Marianne tries out supermodel Elle Macpherson's 'The Super Elixir' with her morning Weetabix . Magical powder: The Super Elixir is supposed to improve fitness and nutrition in all 11 systems of the body . And although it might look like fermented pond scum, it tastes surprisingly sweet — not least because it promises to make me look and feel like a supermodel. Elle Macpherson to be exact. The Australian model, who somehow turned 50 in March, launched this green powder — marketed as The Super Elixir — last month, with the help of Harley Street nutritionist Dr Simone Laubscher. Containing 45 ingredients, it is meant to improve ‘inner fitness, support nutrition at a cellular level and optimise the functioning of all 11 systems of the body.’ Frankly, at this price — £96 a jar, which should last just one month — I’d expect it to make me fly. But it seems the days of good old-fashioned multi-vitamins are long gone; today’s supplements are as A-list as the people raving about them — with price tags to match. The Body: Australian supermodel Elle Macpherson turned 50 in March . Earlier this month, Victoria Beckham tweeted a picture of her new favourite supplement: Bee Panacea, which combines raw honey, pollen, propolis and royal jelly to boost energy, fight acne and help with indigestion, depression and high blood pressure. It also costs an eye-watering £35 for a small pot, which even its biggest fan would have to admit won’t last long. Meanwhile, other celebrities such as Miranda Kerr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have been waxing lyrical about breakfast smoothies made with a bewildering number of new-age ingredients, including maca powder, chia seeds, blue algae, baobab powder, bee pollen, freeze-dried acai berry and lacuma powder. Each one is supposed to be an ancient superfood, offering a vast array of benefits, from boosting your libido to warding off depression. But as they cost anything from £5 to £20 a pop, by my reckoning, you’d have to shell out £70 before you could get your blender out. Even John Lewis sells Dr Perricone’s Total Skin and Body supplements — £78 for a month’s worth, or for those on the budget, Superberry powder with acai, at £53 for 30 days’ worth. Just like jeans and handbags, vitamins, it seems, have gone designer. But are super-supplements worth their super prices? ‘Part of the allure of some of these products is the price tag. It’s like buying a Jo Malone candle or a pot of Creme de la Mer — you don’t need to spend £100 on a face cream, but some people want to and swear by it,’ says nutritionist Ian Marber. ‘Most of these new supplements are what’s known as “food state nutrients”, which are as similar to real food as possible. Because they are better absorbed by the gut, you could say you get more benefit from them, but then you could also benefit from eating a lot of vegetables,’ says Marber.Marber has a problem with the main claim of Elle Macpherson’s new product: that it alkalises the body. The theory goes that modern diets create too much acid, leading to an over-production of fat cells to carry the excess away from vital organs; as well as exacerbating  many common complaints such as arthritis and tiredness. Health Wealth: Super-supplements are supposed to be an ancient superfood, offering a vast array of benefits, but may make your purse significantly lighter . Breakfast boost: Marianne channeled the celebrity vibe and tried out several super-supplements . The idea is that eating certain foods or supplements can maintain the body’s ideal pH balance (acidity levels) to improve overall health. ‘I’m not comfortable with the science,’ says Marber. ‘There’s no robust research to show you change your body’s pH through food for more than a minute or two. We all like to think that there’s a health secret that we haven’t been let into — and Elle is sharing it with us.’ And what about the new array of products such as maca or  lucuma powder? Sales of vitamins and dietary supplements are expected to reach £786 million by 2018 . ‘It’s funny, we embrace technology in every area of our lives but still think, health wise, that something from an ancient tribe is better,’ says Marber. ‘The specifics are fine — they contain concentrated forms of  antioxidants and flavonoids, which are extremely useful,  but we don’t know the long- term safety. ‘Also, putting a spoon of this, a spoon of that into a smoothie is working on the assumption that the body is going to benefit from a mega dose of nutrients. Whereas we don’t know if our body is even able to absorb them all.’ Marber is, however, a fan of freshly made green vegetable juice — and says if we up our ‘five-a-day’ to at least seven, we will be fine. ‘I don’t like the idea that food isn’t enough,’ he says. ‘A good diet of fruit and vegetables will be enough for the vast majority of us. Salad days: The Super Elixir contains 45 different vegetables, but one expert says it would be better for us to eat the vegetables directly . ‘And if you’re feeling below par, think: are you stressed? Are you drinking too much? Not sleeping enough? An expensive supplement isn’t the answer.’ Oh well, even if Elle’s power powder doesn’t give me the body of The Body, it has at least made me a few pounds lighter. In  the wallet. MACA POWDER: Made from a South African root, purported to boost energy and sex drive. BAOBAB POWDER: The sub-Saharan superfood is said to increase energy. LUCUMA POWDER: Made from Peruvian lucuma fruit and  aids digestion. BEE POLLEN: Packed full of  22 amino acids, vitamins  and minerals. ACAI BERRIES: Rich in anti-oxidants; linked to weight loss.

"They were once worshipped by the Aztecs for being food of the gods. And now, hundreds of years later, chia seeds are revered once again as the latest ‘superfood’ trend. Originally found in Mexico, the tiny seeds have been dubbed ‘the running food’ and hailed as the ‘ultimate superfood’ by athletes and health advocates. Originally found in Mexico, the tiny seeds have been dubbed ‘the running food’ and hailed as the ‘ultimate superfood’ by athletes and health advocates . They contain a wealth of antioxidants and minerals such as calcium and have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Omega-3 has been shown to help protect against a range of illnesses including heart disease and dementia. The seeds are also thought to help dieters as they contain few calories but are high in protein, making people feel full. The craze has taken such a hold that Marks & Spencer has just launched a range of products – including bread and pitta – containing the ingredient to meet the rising demand. The chain’s nutritionist Helen Stevenson said: ‘Our customers are definitely becoming more aware of these hero health ingredients, and are actively looking for them.’ However, not everyone is convinced of their power. Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘I regard chia seeds as a bit of a fad, they are here today and will be gone in a week’s time and no one will remember them.’ The craze has taken such a hold that Marks & Spencer has just launched a range of products – including bread and pitta – containing the ingredient .","Originally found in Mexico, the seeds have been dubbed 'the running food'

"Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Ed Miliband should have joined the army . Ed Miliband should have joined the army instead of spending his whole time working in politics - because it would make him seem like less of a ‘geek’, a former Labour Cabinet minister has said. Alan Johnson said spending three years in the armed forces would have ‘enhanced his reputation’ and made the Labour leader more appealing to the public. The former home secretary defended Mr Miliband in the face of poll ratings that suggest the public don’t see him as a strong leader. In an interview with The Times he said: ‘When you have not been prime minister people don’t see you as being prime ministerial, might be part of it. ‘It’s unfashionable to be a geek at the moment. ‘He should perhaps have gone away and gone in the army for three years and enhanced his reputation.’ Mr Johnson’s comments will not be seen as helpful to Mr Miliband, who has struggled to turn around voters’ negative perceptions of him. One poll found four in ten voters regarded Mr Miliband as either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’. Mr Miliband has admitted his problems with presentation, including a major speech in which he admitted he looked less like a Prime Minister than David Cameron. He also highlighted his resemblance to Wallace from the Wallace and Gromit animated films – but claimed to be a politician of substance rather than one – like Mr Cameron, who was interested in ‘posturing’. Mr Johnson praised Mr Miliband for holding the Labour party together and preventing it from tearing itself apart after the 2010 general election. He said it was worrying that the political elite is dominated by people who studied politics at a top university before working as political advisors and then becoming MPs. He said: ‘All three main political leaders came through that route. It’s fine if 10 per cent of MPs do, but if it is much higher it’s a disproportionate number and that is almost the only way to get into politics now.’ Mr Johnson was appointed shadow chancellor by Mr Miliband in 2010 but resigned in January the following year after it emerged his wife Laura had an affair with a police officer assigned to protect him. The couple have since divorced. Mr Johnson said he did not want to return to front line politics while Labour was in opposition. But he said he would consider a return if Labour won the next election. Labour leader Ed Miliband is not seen as 'Prime Ministerial' because he has not yet been Prime Minister, claimed Mr Johnson . He said: ‘I think they are doing very well without me. [I have] no appetite for being on the front bench, you don’t want anyone there who doesn’t want to be there. I have nothing but admiration for Ed [Miliband] and the way he has dealt with things and his personal kindness to me. ‘It’s nothing to do with Ed at all. It’s to do with me having got whatever ambition there was – there wasn’t a lot in the first place – out of my system.’ Mr Johnson’s comments came as he promoted Please Mr Postman, the second volume of his bestselling memoirs. The first volume described how he grew up in a Notting Hill slum with his siblings after his drunken father walked out and his mother died when he was 13.","Labour MP said a stint in the military would have 'enhanced his reputation'
