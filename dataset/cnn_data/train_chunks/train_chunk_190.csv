"(CNN) -- When I was a kid, I was obedient and quiet. I automatically knew that talking too loud, making a fuss or being assertive would never fly. I did what I was told. I was a Chinese girl. I adhered to my parents' wishes that I get top grades and perform well in the activities they had chosen for me. But after all the hours of homework, grueling afternoons of practicing arpeggios on the piano to perfection, four hours of Chinese school after regular school, Chinese calligraphy lessons with the stiff brush and stinky ink, after the chores, basketball practice and memorization of Chinese poems, eventually I wanted to feel known for myself, not just my accomplishments. In the song ""In My Room,"" Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys sang, ""... Do my dreaming and my scheming, laugh at yesterday."" Obviously, he wasn't Chinese. When you are a kid in hyperdrive, daydreaming and lying on your bed doing nothing doesn't fit into the schedule. It didn't occur to my parents to ask for my opinion. That might promote individual thinking. And thinking for oneself is not part of the plan. Chinese culture emphasizes acting according to your place in the family -- you are the Number One Son, Third Daughter, Fifth Wheel or maybe just another mouth to feed. Everyone has a part to play, and if you don't like the role you've been given, the mandate is still ""don't make trouble."" You don't make trouble, and you study like crazy because in the really old days, passing the imperial exams was your only ticket out of poverty. And since the time of Mao Zedong, individuality is considered counterrevolutionary. Speaking up about injustice could get you and your whole lot exiled. Sure, many Asian-Americans are several generations away from those threats. Yet, some collective memories don't ever seem to fade. Chinese parents who rock the Tiger Mother style still cling to the remnants of the Old World by expecting obedience above all else and stifling true creativity in favor of tried and true benchmarks of success: Perfect grades, best test scores, admission into top colleges. What's so bad about that? To earn straight As for two decades in a row, I learned to detach from my own emotions and physical body. I disregarded my cramping fingers, tired eyes and grumbling stomach. Having fun with friends had to wait. Through consistent pressure to succeed, I learned that human connections were an obstacle and distraction. The only semblance of approval I received was when I won an award or had a perfect report card. Achieving The Best was the only goal, and it didn't matter if the pursuit of perfection required that I ignore or step over someone else. All that mattered was the A. After so many years of performing like a robot, by the age of 25, a lot of kids who grew up like me have no idea how to connect with other people. We never bonded with friends in endless games of kick-the-can or went to birthday parties or listlessly congregated in the halls with the ""bad"" kids. We knew better than to waste our time like that. Plus, we might catch stupid that way. As the children and grandchildren of immigrants, we may not have been starving for actual food, but we are starved for affection. In the pursuit of high achievement, our feelings got left by the side of the road, our emotions mistaken as unnecessary baggage. Maybe our parents who escaped war and poverty never expected that later in the journey, we would need emotional availability and a sense of humor as flotation devices. As for me, the anxiety and loneliness of childhood that I describe in my book, ""Tiger Babies Strike Back,"" has caused an uproar in my family. It's the roar of a Chinese kid saying enough is enough. It's me as a Chinese person saying I want to be seen as an individual. The world sees stereotypes of waitress or Tiger Mom, but even within my own ethnicity, I am also supposed to fit into a box -- that of obedient child. I'm a 43-year-old writer and mom, raising my kid with more hugs and affection that I ever had. Growing up in San Francisco with frequent trips to Chinatown, I interacted with newly arrived Chinese as well as third- and fourth-generation Asians who spoke without accents. But no matter what our ages or how Americanized we were or were not, everybody seemed to know that nothing good could come from stirring up the melting pot. The fact that I am now purposely ""making trouble"" has opened up Pandora's box. My parents, brothers and other relatives are stumbling around, trying to stuff my words, anecdotes and remembrances of the past back into the locked Chinese box. But it's too late. While we were cramming to learn English or Mandarin, we forgot to learn the vocabulary of the foreign language of our feelings. We don't know the words for ""I'm sorry"" or even ""I love you."" But now that I have stirred the pot a little, all is not lost. I remember that when Pandora opened the box, there was one tiny thing that was the last to fly out into the world, and that was Hope.

"(EW.com) -- The ""Good Wife"" returns Sunday night (CBS, 9 p.m. ET), and while we're all eager to meet Kalinda's estranged husband Nick (check out our scoop on him here, and find out who was behind the door in the clip below), there's more to look forward to in season 4. • The arrival of Nathan Lane. We'll also meet his recurring character, the firm's appointed trustee Clarke Hayden, in the season premiere. ""He becomes a foil to everyone, but primarily Diane and Will,"" co-creator Robert King says. ""We've been studying a lot about law firm bankruptcies, and when you want to restructure to give yourself relief from your creditors, sometimes a bank or court will order in a trustee. A trustee is someone who represents the creditors' interest, and he or she is brought in above the managers, or the partners in this case. He basically can veto any decisions of the partners."" It's an especially interesting time for Will, who'll be practicing again now that his suspension is over. ""Because they are in this kind of bankruptcy limbo where they have to make a certain amount to pay off the creditors in a certain amount of time, it's a very bad time to find a conscience. Just like we're all struggling with that in this economy: How much do you let your ethics lead, and how much do you let your pragmatism lead? Will's gonna be struggling with that almost daily."" And don't forget about David Lee. ""David Lee's someone who has new clout given this bankruptcy and the fact that family law is doing so well. Given the world of Lockhart Gardner and how much it's struggling, David Lee is a commodity and will have a lot of confrontations with the Nathan Lane character."" • Seeing more Cary. ""We love Matt Czuchry. We felt we painted ourselves a little into a corner having him over at the State's Attorney's office. It really was good for cases when he was on the other side, and it was really good with the Peter relationship. We got to see what that developed into. But we feel so much better having him again in-house,"" King admits. ""You just want to see more of him. You want to see more contact with Alicia, with Kalinda. So we feel we have a mature Cary coming back to the Lockhart Gardner fold. The irony, of course, is the moment he comes back is when things are just miserable financially over there. So it's both good and bad for him. Cary started as someone who was more pragmatic and then become more ethical over the last three years. We want to see how that plays out now in this new environment where it's kind of dog eat dog."" And how will things be between Cary and Kalinda? ""There's a difficulty there, because now Kalinda's husband's in town, and so, the Cary-Kalinda relationship isn't a straight line. It never has been, but it gets even more crooked,"" King says. ""And I think the other thing with Cary is we want to see a little bit more of people's home lives this year. It's hard for the show to go too far in that direction, because it can't take you too far from other plot lines."" • Eli's focused again on Peter. ""We felt we made a mistake with Eli last year. Sorry to admit it now,"" King says, with a laugh. ""But the thing is, Eli seems to have more fun when he has one overwhelming goal for the year, as opposed to little goals. And the goal for the year is to get Peter elected governor. And Eli has never played in the big leagues like this before. And to see an Eli, who is unhinged, try to get Peter elected is just going to be very fun I think both for Alan Cumming and the audience, who will see him dealing with a lot that we see now nationally with Romney and Obama — the mix of serious issues but also being tainted by frivolous issues. How do you separate the two and should you? How do you keep what's frivolous in the public's eye so they don't start questioning about Peter's past with a prostitute or Peter's time in prison? It's not just a defensive game, it's an offensive game, and Eli becomes a master at that game."" • Jackie and Eli! ""You're gonna see Jackie first in episode 4, and she's gonna have a stronger presence this year, partly because Jackie is someone who will use anything to get what she wants, and now she's using her potential illness as another weapon in her arsenal. The other thing is for the campaign, it's very important when you're going state-wide in Illinois that you get the senior vote. And Jackie can pull in seniors who would otherwise be reluctant to vote for someone who slept with prostitutes,"" King says. ""So obviously, what we love about that is her fights with Eli. So Alan Cumming and Mary Beth Peil are for us a couple from comedy heaven. We want to see more of those struggles as they go through the campaign this year."" • A different kind of Peter. ""The third season was a Peter who wanted to do things differently. This year is a Peter who really wants to win, and how do you keep your ethics when you really want to win? Do you just let other people around you do the dirty work for you, or do you engage on that?"" King says. ""Some of the issues from the year before will come back for him, supposed racism in his department and other issues. So what we want to see a Peter who has to deal with these things sometimes by ignoring them and letting Eli just handle them."" • How Peter's campaign affects Alicia. ""There's a more engaged Alicia this year because she really wants her husband to win, too. Not for any power move on her part, but because she's afraid of what the opposition will bring,"" King says. But there are issues. Let's start with the kids: ""Zach's 17, Grace is 15. Zach really wants to be involved with the campaign. Alicia doesn't want it. But at a certain point, the kids reach the age where they're not off-limits anymore. How do you keep them from being involved with the campaign when they're kind of being dragged into the campaign by the press?"" King says. ""And what we like about that is what it does for Alicia. Her natural instinct has always been to protect her kids, but then it becomes a question mark: is it really appropriate anymore to protect them as much as she wants to?"" As the issue of race becomes part of the campaign, the fact that Zach is dating an African-American young woman could be useful. ""The difficulty obviously is where does Alicia draw the line when she knowingly is being used: Do you just start having a jaundiced eye toward the fact, or do you really draw the line and say, 'I will not allow our family to be used this way?' And that's a struggle within Alicia because she's not a kid anymore and she's not naive about how the world works."" There's also Alicia's friendship with Maura Tierney's recurring character, wealthy businesswoman Maddie Hayward, who makes her first appearance in the second episode. Eli will want Maddie to endorse Peter. ""The difficulty dramatically for characters on our show is where do you draw a line between the personal and the professional. And sometimes, more often than not, people don't draw the line. Everything that's professional is personal and everything that's personal is professional. And for Alicia, that's a very difficult balance. Sometimes she wants someone to be a friend and not there to be an agenda."" See original story at EW.com.

"Patna, India (CNN) -- Pesticides have been found in the food and oil used in a free school lunch that killed 23 students and sickened 25 others on Tuesday in northern India's Bihar state, police said Saturday. Forensic scientists found monocrotophos, an organophosphorus compound used as an insecticide, ""in the samples of oil from the container, food remains on the platter and mixture of rice with vegetables in an aluminum utensil,"" Assistant Director General Ravinder Kumar told reporters in Patna. Monocrotophos, which is used for agricultural purposes, is toxic to humans. An administrative inquiry has pointed to negligence by the school headmistress in supervising food preparation for the children, Bihar state's midday meal director R. Lakshamanan told CNN on Friday. The cook, Manju Devi, was hospitalized after eating the food she prepared, doctors said. Devi told police that the headmistress, Meena Kumari, did not heed her warning that the mustard oil used to prepare Tuesday's lunch looked and smelled bad and instead insisted that she continue preparing the meal, Lakshmanan said, citing the inquiry report. Police told CNN that investigators were trying to find Kumari to question her. Confusion, grief and despair in India's school poisoning village . The investigation found compromised hygiene and sanitation in the school, which was running from a single-room makeshift building, he added. Experts have said the deaths underscore the problem of food safety in the country and have prompted discussion on how to improve national school food programs amid news that authorities had warned months ago of safety problems with Bihar's school meal program. On Friday, authorities in Bihar -- which is one of India's poorest states -- announced that a committee would be formed to improve food preparation in rural schools. Lakshamanan said village communities would help monitor standards for school meals. The Bihar students, who were ages 5 to 12, started vomiting soon after their first bite of lunch; some fainted, authorities said. According to the Indian government, nearly half of India's children are malnourished. Since a Supreme Court decision in 2001, government schools in India have been required to provide free meals to students younger than 13. CNN's Harmeet Singh reported this story from Putna and Tom Watkins wrote it from Atlanta .","Monocrotophos is toxic to humans .

"(CNN) -- If those coveted 20-something readers can't identify with Hugh Hefner, maybe they will with ""The Simpsons."" Marge Simpson will appear in the November issue of Playboy as the magazine's first cartoon cover model. Like nearly everything printed on paper these days, Playboy magazine has been facing tough times. Advertising pages have dropped 31 percent over the last year, newsstand sales have dried up by 25 percent, and its circulation has dipped to 2.4 million, according to publishing insider Media Industry Newsletter. Can a blue-haired mother of three deliver the iconic gentleman's book to a new generation? Part commemoration of ""The Simpsons'"" 20th anniversary, part nod to the golden days of Playboy, what has become known as ""The Marge Simpson Cover"" has drummed up more attention for Playboy than the premiere of the original ""Girls Next Door."" But it remains to be seen whether the animated move can open the wallets of a younger generation. ""The shock value always does Playboy very good,"" said Media Industry Newsletter online editor-in-chief Steve Cohn. ""This is a novelty one, but it's no different than a celebrity. In a sense, Marge has something in common with a woman who's never done it before, someone like Nancy Sinatra."" But it's not exactly shock value Playboy is going for -- more like ""hip, cool"" and the kind of magazine a 25-year-old would read. Maxim, a ""lad mag"" with an average reader of 29, also ran a cover of Marge Simpson in 2004, depicting the d'oh-eyed beauty in a sheer dress on all fours, scrubbing the floor. ""We knew Marge's pictorial would appeal to a large demographic,"" said Playboy editorial director Jimmy Jellinek. ""This cover and pictorial is just another example of how we're evolving our editorial content to continue to reach men in their 20s, and also maintain the elements of the magazine that have attracted readers for more than 50 years."" The three-page pictorial, featuring a scantily-clad Marge in cartoon lingerie, was ""obviously tongue-in-cheek,"" new Playboy CEO Scott Flanders told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""It had never been done, and we thought it would be hip, cool and unusual."" Playboy's use of ""hip"" isn't the only thing retro-cool -- the cover is a clear nod to the empire's peak in the 1970s. Marge's now infamous image, itself considered to be groundbreaking as the first cartoon character to land a Playboy cover, was inspired by another bunny-eared milestone: The October 1971 issue featured Darine Stern, the first black woman to pose on a Playboy cover. Darine Stern's picture on the October 1971 cover served as the inspiration for Playboy's November 2009 cover. ""We decided to re-create [it] because it's one of our most iconic covers,"" Jellinek said, ""and because Marge's sexy blue beehive immediately made us think of Darine Stern, whose beautiful, voluminous hairdo was front and center on the October 1971 cover."" For Hefner, ""Marge Simpson is the quintessential girl next door who stole our hearts 20 years ago and has held them captive ever since. We were delighted to learn she wanted to grace the pages of our magazine. Her pictorial is truly stunning,"" he told CNN. This move comes on the heels of a disappointing first half of 2009, during which Playboy lost some attention from the demographic it does have -- the average reader is a 35-year-old male. The magazine came in 200,000 short of its 2.6 million rate base -- the minimum circulation a magazine promises to advertisers -- according to BusinessWeek. Playboy's lackluster showing as of late can be attributed to two things, Cohn said. One, the audience transferred some of their desire for tastefully disrobed women to the Web. Second, Hugh Hefner got old. ""The reason for their audience shift can be seen in Hugh Hefner. I went to college in the '70s and Hefner was in his 40s back then. He was the symbol for what kind of guy I wanted to be,"" Cohn said. ""Now he's in his 80s -- it's hard to identify with someone like that. That's a problem for Playboy."" But, Jellinek said, ""Playboy is a state of mind and a way of being, not a pre-prescribed age. We knew this was something that all of our readers would enjoy, because the show has been on for 20 years and it resonates with adults of all ages."" The ""Simpson""-ized Playboy will be available at newsstands Friday.","Playboy magazine teams up with ""The Simpsons"" to capture a younger audience .

"Acapulco, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities are holding five suspects in connection with the alleged rapes of six Spanish tourists in Acapulco, Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero said Sunday. The state attorney general has not yet released any information on the suspects or where they're being held, prompting demonstrations by family members concerned about their whereabouts. Fifty investigators have been dedicated to the case. The six women were among 14 people victimized by hooded gunmen who burst into a beach bungalow in the resort town before dawn February 4. There are seven suspects between the ages of 20 and 30, lead investigator Marcos Juarez said. In addition to the rapes, the men stole cell phones, iPads and tennis shoes from the victims, investigators said. Investigators believe the victims bought drugs from one or more of the suspects a day or two earlier, and that the victims knew the suspects, Juarez said last week. The Spanish nationals range from ages 20 to 34 and are under the protection of Mexican authorities in Mexico City. Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back in the spotlight . Seven men who were with the group were tied up with cell phone cables and bikini straps while the gunmen assaulted the six women, officials said. A seventh woman, a Mexican, was spared because of her nationality, Guerrero state Attorney General Martha Garzon said in a radio interview Wednesday. ""She has said that she identified herself to the men and asked them not to rape her,"" Garzon told Radio Formula. ""And they told her that she had 'passed the test' by being Mexican, and from that point they don't touch her."" The gunmen's motive was robbery and ""to have some fun,"" as they saw it, Garzon said. They do not appear to be a part of organized crime, officials said. Military checkpoints have been set up to apprehend the suspects. As they sift through evidence, investigators have cordoned off the area around the bungalow, which is in Playa Encantada. Last year, the city of Acapulco attracted half a million tourists -- most of them Mexicans. Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Spanish tourists received consular aid after the incident. The U.S. State Department says ""resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime reported in the border region and in areas along major trafficking routes."" But the agency adds that resort city bars, including those in Acapulco, can be ""havens for drug dealers and petty criminals."" Salomon Kaufman reported from Acapulco, and Jessica King reported from Atlanta.","50 investigators are working the case .

According to the statement, doctors said ""there is no crisis, but add that they are in no hurry to send him home just yet until they are satisfied that he has made sufficient progress."" ""We urge the public to continue supporting Madiba, but at the same time to understand that he is 94 years old and needs extraordinary care,"" the South African presidency said. ""If he spends more days in the hospital, it is because that necessary care is being provided."" Read more: Nelson Mandela has lung infection .

"(PARENTING.com) -- Since last night's unexpected announcement that terrorist Osama bin Laden had been killed, many parents are grappling with how to talk to their kids about this huge news story. Young children, most born after the horrible events of September 11, may hear bits and pieces at school even if parents took care to keep the morning news turned off. How do you explain the contradiction that it's wrong to hurt someone, but in this case the president said it was justified? We talked to Paul Coleman, a clinical psychologist who specializes in trauma and wrote the book ""How to Say It to Your Child When Bad Things Happen"". He offers these tips to find out if you should bring it up with your kids, and what to say if you do. • Although Coleman generally suggests age 7 as the best time to start talking to kids about tough stuff, this story is ubiquitous enough that preschool and kindergarten-age kids may get wind of it anyway from classmates. Parenting.com: How to answer kids' toughest questions . ""I would ask leading questions,"" says Coleman, ""like, 'Were the kids talking about anything different than normal at school today?'"" Once you understand what your kids have heard, you can correct any misinformation and take it from there. Time.com: Kids ask 'Who is bin Laden' • If you do broach the topic with your kids, keep the message simple. ""Kids are very black and white, without a lot of ability to think abstractly,"" says Coleman. Emphasize that bin Laden was very bad and hurt many people, and that when you hurt other people, you get punished so you can't keep hurting. You might even give them the relatable analogy of a bully who gets in trouble so he'll stop picking on other kids. Parenting.com: How to raise a good-hearted child . • If you haven't discussed the events of 9/11 with your kids already, you'll have to gauge if now is the right time. Since it happened before they were born, and may feel more historical than real, some kids will be able to handle it. But if your child's a worrier to begin with, you might want to stick with giving her information on a need-to-know basis. Parenting.com: What I told my kids about 9/11 . • Above all, emphasize that the grown-ups are in charge and that kids are safe, especially if they've caught wind of retribution fears. No, we can never know with 100% certainty that we are truly safe, but kids need the comfort of absolutes. Here's how parents we polled are tackling this issue with their kids today: . • My 8-year old overheard as we were reading about it and discussing. We explained simply that he killed a lot of people and was a very bad man. However, we don't celebrate the fact that a man died (since he was a person), but we do celebrate the fact that he can not hurt people anymore. • We will probably talk about it after school today. My kids are little, so I'll keep it simple and say Bin Laden was a very bad man who hurt a lot of people before they were born and this was the best way our country could think of to make sure he couldn't hurt anyone else. • My 9-yo daughter happened to be watching the news with me this morning, so I gave her and my 7-yo son a very brief synopsis of what happened. My daughter thanked me for telling her, so she'll know the facts if other people were talking about it at school. • I did talk to my 6 yo daughter about it this morning. I would rather her hear about this topic from me and be able to ask questions and not be afraid than hear it from potentially misinformed classmates. She's mature for her age and asked great questions. I'll keep the lines of communication open to be sure she feels comfortable to ask more questions if she wants to. • We told them that there was a mean man, Osama, that killed a lot of Americans. Then explained to them about ""army men"" and how they captured him and sent him away forever so the mean man will never hurt any Americans again! I told them to be proud of our country and be proud to be an American! • I told my sons the biggest bad guy in the whole world got caught by our good guys.

"(CNN) -- From faraway planets to the deepest depths of the ocean, 2012 has been an exciting year for scientific achievements and milestones. Humans broke previously unimaginable barriers by detecting an elusive tiny particle and free-falling 24 miles from the edge of space. At the same time, we said goodbye to four retired NASA space shuttles that found new museum-type homes. Here's our list of the biggest science achievements this year, in order of significance: . 1. Curiosity lands, performs science on Mars . Every time I hear the word ""curiosity"" in a sentence, I'm tempted to butt in and ask if you're talking about the Mars rover Curiosity. She's really there! On Mars! Right now! And people are driving it! (Forgive me, I get excited about this.) Landing this 2-ton rover flawlessly on the surface of Mars is our choice for the most exciting science moment of 2012. You can see from NASA's ""seven minutes of terror"" video how crazy-complicated that was -- the landing process included a supersonic parachute and a sky crane. I'll never forget watching the live NASA feed with hundreds of other science enthusiasts at Georgia Institute of Technology in the first hours of August 6. James Wray, assistant professor at Georgia Tech, who is affiliated with Curiosity's science team, was next to me, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. And when the landing was confirmed, the room erupted in cheers and shouts. This was only one of many gatherings around the world celebrating this achievement. And then there's all the stuff Curiosity's been doing since then, such as taking gorgeous photos, finding shiny objects, and coming across evidence that water once flowed on Mars. We can't wait to see what Curiosity will do in 2013. 2. Higgs boson -- it's real . One of the most highly anticipated discoveries in all of physics happened this year -- well, probably. Scientists at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, said they used the Large Hadron Collider to detect a particle whose characteristics matched those of the Higgs boson. What is the Higgs boson, you ask? It's basically a component of an invisible field, called the Higgs field, that is responsible for the mass of all the matter in the universe. In essence, it is why we are here. Finding this particle, sometimes referred to as the ""God particle"" in popular culture, will fill a large gap in scientists' understanding about how the universe works. But it's not ""God"" in the way that you might think. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman wrote a book with ""God Particle"" in the title, but reportedly said he'd actually wanted to call it the ""Goddamn Particle."" But wait, what about its mass? The two most precise ways that the particle has been measured have yielded slightly different values for its mass, said Beate Heinemann, scientist with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. But these measurements are consistent, and with more data that difference should get smaller. ""It all points at the moment to that this is indeed the Higgs boson,"" she said in an e-mail. More results are expected in March 2013, she said. 3. James Cameron's deep dive . He didn't find The Heart of the Ocean necklace, but director James Cameron did probe the remotest depths of the ocean this year. In fact, using his one-man submersible, the maker of ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" traveled to the deepest known point in the world's oceans. Cameron is the first to go alone to Challenger Deep, the name for that part of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. Here's a mind-boggling fact: Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. Only two other humans have ever visited it. In this cold, dark place, miles beneath the ocean's surface, Cameron said he did not see any fish, but did spot some ""shrimplike animals."" It took him 2 hours, 36 minutes, to get down there. ""It's a completely alien world,"" Cameron said. 4. Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking jump . Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner broke the speed of sound in October by jumping from the edge of space. He got up there on a balloon, then stepped off a platform 24 miles high and landed soon after in the New Mexico desert. Baumgartner wore a 100-pound pressurized flight suit and helmet. Without protection, his blood would have been vaporized because the atmosphere was so thin when he jumped. The temperature at his launch point was estimated at 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, if not lower. In doing so, Baumgartner broke the record for highest jump that had been set in 1960 by Col. Joe Kittinger. As part of a U.S. Air Force mission, Kittinger fell from 102,800 feet. He was a consultant for Baumgartner's efforts. Technology behind how he did it . 5. Planet with four suns . You may recall a scene from ""Star Wars"" where Luke Skywalker looks out across the landscape of a planet called Tatooine, which had two suns. This year, amateur scientists discovered that in reality, there is a planet with not just two, but four, suns. This planet, called PH1, is special for another reason: It's the first confirmed planet that the Planet Hunters group has identified. Planet Hunters is a citizen science organization, made of people just like you, who are combing through planet data. The group has also helped identify several planet candidates. Learn more at planethunters.org. 6. Nearby star has a planet . The closest planet we know of to Earth, outside of our solar system, was identified in October. This planet orbits a star called Alpha Centauri B. It's unlikely to harbor life, but there's hope that other potential planets in that area might be more hospitable to breathing creatures. Of course, when we say ""close,"" we mean 4 light-years, or 23.5 trillion miles, away. About 800 planets have been confirmed to exist outside our solar system, in addition to nearly 2,000 planet candidates found with the Kepler mission. 7. Vesta becomes a 'protoplanet' NASA's Dawn spacecraft helped scientists to determine that Vesta, originally thought of as an asteroid, is a ""protoplanet."" That means that its structure has a dense, layered body, and it orbits the sun. What's the difference between a protoplanet and a planet? It appears that something interrupted the development of protoplanets, which aren't fully formed, so they don't quite make the cut as full-fledged planets. 8. Bye-bye, space shuttles . In 2011, we said goodbye to NASA's Space Shuttle Program. This year, we saw the four surviving orbiters making Earthly journeys -- whether flown or towed -- to new homes at museums and similar attractions. Discovery is at the Udvar-Hazy Center at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. It flew on the back of a 747 from Kennedy Space Center. This is the most traveled of the space shuttles. Enterprise is at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York. This shuttle never actually went into space, but it was carried on a 747 jet from Washington to New York in June. It was originally designed as a prototype test vehicle. Endeavour is at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, having flown from Kennedy Space Center on the back of a 747. To make room for it to be towed through the city, dozens of trees were cut down and traffic signs removed. Atlantis is at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida. It was the last space shuttle to go to space, and the last to come to rest this year. Unlike the other shuttles, which made flyovers in various parts of the United States, Atlantis moved only 10 miles, towed by land to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in November. The other two shuttles -- Challenger and Columbia -- did not make it back to Earth after accidents that killed their entire crews. 9. SpaceX gets to the space station, and back . No NASA shuttles flew in 2012, but a private company called SpaceX successfully sent almost 900 pounds of cargo to the international space station in its first official mission in October. The Dragon capsule came back with nearly 1,700 pounds of freight. This was only months after the SpaceX demonstration flight in May. NASA and SpaceX have a contract for a dozen flights to the space station, and the October trip was just the first. SpaceX isn't the only player in this commercial spaceflight arena. Virgin Galactic, Sir Richard Branson's private spaceflight company, recently completed a high-altitude test. Orbital Sciences is also under contract with NASA, and will also launch a demonstration flight. 10. Baby's DNA constructed before birth . For the first time, researchers at the University of Washington were able to construct a near-total genome sequence of a fetus, using a blood sample from the mother and saliva from the father. The study suggested this method could be used to detect thousands of genetic diseases in children while they are still in the fetal stage. In the long run, it could help scientists derive new insights about genetic diseases. Right now, this sequencing costs in the neighborhood of $50,000, but given how rapidly the price of genetic testing is falling, the process may become less expensive over time. Of course, it also raises ethical issues about selecting certain desirable traits in children. For right now, however, the technology is still in its early stages.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will miss a service celebrating the Commonwealth Monday, as she continues to recover from an illness that left her hospitalized last week, Buckingham Palace announced in a statement. The 86-year-old monarch was admitted to a London hospital on March 3 with symptoms of gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, before being released the following day. A palace source told CNN the queen's health problems are ""nothing serious"" and ""nothing to fret about,"" despite preventing her attending the Commonwealth Observance service at London's Westminster Abbey. The queen will still attend Monday evening's Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House, the statement said, where she will sign a new charter calling for equal rights in all Commonwealth nations. The charter, adopted in December by all 54 countries over which the queen nominally presides, declares: ""We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds."" While some observers believe the queen's signing of the Commonwealth Charter signals her implicit support for gay rights and women's equality, a Buckingham Palace official said the monarch is merely carrying out her official duties. The official said: ""The Queen is apolitical and is signing the document in her capacity as head of the Commonwealth."" The 16-point charter also embraces democracy, freedom of speech and the rule of law among its provisions. The charter's principles could be difficult to implement in many Commonwealth countries, like Nigeria and Uganda, where homosexual acts are currently illegal. Prince Philip, the queen's husband, will attend the ceremony at Westminister Abbey, where a recorded message from the queen will be played. This year's Commonwealth theme is ""Opportunity through enterprise,"" and in the message the queen declares: ""From climbing the highest mountain, to winning a sporting competition, making a scientific breakthrough, building a successful business or discovering unique artistic talent -- these outcomes all begin as a simple goal or idea in one person's mind."" ""Our shared values of peace, democracy, development, justice and human rights -- which are found in our new 'Commonwealth Charter' -- mean that we place special emphasis on including everyone in this goal, especially those who are vulnerable."" A Palace official said the queen, who celebrated her 60th year on the throne in 2012, hopes to undertake some of her official engagements planned for the rest of this week.","Queen Elizabeth to miss Commonwealth Day service as she recovers from illness .

"(CNN) -- Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier fought long for the day they could exchange wedding vows with no judicial cloud on the horizon. That day came Friday, when they stood before California Attorney General Kamala Harris on an interior balcony in the San Francisco City Hall rotunda. ""They have waited, hoped and fought for this moment. Today, their wait is finally over,"" Harris told observers. Harris began marrying same-sex couples two days after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the marriages. Perry and Stier were plaintiffs in the lawsuit before the nation's highest court. The lesbian couple has been together since 1997. Stier held a bouquet of white roses during the ceremony. Perry wore a pants suit; Stier a dress with heels. One spectator, a man, wore a rainbow-colored vest with a hat resembling a wedding cake. The ring bearer was Elliot Perry, 18, one of the couple's twin sons who just graduated from high school and will be attending college. Harris presided over the exchange of vows, with the couple, spectators and media gathered on the balcony. Harris: ""Do you, Kris, take Sandy to be your lawfully wedded wife...."" Stier: ""I do."" Harris: ""Do you, Sandy, take Kris to be your lawfully wedded wife...."" Perry: ""I do."" Harris: ""You may now present the ring."" Perry and Stier exchanged rings and vows. The attorney general then stated that by the power and authority invested in her by the state of California, ""I now declare you spouses for life."" The spouses kissed. Cheers echoed in the rotunda. Perry began to cry. Their son, in a suit, stood between them, posing for the cameras on the balcony. Each newlywed kissed him on a cheek. Process begins to allow federal benefits for same-sex spouses . ""Thank you so much for coming to our wedding,"" Stier said afterward. ""We waited a long time for this day. We fell in love 14 years ago."" Added Perry: ""It's a great day in San Francisco, it's a great day in California and it's a great day in the country because Sandy and I are married. ""Other famlies out there in similar circumstances should fight to be married, too,"" Perry said, referring to other states that don't have same-sex marriage laws. ""Sandy and I being married represents the conclusion of a difficult period in California."" The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that same-sex marriages could resume in California, a move that the Supreme Court paved the way for on Wednesday. Supreme Court cases rest on citizens who sued -- and made history . California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state's constitution gives ""this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."" But months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they could only be between a man and a woman. A federal appeals court ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in. San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee said, ""Now, and from this day forward, same-sex couples can share in the same joy that is available to all Americans."" City Hall will be open Saturday and Sunday for similar ceremonies. Stier told reporters before the ceremony that she believes young Californians can now grow up feeling ""they can be who they want to be"" -- with government protection for all. ""I have never felt equal and I will after I marry,"" said Perry. ""I will belong to a family that I chose."" The couple said their marriage was arranged so quickly Friday and their other three children couldn't attend the ceremony. So ended California's nine years of legal struggle for same-sex marriage -- in a mere few minutes devoted to roses, kisses and ""I do's."" Same-sex marriages resume in California after court gives go-ahead . CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Weddings will continue over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- The Creators Project, a partnership between Vice Media and Intel, took over the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, on October 15 and 16 to continue its mission to bring art, music and tech together in exciting and unexpected ways. In addition to installations like David Bowie's ""Life on Mars"" revisited by Mick Rock and Barney Clay, a cocoon of light and sound by filmmaker Jonathan Glazer and Spiritualized's J. Spaceman, interconnected floor panels by Cantoni and Crescenti that undulate when you walk on them and the massive, responsive light cube by United Visual Artists, there were films by Spike Jonze and Arcade Fire as well as a screening of Kevin Macdonald's user-generated film ""Life in a Day."" As part of the weekend's festivities, Karen O premiered her psycho-opera ""Stop the Virgens,"" a widely anticipated performance piece that has been in the works for nearly seven years. When the lights come up on the stage, Karen O, in a headdress and long red and white robe, appeared behind a screen projected with bare trees and snow falling up. ""Let's begin at the end"" she sang before taking the audience though a journey of darkness, innocence, falls from grace, lobster claws, poisoned Eucharist and everyone's eventual redemption. ""Since the music was written it called out to be something more; even though I still can't describe exactly what it is we have created, I can't imagine it being anything else, nor can I see a more perfect collective of artists and friends answering that call,"" Karen O wrote in the program. The stunning performance is directed by playwright Adam Rapp and features production design by K.K. Barrett (""Where the Wild Things Are,"" ""Marie Antoinette""), costumes by Karen O's longtime wardrobe collaborator Christian Joy, music by her Yeah Yeah Yeahs bandmates Nick Zinner and Brian Chase and an appearance by Lili Taylor. It is playing at St. Ann's Warehouse through October 22. The other showstopper came from Florence + the Machine. In the Archway under the Manhattan Bridge, the band debuted songs from its upcoming album ""Ceremonials"" (due November 1). Dressed in a sheer button-down shirt and long skirt, the flame-headed Florence Welch belted out new numbers, ""Never Let Me Go,"" ""Heartlines,"" ""Spectrum"" and the previously released single ""What the Water Gave Me."" Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé of Justice played a DJ set at the event and gave a small preview of their new album ""Audio, Video, Disco,"" (due October 24), but nothing too much. De Rosnay explained: ""When we started to make this record, we noticed that electronic music was being portrayed as music for the night and the cities. We wanted to make a record for the day and the countryside. So if you listen to this album as electronic music for DJs, it may be a little bit of a disturbing experience."" Nevertheless, the group maintains ""Audio, Video, Disco"" came out of the same intentions and the same obsessions as their first album, the hard-driving ""†."" ""We thought we could express the same kind of feelings but in a different way,"" de Rosnay said. ""Sometimes you don't have to be blatantly aggressive to be powerful."" Of the 11 tracks on the album, De Rosnay and Augé's favorite is ""Brianvision."" ""Most people think it's an interlude,"" de Rosnay said. ""It's not dancey, there's no vocals, it's not pop. There's nothing, but this track was really important to us. We made it halfway through the album and when we made it, we knew we had the sound of the record. We stepped back from (what was already recorded) and made everything sound like this track. I think it's the least favorite track of people, but it's the template for the whole record.""","Karen O premieres her psycho-opera ""Stop the Virgens""

"London (CNN) -- Prince Philip has left the hospital where he has been recuperating since abdominal surgery on June 7. The Duke of Edinbugh, 92, walked out unaided Monday. He was admitted to the hospital on June 6. Philip will convalesce at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said Monday after he left a London hospital. Prince Philip: The man behind the queen . Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I. Despite his roots, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria.

"London (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron promised Wednesday that a vote will be held on Britain's membership in the European Union if his party wins the next election, in 2015. Should Britain stay in the EU? What would the impact be if it left? Send us your thoughts. Cameron said the British people should have a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement -- or to leave. The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone work out, he said, while giving a landmark speech on Europe. But, he said, it is important to ask ""difficult questions"" about the future now. Otherwise, British people could ""drift towards the exit"" if Europe fails. The key problems Europe faces are instability in the eurozone, a ""crisis of European competitiveness as other nations across the world soar ahead,"" and a lack of democratic accountability, Cameron said. ""There is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years,"" he said. As a result, ""democratic consent for the EU in Britain is now wafer thin,"" he said, and public disillusionment is at an all-time high. ""It is time to settle this European question in British politics,"" he said. ""I say to the British people: This will be your decision."" UK warned against 'cherry-picking' EU policy . The British prime minister insisted that he is not an isolationist, saying he would like Britain to remain part of Europe on the right terms, with the single market and competitiveness at the heart of the relationship. And he set out a vision for an ""updated"" European Union that is ""more flexible, more adaptable, more open, fit for the challenges of the modern age"" -- and said all options should be on the table to negotiate a new deal. He also warned that leaving the European Union would be a ""one-way ticket"" with no option of return. ""Over the coming weeks, months and years, I will not rest until this debate is won -- for the future of my country, for the success of the European Union and the prosperity of our peoples for generations to come,"" he concluded. Cameron promised a vote in the first half of the next parliament, if his party -- which is currently in a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats -- wins the general election due in 2015. The prime minister has been under concerted pressure from some members of his party to hold a referendum on Europe. The so-called Eurosceptics want to see Britain get some powers back from the EU, as well as a reduction in legislation they say holds back businesses. However, others both in and outside the party warn that creating uncertainty about Britain's membership in the European Union risks undermining the confidence of businesses and industry at a critical time. Fellow European nations may also be unwilling to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership. France and others have made it clear that Cameron cannot ""cherry-pick"" which elements of the European Union he signs up to, or risk unraveling the union to suit British interests. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told radio station France Info that the planned referendum ""risks being dangerous for Britain itself because Britain outside of Europe, that will be difficult."" If Britain did decide to leave the European Union, France would roll out the red carpet for business leaders, Fabius added. Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, predicted Britain would remain in the EU. ""I am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and contribute to shape its future,"" he said. ""I think the EU does not need unwilling Europeans."" Britain is a net contributor to the European Union and an important player in the single market, which may give Cameron some additional sway -- but critics warn he is taking a big gamble. Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt warned against trying ""hold the EU to ransom."" Verhofstadt, who leads the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, said Cameron's speech was ""filled with inconsistencies"" and showed ""a degree of ignorance about how the EU works."" New year, same old problems? ""By holding out the prospect of renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and subjecting it to a referendum, David Cameron is playing with fire,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama last week told Cameron that ""the United States values a strong UK in a strong European Union."" And Philip Gordon, the U.S. assistant secretary for European affairs, also made it clear that there would be consequences for Britain if it either left the EU or played a lesser role in Brussels. ""We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU,"" he told reporters at the U.S. Embassy in London. ""That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it."" Markets across Europe were flat Wednesday morning after Cameron's speech, including in London. Labour leader Ed Miliband said ahead of Cameron's address that it would ""define him as a weak prime minister, being driven by his party, not by the national economic interest."" Miliband said Tuesday that Cameron had rejected the idea of an ""in/out"" referendum on Europe in October 2011 because of the doubts it would foster. ""The only thing that has changed since then is he has lost control of his party and is too weak to do what is right for the country,"" Miliband said. ""Everyone knows that the priority for Britain is the jobs and growth that we need. We have had warning after warning from British business about the dangers of creating years of uncertainty for Britain."" Cameron also lacks the support of his party's coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, for the move. Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told UK media that creating years of uncertainty over Britain's place in Europe was not in the national interest at this time. Cameron's Conservative Party faces a growing domestic political threat from the UK Independence Party, or UKIP, which wants Britain to withdraw fully from the EU. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who is also a member of the European Parliament, said Cameron's speech Wednesday had ""defined the national debate about our place in the European Union. No longer can the case for British withdrawal be confined to the margins. The genie is out of the bottle."" But Farage questioned whether Cameron is truly committed to reclaiming powers from the European Union, or is just seeking to win votes. Daniel Wilsher, an expert in EU law at City University London, said Cameron will need to come up with ""some convincing bargaining chips"" if he wants to persuade other EU members to negotiate a new deal. Cameron's threat to wield Britain's veto over treaty changes to deepen ties within the eurozone will not be enough, Wilsher said. The British prime minister also focused on the importance of the single market, Wilsher said, but membership in this is tied to EU rules regarding workers' rights, consumer safety and environmental protection. To opt out of certain laws, such as the EU directive on working hours, ""is legally difficult and would disturb a premise of the single market,"" he said. ""Overall, it would be very hard to change the fundamentals without allowing every country to pick on its own pet hates."" President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz had a similar view, tweeting: ""#Cameron's Europe a la carte not an option. We have to focus on jobs & growth rather than getting lost in treaties discussions."" Cameron was due to give the speech on Europe last week but had to postpone its delivery because of the Algerian hostage crisis. Medvedev: Russia is open for business .

"(CNN) -- Feeding India's hungry school children is an undertaking unparalleled anywhere -- the $22 billion-a-year scheme provides a hot meal to an estimated 120 million students every school day. Reetika Khera, an economist at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi who has studied the scheme, credits the ""very ambitious, very large and very popular"" program with having a huge impact on student enrollment and attendance in a country in which, according to official government figures, nearly half of all children are malnourished. But the tragic deaths of at least 22 children and hospitalization of 24 more after eating a school meal in India's northeastern Bihar state highlight the failings of the program to provide healthy -- or even safe -- meals, in some parts of the country where governance, accountability and poverty remain entrenched issues. Read more: Principal on the run, children recover . The students became ill immediately after eating the meal of rice and potatoes in the village of Dahrmasati Gandawan on Tuesday. The circumstances leading up to the contamination, which has provoked violent protests in the region, remain murky, with the school's principal and her husband having absconded and currently being sought by authorities, area police chief Sujit Kumar told CNN. But Bihar state Education Minister P.K. Shahi has said the children were poisoned by an insecticide that was in the food. Officials believe the substance involved was organophosphorus, a chemical that the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention says is commonly used in agriculture. Khera said the national school meal program had its origins in a landmark decision by India's Supreme Court in 2001 that decreed all government schools were required to provide free meals to students below the age of 13. Until that point, the schools had been discharging their commitments to child nutrition ""by giving children 3kg of wheat or rice every month in lieu of giving them meals,"" she said. ""The court said 'This will not do.'"" Within a year, most states had implemented systems to offer daily meals to their students, but in Bihar -- one of India's poorest states she said, with a track record of poor governance and social welfare -- it took two years to start providing the service. ""Bihar is always a little bit behind everything,"" she said. ""Around 2004-5, they started rubbing their eyes and waking up and saying, 'Okay, we've got to get on this thing.'"" Read more: Feeding school children in Bangalore . On the whole, the program -- aimed at achieving educational and nutritional goals in one swoop -- has been hailed as a success, with studies showing significant increases in enrollment and attendance, particularly among disadvantaged groups, such as girls, dalits and adivasis, said Khera. ""By and large, it is a very important program and it has had a very good effect."" But the quality of the service has varied greatly across the country. Some states, such as Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, developed sophisticated programs to deliver a quality service. By contrast, a 2010 study by India's Planning Commission reported that more than 70% of children in schools surveyed in Bihar were unhappy with the quality of their meals, three-quarters of the schools reported they lacked proper utensils, and many schools in Bihar complained of receiving their food supplies on a haphazard basis, resulting in hygiene issues. ""Problems still remain, especially in states like Bihar, Jharkand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal,"" she said. ""There is a very serious problem of administrative capacity and law. The implementation is poor, the money they put into the program is very little and so the quality of the food that is provided in this region is a general concern. They're still struggling with issues that a place like Rajasthan was dealing with 10 years ago."" The fact that there were no answers days after the tragedy was ""a reflection of the lackadaisical attitude of the Bihar government,"" she said. ""Bihar needs to put mechanisms in place that will allow it to monitor these meals more effectively."" Further complicating the picture, she said, was the role of private contractors in the food supply chain, motivated by the promise of profiting from the government-funded programs. ""When you bring in contractors to supply meals, these people only come in it for the money. And when they come in for the money, they're going to skimp any way they can -- by cutting corners,"" she said. CNN-IBN, CNN's sister network, reported Bihar's education minister P.K. Sahi as claiming the school principal's husband was the supplier of the food for the school meals. CNN has been unable to verify his claims with the principal or her husband, who authorities say have ""absconded."" Khera said that while contaminated school meals were not unheard of across the country, an incident on this scale would hopefully serve as a wake-up call to authorities to improve the service where it was required. ""But it's hard to see that happening, because there's a general problem of a lack of accountability, particularly in this state,"" she said.","India provides a free hot meal a day to every student below the age of 13 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Sunday refused to stop California from issuing same-sex marriage licenses, turning aside an emergency request from supporters of Proposition 8, the voter-approved measure that had earlier been dismissed by the justices on narrow, jurisdictional grounds. It is the latest legal and political twist in an issue that has divided the state. Justice Anthony Kennedy refused to vacate a stay of a decision Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, which had lifted a previous injunction on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed. Officials across the state, including the attorney general, quickly began performing same-sex marriages, including those of the two couples who brought the original lawsuit. Kennedy acted on his own, without consulting the other justices, and offered no explanation for his decision to stay out of the new legal fight. Same-sex marriage opponents had argued the lower courts and state leaders acted too quickly, without allowing the legal appeals process to fully play out. Process begins to allow federal benefits for same-sex spouses . It all started last week when in a blockbuster ruling, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds, ruling Wednesday that private parties do not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. After the appeals court two days later effectively permitted same-sex marriage to resume, supporters of Proposition 8 then asked the Supreme Court over the weekend to intervene. Despite Sunday's order, ""traditional"" marriage advocates have the option of asking another individual justice, or the entire court, to halt the 9th Circuit's order. And while many more same-sex marriages are expected to be performed in coming weeks and months, the legal challenges over the issue are also certain to continue. What angered Prop 8 backers in this fight was the appeals court's bypassing a traditional waiting period. Typically, 25 days must pass before Supreme Court judgments become final, to give the losing side an opportunity to ask for a rehearing. Such rehearing requests are almost always denied, but a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit decided to act swiftly, without waiting for a certified copy of Wednesday's ruling to be issued. ""Everyone on all sides of the marriage debate should agree that the legal process must be followed,"" said Austin Nimocks, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, on Sunday. ""The 9th Circuit has failed to abide by its own word that the stay would remain in place until final disposition by the Supreme Court. When courts act contrary to their own statements, the public's confidence in the justice system is undermined."" The Supreme Court's 5-4 opinion last week avoided, for now, a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional ""equal protection"" right that would apply to all states. But it had the effect of clearing the way for the nation's largest state to move ahead. Thirteen states have now approved of same-sex marriage. Delaware's law takes effect Monday. Historic rulings on same-sex marriage . At issue in California was whether the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage to exclude same-sex couples, and whether a state can revoke same-sex marriage through referendum, as California did, once it already has been recognized. But a majority of the Supreme Court opted not to rule on those issues. Instead, it ruled on ""standing"" -- whether those who brought the suit to the court were entitled to do so. ""We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend a state statute when state officials have chosen not to,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. He was supported by an unusual coalition: fellow conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and more liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Within hours of the ruling, California's Gov. Jerry Brown said, ""I have directed the California Department of Public Health to advise the state's counties that they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in California as soon as the Ninth Circuit confirms the stay is lifted."" Brown, a Democrat, said he interpreted the high court opinion as making Prop 8 unconstitutional and unenforceable. The state's Attorney General Kamala Harris agreed and urged the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco to issue its mandate ""immediately."" That court did so two days later. There remains some legal uncertainty whether the high court's ruling could be enforced statewide, or limited to only a few jurisdictions. Some county clerks may decide they will not certify same-sex marriages in their jurisdictions. The Prop 8 case was Act Two in a closely watched pair of high court appeals over state and federal laws and the limits of recognizing the ability of gay and lesbian couples to wed. The outcome of the rulings gives same-sex couples much to be encouraged about. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue . California voters approved Proposition 8 in 2008 with 52% of the vote, shortly after the state Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriages are legal. The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold in the state, but a federal appeals court later ruled Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. Two of the original plaintiffs -- Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, a Burbank, California, couple who wanted to marry but could not because of Proposition 8 -- contended the state was discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation. ""This is about our freedom and our liberty,"" Katami told CNN. ""We are not trying to topple marriage. We are not trying to redefine marriage. What we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country."" Both they and Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier, the other plaintiff couple from Berkeley, were in the courtroom when the rulings came out. They were cheered when they emerged from the court building. And the two same-sex couples were among the first Californians to get married on Friday afternoon. Ironically, Justice Kennedy wrote the court's dissent in the Prop 8 petition. ""What the court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government, not the other way around. Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government,"" he wrote. ""The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century. ... In California and the 26 other states that permit initiatives and popular referendums, the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves. The court today frustrates that choice."" 'What about us?' ask couples who still can't marry . Kennedy was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor. The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (13A18).","Court turns aside emergency request from supporters of California's Prop 8 .

"(CNN) -- Large volumes of gas continued Friday to gush into the North Sea from an offshore oil platform, with energy giant Total trying two divergent methods in hopes of stopping the leak. Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said Friday that authorities are prepared for the worst, but he added that it is believed that the ""gas condensate"" now flowing into the water ""will evaporate naturally into the atmosphere."" ""As such, the current environmental risk continues to be minimal,"" Lochhead said. The Elgin platform sprang a leak Sunday, prompting the evacuation of 238 people from the platform and the adjacent Rowan Viking drilling rig, according to Total executive Philippe Guys. The leak seems to have started as workers were sealing the well in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. Since then, energy company and government officials have weighed what to do about it, with one option being waiting for the gas to stop leaking on its own. On Friday, one day after announcing it had pinpointed the source of the leak, Total detailed its dueling approaches to stop it: blocking the outflow with ""heavy mud"" (consisting of a mixture that contains mineral compounds) and drilling a pair of relief wells. Until then, ""the leak remains ongoing,"" according to Guys. Gas is now gushing into the North Sea at an estimated rate of 2 kilograms per second, which translates to about 200,000 cubic meters per day. The North Sea was the scene of the world's worst offshore rig disaster, the Piper Alpha explosion, which killed 167 people in 1988. The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 -- including the fact that both emerged as workers were closing off wells -- but there are differences. The Elgin is in shallower water than the BP spill, which could make problems easier to fix. And instead of oil, it is leaking gas, which can disperse faster but ignites more easily. ""This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago,"" oceanographer Simon Boxall said. ""This is a relatively light spill. The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly."" After Total's share price fell sharply earlier in the week, it rebounded slightly on Friday with a 0.9% gain. Guys, the executive from the energy giant, said Friday that ""all other"" Total wells in the vicinity are in ""safe condition,"" signaling that there is no expectation of further problems. Shell has also partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms, Shearwater and Hans Deul, as a ""purely precautionary"" measure, it said Wednesday. Satellites and spotter planes are being used to assess the latest spill, while several vessels are on standby nearby ready to help, Guys said. Lochhead, Scotland's environmental minister, said he was ""pleased"" that ""more information"" on the incident had been released by Total and the British government. While expressing faith that the long-term impact on the environment shouldn't be major, Lochhead said that the hard work is far from over. ""We cannot be complacent, and Marine Scotland is continually assessing the situation and scenario planning for all eventualities,"" Lochhead said. ""Additional scientific resources, manpower and vessels can be utilized at short notice, should the situation change.""","Total's Elgin platform in the North Sea began leaking gas on Sunday .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least seven people are dead after assailants attacked a compound housing senior government officials, including those of the Pakistani intelligence services, a first responder and a security official told CNN Wednesday. Earlier, the security official had told CNN that two attackers were killed in the attack on the compound in the town of Sukkur, in Sindh province, but that number conflicted with additional reporting CNN has gathered. It was not immediately clear what the breakdown was of civilians and attackers killed. The security official, however, said that a suicide bombing occurred and was followed by a gun and grenade attack. In addition to housing Pakistani security offices, it also includes judges' homes and police housing. Suicide bombers rammed an explosives-laden car into the building, the official said, and others went into the compound and carried out the gun and grenade attack. Mohammed Urif, in charge of ambulance services, said rescuers have transported 35 to 40 injured people to nearby hospitals. Among the injured, 10 to 12 are critically wounded, he said. ""It seems the blasts were targeting the Barrage Colony compound where the ISI offices are,"" said Deputy Inspector General in Sukkur Javed Odho, referring to Pakistan's intelligence agency. ""Police have cordoned off the area, and we are working toward conducting an investigation."" In a news release, Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack. The statement said that he ""prayed to Allah Almighty to bless the departed souls with eternal peace and grant courage to their families to bear the loss with fortitude."" He was also praying for the recovery of the injured, it read. Geo TV in Pakistan covered the blasts, showing video of rubble. It reported that the attack injured 35 people.","Compound in Sukkur attacked, a security official and first responder tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- Any way you slice it, thousands of same-sex couples across the United States were thrilled by Wednesday's Supreme Court rulings. But in 37 states, some same-sex couples weren't as happy as they'd hoped to be. They're the 37 states that ban same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8 weren't broad enough to change that status. Don't get them wrong, many couples in these states feel the ruling is an overall victory, especially for ""our folks in California [who] can be blissfully married again,"" as Maryland resident Nicolene du Toit, who anxiously awaited the ruling with her wife over the phone, put it. In addition to saying that same-sex marriages could resume in California, the court decided that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. But some couples couldn't help but be disappointed that the rulings may not make a difference in their own states -- at least for now. What's next for gay rights movement? ""Immediately, it doesn't mean anything,"" said Brandi Ansley of Atlanta. Georgia is one of the states that does not allow same-sex marriage. ""There's no reason for us to run out and get married (in a state that allows it), because she wouldn't be able to insure me and the children."" South Carolina resident Jordan Sullivan agreed. ""It's a wonderful step in the right direction, but I still can't help but feel sad and disappointed that the ruling does not extend to all states, including South Carolina,"" said Sullivan, who's been with her partner nearly three years and would like to get married. ""I can only hope we won't be like the last kid picked in gym class."" And for couples like Casey Miller and John Martin, the federal benefits ruling brings up a number of questions that even legal experts don't agree on. Miller and Martin were legally married in California in 2008. But they live in Texas, where same-sex marriage isn't recognized. So will they qualify for federal tax, health and pension benefits? Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of law at the University of California-Irvine and a constitutional law expert, says yes. ""A couple that was lawfully married in a state, but moves to another state, still is married,"" he said. ""Their marriage has not been ended, even if not recognized in their new state. So they get all federal benefits accorded to married couples, though their marriage will not be recognized in their new state."" But Neil Siegel, a law professor at Duke University and an expert on the Supreme Court, didn't think the issue was quite so black and white. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue . ""It's not clear,"" he said. ""The federal agencies are going to have to decide, and different agencies may decide differently. Congress could always step in, and eventually you're going to have federal courts ruling. There may be additional protection from certain federal agencies, but it's not clear at this point which ones or when."" ""It wouldn't be surprising to me to hear the president order the federal agencies to say that if [a same-sex couple] is lawfully married in one state, that they have to provide benefits wherever they're living,"" he added. Same-sex couples: What the Supreme Court decision means for your finances . Miller finds all the uncertainty frustrating and described the rulings as ""an expensive baby step."" ""Are we still second-class citizens?"" he asked. Other same-sex couples in states that do not allow them to marry say they're still worried about the same issues that plagued them before, like hospital visitation, adoption and end-of-life rights. And some say that, even if they could be afforded federal benefits by marrying in a state that allows same-sex marriage, they deserve the right to get married in the states where they've made their home. ""I hope the Supreme Court takes the ruling a step further to make it a national law, so we can legally get married under big oak trees in Charleston, with our friends and family from all over the world sharing the joy and excitement on a day that once didn't seem possible,"" mused Sullivan. ""To my LGBT brethren in more accepting states, especially you who got a double in California...rejoice and be happy, for this day is truly yours,"" wrote R.J. McKay, an Ohio resident who's been with his partner for 15 years. ""For those of us stuck in less accepting states, this was a huge symbolic win...keep (your) eye on the prize."" CNN's Christina Zdanowicz, Daphne Sashin, Nicole Saidi and Julia Carpenter contributed to this report.","Wednesday's Supreme Court rulings left some same-sex couples with conflicting feelings .

"London (CNN) -- A man accused of defacing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II with paint at Westminster Abbey is due in court on Friday, police in London said. Tim Haries, an electrician from South Yorkshire, has been charged with causing criminal damage over Â£5,000, Metropolitan Police said. The 41-year-old suspect was arrested on Thursday soon after the damage to the painting was reported. He will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court. The portrait, by the Australian-born artist Ralph Heimans, has been taken down, the abbey said in a statement Thursday. ""Until work can be done to remedy the damage it will -- very regrettably -- not be possible to have the painting on public view,"" it said. The portrait went on show in the Chapter House last month as part of the abbey's celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the queen's coronation. The 9-foot by 11-foot oil painting depicts the queen in state dress, including the crimson velvet robe she wore for her coronation in 1953, in an imagined scene at night in the abbey. According to the abbey website, it captures the queen ""in a moment of solitary reflection."" Last week, the queen and other royals attended a service at the abbey to mark 60 years since her coronation there. There have been 38 coronations at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066. Westminster Abbey is also where Prince William married Catherine Middleton in 2011.

"Peshawar (CNN) -- Taliban fighters from Pakistan say they have united with al Qaeda forces in Syria to fight the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The commander of the Pakistan Taliban, Abdul Rashid Abbasi, has told CNN that the first batch of fighters has arrived in Syria and established a command and control center to launch operational activities alongside Syrian rebel fighters. Abbasi, a close associate of Pakistan Taliban head Hakeemullah Mehsud, told CNN that 120 fighters are already in Syria. The Taliban commander went on to say that another batch of fighters made up of 150 men will arrive in Syria this week. ""We shall be sending more volunteers, but cannot give exact numbers at this moment, but we will provide whatever support is needed by our Syrian brothers,"" Abbasi told CNN. CNN is unable to independently confirm that members of the Pakistan Taliban are inside Syria. CNN journalists have previously been inside Syria and seen foreign fighters participate in the country's civil war, which sprang from unrest sparked in the spring of 2011. Abbasi said the fighters were sent after the Pakistan Taliban received a request from the al Qaeda operational commander in Syria, Abu Omar Baghdadi. Pakistan Taliban fighters will be under the command and control structure of al Qaeda in Syria, as it is leading the operation, he said. The Pakistan Taliban said it has also asked its local chapters in the Mohmand, Bajaur, Khyber, Orakzai and Waziristan agencies to recruit fresh fighters who are willing to go on their mission in Syria. The Pakistan Taliban says many young men are registering to go on their first foreign mission. But the Pakistan Taliban said it will remain based in Pakistan. ""We have lots of fighters here and our central command will be operating from here, so there is no reason to stop operations in Pakistan,"" Abbasi said. ""They will go on as usual.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- The wife of a former Communist Party leader will go on trial next week in the alleged killing of a British businessman, a friend of the suspect's family said Friday. The trial of Gu Kailai, the wife of disgraced former Politburo member Bo Xilai, is expected to start Thursday in the eastern city of Hefei, according to the friend, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Gu and a family aide were charged in the November death of British businessman Neil Heywood. If convicted, Gu could face the death penalty, but the friend said her life is expected to be spared. Read more: Bo scandal 'good' for China, expert says . Each of the defendants will be allowed to have two relatives at the trial, which is expected to be speedy, according to the friend. Heywood died in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing, where Bo was the Communist Party chief and a rising star in the party -- the son of one of the ""eight immortals"" of the revolution that created modern China. Heywood was found dead in his hotel room, and officials quickly blamed his death on excessive alcohol. His body was cremated without an autopsy. But controversy swirled in February, when Bo's longtime lieutenant, Wang Lijun, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu. Wang, the former police chief who managed Bo's anti-crime push, wanted political asylum, apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss. Read more: The inside story of China's great political drama . Media reports and online posts claimed he clashed with Bo after suggesting that Heywood had been poisoned amid a business dispute with Gu -- an allegation that appears in the charges announced. Gu and the family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were arrested in early April and have not seen their relatives since then, the friend said. The Xinhua news agency also announced in April that Bo had been stripped of his seats on the Communist Party's Central Committee for an unspecified ""serious breach of regulations."" Wang was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization. Authorities say Gu and her son squabbled with Heywood over ""economic interests,"" and she regarded him as a threat to her son's safety. Britain, which had asked China to investigate the matter further, said it welcomed the charges. Read more: Interest in Bo Xilai scandal bigger abroad than in China . ""The details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement last week. ""However, we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely."" Speculation has grown over the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to Bo's family. Heywood had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies he advised was a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. That link fueled rumors that he may have had connections to British intelligence services, but Foreign Secretary William Hague denied that possibility in a public statement in April. Read more: Inside China's murder mystery hotel . ""Mr. Heywood was not an employee of the British government in any capacity,"" he said in a letter. He said that the British government usually never confirms nor denies those accounts, but that he was making an exception, ""given the intense interest in this case."" The case has forced the Communist leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high-ranking member in an unusually public way, according to Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The disruption of his departure from office and his wife's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people,"" Paal said. That united front has been key to ruling China for 2,000 years, he said. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The leadership is trying to resolve the affair before its once-in-a-decade leadership transition at the Communist Party Congress meeting this year, said Joseph Fewsmith, an international relations professor at Boston University and a longtime China watcher.

"London (CNN) -- The security plans for the London Marathon this weekend are being reassessed after the deadly bomb blasts in Boston, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. Police and race organizers said they are working closely on security for Sunday's race. About 35,000 runners take part in the London Marathon each year, and many more people turn out to cheer them on. READ MORE: Terror at Boston Marathon: 3 dead, scores wounded . ""We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon,"" said event commander Chief Supt. Julia Pendry. The Metropolitan Police have ""a wealth of experience in policing a wide range of public order events across London,"" she said. The London Marathon organizers said Tuesday the event ""will go ahead as originally scheduled."" ""We have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the Metropolitan Police and other authorities,"" a statement on the event website said Tuesday. Chief executive Nick Bitel said: ""We want to reassure our runners, spectators, volunteers and everyone connected with the event that we are doing everything to ensure their safety."" The organizers said Monday they were deeply saddened and shocked by the news from Boston. ""Our immediate thoughts are with all the people there and their families. It is a very sad day for athletics and for our friends and colleagues in marathon running,"" they said in a statement. London is the next, after Boston, of the six races that make up the World Marathon Majors series. The course, which starts in southeast London, passes through some of the capital's main business districts before finishing near Buckingham Palace. More than three-quarters of those taking part will raise money for charity. 'Robust security measures' ""The bombings in Boston are shocking, cowardly and horrific, and the thoughts of all Londoners this morning will be with the victims,"" London Mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. ""Boston is a proud city built on history, tradition and a real sense of community. These attacks were aimed at its core, at innocent men, women and children enjoying a spring day out at a major sporting event. ""We do have robust security measures in place for Sunday's London Marathon, but given events in Boston it's only prudent for the police and the organizers of Sunday's race to reexamine those security arrangements."" CNN anchor Piers Morgan tweeted: ""London marathon this Sunday - security at these events will never be the same again."" Will Geddes, managing director of threat management company International Corporate Protection, told CNN that it is ""very difficult"" to secure a marathon. ""You can look at isolating particular areas and trying to secure these -- however, you are looking at a 26-mile-plus route, which often will spread across a major capital, and in terms of protecting it right along the route, it will be very, very difficult,"" he said. Any potential terrorist ""will be looking for the largest number of casualties they can achieve, so the start point and the finish point will no doubt be two areas the Metropolitan Police will be focusing on and how they can secure those."" But, Geddes said, ""to a certain degree, there is only so much they can do."" One key element will be the awareness of the general public, which in recent years has played an increasing role in alerting authorities to any suspicious activities or bags left unattended, he added. A big security operation will also swing into place on Wednesday for the funeral of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister. The Metropolitan Police have said parts of the transport network will be closed down and there will be a large military and police presence on the streets as the funeral procession passes through central London. Last summer, authorities successfully implemented a huge security plan to keep the city safe during the London Olympics.

"(CNN) -- One person was killed in a shooting involving Border Patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican state media reported Thursday. A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border, the state-run Notimex news agency said, citing anonymous sources. In a statement released earlier Thursday, the U.S. Border Patrol confirmed the Wednesday night shooting, but did not say whether anyone had been killed. Citing preliminary reports, the Border Patrol said agents saw smugglers drop drugs on the U.S. side of the border in Nogales, Arizona, then return to Mexico. ""Subjects at the scene then began assaulting the agents with rocks,"" the Border Patrol said in a written statement. ""After verbal commands from agents to cease were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm,"" the Border Patrol said. ""One of the subjects appeared to have been hit."" The FBI is investigating the shooting, the Border Patrol said. Mexico's government condemned the violence and called for a swift investigation, Notimex said. ""Preliminary information available at this moment once again generates serious doubts about the use of lethal force by Border Patrol agents, which the Mexican government and Mexican society strongly condemn and deplore,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday night, according to Notimex. In response to similar shootings in September and July, Mexico's foreign ministry has criticized what it said was ""disproportionate use of lethal force"" at the border. In 2010, the FBI investigated after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teen along the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Federal officials closed the case in April, saying there was not enough evidence to pursue charges against the officer and that he acted within the agency's policies for use of force. The officer received widespread condemnation from critics who questioned his use of deadly force against 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who authorities said had been throwing rocks at the agent when he was shot and killed. Hernandez had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia said after the shooting. An appeal is pending in a lawsuit filed by the teen's parents in U.S. federal court, accusing the officer of using excessive force. The Mexican government filed a friend of the court brief in the case, noting that its request to extradite the Border Patrol agent for prosecution had been denied. ""As a matter of international responsibility, the fact that the victim was on Mexican soil when he was killed does not absolve the United States of responsibility for the acts of its agent,"" the brief said.

"(CNN) -- Batman had Robin, Holmes had Watson, Han Solo had Chewbacca; iconic heroes have iconic sidekicks who keep their main man sane and humanized, while providing the audience with a proxy. But whereas the Lone Ranger only had one Tonto, ""The Doctor"" from 50-year-old British series ""Doctor Who"" goes through a lot of ""Companions"" -- so much so that new arrivals are met with fan anticipation and anxiety. Enter Jenna-Louise Coleman, the 26-year-old actress who officially steps into the role of sci-fi sidekick on the popular BBC America show's Christmas Special. Known to American audiences from the April 2012 ABC miniseries ""Titanic,"" and for a brief role in 2010's ""Captain America: The First Avenger,"" she joins ""Doctor Who"" as Clara/Oswin, a companion to The Doctor, a mysterious, human-looking ""Time Lord."" Played by Matt Smith, he journeys through ""Time And Relative Dimension In Space"" in his aptly-named ship, the TARDIS -- which looks like a blue British police call box on the outside, and is as iconographic a vehicle as the U.S.S. Enterprise, Millennium Falcon or DeLorean. Launched in 1963, change and evolution is part of the show's DNA. When a lead actor steps down, The Doctor essentially dies and is regenerated into a new body, but as the same character with a new actor portraying him. Smith is the 11th to do so. However, over five decades, more than the 30 companions have been unique characters with their own back-story. The Doctor invites them on adventures across the ""time vortex"" to face monsters and save worlds. As they retire or die, fresh ones are needed to keep the him company. Although she is only the latest of companions, Coleman's debut comes during a unique moment during ""Doctor Who.""Gracing the covers of TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly as a fan favorite, garnering a cover mention in ""Rolling Stone"" as a best fall show, ranking as iTunes' most downloaded TV show in the U.S., packing the house at San Diego Comic-Con International, Coleman arrives as the global brand has become a bona fide hit in America -- and immediately following the death of popular predecessors Amy Pond and Rory (played by Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill), Smith's first companions. Coleman played a surprise role in last September's season premiere -- as Oswin, a different character from Clara, but one connected to her -- and takes on full companion duties in ""The Snowmen"" Christmas episode, airing December 25 at 9 p.m. ET. A mysterious woman with a secret, Clara is a feisty, flirty foil to a grief-stricken, apathetic Doctor. ""We see him having just lost the Ponds, and he's not in a great place,"" said Smith. ""He's lost his mojo a bit, and his sense of adventure, and I think this season certainly looks at him rediscovering that fire with Clara."" Smith added he is excited for fans to see the developing chemistry between him and Coleman, as well as the ""real intrigue"" behind the mystery of Clara's identity. And just as the nature of ""Doctor Who"" is change, Smith said fans will also embrace Coleman's Clara. For her part, Jenna-Louise Coleman has already embraced her role as a companion. During a recent interview at BBC America's Manhattan offices, she offered insight about her character and her relationship with The Doctor, and weighed in on Clara's soufflÃ© obsession, driving a spaceship, her Bond Girl moment and Christmas traditions. Can you share a moment when you felt the enormity of stepping into this popular world? You see ""it"" everywhere and you're used to it, like I was used to seeing Matt's face all over the place. But, when I was auditioning, being sat on the Tube and you see the posters, and it was always like he was pointing at me . ... (But) there's not very much time to analyze as you go. It is only now that I feel like I've just been playing with all my mates for the last couple of months, and then suddenly, I'm like, ""but people are going to see this,"" you know? What would you like to add to the legacy of the show as Oswin/Clara? I like that it's not plain sailing. Like (executive producer Steven Moffat) was saying, it's not very interesting if you come in and it's like this friendship straight away. He's been very clever in creating a mystery, because, no matter what, it's always going to be hard to bring in somebody else into the show, when Matt, Karen and Arthur started out together, and you're used to seeing them on screen together. How would you define your character's relationship with The Doctor? I like that she holds her own. You know, The Doctor's this amazing man, and she's like, ""You know, cool. I think you're amazing, but so am I."" So, it's a nice double act. Has Karen offered advice on joining the show? She's been really supportive. ... She came to the screening in New York City with Matt, and when Oswin was on screen, she texted me saying it was great. (But) from interviews I've seen of Karen, she was saying she didn't want to, because she wanted me to have my own experience. I did want to be like, ""What do I need to know? Tell me everything!"" But she's been really cool about it. There was never a realized romance between The Doctor and Karen's Amy, but your character gets flirtatious straight away, right? It's been interesting how it's changed Matt's Doctor. There is a natural bounce between them, and a flirtation, and attraction. But, again, they've always got this friction because they're a bit magnetic and drawn to each other, but she can't quite figure him out. He's got loads of secrets and he's always looking at her, trying to figure her out. Can you tell me about the first meeting between you and Matt? He's with the same agency as me, so my agent said, ""You're going to be reading with Matt and he's lovely. He'll take care of you."" I walked into the room and he's just like, ""Heeeeyyyyy,"" and gave me a big hug. He really helped me out in the audition. I've read with other actors in auditions before, but Matt really got involved so it was like we were both auditioning together almost. This is an iconic franchise, but are there other big franchises you'd want to step into? Totally! I'd love to be a Bond Girl. I did have my Bond Girl moment -- well, what I thought was going to be, but it was very much a ""Doctor Who"" version. Like being on the back of a motorbike, but then we've got the goggles and the hat, so it was like ""Doctor Who's"" take on James Bond. Have you played with any cool sci-fi gadgets on the show, like the TARDIS? There are certain parts of the TARDIS which I love. We've got these new kind-of rolly balls, which is my favorite. But my character got to drive the TARDIS at one point! In the long list of ""Doctor Who"" monsters, what's your favorite? The Weeping Angels. It's the concept (that they only move when you aren't looking at them). But there's one at the end of this season -- it's a new monster, and I'd say you have to wait and see that. That one is my favorite, so far. One of the things we know about your character is her love of soufflÃ©. Have you tried making one? I had to be baking one in a scene recently. So I got the Google up and tried to figure out exactly how to do it, take it kind of really seriously to make sure I've got, like, the whisking right. But maybe that's what I should do over Christmas. Is it odd returning to a ""normal"" world after living in The Doctor's? ""This"" life is so exciting on a daily basis. Everything's so dramatic every day, and it's the end of the world every week. You're either running or there's a snow machine or rain machine, or you're in a harness and you're on wires. ... On an off day, I find that I get bored quickly, like, ""Where's the Cybermen?"" The ""Doctor Who Christmas Special"" is something of a tradition -- do you have others you'll keep? There are 13 of my family going to a cottage, so we'll be there watching. It's one of my grandmum's favorite shows, so it's big for her. But normally I get home from London and I haven't seen my family for a little while, and me and my mum always wrap the presents the night before with a glass of Bailey's. That's my favorite tradition at Christmastime. What did your grandmother say when she learned you got this role? I auditioned for Amy's best mate in it, and was pretty close to getting the part, and my grandma was absolutely devastated I didn't. So, we came back around, and I don't think she can believe it, actually. It is quite surreal for her, and she's quite looking forward to meeting Matt. What do you anticipate that encounter being like? My grandma's going to mess up his hair. She's going to be patting him and hugging him, and Matt's going to have really messy hair for the rest of the night.","The ""Doctor Who"" doctor goes through a lot of companions on the series .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's through film, TV or pages of a book, you may have flown a TARDIS with a time lord, walked on the moon with Neil Armstrong, survived the Hunger Games, and perhaps even fallen in love with a character of the likes of Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy. But faithful fans aren't leaving their love for their interests at home. Instead, they're setting course to destinations where their geeky passions come alive. From the sweeping emerald landscapes of New Zealand where one can wander the trails of the cinematic Middle-earth of ""Lord of the Rings"" to Wales for the ultimate ""Doctor Who"" experience, devotees are seizing the chance to experience their fandom up close and personal. For iReporter Alex Vaccarino, a book report in fourth grade would start a lifelong love affair with J.K. Rowling's world. Though our ""muggle"" world may not have magical potions to ensnare the senses, Potterheads like her can apparate (or take a plane or car) to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an enchanting theme park inside Universal Orlando fit for any wizard. Complete with a snow-capped Hogsmeade, a Hogwarts Castle and recognizable shops including Ollivanders and Honeydukes, fans can immerse themselves in magic that has been lifted from the series. ""Rowling's books are so rich in detail, taking a pilgrimage like this was like looking directly into her imagination,"" Vaccarino says. ""I think I scared nearby small children with my level of excitement. It was like stepping into one of the books, which is any fan's dream come true."" For many nerds, a pilgrimage goes beyond simple sightseeing and becomes a rite of passage. Most of the readers who shared stories of their nerdy pilgrimages with CNN.com felt their experiences cemented their love for their respective passions. The object of iReporter Daniel Fandino's veneration is tucked away in Mitaka, Japan. Designed by legendary anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, renowned for movies like ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" the whimsical Ghibli Museum is the perfect place to see Miyazaki's animations come to life. With a playful interior, the museum houses detailed models, artful storyboards and several exhibits that invite Ghibli admirers to pause and savor. ""The experience was very meaningful because it was a chance to see the behind-the-scenes and creative process of a major animation studio whose work I have so admired,"" Fandino says. ""To have visited the museum felt like reaching a certain pinnacle as a fan and I felt extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to do so."" It's these pinnacle experiences that become the driving force behind a pilgrimage, but each full-hearted adventurer has a unique motivation for wanting to take one. If you're a literary nerd like Teresa Fields, not only do you fall in love with imagined characters who sit on your bookshelf, but you also fall in love with the minds that have penned them to life. ""You realize that it wasn't the characters that so captivated your thoughts, but rather, it was the author who created them who you were in love with all along,"" Fields said in a CNN iReport. Wanting to explore the world of English novelist Jane Austen, Fields set off from her home in Virginia to the charming Hampshire countryside -- the place of inspiration for stories that would become timeless novels like ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."" Austen fans can take a stroll through the 17th-century cottage, now a museum, where the author spent the last eight years of her life in the village of Chawton. ""You get a clearer picture of how she lived and how she might have formed her characterizations by the way her environment shaped her,"" Fields said. ""I couldn't believe that I was actually walking in the footsteps of history. Sometimes I had to stop and say to myself, 'Jane Austen actually walked this path.'"" Undertaking a pilgrimage may not be for everyone, but it certainly offers enthusiasts the opportunity to not just imagine how things may be, but to see things as they really are. For a Whovian like Tim Hampson, what better place to come face-to-face with the ""Doctor Who"" universe than The Doctor Who Experience, an interactive journey that takes fans behind-the-scenes of the iconic show. On Cardiff Bay in Cardiff, Wales, the attraction showcases sets and an incredible collection of artifacts and costumes that span the 50-year history of ""Doctor Who."" ""I've been a 'Doctor Who' fan since childhood, so approximately 40 years. Seeing all the sights was astounding,"" he says. ""It was a fantastic day. Not only the exhibition, but also getting the chance to visit many of the external filming locations in the area."" Though gaining a deeper connection to the show was a rewarding experience for Hampson, he said going with a worthy companion, his son, made for a more meaningful one. ""My son is 9 years old and a huge fan of the latest regeneration of the Doctor,"" he said. ""Getting to share a visit with him to many of the props, costumes and sets made this an unforgettable experience."" The beauty of these trips is in memories that last long after the experience. The journey is almost always so brimming with heartfelt emotion and zeal that it resists being reduced to a typical set of vacation snapshots. And there's certainly nothing typical about finding yourself at the doorstep of a Hobbit-hole home. With countless ""Lord of the Rings"" tours available, New Zealand has quickly become a place of pilgrimage for ""Lord of the Rings"" fanatics. Drawing new energy with the release of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" in December, Tolkienites are flocking to spectacular locations like Matamata, where Peter Jackson filmed his Academy-Award winning trilogy. ""Now I can say that I have seen Middle-earth,"" said iReporter Jerry C. Gonzales, who took a Hobbiton movie set tour  to see the stunning fantasyland for himself. ""I never stopped taking shots from every angle of the place. It was an amazing experience,"" he said. ""It was more than what I expected because our tour guide even told us some secrets on how Peter Jackson filmed the movies."" As most nerds know, being homesick for a place you've never been to is not an unfamiliar feeling. In fact, it's that longing that breathes life into a pilgrimage. In the book ""The Hobbit,"" J.R.R Tolkien writes about Bilbo: ""Then something Tookish woke up inside him and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick."" Perhaps there's a Tookish wanderlust that begs to be awakened in us all.","Fictional characters inspire real-life travels for many fans .

"(CNN) -- In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lance Armstrong has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs while cycling. He's already been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and this week had to give back his Olympic bronze medal. But he still must face judgment from a different group of fans: those who have personal experience with cancer. Armstrong, founder of the cancer charity Livestrong and a survivor of testicular cancer, is still a hero to some cancer survivors. But others express a mix of emotions and are trying to distance their support of his cancer efforts from their anger about his cheating. What did you think of the interview? Bob Denton, 64, of Tucson, Arizona, said he was surprised that the disgraced cyclist appeared, in his view, ""honest but insincere"" in his apology in the interview, as if ""whatever he was admitting was for his own benefit."" But Denton doesn't hold that, or the doping, against Armstrong. In Denton's mind, Armstrong is still a winner. ""Really, compared to the life and death issues of cancer that Lance has embraced, cheating in the Tour is small potatoes,"" Denton said in an e-mail. Denton, who cycles as a hobby, has worn a Livestrong wristband every day since 2004, even at business meetings. He sent an iReport to CNN.com about it, too. He had known Armstrong only in the context of cycling before getting a wristband at a 100-mile bike ride in Florida, which prompted him to research Armstrong's battle with cancer. At that time, he saw the wristband as a symbol of ""Lance's total victory over adversity."" ""When I would be exhausted trying to keep up with the pace line, I'd look down at that yellow band and get my second wind,"" Denton said. The wristband took on a different meaning when Denton developed a cancerous tumor at the base of his tongue in 2009. Then, the wristband became an inspiration for him to overcome the illness. ""Every time the treatments became intolerable, and I felt like my life was over, I'd see that yellow band and it gave me hope that I too would be back on my bike,"" Denton said. Denton's last treatment was in September 2009, and he has been in remission ever since. These days, he still cycles about 2,000 miles a year. Armstrong's cheating in cycling also hasn't tarnished his image as a source of inspiration for Amy Wadsworth, who found out she had breast cancer at age 29. She feels grateful for all that Armstrong has done for the cancer community, and appreciates that Livestrong had offered to help her pay for egg preservation because cancer and treatment for it could have impaired her fertility. (She ended up not doing the preservation, but is glad she had the option.) ""I think we should accept his apology and move (on) because what he has done to help people with cancer definitely out weighs the 'bad.' He didn't give up when he was (stared) in the face with cancer,"" Wadsworth said of Armstrong. ""He kept going and encouraged many other survivors to the same."" Breast cancer awareness: Not so pretty pink . Other cancer survivors, however, aren't so quick to forgive. Caden Brody, 49, a two-time cancer survivor who also lost his brother to leukemia, said in an e-mail that he does not believe Armstrong is ""an evil man,"" but in a comment on a recent CNN.com story he harshly criticized Armstrong's behavior: . ""We cannot deny he raised a lot of awareness and money for cancer. As a survivor I commend that,"" Brody wrote. ""Unfortunately, he undid everything, in many ways, by his sociopathic need to bully, win, play mind games, and he used cancer as a cloak to cover his sins. If he'd confessed ages ago in true remorse? We're a pretty forgiving people. But this is a forced, 'I still want to compete in something so I better apologize' thing."" CNN.com user ""jackiero"" had an even more scathing view of Armstrong, posted in the comments on a recent story: . ""As an avid cyclist and a cancer survivor who used cycling to aid in my recovery, I am disgusted by this man,"" jackiero wrote. ""I threw away all my (Livestrong) gear not because I don't support the cure -- of course I do -- but because I support the cure without the taint of a cheater like Armstrong. He was an inspiration until I learned that he was just like all the other chemically induced sports stars who rake in millions and millions."" Livestrong likely to survive Armstrong doping admission . Bruce Ross, 64, of Ajijic, Mexico, near Guadalajara, is also dealing with his mixed feelings about Livestrong and Armstrong. Ross has worn his two Livestrong bracelets, one for each time he had cancer, every day since his second surgery in 2006. He gives Livestrong cancer guidebooks to patients he meets who have been newly diagnosed, but has separated his feelings about the foundation from Armstrong. ""When people ask me about Lance, I try to leave him out of the conversation if I can discuss Livestrong in the answer,"" he said in an e-mail. ""For me, the last year has been all about the foundation."" Armstrong's actions have also changed the way some family members of cancer survivors view him. Susan Moberg Hopkins of Seattle, who submitted an iReport about her family, still supports Livestrong, but has a cynical view toward Armstrong. Hopkins' family contacted Livestrong after her late husband, Marty, found out he had a brain tumor, and she said the staff there was very responsive. Marty was a big fan of Armstrong, and the Hopkins used the cyclist as a way of explaining to her children, who were 12 and 17, that it's possible to recover from cancer and accomplish many things. ""You look for role models, you look for people that help get you through things, and I would say Lance did that,"" she said Friday. Armstrong is less of a role model now, she said, because he lied about what he did to get ahead in cycling. The Livestrong bracelets, she believes, are ""tainted"" by Armstrong. He affected people ""in a way that is far more significant than a bike race,"" she said. ""It's about life and death. I don't know if he will ever be able to say he's really sorry."" CNN's Henry Hanks and Nicole Saidi contributed to this report.","Lance Armstrong is still an inspiration for some cancer survivors .

"(CNN) -- TV's newest crime thriller, ""The Bridge,"" is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news: The U.S.-Mexican border. FX goes beyond the headlines with a series that aims to give a new twist to the serial killer storyline by setting it against the backdrop of a tumultuous border town. Named after the Bridge of the Americas that connects El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the show explores the real-world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the United States and one from Mexico -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides. The series is an adaptation of a Scandinavian drama called ""Bron,"" and is brought to life for the American audience by creators Meredith Stiehm (""ER,"" and ""Cold Case"") and Elwood Reid (""Cold Case"" and ""Hawaii 5-0""). Like ""Bron,"" ""The Bridge's"" pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations. This time, however, the murder involves an American judge with anti-immigrant ties. El Paso detective Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger) and Chihuahua state police detective Marco Ruiz (Demian Bichir) form an unlikely pair of agents whose investigation and relationship examines the hot topic of immigration while shedding light on the varying cultural experiences of both border towns. The series also addresses the powerful drug cartels and rampant corruption plaguing Mexican police. Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film ""Miss Bala,"" directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions. For example, the series embraces dialect as an important component of the story. Much like the real-life fluidity of language alongside the border, ""The Bridge"" incorporates Spanish when set in Ciudad Juarez and adds English subtitles. There is even the occasional use of a mix of both languages (aka Spanglish). Aside from being a Mexican national, Naranjo brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director's chair. He spent close to three years interviewing criminals and researching the conflict in preparation for 2011's ""Miss Bala."" ""We tried to be as honest as possible,"" Naranjo said. ""It is not about making Mexico look good or bad, it is about what is the truth. Many people who are ignorant of Mexican issues are going to learn about certain realities through our show."" At the New Generation Latino Consortium Media, Marketing and Entertainment Conference (NGLC) in early June, Bichir echoed the sentiment. ""I had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real,"" he said. The show's premiere coincides with a real event currently brewing in Washington. With the passage of a bill in the U.S. Senate earlier in the month that aims to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, the immigration debate re-entered the public discourse. Crucial to the passage of the bill was an amendment to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more border agents and 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico. ""The Bridge's"" setting alongside the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world. Given this political relevancy and the Latino undertones of the drama, FX took the opportunity to launch a hyper-targeted campaign in an effort to cater to the 48 million TV viewers Nielsen says identify as Latinos. ""When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience,"" Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN. ""We understand that the Hispanic market is huge, represented by many cultures and nations of origin. We did our best to utilize materials that spoke in a relevant way to that audience."" Naranjo hopes that ""The Bridge's"" ability to cross multiple borders of language and culture will help spark a national debate about not only the U.S.-Mexican border, but the commonalities shared between the characters -- regardless of their cultural background. 'The Bridge' is a great bet,"" Naranjo said to CNN. ""I hope that this show can begin a good type of controversy and a good conversation.""

"(CNN) -- The family of a Mississippi mayoral candidate claimed Sunday that he died after being ""beaten, dragged and burned,"" but it's an account a medical examiner disputed, saying ""I don't know where that is coming from."" On Wednesday, authorities found Marco McMillian's body near a levee between Sherard and Rena Lara, two unincorporated communities about 15 minutes from Clarksdale. The 34-year-old McMillian had been running for mayor of Clarksdale, a city of about 18,000 people in northwestern Mississippi's Delta region. His body was ""set afire,"" according to his family, who said they twice met with a coroner. Coahoma County Medical Examiner Scotty Meredith told CNN that there were ""signs of an altercation,"" but that didn't kill him. ""Beating is not the cause of death,"" said Meredith, who confirmed he'd met twice with McMillian's family. ""He was beaten, but not badly."" The medical examiner added he didn't know how the family came to the conclusion that McMillian was dragged and burned. The late politician's family, in the statement released through his former campaign manager Jarod Keith, called for ""a full and thorough investigation."" They said McMillian had told ""family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety."" ""We feel that this was not a random act of violence, based on the condition of the body when it was found,"" they said. ""Marco, nor anyone, should have their lives end in this manner."" Yet Meredith insisted ""this was not a targeted attack."" ""No way,"" the medical examiner said. ""This was more of a personal dispute."" The Coahoma County Sheriff's Office announced on Thursday that a suspect, Lawrence Reed, faces a murder charge in the death. Reed, 22, was found in McMillian's wrecked SUV on Tuesday morning and was taken to a hospital. McMillian's Facebook page shows a glimpse at a man who was politically ambitious. It includes a picture of McMillian posing with President Barack Obama. His campaign motto: ""Moving Clarksdale forward."" McMillian's short biography on Facebook said he had spent much of his career raising money for universities after he graduated from Jackson State with a degree in elementary education. He also received a master's in philanthropy and development from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota. In 2004, Ebony magazine recognized him as one of the country's top leaders younger than 30. He received the Thurgood Marshall Prestige Award from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund five years later. And from 2007 to 2011, McMillian was executive director of his fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, which after his death recalled how he'd ""made an incredible difference in his community."" He secured the first federal contract to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS among African-Americans for the fraternity and helped it form partnerships with organizations such as the U.S. Marine Corps and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in discussing the disease. Patricia McMillian said that even though media reports since her son's death have labeled him as openly gay, his death likely had nothing to do with his sexual orientation. Without offering specifics, the family said Sunday that it hoped to share information from the ongoing investigation in order ""to dispel speculations surrounding his death.""

"(CNN) -- The royal baby is about to debut. Here are some facts about other bundles of wonder who join this world. • UNICEF estimates that at least 130 million babies are born each year, with some reports in the past 10 years putting that figure at 136 million. But it's difficult to know exactly how many babies are born globally, the World Health Organization notes, because some children are not registered. • Will and Catherine's little one will become part of an increasing number of children born in the United Kingdom. There were 594,634 births in 2001 and 723,913 in 2011, according the Office for National Statistics. • There were 3,999,386 babies born in the United States in 2010, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Census reports that there's one birth every 8 seconds. The U.S. birthrate dropped to the lowest number ever recorded in 2011, including a major dip in births to immigrant women, Pew Research Center said. • U.S. state laws require birth certificates to be completed for all births, and federal law mandates national collection and publication of births and other vital statistics data. All births in England, Wales and Northern Ireland must be registered within 42 days of a child's birth. • Each year, some 15 million babies in the world -- more than one in 10 births -- are born preterm and at least a million of those children die, according to a May 2012 report compiled by the March of Dimes Foundation, Save the Children, The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health, and the WHO. Experts representing 40 of the United Nations said that inexpensive treatment and prevention methods are available. • It's not just low income countries that have high numbers of preterm babies, the report states. Brazil and the United States rank among the top. One in nine U.S. births is preterm. India, China and Pakistan are also on the list; the United Kingdom is not. • The average life expectancy of a U.S.-born child is 78.7 years. Globally, the average life expectancy for current newborns is about 70, according to the World Health Organization. In low income countries the average life expectancy, WHO says, hovers around 60. • In 2012, Jacob and Sophia topped baby name choices in the United States, followed by Mason and Emma. Baby-naming website Nameberry, which claims to have a 50,000 name database, said some parents are going the less traditional route with Imogen for girls and Asher for boys. The site names several stand-out international baby names, including Aziza, Cai and Eluned. In England and Wales, Harry and Amelia were tops in 2011. • The WHO reports that every day approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Nearly all of those maternal deaths happen in developing countries, as mothers face a higher risk in rural and poor communities. • But, there's good news. Between 1990 and 2010, the WHO found, maternal mortality worldwide dropped by nearly 50%. For example, a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa significantly reduced their levels of maternal mortality between 1990 and 2010. But more than half of the world's maternal deaths happen in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one-third occur in South Asia, the organization found.","The royal couple are adding to a steady increase in babies born in the United Kingdom .

"(CNN) -- In a sense, Fred Schuster has a permanent reminder of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong etched into his skin. But to the 48-year-old New Jersey resident, the Livestrong Foundation bracelet tattooed on his wrist isn't about Armstrong or his long-awaited admission to doping as a professional cyclist. It's a symbol of his father's struggle with cancer and the bond they shared, Schuster said. Moreover, any time he's tempted to pick up a cigarette, the recovering smoker is reminded of why he stopped in the first place. ""My decision to get the tattoo had absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Armstrong, and subsequently, these revelations do nothing to diminish the meaning it has for me. The tattoo was and will always be a symbol of the love that my father and I shared,"" Schuster said in a CNN iReport. ""The effect he had on the foundation was huge, but they both should be able to stand on their own. The foundation should not be held accountable for his deception."" Armstrong admitted this week in an interview with talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he used an array of performance-enhancing drugs to win seven Tour de France titles. He had denied the drug use for years, often angrily. The first of the two-part interview aired Thursday night. Others who have worn the yellow bracelet or supported the cancer charity that Armstrong started in 1997 say Livestrong is now bigger than him. As long as people like Schuster continue to view Livestrong as an entity separate from its fallen founder, the cancer charity will likely withstand whatever controversy befalls Armstrong, charity experts said. Opinion: A loss for Lance, a win for Oprah . ""The organization has done a lot to separate itself from Lance's image over the years. As a result, many people identify it as a cancer organization, which is why it's not already crumbling,"" said Stacy Palmer, editor of the The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a Washington-based news source for the nonprofit world. After all, this isn't the first time Armstrong has been mired in controversy in the past decade, and Livestrong is still around. Since 2004, when doping allegations against Armstrong first came to light in a book by French sports journalist Pierre Ballester, the foundation has experienced steady year-to-year revenue growth, according to financial records, with the exception of a dip from 2005 to 2006, the year Armstrong was cleared of allegations stemming from a 1999 drug test. Many nonprofits look up to Livestrong as a success model, especially for its social media campaigns, thanks in part to Armstrong's hands-off leadership, Palmer said. He hired a staff of experienced fundraisers with a history of running charities and nonprofits, which can be unusual among celebrity-driven charities, she said. ""He's allowed them to go ahead without micromanaging, which some celebrities have a hard time doing,"" she said. ""For foundations started by one person, It can be hard to get past the celebrity because that's how they've gotten so big."" Livestrong has also built alliances with other organizations to fundraise and raise awareness around positive messaging, she said, which also makes it stand out from other cancer charities. In other words, If Livestrong was going to crumble under the mountain of scandals and deception now synonymous with Armstrong, it probably would have happened by now. That doesn't mean the foundation won't face some fallout, but its overall future probably won't hinge on Armstrong, she said. His decision to step down as chairman and leave the board has helped distance Livestrong from the controversy and give the impression that the foundation is charting an independent course, Palmer said. ""It was one thing when there were a few weeks between him stepping down as chair but still remaining on the board that were questionable,"" she said. ""But now that he's not on the board, it shows that (the board) is trying to become a new generation of the organization."" Livestrong has indicated this would be part of its strategy going forward, regardless of what Armstrong revealed to Winfrey. Armstrong's doping drugs . ""... We are charting a strong, independent course forward that is focused on helping people overcome financial, emotional and physical challenges related to cancer,"" the Austin, Texas-based foundation said Thursday. ""Inspired by the people with cancer whom we serve, we feel confident and optimistic about the foundation's future and welcome an end to speculation."" That's not to say the situation hasn't provoked a crisis of faith among many Livestrong supporters, especially those who were inspired by Armstrong's accomplishments as a cyclist and cancer survivor. Evan Andrew Del Colle Jr. admired Armstrong and everything he stood for, especially after reading his books, and started wearing the bracelets as soon as they came out in 2004. The Livestrong slogan resonated with him after his grandfather and aunt died from cancer, and he decided to get a Livestrong tattoo when he was 20 because he couldn't wear the yellow bracelets while playing college sports. ""Livestrong represents being able to conquer even the toughest of obstacles, including cancer,"" he said. Now, after all that has come out, the tattoo embarrasses him and he is torn over what to do. ""I still support the Livestrong cause and I am still in awe of what Lance Armstrong was able to do, doping or not, but both the foundation and Lance are now tainted,"" he said in a CNN iReport. ""It is incredible that he won seven Tours, but he cheated. It's plain and simple. And the fact that after all the cancer he suffered from he would do unnatural things that could harm his body is just something I can't fathom."" Why people cheat . Before he got his tattoo, Schuster started wearing the yellow bracelet in 2004 in an effort to scare himself out of smoking. Then, his father received an abrupt diagnosis of stomach cancer in 2005. Schuster gave him his bracelet when he went into the hospital for surgery related to his stomach cancer. He never left. The day his father died in 2005, Schuster held his hand and slipped the yellow Livestrong bracelet off his wrist and onto his. When the bracelet wore out a year later, he got it tattooed onto his wrist. The tattoo artist didn't think yellow would wear well and made it red instead, Schuster said, so people don't immediately recognize it. He has no plans to get rid of it, given all that it means to him. As for his father, he had a dry sense of humor, he said. ""I would like to think he's chuckling somewhere and smiling about the whole situation."" Follow Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .

"Washington (CNN) -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday she is resigning and will be nominated to become president of the University of California system. In an e-mail to associates, Napolitano said she will leave the Department of Homeland Security in September. While her nomination must be approved by the university's board of regents at a meeting next week, Napolitano sounded confident of the outcome. ""Departing a job and community you love is never easy, but I am passionate about educating the next generation of leaders and the University of California is like no other institution in affording such an opportunity,"" her e-mail said. She graduated from the University of Santa Clara in California in 1979 as its first female valedictorian. Napolitano, 55, was confirmed as the nation's third homeland security secretary and the first woman to hold the post the day after President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Janet Napolitano: Fast Facts . In an earlier statement on Friday, she called working with homeland security personnel who protect the nation ""the highlight of my professional career."" Obama thanked Napolitano for what he called outstanding work in dealing with ""some of the toughest challenges facing our country."" He cited her leadership in recovery efforts from natural disasters like Superstorm Sandy, dealing with the volatile immigration issue and protecting the nation against terrorist attacks. ""I've come to rely on Janet's judgment and advice, but I've also come to value her friendship,"" Obama said, wishing her luck ""as she begins a new chapter in a remarkable career of public service."" A breast cancer survivor, Napolitano was attorney general and then governor of Arizona before joining Obama's Cabinet. As head of the vast department involved in all aspects of national security including anti-terrorism efforts, Napolitano was involved in some of the most high-profile moments of Obama's first term. She was criticized for defending screening efforts after the 2009 attempted terrorist attack in which a man on a flight from Europe failed to ignite explosives in his underwear. During her tenure, the administration deported record numbers of undocumented immigrants. However, GOP critics complained Napolitano ignored the law by halting deportations of some young immigrants living illegally in the United States as part of administration reforms of the broken immigration system. Some officials at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency complained that the policy change forced agents to violate laws. Conservative Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said Napolitano's tenure ""was defined by a consistent disrespect for the rule of law."" ""Any selection -- interim or permanent -- to replace Secretary Napolitano must disavow these aggressive non-enforcement directives or there is very little hope for successful immigration reform,"" Sessions said in a statement. Other legislators called for Obama to swiftly name a replacement. Names previously mentioned as possible successors include New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and retired U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the service's former commandant. The Homeland Security Department was created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge was the first secretary, followed by Michael Chertoff, both during the administration of GOP President George W. Bush. In a statement Friday, Kelly and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised Napolitano for prioritizing federal funding for the city's anti-terrorism programs during an era of budget austerity. ""Secretary Napolitano never lost sight of the fact that New York City was on the top of the terrorist target list and acted accordingly in funding important initiatives,"" Kelly's statement said. ""She performed a great public service not only for New York City but for the nation at large."" At the University of California, Napolitano will lead a system with more than 234,000 students at 10 campuses, five medical centers and three affiliated national laboratories. Sherry Lansing, the former film studio executive who headed the search committee, said Napolitano received unanimous support from the nominating panel. ""While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time"" to lead the university, Lansing said in a statement. ""She will stand as a vigorous advocate for faculty, students and staff at a time when great changes in our state, and across the globe, are presenting as many opportunities as challenges.""

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney stated Monday that President Barack Obama ""has not signed one new free-trade agreement in the past four years."" ""I'll reverse that failure,"" the Republican presidential nominee said. But is his assertion true? The facts: . While he angered his allies in organized labor, Obama secured congressional approval of free-trade deals with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, and signed them in October 2011. The term ""new"" in Romney's remarks concerning trade deals appears to be a reference to the fact that work on the three separate trade agreements began in 2007, when George W. Bush was president. But it was Obama who re-negotiated the passage of the three deals with a Congress that has been identified more for its legislative gridlock, than its passage of such deals. Fact Check: Was Obama 'silent' on Iran 2009 protests? ""It takes a lot of capital to get trade deals through Congress, and it's particularly tough to do when the economy is weak,"" said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at Peterson Institute for International Economics. In a rare moment of bipartisanship in Washington, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, issued a statement on the day Obama signed the agreement saying ""years of perseverance have been rewarded today as American job creators will have new opportunities to expand and hire as they access new markets abroad."" Obama re-negotiated aspects of the deal with South Korea to secure additional market access for U.S. auto manufacturers. He also added language into the deal with Colombia to protect the rights of Colombian workers, and addressed concerns with tax transparency in Panama. Speaking with reporters Monday aboard Air Force One as the president traveled to California, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign challenged Romney's assertion that Obama had not signed a ""new"" free-trade agreement. ""That is not only absurd, it's inaccurate,"" said Jen Psaki, traveling press secretary for the Obama campaign. ""He's basing it on an absurd premise that President Bush signed a couple of trade agreements, but the fact remains that the president renegotiated the trade agreements -- made them better for American workers, made them better for the American auto industry and the American meat industry -- and that's why we not only got them through Congress, but the president actually signed them into law."" Fact Check: Did Obama say he wants 'daylight' between U.S., Israel? In addition to the three trade agreements, Obama has continued the Bush administration's effort to form a trans-Pacific free-trade zone, which would include up to 11 economies across the Asia-Pacific region. The fourteenth round of negotiations for the proposed zone took place last month in Leesburg, Virginia, with another round scheduled to take place in New Zealand in December. The administration has said its goal in continuing the negotiations is to support the creation of jobs in the United States, and an increase in exports to a region that represents more than 40% of global trade. The Obama administration is also exploring the possibility of free-trade talks with the 27-nation European Union. A decision on whether to launch such negotiations is expected soon. An economist who follows trade policy, though, says that pursuing free-trade deals does not appear to be a top priority of the Obama administration. Administration officials are ""not very enthusiastic"" about negotiating new free-trade agreements in the current political environment, according to Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. Fact Check: Romney's comparison of past, present Navy pointless . With the expiration of fast-track trade negotiation authority in 2007, any agreement started by the administration would go through an amendments process, as opposed to a straight up-or-down vote in the Senate. In the absence of fast-track authority, no country would put their best offers forward in negotiations with the executive branch if that would only be amended as it traveled through both houses of Congress, said Bosworth. ""Neither side trusts the other when it comes to trade"" in today's polarized political environment, so movement is not likely as long as the executive and legislative branches are controlled by different parties, added Bosworth. Conclusion: . While President Obama continued trade agreements begun under the previous administration, it is not accurate to assert that Obama has not signed any free trade agreements when, in fact, he has done so with South Korea, Panama and Colombia.

"(CNN) -- Removing the wrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia from the coastal waters off an Italian island will begin in May and take about a year, the ship's owner said. ""Once returned to a floating state, the wreck will be towed to an Italian port,"" Costa Cruises said in a news release. A decision on what to do with the ship after it has been towed will be up to Italian authorities, according to Pier Luigi Foschi, chairman of Costa Cruises. U.S.-based Titan Salvage of Florida and Micoperi, an Italy-based salvage, have been selected to recover and tow away the Concordia, Costa said. The announcement Saturday by Costa follows news that the bodies of all but two of the 32 people presumed dead in the wreck have been recovered. The cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side January 13 off the Italian island of Giglio. Recovery teams spent weeks searching the submerged decks and cabins for those who failed to escape the sinking vessel. The liner, owned by Genoa-based Costa Cruises, was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it struck the rocks. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, remains under house arrest while he is investigated for possible criminal charges. He faces possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat, a prosecutor said last month. A portion of Giglio's coastal waters is designated as a protected marine habitat. Schettino's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm Costa in Genoa are under investigation over allegations including manslaughter, shipwreck and failure to report the accident, the prosecutor said. To date, no one has been charged. Schettino previously said managers of the Costa cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He has said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Salvage companies from the U.S. and Italy will begin work next month .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Mississippi are being tight-lipped about the death of a mayoral candidate and the arrest of a man found alone in the candidate's damaged SUV. On Thursday, the Coahoma County Sheriff's Office announced that a suspect, Lawrence Reed, faces a murder charge in the death of Marco McMillian. Reed, 22, was found in McMillian's wrecked SUV on Tuesday morning and was taken to a hospital. He is in good condition, the Sheriff's Office said Thursday. On Wednesday, authorities found McMillian's body near a levee between Sherard and Rena Lara, two unincorporated communities about 15 minutes away from Clarksdale in northwestern Mississippi's Delta region. Officials have yet to comment on why or how McMillian was killed. ""It's too early in the investigation to know what the motive is,"" Sheriff's Office spokesman Will Rooker said of McMillian's death. McMillian's body was taken to the capital, Jackson, for an autopsy. Patricia McMillian said that even though media reports since her son's death have labeled him as openly gay, his death likely had nothing to do with his sexual orientation. She told CNN that her son had told only family and friends that he was gay. ""He did not announce in public that he was gay,"" she said, adding, ""I don't think he was attacked because he was gay."" She said that she didn't know Reed. ""We never heard of him,"" said Amos Unger, Marco McMillian's stepfather. McMillian's Facebook page shows a glimpse at a man who was politically ambitious. It includes a picture of McMillian posing with President Barack Obama. His campaign motto: ""Moving Clarksdale forward."" McMillian's short biography on Facebook said he had spent much of his career raising money for universities after he graduated from Jackson State with a degree in elementary education. He also received a master's in philanthropy and development from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota. Condolences flooded the page, including one from a man who wrote that McMillian, 34, was one of Clarksdale's best leaders. ""The shocking news of Marco's death is beyond difficult for us to process,"" his campaign team posted Thursday. ""We remember Marco as a bold and passionate public servant, whose faith informed every aspect of his life."" Bill Luckett, who like McMillian was running for mayor as a Democrat, said he thought the politician was ""cordial and articulate."" ""It's a bizarre situation,"" Luckett said. ""A sad story."" McMillian picked up a host of awards in recent years. In 2009, he received the Thurgood Marshall Prestige Award from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. In 2004, Ebony magazine recognized him as one of the country's top leaders younger than 30. His fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma, released a lengthy note about McMillian's accomplishments Thursday. McMillian ""made an incredible difference in his community"" it read, adding that he was the executive director of the fraternity from 2007 to 2011. McMillian secured the first federal contract to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS among African-Americans for the fraternity and helped it form partnerships with organizations such as the U.S. Marine Corps and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in discussing the disease.

"(CNN) -- The court of public opinion weighed in decidedly against Lance Armstrong, even before the broadcast of an interview in which he is said to acknowledge using performance-enhancing drugs after years of denials. On CNN's Facebook page, the opinions were passionate and pointed. ""This guy is a loser and a liar!!"" Melinda Morgan said. ""He is not sorry for what he did, he is sorry that he got caught!!"" Margaret Midkiff said there's no hope of Armstrong reviving his career. ""He's lied to folks way too long."" For more than a decade, Armstrong has denied he used performance-enhancing drugs, but he was linked to a doping scandal by nearly a dozen other former cyclists who have admitted to doping. But Oprah Winfrey appeared to confirm Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning"" that Armstrong acknowledges having used performance-enhancing drugs in the interview which will air across two nights. After CBS, like other media, reported that Armstrong admitted using banned substances, Winfrey said she was surprised to see that not long after the interview, news of what he said had ""already been confirmed."" Winfrey did not describe Armstrong's statements in detail, and has not released clips or quotes. She said the former cyclist was forthcoming in an exhausting and intense interview taped in Armstrong's hometown of Austin, Texas. ""We were mesmerized and riveted by some of his answers,"" she said, adding that ""he did not come clean in the manner that I expected."" She didn't elaborate. Some media outlets have reported that Armstrong has been strongly considering the possibility of a confession, possibly as a way to stem the tide of fleeing sponsors and as part of a long-term comeback plan. Cycling fan and CNN iReporter Beverlee Ring said she has ""mixed feelings"" about the Winfrey interview. He should apologize and do whatever it takes to begin the healing,"" she said. ""Now is when the real work begins for Lance."" But Gretta Michellé said it's too late for redemption. ""He had the opportunity to be honest from the beginning and he should have,"" she posted on the Facebook page. ""Winning was more important."" Sources: Armstrong says he used steroids . Armstrong's admission is a sharp about-face after more than a decade of vehemently denying he cheated en route to winning a record seven Tour de France titles. Cycling's international governing body, the UCI, stripped the titles from Armstrong following a report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that found widespread evidence of Armstrong's involvement in a sophisticated doping program. The interview will air over two nights, beginning at 9 p.m. ET Thursday on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Winfrey has promised a ""no-holds-barred"" interview, with no conditions and no payment made to Armstrong. Read more: Oprah interview with Lance Armstrong airs January 17 . ""I hope the ratings are (a) record low on that show,"" Matthew Black said in a Facebook comment. Winfrey declined to characterize Armstrong's statements, saying she preferred that viewers make up their own minds. She said the interview was at times emotional and surprisingly intense. ""I would say that he met the moment,"" she said. Word that Armstrong may have allowed some emotion to show through didn't seem to soften many critics. ""Go ahead and cry, Lance ... it won't help you one bit,"" Lori Polacek said. You ""blew it a long time ago!"" Cancer charity: The trump card? Some were willing to cut Armstrong a break because of his long-running cancer charity: the Livestrong Foundation. ""Who cares?"" said Pedro Murillo. ""He raised so much for cancer research, that's more important (than) if he doped for some races."" Armstrong's demise: How an all-American hero fell to earth . David Flowe said he doesn't care if Armstrong was involved in doping or if he even confesses to it. ""The man is an inspiration for those battling cancer,"" he said. ""Quit being so judgmental of others especially someone who has done so much good for the world!"" Armstrong, 41, has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour de France from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. Before the interview with Winfrey, the disgraced cycling legend apologized to the staff of his cancer charity, a publicist for Livestrong Foundation said. Armstrong was tearful during the 15-minute meeting and didn't address the issue of steroid use in cycling, said Rae Bazzarre, director of communications for the foundation. Bazzarre added that Armstrong offered to the staff a ""sincere and heartfelt apology for the stress they've endured because of him."" He urged them to keep working hard to help cancer survivors and their families. Armstrong in talks to return Postal Service money . Banned for life . The USADA hit Armstrong with a lifetime ban after the agency issued a 202-page report in October that said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program. The report detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions. The USADA said it had tested Armstrong fewer than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. ""Show one failed test, just one,"" Ron Berg said, challenging the wave of public opinion against Armstrong. ""You can't, because he passed them all. ... They hate him for his success and tried to fail him, they could not."" The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided them altogether. Kurtz: Can even Oprah save Lance Armstrong?

"Rome (CNN) -- Salvage experts outlined their plan Friday to raise the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner from the sea floor off Italy in one piece and tow it from the disaster site. The complicated operation is expected to start in the next few days and take up to a year, the ship's owner, Costa Cruises, said in Rome. It will be a joint effort by Titan Salvage, an American-owned specialist marine salvage and wreck removal company, and Italian marine contractor Micoperi. Capt. Richard Habib, president of Titan Salvage, said it was an ""unprecedented"" operation. ""It is not impossible. It is entirely possible. It will be successful, and we believe that our plan will work,"" he said when asked whether there was a backup plan. At least 30 people died when the cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Costa Cruises announces new safety initiatives . The search for two people who remain missing will continue alongside the removal operation, said Franco Gabrielli, head of the Italian Civil Protection agency. The 30 bodies recovered have all been identified. The ship cannot stay in its current position, as it represents a danger for the environment, he added. ""The plan to re-float the hull in one piece gives top priority to minimising environmental impact, to protecting Giglio's economy and tourism industry, and to maximum safety of the work,"" Costa Cruises said in a statement. ""Once removal is complete, the sea bottom will be cleaned and marine flora replanted."" The operation will be divided into four basic stages, Costa said in its statement. First, once the ship has been stabilized, an underwater platform will be built and watertight boxes, or caissons, fixed to the side of the ship that is above water. Two cranes fixed to the platform will pull the ship upright, helped by the weight of the caissons, which will be filled with water. When the ship is upright, caissons will be fixed to the other side of the hull to stabilize it. Finally, the caissons on both sides will be emptied, after the water inside has been purified to protect the marine environment, and filled with air, Costa said. Once the giant ship has been refloated, it will be towed to an Italian port, probably in Tuscany, to be dismantled and disposed of according to local regulations. No exact cost was given by the officials who presented details of the recovery operation. But a Costa Cruises representative said that the figure would probably be about $300 million. Costa said efforts to prevent damage to Giglio's tourism industry would include housing workers involved in the recovery operation on the mainland. Equipment will also be stored there. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, is being investigated for possible criminal charges and remains under house arrest. He faces allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat, a prosecutor said this year. Giglio is a protected park. Schettino's first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm Costa in Genoa are under investigation over allegations including manslaughter, shipwreck and failure to report the accident, the prosecutor in the case has said.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's highest court ruled Tuesday that the captain of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship must remain under house arrest while he is investigated for possible criminal charges. Prosecutors wanted Capt. Francesco Schettino to be held behind bars while the investigation continues, but his lawyers had argued he should be given his freedom. At least 30 people died when the giant cruise liner struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Italy's Supreme Court, known as the Court of Cassation, met Tuesday morning in Rome to consider Schettino's house arrest at a hearing closed to the media. The five-judge panel's ruling was delivered Tuesday evening. Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement ahead of the ruling that his client had ""full trust and respect in the judges and that he awaits the Supreme Court's decision with serenity."" The court was also expected to rule on the admissibility of the captain's phone intercepts at the police station following his detention right after the shipwreck.

"Washington (CNN) -- Survivors of the Costa Concordia cruise ship accident off the coast of Italy recounted in riveting testimony before Congress on Wednesday that they feared for their lives after the ship hit a reef last month. ""We were at our dinner table on Deck 3 and were in the process of ordering our food, and we had just ordered our appetizers,"" said Divya Sharma, who was celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary with her husband on the ship. ""At that moment, there was a violent shaking of the ship, followed by loud crash noises as the plates and glasses broke due to the listing of the ship towards the starboard side. Lights went out immediately, but there was no announcement as to what had happened. It was pitch dark with no visibility. Everyone nearby started to scream, and a few minutes into the ordeal the emergency lights came on, and we observed that the ship is now listing on the port side. This is when the first announcement came on telling us it was nothing but an electrical failure, and that everything is under control."" There were 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew members aboard the Costa Concordia when it set sail January 13. Sharma told a House Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Committee hearing that ""crew members urged the passengers to remain calm and seated. The staff started to bring out people's food, as if nothing bad had happened."" She said a half hour after the accident, she and her husband decided to leave the dining room and go back to their room to get their life jackets, climbing six levels while holding onto the guard rails in dim emergency lighting. ""As we were getting to our room there were constant announcements of the same message, 'Ladies and gentleman, everything is under control at this point, and it seems to be a generator failure. Please stay calm and wait for further instructions and be cooperative.' What caught our attention was that all the announcements were made on behalf of the captain, and never once did we hear the captain speak,"" Sharma said. ""No one seemed to have any clear idea as to why they had to, what they had to do in this situation, or where they were supposed to send us,"" she added. Her husband, Sameer Sharma, told committee members ""there was not one instance where crew members or anybody had mentioned that there was anything wrong other than the electrical issue. So we felt very betrayed, very much lied to at that point."" Despite being urged to stay in their rooms, the Sharmas headed to a lifeboat. ""People started to panic and getting frustrated as the ship is tilting more by the minute. We were getting frustrated, aggravated, and the crowd was pushing and shoving against each other,"" Divya Sharma said. ""Everybody was on their good vacation, but here we were sitting on a life boat, on a life boat, staring into the eyes of death,"" she told CNN in an interview before the hearing began. The number of confirmed dead in the accident is 25, with several people still missing. Dozens were injured. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Washington, told the Sharmas, ""I'm embarrassed with what happened."" Coast Guard officials said an investigation is under way to determine what lessons can be learned from the incident and what regulations should be strengthened to protect passengers. One part of the probe includes whether watertight doors were closed after the ship struck the reef. The investigation will also look at crew training procedures, language and ship inspections. ""From that, we hope to develop a picture of what happened on board and the human factors in the unfolding of that tragedy,"" said Vice Admiral Brian Salerno, commandant for operations with the U.S. Coast Guard. Salerno pointed out that the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic was drawing near, on April 14, and the ""Costa Concordia reminds us that our new technology cannot be taken for granted. We're only as good as the human systems that operate them."" One immediate change is the cruise industry's decision to conduct muster drill exercises prior to a ship's departure from port, something Salerno called a ""positive development."" There are some 170 passenger ships that operate from U.S. ports each year. The Transportation Committee said in 2010 more than 10 million U.S. residents took a cruise, generating more than $37 billion for the U.S. economy and creating 330,000 American jobs. Representatives of the cruise line industry told lawmakers it is reviewing procedures in the wake of the accident. ""The cruise industry remains one of the safest recreational travel options,"" said Christine Duffy, president and CEO of Cruise Lines International Association. She said the industry is ""proactive and transparent"" when it comes to safety. The captain of the Costa Concordia reportedly abandoned the ship well before most of the passengers evacuated and refused to return when ordered to do so by the Italian Coast Guard. He faces several criminal charges in connection with the accident. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who holds a captain's license, said pointedly, ""Nothing's wrong with the ship. It's a captain who forgot he was a captain."" Young cautioned against ""casting aspersions"" on the American cruise line industry and its ""good safety record."" ""We want to avoid collateral damage to the cruise industry,"" added Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. ""This is truly a teachable moment."" But when Cummings asked Divya Sharma whether she would ever take a cruise again, she said, ""Not in the near future.""","Twenty-five people were killed in the Costa Concordia accident .

"Grossetto, Italy (CNN) -- A judge on Saturday barred environmental and consumer groups from participating in a criminal court investigation into the wreck of cruise liner Costa Concordia that killed at least 25 people, attorneys said. But the judge allowed the island of Giglio, whose waters were where the ship ran aground in January, to remain as an injured party, said attorneys who participated in Saturday's closed court proceeding. Italy's civil protection agency was also deemed an injured party Saturday, attorneys said. The injured parties can present evidence and request additional analysis of any element of the investigation, attorneys said. Meanwhile, Prosecutor Francesco Varusio confirmed that ship captain Francesco Schettino is being investigated, with allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard, and destroying a natural habitat against him. Giglio is a protected park. His first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, and six other officers both on the ship and from the firm Costa in Genova are under investigation on allegations including manslaughter, shipwreck and failure to report the accident, Varusio told CNN. Ambrosio's attorney, Salvatore Catalano, provided CNN with a copy of a court transcript of the interrogation of Ambrosio, in which he tells prosecutors that captain Schettino wasn't wearing his glasses when he set the parameters on the radar system. Ambrosio also told the prosecutors that during the voyage, Schettino asked Ambrosio several times to adjust ship instruments because he couldn't see, the transcript says. Schettino was in command of the ship at the time of the accident, Ambrosio told prosecutors, according to the transcript. ""Schettino was in denial about the gravity of the situation,"" Ambrosio says in the transcript. ""He asked us not to tell the coast guard how serious the situation was. ""He didn't want us to contact the coast guard about the accident,"" Ambrosio also says in the transcript. When asked by CNN about Ambrosio's statements on the transcript, Schettino's attorney, Bruno Leporatti, declined to comment. The ship's owner, Costa Cruiselines of Genova, also was allowed Saturday to remain as an interested party in the preliminary hearings, but not as an injured party, the attorneys said. The company is allowed to remain in the proceeding because the eight persons under investigation are the firm's employees, the attorneys said. Judge Valeria Montesarchio, who presided over the near five-hour hearing, will rule on March 9 on when the ship's black box will be opened and analyzed, attorneys said. The next hearing is set for July 21 in Grosseto. Saturday's court action was a preliminary hearing and is akin to a U.S. grand jury investigation, also a closed proceeding. The tribunal, which marked the second preliminary hearing so far in the catastrophe, was held in the Moderno theater to accommodate many of the 4,200 passengers and crew who are named as injured parties. Attorneys participating in the hearing told CNN of what happened behind the closed doors. More than 70 lawyers and 20 passengers and relatives of the missing attended the hearing. No one has been charged in the Costa Concordia incident, though charges are expected, attorneys added. Carlo Rienzi, president of Codacons, the consumer advocacy group for Italy's tourism sector, said the judge on Saturday barred environmental and consumer groups. Rienzi's group has joined two American law firms -- Proner & Proner, and Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik -- in representing several hundred passengers in civil law suits against Costa's parent company, Carnival Cruise Lines, of Miami, Florida. On Thursday, the prosecutor temporarily suspended the DNA identification of the latest eight bodies found aboard the shipwreck last month. Families were notified on Thursday that a court-appointed expert must be present because of the manslaughter investigation. The expected resumption of the identification efforts wasn't immediately known, attorneys said. One of those eight bodies is 5-year-old girl whose identity has already been established without confirmation by DNA testing, authorities said. The cruise liner ran aground January 13 when it struck rocks and turned on its side off the Italian island of Giglio. Seven persons remain missing in the incident, and a total of 25 bodies have been found, authorities said. The total death toll is estimated to be 32 persons, officials said. Of the 25 bodies found, 18 have been identified, authorities said. Giulia Bongiorno, an attorney representing 67 Italian and German passengers who were aboard the Costa Concordia, told CNN that she made a formal court request that the black box data be analyzed from the moment the cruise liner started registering data -- prior to leaving the port of Civitavecchia -- to determine whether the officers and crew followed proper procedure and to determine at what point and under whose command the ship deviated from its route. Bongiorno was also the attorney who represented Raffaele Sollecito, the boyfriend of Amanda Knox, who were both convicted in Italy in the murder of Knox's roommate, Meredith Kercher. Sollecito and Knox both successfully appealed their convictions last year and were freed. Sergio Amerotto, 67, a passenger on the Costa Concordia, said he attended Saturday's hearing because he is seeking to bring to justice those responsible for the tragedy. ""We are here so those who lost their lives did not die in vain,"" he told CNN. ""We need to understand who is responsible for their deaths. The captain did absurd things, but the black box will reveal who else acted irresponsibly.""

"(CNN) -- Every July in the lush, green mountains of Aspen, Colorado, many of the top present and former U.S. national security officials and other experts gather to discuss how the war against al Qaeda and its allies is going. Ahead of last year's Aspen conference, I wrote a piece for CNN provocatively titled ""Time to declare victory: Al Qaeda is defeated."" And I then spoke on a panel at Aspen where I tried to make the case for this position. I'm not sure too many of the folks in Aspen were convinced. (If they had been, it would hardly seem necessary to travel back to Aspen again this year!) Since last year's Aspen conference, a group of men only very loosely aligned with al Qaeda attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing four U.S. diplomats and CIA contractors. And in April, the Tsarnaev brothers whose family originated in the Caucasus -- one an American citizen and the other a US resident -- were accused of detonating pressure-cooker bombs in Boston that were based on a design that al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate had widely distributed on the Internet. The bombing killed three and wounded more than 250 and brought ordinary life to a screeching halt in one of the nation's largest cities. Certainly the attacks in Libya and Boston were victories for ""Binladenism,"" the ideological movement that al Qaeda has spawned. Indeed, the New Mexico-born cleric Anwar Awlaki who was a leader of al-Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate before he was killed in a US drone strike in 2011, was influential not only on the Tsarnaev brothers who possessed some of his writings but also on 22 other US-based jihadist extremists, according to a count by the New America Foundation. However, the attacks in Libya and Boston don't really change the prognosis that al Qaeda, the organization that attacked the U.S. on 9/11, is going the way of the VHS tape. Al Qaeda itself hasn't carried out a successful attack in the West since the suicide bombings in London in 2005 that killed 52. And the terrorist group hasn't carried out an attack in the United States since 9/11. Nor have any of its affiliated groups. The killings of several high-level al Qaeda militants -- foremost among them the organization's founder and leader, Osama bin Laden, during a Navy SEAL raid on his compound in May 2011 -- have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda's core leadership. A few months after bin Laden's death, a U.S. drone strike killed Atiyah Abdul Rahman, who had become al Qaeda's No. 2 commander after Ayman al-Zawahiri had assumed bin Laden's leadership role. Rahman was one of 30 leaders of al Qaeda in Pakistan who have been killed in CIA drone strikes over the past five years, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Al Qaeda ""Central,"" in short, remains on life support. A second chance with the Arab Spring . However, the unrest that swept the Arab world in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring has provided jihadist extremist groups with more room to operate and injected large amounts of arms into the region. Al Qaeda affiliates subsequently gained significant footholds in Libya, Syria, Yemen and Mali. But the bulk of jihadist violence in those countries is focused on purely domestic targets. And in countries such as Mali and Yemen, jihadist militants have overplayed their hands and have suffered real reverses in the past year or so. As a result, the attacks by al Qaeda-aligned groups on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in September and on the BP gas facility in Algeria, at the beginning of this year represent the current state of jihadist anti-Western capabilities abroad. Worldwide, al Qaeda affiliates and allied groups aren't a major threat to the West: . -- Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula remains a real threat to Yemen, but despite its strong interest in U.S. targets, the group has not attempted any serious anti-American attack since its failed October 2010 plot to plant bombs hidden in printer cartridges on cargo planes destined for the United States. However, AQAP's capable chief bomb maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, remains at large. -- A long-term safe haven for the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria known as Jabhat al-Nusra, ( ""the Victory Front"") could create an organization with the capability to attack the West. For the moment, the group, which is widely regarded as the most effective fighting force in Syria, is focused on overthrowing the regime of Bashar al-Assad, a project that may take years to achieve. That said, this group is gaining substantial territory in Syria; is attracting thousands of foreign fighters, including hundreds from the West; and might eventually turn its attention to Western targets. -- Al Qaeda in Iraq has also become deeply involved in the civil war in Syria. It has also successfully leveraged a growing sectarian divide in Iraq to garner support from the Sunni community and is, once again, a real threat to the stability of Iraq. -- Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its splinter groups have little ability to target the West but still pose a threat to Western interests in their areas of operation. AQIM and its splinter groups remain active in parts of Algeria, where they attacked the BP gas facility in early 2013, and northern Mali, where they launched an offensive against the government alongside separatist Tuareg rebels in 2012. However, AQIM and its splinter groups were pushed out of major Malian cities by a French military intervention earlier this year . -- In the past two years, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, Al-Shabaab, has lost substantial territory and influence in Somalia. While Al-Shabaab remains a potential threat to Western targets because of the group's influence among the Somali diaspora in the West, recent battlefield defeats have forced the group to focus internally. Al-Shabaab has never conducted a successful attack in the West and has not conducted a mass-casualty attack outside of Somalia since it carried out bombings in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010. -- Islamist militant groups remain a threat to stability in Libya in the post-Moammar Gadhafi era. Ansar al-Sharia's loose network of Islamist militants have conducted attacks and gained some legitimacy among the local populace in Benghazi. Ansar al-Sharia is not, however, organizationally or operationally linked to al Qaeda, and it operates only within Libya. -- The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, is largely a threat to Pakistan, Afghanistan, NATO soldiers and Western interests in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. It has attempted only two attacks outside the region. TTP has not conducted an attack on American soil since it directed Faisal Shahzad to carry out a car bombing that proved unsuccessful on May 1, 2010, in Times Square. -- The Afghan Taliban continue to lead a potent insurgency in Afghanistan, launching persistent attacks against U.S. forces, as well as military, diplomatic, and aid facilities. They remain in control of significant swaths of land in rural Afghanistan, and will continue to threaten Afghan stability after the NATO combat mission ends in December 2014. However, they have shown no interest in mounting an attack against the U.S. homeland. -- The Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba has not conducted a mass-casualty attack outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region since its lethal rampage in Mumbai in 2008. Similarly, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Islamic Jihad Union have not showed an interest in or ability to engage in international terrorism since an IJU-linked terrorism cell was broken up in Sauerland, Germany, in 2007. -- Because of continued government crackdowns throughout Southeast Asia, the once-virulent threat posed by the al Qaeda aligned regional terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah has decreased significantly over the past few years. Terror groups have local preoccupations . Given the weaknesses and the local preoccupations of the terrorist groups described in this story, many U.S. counterterrorism officials believe the chances of a large-scale, catastrophic terrorist attack in the United States by al Qaeda or an al Qaeda-affiliated or inspired organization are quite small. Also, the long-term prognosis for most of these terrorist groups is poor because they have all tended to kill many Muslim civilians, and they offer no political or economic ideas to cure the real problems of much of the Islamic world. However, continued unrest throughout the greater Middle East, especially the current turmoil in Egypt, the rising tensions across the region between Sunnis and Shia, the continuing Syrian civil war and the uncertain future of Afghanistan after U.S. and NATO combat troops are withdrawn in December 2014 are all potential wild cards that could create an environment that gives al Qaeda and allied groups opportunities to resuscitate themselves. And at home, the Boston Marathon bombings remind us that the United States still faces a threat from disaffected individuals inspired by al Qaeda's ideology and who often radicalize in the online world. Although they are difficult to detect, these individuals are also quite unlikely to be capable of perpetrating an attack even remotely on the scale of 9/11.","Peter Bergen: Benghazi and Boston don't alter reality about jihad .

"(CNN) -- Days after the Costa Concordia ran aground off Italy's coast, details of the harrowing escape from the ship are still fresh in survivors' minds. Here are some of the accounts they shared with CNN: . Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York: ""It wasn't until approximately 30 to 40 minutes after the collision that we finally heard announcements being made, and in English, we heard that they were saying everything was under control ... that there was an electrical problem with the generator. My husband and I looked at each other and said, 'They're full of it. We have to get off this boat.'"" Valerie Ananias of Downey, California: ""I kept telling my parents and I kept telling everybody else, we need to go. Time is of the essence. We need to get on (a lifeboat) as soon as possible because it continued to tilt. What happened was, when we finally got on the lifeboat, it took several minutes to get everybody on ... people were screaming and crying and they had us count."" Keiko Guest of Atlanta, Georgia: ""We managed to get to a lifeboat that wasn't being overrun and the crew tried to keep us back and we felt all this pressure coming from behind ... stampeding, trying desperately to save their lives ... babies crying ... the siren was unbelievable. It was so piercing that the children and babies were screaming at the top of their lungs while everybody else was screaming to try to be heard. It was so chaotic. It was like the disaster movies."" Georgia Ananias of Downey, California:  ""When the ship was listing ... we had to climb up and pull a human chain to pull ourselves up on to a stairwell. ... Another couple turned around and gave me their baby, and said, 'take my baby.' And I held a 3-year-old and I was holding on and the ship was moving and I was afraid the child was going to go down the stairwell. And I knew -- I looked at my husband who's been in the Navy, and he said, 'This is it,' and I handed the baby back to the parents and said, 'Be with your baby.' ""Not one person from the ship assisted us in any matter. There wasn't one officer. We got on a lifeboat that wouldn't function. We were all thrown out of the lifeboat and thrown against the walls of the ship. We crawled down under to try to get on the other side of the ship, because they said that if we got on the other side, we could get a lifeboat. And at the time, the ship shifted again, and we were thrown back. ""We had to crawl back out. We had to climb a 20-foot ladder. ... The real heroes were the people, the other passengers on board that lifted us up. And we had to go through crates of things. And then we get to the top of the ship, and we're up there with about 10 people. The rest of the people have left the ship, and you see coast guards and flashing lights, and you think they're coming for you, and the next thing you know, they're taking somebody from the bridge and airlifting them out. And we're standing there with our lights flashing and yelling, 'Save us, save us!'"" Justin Evans of Atlanta, Georgia: ""The staff, you know, they seemed younger than me. They did not know what to do. They got on the lifeboats. They could not even drive the lifeboat.

"(CNN) -- Costa Cruises is on the defensive again. The cruise line issued a statement Tuesday denying that it offered discounts on future cruises to passengers who were aboard Concordia when it ran aground. The statement was in response to news reports that the cruise line offered 30% off on future travel to some survivors. ""The company has never offered any discount on future cruises to our guests who were on board Costa Concordia for the cruise of Jan. 13 and involved in the tragic accident,"" Costa's statement said, calling reports published by various news outlets ""unfounded."" An internal investigation into the reports that surfaced over the weekend revealed no evidence of discounts being offered to disaster survivors, said Buck Banks, Costa's North American spokesman. ""There's probably no way to know for sure as confused as things were in the hours just following the accident,"" Banks said. ""I'm not going to say mistakes couldn't have been made,"" he said. Banks said he was certain no discount offers were made to North American passengers. It must have been a mistake or miscommunication if any discounts were offered to survivors, said Dan Askin, an editor at cruising website CruiseCritic.com, noting that there's no confirmation that such offers were made. The cruise line did offer 30% off on future cruises to guests who were scheduled to sail on the Concordia from January 14 and beyond, which Askin called ""perfectly ordinary"" compensation for people booked on cruises canceled because of an incapacitated ship. Costa is offering cancellation without penalty by February 7 to concerned passengers booked on other ships, the company's statement said. Passengers involved in the Concordia disaster will receive full refunds for the cruise and all related expenses, Costa said Monday. All costs associated with travel to the port of embarkation and the return home, including transfer arrangements made independently of the cruise line, will be reimbursed, as will medical expenses, cash deposits and any expenses incurred on board. Costa said it will update passengers on the return of personal belongings and try to return valuables stored in cabin safes. The company has been following up on the emotional and physical well-being of affected passengers, the statement said, and talking with tourism trade associations and consumer protection groups to determine indemnity for passengers for the hardship endured. Costa had no comment on a class-action lawsuit against the cruise line and its parent company, Carnival Corp., that Italian consumer group Codacons and two U.S. law firms plan to file in Miami. ""We've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,"" said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. The suit is seeking at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger, Proner said.","Cruise line denies offering discounts on future cruises to survivors .

"(CNN) -- While all eyes were on Rome for the election of a new pope, for Catholics, the importance of the event went beyond an impressive spectacle. Pope Francis, previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina, will now be the spiritual and moral leader for more than 1.2 billion Catholics across the world. Already, he has given a clear sense of how his tenure will be more distinct from his retired predecessor, asking first for the audience's prayers instead of giving a blessing, and choosing his name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, who humbly dedicated his life to aiding the less fortunate. 5 things to know about the new pope . Now some Catholics are taking a more introspective look at their church and pondering what the pope should focus on. From returning to a simpler message to welcoming women -- and gay-friendly views, here are some of the top priorities from Catholics around the world: . Rethink the church's -- and his -- position on gay rights . The issue of gay rights has proved deeply controversial within the Catholic Church, and led to accusations from activists that it remains mired in the past rather than looking toward a more inclusive future. Josep Prat Vinolas from Spain thinks the new pope and the church need to rethink their position on gay rights and gay marriage. Catholics: Tell us your views on the new pope . Pope Francis once called the Argentine government support for a bill on gay marriage ""an attempt to destroy God's plan,"" but Vinolas says the new pope bears the responsibility of opening the eyes of the church to other views, even if he is conservative. ""There are gays who are Catholics. I'm not saying [for him] to accept that, but not to compare it with evil,"" he said. ""I think he could say that he respects different people and that the house of God is the house of all."" Bring much needed reform . The U.S. has been at the forefront of some of the worst scandals wracking the church in recent years, over the sexual abuse of children by men of the cloth. American iReporter and committed Catholic Jannet Walsh wants action. ""[The church must] clean up, resolve and prevent future scandals,"" said the Minnesota resident. ""The world has heard enough on this subject and wants to move on."" Walsh was also one of the first people to point out the importance of the name Francis, arguing the move was ""very telling"" because of the medieval Italian saint's emphasis on rebuilding the church, love of the poor, and adeptness at reconciliation. ""A charismatic or people's pope might just be just what the people need to be inspired in their faith and bring joy into their [lives],"" she argued. Open up the church to women . Meanwhile, 50% of the world's Catholics remain excluded from the highest echelons of the church because of their sex -- and Filipino Rummel Pinera says it's time the church acknowledged the importance of women in its history, and its future. Legend of female pope endures . ""We're living in a world that has become a global village, [and] in this global village of ours, women now can't just be fence-sitters or nannies,"" he said. ""Women now know that they were created as co-equal of men."" He also observes that, to solve the issue of dwindling priest numbers in some parts of the world, the church could make the issue of celibacy for priests optional. He also emphasized that the church could no longer stick to the status quo. ""The Roman Catholic Church should become dynamic in this age, so that it can maintain the loyalty of its flocks and win many souls for God,"" he said. Stop powerful nations from bullying the smaller ones . Pope Francis's election was unique in many ways, not least because of his background -- he's the first Latin American pope to lead the church in its history. The cardinals' decision to pick a man from a diverse and rapidly rising continent sparked hope amongst many Catholics of a new mindset amongst the powers that be in the Vatican, one that takes emerging powers more seriously. In Nigeria, Catholic bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, who ministers to Sokoto in the northwest of the country, was ""delighted"" to hear that a Latin American pope had been elected by the cardinals in Rome, because he was not from Western powers who had dominated the papacy for so long. What Africans want from the next pope . ""I pray that a pope from out of Europe will help to tame and reverse all the tendencies of the super powers towards weaker nations, [such as] arrogance, greed and caprice,"" he said. And Cesar Sotolongo, originally from Florida but currently in Lima, Peru, explains that the Latin American way of doing things in a more accommodating manner, rather than the Western-driven methods of leadership, would prove positive for the church, and its followers. ""A person from Latin America thinks in a collective manner rather than individually because society is structured like that,"" he reflects. ""A Latin American pope brings a message of hope for today's society."" Keep it simple! Sotolongo had another piece of advice for the church -- open up and become more approachable, and you may attract a new wave of followers. And if they're looking for inspiration -- Pope Francis's own austere style of living and worship already set a perfect example. ""The pope should shape the church with what he has been doing during his career [as an example],"" he said. ""Stay in contact with the people, communicate clearly, promote the unification of faith and ... and represent the word of Jesus."" Meanwhile in Zagreb, Croatia, Ivan Klindic says the pope, and the church, need to rely less on the trappings of wealth and more on helping those in need. ""The pope needs to be more modest, to show that the Vatican isn't based only on money,"" he said. And for Martina Lunardelli in Italy, her message for the new pope was even more succinct: Keep it simple. ""I think that the church needs to go back to a simple message which is to love each other and not care about what religion we are or what we believe in,"" she said. ""I hope he can do this.""","Catholics from Croatia to Peru gave their top priorities for the pope to lead on .

"(CNN) -- The resilience of a burned baby golden eagle that survived a Utah wildfire is astounding wildlife rehabilitators nursing him back to health. ""The trauma and the injury and the situation he is in -- to come out of it is amazing,"" said DaLyn Erickson, executive director of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah in Ogden. All of the eaglet's feathers, even on his head, were charred. He also suffered burns to the feet and around his beak. His improbable story began June 1, when a volunteer who documents eagles placed a band on the bird. The Dump Fire erupted three weeks later, burning more than 5,500 acres south of Salt Lake City and west of Utah Lake. Kent Keller returned in late June to the nest, built on the edge of the cliff, thinking he would recover the band from a deceased animal. The nest on Lake Mountain was gone, the rocks behind it blackened by the blaze. Keller then spotted legs and talons near a scorched juniper below. Amazingly, the baby eagle was alive. Near him were rabbit and squirrel carcasses, evidence his parents had tried to feed him after disaster struck. Fortunately, his eyes had not been burned. Wildfire victims face second tragedy . Keller said he has thought of the horror the helpless nestling might have felt when flames approached. ""He had enough courage to jump from that nest and try to save himself anyway,"" said Keller, 56, who describes himself as an amateur ornithologist. ""He is a real fighter."" The fall was about 25 feet, and the eagle probably walked back to the base of the cliff after rolling another 100 feet, said Keller. The bird remained in the area for several days while Keller, who is authorized to band raptors, sought permission from federal and state authorities to obtain care for him. On Wednesday, Keller handed the bird over to Erickson. She and her staff dubbed the survivor ""Phoenix"" -- a reference to the mythical creature that is reborn from the ashes. There was no food in the craw of the dehydrated eagle, which weighed just over 5 pounds. ""He was lethargic and just obviously hurting,"" Erickson told CNN on Saturday. ""After we got him hydrated and medications, he perked up and that fire came back in him."" Erickson said Phoenix, now about 70 days old, was a handful Saturday, lunging and using his talons as caregivers fed and provided antibiotics to the animal. ""He's not grateful,"" she quipped. Rehabilitators limit their contact with the eagle so that he will not ""habituate,"" or become too comfortable around people. They use hydrotherapy to help the healing in his feet. ""He needs those for hunting. There are lots of tendons and muscles we need to protect,"" said Erickson. Golden eagles, which are protected, typically eat reptiles, birds and small mammals, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They also are known to scavenge carrion. Colorado's most destructive fire nears containment . Keller said golden eagle females are slightly smaller than the more-famous bald eagle and tend to hunt more and scavenge less. Their particular favorite prey in northern Utah is the black-tailed jackrabbit. The resident of suburban Salt Lake City studies golden eagles and provides population information to state wildlife authorities. Erickson called Keller ""the hero in this story."" It's too early to tell whether Phoenix will be able to fly in the wild. Rehabilitation will take at least a year and his feathers won't fully molt until mid-2013. ""We are fairly confident, but there could be follicle damage we do not know about that would prevent feathers from coming in,"" Erickson said. The nonprofit center, which treats about 1,800 animals a year, is accepting financial and food donations to offset the cost of caring for the golden eagle. ""He is doing well and we are very positive about his outcome right now,"" said Erickson. ""(But) these types of things can turn at any moment."" How to donate . In her 12 years of wildlife rehabilitation, Erickson said, the eagle's story is among a few cases she considers ""nothing short of a miracle.""","Baby golden eagle was burned in a Utah wildfire .

"(CNN) -- St. Francis of Assisi, after whom Pope Francis has taken his name, captures the spirit of many Catholics because church history regards him as the pre-eminent figure passionate about imitating Christ's life. He is known also as a patron saint of Italy, the founder of the Franciscan order of the Friars Minor, an admirer of nature and a servant to poor and destitute. The brown robe of the Franciscans is iconic. ""Who doesn't know Francis of Assisi, who abandoned everything from wealth and prestige and who became poor himself,"" Vatican deputy spokesman the Rev. Thomas Rosica said Wednesday, explaining how the saint inspired Pope Francis' name. ""Francis of Assisi is a great, great figure in the church but known especially for connecting with fellow Christians and many people outside the Christian family,"" Rosica said. Many popes have written and spoken of St. Francis of Assisi, according to the Vatican's website. In an encyclical, Pope Pius XI stated that ""there has never been anyone in whom the image of Jesus Christ and the evangelical manner of life shone forth more lifelike and strikingly than in St. Francis."" St. Francis ""was also rightly spoken of as 'another Jesus Christ,'"" Pius XI said. He was born in Assisi in 1181 or 1182, the son of a rich cloth merchant, and he enjoyed a carefree adolescence and youth, particularly with troubadours. He went to war at age 20 and was taken prison for almost a year. He was released and became seriously ill, which began a major turn in his life. When he returned to Assisi, a spiritual change commenced, and Francis abandoned his worldliness. He met with lepers and extended a kiss to one. In rags, he lived among beggars at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. And in one renowned episode, he went to the tattered small church of St. Damian, where Christ on the cross came to life and told him: ""Go, Francis, and repair my Church in ruins,"" recounted Pope Benedict XVI in a 2010 address, according to the Vatican website. ""The ruinous state of the building was a symbol of the dramatic and disquieting situation of the church herself,"" Benedict said. ""At that time the church had a superficial faith which did not shape or transform life, a scarcely zealous clergy, and a chilling of love."" Francis' father questioned his son's generosity and servitude to the poor. While standing before the bishop of Assisi, Francis stripped off his clothes and renounced his paternal inheritance, Benedict said. Francis lived as a hermit. He went to Rome in 1209 to propose to Pope Innocent III a plan for a new form of Christian life, Benedict said.

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . My 3-year-old daughter, Jasmine, amazes me every day. In all of my travels around the world as a fashion photographer, I've never seen anything more beautiful than watching her grow up. She loves going to school and dreams of becoming a doctor and a ballerina -- there are no limits to what she can become! As a father, it pains me that not every girl has the same chance as Jasmine to get an education and pursue her dreams. Today, girls make up more than half of the 140 million children and adolescents who don't attend school, and in many countries, more than half the girls drop out before they get to the sixth grade. Instead of getting an education, they are often forced to marry as children and carry the burden of household chores. This predicament is devastating for millions of girls who deserve better. It's also devastating for our world because educating girls is one of the most important steps we can take to end poverty. When a girl is educated, she is likely to earn more money to support her family, to promote economic growth in her country, and to have a healthier home life. The good news is: We can make a difference. As part of the United Nations Foundation's Girl Up campaign, I've had the opportunity to work with young people to stand up for girls' education. Girl Up, a ""for girls, by girls"" campaign, mobilizes the energy of youth to help raise funds and awareness for United Nations programs that provide girls in developing countries with life-changing opportunities, like getting an education. Thanks to the work of the U.N., governments, organizations and girls around the world, more girls than ever are in primary school. We still have more work to do to get every girl in a classroom, but we are making progress. Achieving this goal will require all of us to stand up for girls' rights. Men and boys need to be part of the solution. After all, the positive impact of girls' education has been shown to transcend generations, benefiting girls, as well as their families, their communities and our world. Girls can change the future, but we need to give them the chance. Join the growing movement to advocate for girls' education. - Nigel Barker .

"(CNN) -- Killing the man proved easier than killing his ideology. Following a decade-long hunt, Osama bin Laden was finally run to ground in Pakistan two years ago. Bin Laden did not die on the bloody battlefield of a holy war but in a suburban compound in the comfortable city of Abbottabad in northern Pakistan, surrounded by three of his wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren. The anti-heroic death of the al Qaeda leader was greeted by only small protests in the Muslim world. And worries that bin Laden's ""martyrdom"" would unleash a new wave of terrorist attacks have proved unfounded. At the time of bin Laden's death on May 1, 2011, core al Qaeda had already been severely degraded by CIA drone strikes. Drones have killed at least 30 leaders of al Qaeda in Pakistan, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Some of the most senior al Qaeda leaders had also been arrested in Pakistan. As Marty Martin, who headed CIA operations against al Qaeda in the years after 9/11, puts it in the HBO documentary ""Manhunt"": ""Congratulations, Abu Butthead, you're now the No. 3 in al Qaeda; that's the good news. The bad news is, you're now the No. 3 in al Qaeda. Get ready. Buckle your chinstrap, because your career path is probably going to be short-lived."" As a result of CIA operations, the al Qaeda core is now on life support. Simultaneously, bin Laden's overall strategy has failed. Instead of forcing the United States to pull out of the Middle East as bin Laden had predicted would happen after the 9/11 attacks, the United States, together with its allies, largely destroyed al Qaeda in Afghanistan and later invaded Iraq while building up massive American military bases in Muslim countries such as Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. Bergen: Agencies often miss warning signs of attacks . If bin Laden's strategy of attacking the United States was a failure, his ideas, unfortunately, may have more lasting currency, at least among a small minority in the Muslim world. Like many of history's most effective leaders, bin Laden told a simple story about the world that his followers around the globe found easy to grasp. In his telling, there was a conspiracy by the West and its puppet allies in the Muslim world to destroy true Islam, a conspiracy led by the United States. As a result of this purported conspiracy, violence against the United States was a necessity. Bin Laden's single narrative of a war on Islam by the West also purports to explain all the problems of the Muslim world: for example, that the long-running war between Russia and the Chechens is not a centuries-old imperialist land grab by the Russians but is rather a Western war against Islam. So, too, are the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has told investigators were among the reasons he and his brother carried out the bombings that targeted the Boston Marathon, according to a U.S. government official who briefed CNN. Al Qaeda, the organization that bin Laden created during the late 1980s, has now morphed into a loose jihadist ideological movement. That movement spawned the most spectacular terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 in the form of the Tsarnaev brothers, who authorities said killed four and injured some 250 others during the course of a five-day killing spree in Boston this month. This is bin Laden's most toxic legacy: ""Binladenism."" It is an ideological movement that is supported by an entire jihadist ecosystem in which the Tsarnaev brothers and other militants can easily swim. Bergen: Who really killed bin Laden? The widely available English language webzine Inspire is produced by al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate and teaches recruits in the West how to build bombs. Password-protected jihadist forums allow militants to ""meet"" electronically and clandestinely. Firebrand clerics preach hate in colloquial English on the Internet, and shadowy overseas militant groups allied to al Qaeda or influenced by its ideology have recruited and trained many thousands of militants during the past decade, including dozens of Americans. The most effective of these militant groups today is the Nusrah Front in Syria, which is essentially a rebranded franchise of al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate. Nusrah is the most effective force fighting the Bashar al-Assad regime and is widely regarded as the most disciplined of the hundreds of opposition groups now fighting in Syria. Nusrah seems to have learned from the mistakes of al Qaeda in Iraq, which wantonly killed fellow Muslims and imposed Taliban-style rule on Iraq's Sunni population, provoking a tribal rebellion against al Qaeda known as the Sunni Awakening that began in 2006 and devastated al Qaeda in Iraq. Nusrah is avoiding these kinds of mistakes and is actually providing services in a systematic way to the populated area it controls, something of a first for an al Qaeda affiliate. Nusrah makes large quantities of much-needed bread for the desperate Syrian population and even controls some of Syria's oil fields. In the documents that were picked up by the U.S. Navy SEAL team that raided bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad are many examples of bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders urging fellow militants to avoid causing Muslim civilian casualties and to learn from the mistakes of al Qaeda in Iraq. In Syria, these lessons, for the moment, seem to be being heeded, while the tragedy in Boston shows that the death of bin Laden did not lead to the death of his ideas. Bergen: Should we still fear al Qaeda? This is underlined by a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in spring 2012, a year after bin Laden was killed, finding that in Pakistan, 13% of Muslims held a favorable view of al Qaeda. In Jordan, 15% expressed a positive opinion, and the group received its highest ratings in Egypt, where 21% held a favorable view. These favorable numbers are, of course, far outweighed by the unfavorable views that al Qaeda enjoys in the same countries. For most Muslims, whatever fleeting attraction al Qaeda's ideology may once have enjoyed has largely evaporated, in particular because al Qaeda and it allies have killed so many Muslim civilians around the Islamic world. But Binladenism continues to excite a small but not insignificant minority of Muslims. We will be living with this ideology for many years to come until it is finally consigned to ""history's unmarked grave of discarded lies,"" as President George W. Bush eloquently put it in a speech to Congress 10 days after 9/11.","Peter Bergen: It was easier for the U.S. to kill bin Laden than to kill his ideology .
The Boston bombing is one case in which bin Laden's ideology may have played a role, he says .
The majority of Muslims reject bin Ladenism, but there are still some adherents, he says .
Bergen: Syrian conflict is another arena in which bin Ladenism is active ."
"(CNN) -- To most of us, golden Aviator sunglasses, sleek wireless headphones, a Louis Vuitton bag and a private jet flight better suit the life of a Hollywood star than a holy Buddhist ascetic. Yet Thailand's so-called ""jet-set monk,"" 34-year old Luang Pu Nenkham, who claimed to be the reincarnation of a respected monk who lived several decades ago, is accused of ignoring his Buddhist vows of celibacy and a simple, moral living, as evidenced in video that showed up on youtube about two months ago. Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), a division of the Ministry of Justice, tells CNN it believes the video was shot by one of the monks on the plane, passed around and posted anonymously. Thai authorities, in an investigation, uncovered a mind-boggling list of assets that they say a man sworn to austerity should not possess. Nenkham, now stripped of his religious leadership, owned at least 83 automobiles and a list of properties that include plots of land, houses and condominiums, according to the DSI. Thai authorities believe more properties have yet to be accounted. Authorities also estimate at least 300 million baht, or nearly $10 million, have disappeared from Nenkham's bank accounts in recent days. Donations over the past decade, from poor supporters as well as rich backers, had helped Nenkham amass his total wealth, according to investigators. On Wednesday, Thai authorities took action issuing a arrest warrant for the former holy man. Nenkham, who also goes by the name Weerapol Sukpol, now faces charges of violating Thailand's computer crime act by posting ""deceitful information,"" having sex with a minor and rape, authorities say. A female plaintiff who claimed Nenkham had sex with her when she was 14 years old submitted a request for a DNA test for her 11-year old son, says Tharit Pengdit, Director General of the Department of Special Investigation. They are still awaiting results. Nenkham's bank accounts also continue to be under investigation because of an unusually large amount of bank transactions, add Thai authorities. Nenkham is now believed to be in the United States and in California, according to an ""intelligent source,"" says DSI. The fugitive owns a Buddhist retreat some 75 miles south of Los Angeles. We have been unable to reach Nenkham for comment. On Thursday, CNN went to where the monk is believed to be staying. While they offered no official statement, one resident monk said Nenkham had not been seen at the retreat in three months. A second monk said Nenkham had not visited for a year. As the manhunt for the fugitive monk gathers steam, Thailand's Department of Special Investigations tells CNN it has requested 114 financial institutions, land and transport departments to seize all of his assets. Thai authorities have also requested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to revoke Nenkham's visa, DSI's Pengdit told CNN, and will ask U.S. authorities to arrest and remand him into Thai custody.

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . I didn't start playing soccer imagining I would be scoring goals in the Olympics or representing my country at the World Cup. I started playing soccer, and sports in general, as a way to simply make friends. On the field, I was able to hang out with kids my age, kick the ball around and just have a good time. What I didn't realize at the time was that soccer would do more for me than I could ever imagine. At a young age, soccer taught me about leadership and sportsmanship and what it means to be a good teammate. Most importantly, it taught me the power of confidence. Confidence is not something that is always easy to find. Often, being the new girl on a team or being in a group breeds insecurities. I have joined countless teams where I was the new girl, and I was never immune to those feelings of self-doubt. I have learned that by pushing aside those insecurities and rediscovering my inner confidence, I become a better teammate and person. That's why I wrote the book series, ""The Kicks,"" to show girls the importance of maintaining confidence when faced with new (and sometimes scary!) opportunities. While the book is aimed at middle schoolers, the lessons in it are ones that I think hold true across all ages. Joining the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team was intimidating to say the least. I joined a team with women who I had looked up to for years, and at just 20, how was I supposed to fit in with them? I was nervous and overwhelmed. But I knew that I was capable of competing with them so I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone in order to be the best player I could be. I now call these girls more than just my friends. They are my sisters, and together we support each other through thick and thin. I'm so grateful to have some amazing women around me to help me learn and grow. Confidence has carried me on and off the pitch, through high school in California, college at UC Berkeley and now professionally for the U.S. Women's National Team and the Portland Thorns. I have had to adjust to new surroundings, meet new people and have been challenged by different situations. All of those experiences, while nerve-wracking at the time, have empowered me to grow stronger. It's important that as women, we stand up for ourselves, stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere. -- Alex Morgan . Read more open letters .

"(CNN) -- The election of a pope from Latin America shows the emerging influence of the region in the Catholic church and the world, church officials and world leaders said Wednesday. ""His selection ... speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said. Obama said he looked forward to working with the pope to advance peace and dignity for people, regardless of their faiths. ""The election of a pope from the 'new world' is an occasion of genuinely historic proportions,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in a statement. Positive reactions came in from around the globe. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner congratulated the pontiff. ""It is our desire that you have, in assuming the driving and guiding of the church, fruitful pastoral work of such great responsibilities in pursuit of the justice, the equality, the fraternity and the peace of humanity,"" she added. Mexico's Catholic bishops released a statement praising the news. ""For the churches that are pilgrims in Latin America, it is the cause of great joy,"" the statement said. ""For the Mexican church, it is a clear sign of love for the churches that are pilgrims in these lands."" First Latin American pope 'very exciting,' faithful say . Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, president of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland, called the new pope a reconciler and healer. ""His name reminds us of the little saint of Assisi. A simple man who was the poor servant of Jesus and who was given the message 'rebuild my church.' It is a very significant message for our time,"" he said in a written statement. The Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Church of England, said the two churches each hold ""a special place for one another."" ""His election is also of great significance to Christians everywhere, not least among Anglicans."" the Most Rev. Justin Welby said. ""May the love of Christ unite us, and intensify our service in a genuine and fruitful ecumenism that can be a blessing for the body of Christ throughout the world."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights group based in Washington, offered its support. ""We congratulate Pope Francis on his election by the College of Cardinals and offer the Muslim community's support and cooperation in every positive effort he will undertake for peace, justice and the betterment of humanity,"" Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a news release. 5 things to know about Pope Francis . In Asia, Father Raymond O'Toole, the Hong Kong-based secretary general of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences said, ""It is great news to see that he's a very humble man, one who is dedicated to reach out to the poor, has a very simple lifestyle himself. Those things can be very, very positive for the Holy See."" In Australia, Melbourne Archbishop Denis Hart said the Vatican had chosen a pope committed to social justice and Catholic doctrine. ""As Archbishop of Melbourne and President of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, I joyfully welcome the glad news of the appointment of Pope Francis,"" he said in a statement. ""For two weeks, the Catholics of the world have been without the spiritual father of their family. We have been looking forward to this special moment when our new Holy Father, chief teacher and shepherd would be announced."" The Syrian National Council, the Syrian opposition, congratulated Pope Francis and called on him to pay special consideration to the suffering of the Syrian people. ""Our people from all faith backgrounds have hope that His Holiness, The See of Peter, The Supreme Pontiff, with his message of peace and love, will pay a special attention to Syria, the cradle of love, peace and coexistence whose people are suffering from all kinds of blatant abuses and grave dangers."" Pope's name choice 'precedent shattering' But not everyone was thrilled by the choice of this pope. Several organizations in America worried that the Catholic church will continue what they see as policies that discriminate against homosexuals or seek to cover up sexual assaults on children. The executive director of New Ways Ministry, a ""gay-positive ministry of advocacy and justice for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Catholics,"" said he hoped Pope Francis would be open to other views. ""As a cardinal in Argentina, the new pope spoke strongly against marriage equality and against the right for gay and lesbian people to adopt children,"" said Francis DeBernardo. ""We hope that in his new office, he will have the wisdom to hear all sides of these complex issues and that he will inject pastoral messages into his statements."" And American Atheists said on its Facebook page that it found the Catholic church's decision ""backward and disgusting."" ""Another anti-LGBT, anti-abortion dinosaur. Despicable. Disappointed, but hardly surprised,"" the post said. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, in a blog post on the Media Statements section of its website, said Pope Francis had a duty to help prevent sexual assaults against children. ""We are grateful he doesn't work in the Vatican and isn't a member of the Curia. We hope that will give him the courage to shake things up and put the prevention of abuse and cover up first on his priority list,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World, . My own schooling taught me that the opportunity to learn is a gift, and the guidance of a good teacher is life-changing. It is important as a girl to learn how to earn your own living, stand up for your own point of view and share your skills and experiences with others. As the great African proverb goes, you must lift as you climb. In school, I learned that reading, writing and numeracy are powerful tools for life, but so too are stories: stories about our own histories and our culture; stories we can tell, draw, write and perform. How we see ourselves becomes who we are -- so we must see ourselves as tall and strong and kind, and connected to others. Being safe is a prerequisite for learning. If girls are not safe when they walk to school, attend school and as they return home, everything is taken away. We must all fight for our sisters to be safe from violence of any kind, so that they are free to learn, grow and flourish. Learning with and about boys is important -- we all live together in our world. Despite the heightened focus on girls, it's important not to forget to teach boys that their own learning and the learning of their sisters are equally valuable. We have, among ourselves, the power to change the lives of everyone. Each of us must use our voice through whatever networks we have to spread the news that educating girls will transform the world. We must talk to our neighbors, tell our friends, share our tweets and blogs, and create a great noise so that no leader, no education official and no head teacher or principal can avoid hearing the message: that every child -- which means every single girl -- deserves to go to school and learn. -- Sarah Brown .

Two Canadian-born citizens, John Nuttall and Amanda Korody, have been charged with conspiring to place an explosive in or against a place of public use, with intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; facilitating terrorist activity; and making or having in their possession an explosive substance with intent to endanger life, Rideout said. ""This self-radicalized behavior was intended to create maximum impact and harm to Canadian citizens at the B.C. legislature on a national holiday,"" Rideout said.

"(CNN) -- Brazilian military police say they destroyed a small explosive device over the weekend after discovering the item in a bathroom near a sanctuary Pope Francis is scheduled to visit later this week. The device was found in Aparecida, where Francis is scheduled to visit a historic Roman Catholic sanctuary Wednesday. It had ""low destructive power"" and wasn't in an area on the pope's route or in an area where pilgrims would be gathering, military police in the southeastern state of Sao Paulo confirmed to CNN. The explosive was made from a small plastic cylinder wrapped in duct tape, they said. ""The artifact was sent to military authorities for verification,"" police said. ""Security personnel quickly cordoned the area off."" A tactical squad was called in to destroy the device ""without any further risk,"" police said. Francis landed in Rio de Janeiro on Monday for the start of the Roman Catholic Church's World Youth Day. Hundreds of thousands of pumped-up young Catholic pilgrims are on hand for the weeklong festival, hosted by a country eager for good news after a summer of protests. Anger over high taxes, corruption and lavish spending on the upcoming World Cup soccer tournament spurred Brazilians to turn out for the largest protests seen in 20 years. The demonstrations, held in Sao Paulo, Rio and the capital of Brasilia, were sparked by a planned increase in bus fares in June. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff promised to address the concerns, announcing that she heard ""the direct message from the streets"" for better services and social reforms.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A columnist in Cuba's main government-run newspaper Friday accused employees of the United States diplomatic mission in Havana of accepting bribes for visas, charges that American diplomats challenged. The columnist, Nestor Garcia Iturbide, wrote in the state-run Granma that U.S. consular officials were in the ""business of denying visas"" to promote dangerous and illegal travel as well as a side business selling visas. According to Garcia Iturbide, ""to receive the visas some people pay off officials"" during secret meetings arranged outside the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, but he offered no details of the alleged payments. U.S. officials countered they have sped up the application process and don't promote illegal travel. ""The United States supports safe, legal, and orderly migration, and encourages intending immigrants to consider the legal options that may be available to them instead of risking a dangerous and illegal trip via raft or other route,"" U.S. diplomats said in statement issued Friday. The statement said that U.S. officials take allegations of corruption seriously and urged anyone with information about alleged visa payoffs to report it to U.S. authorities in Havana. Under migration accords with Cuba, the United States gives at least 20,000 Cubans a year visas to immigrate to the U.S. legally. But the U.S.'s so-called ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy means Cubans who reach U.S. soil are not sent back to Cuba, which Cuban authorities say leads to an increase in illegal journeys. Thousands of Cubans also apply for tourist visas to the United States but have to prove that they have long-standing ties on the island that would prevent them from remaining in the United States. In February, Cuba removed a long-standing requirement that forced Cubans to have an exit visa before they could travel abroad.","A Cuban newspaper columnist says U.S. visas can be had for money .

"Lac-Megantic, Quebec (CNN) -- Edward Burkhardt said he tried to get the people of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, to hear him, to try to understand that he had traveled to their town because he genuinely cared, he told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday. The 74-year-old chairman of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway wanted to answer any questions from officials and hear people out about the anguish they feel after a driverless train carrying tank cars oil rolled out of control, exploding in an inferno that killed at least 20 people. At least 30 more are still missing, most them probably dead, Quebec Provincial Police Capt. Michel Forget has said. The blaze may have vaporized victims, authorities said. Burkhardt expected that he'd face raw emotions, but was surprised that so much anger was directed at him. ""I'd been told about it. I'd been warned about it,"" he said. ""But it was worse than I thought. I thought people would respond to my willingness to come there. I mean, they were screaming about how I took three days to get there."" The tragedy occurred Saturday. Burkhardt arrived in Lac-Megantic Wednesday. ""Well, the three days we had a dozen people on the scene and I was organizing all kinds of things that were necessary,"" he said. ""And I figured I didn't really need to be in the way of people there when they were trying to put the fire out and that sort of stuff. ""I would wait till the dust settled to a certain degree and then I would come. That's what I did, but this was not well-received at all."" On Wednesday, two middle-aged men shouted at Burkhardt as he spoke with reporters, calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the tragedy. One of the men, Pierre L'Heureux, told CNN he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing. ""They should put that guy in prison,"" L'Heureux said. ""He's a murderer ... he should be in prison."" ""People wanted to throw stones at me. I showed up and they threw stones. But that doesn't accomplish anything,"" Burkhardt told CNN said. Graphic: Runaway train devastates Canadian town . Attempts to set up meetings with city officials and rescue workers were unsuccessful, he said. ""I failed with all that,"" he told CNN. ""They were too busy. They didn't want to meet."" His visit to the town was ""designed to get a healing process under way,"" he said, but he was misunderstood. ""Maybe I didn't present my case very well. But I'm not a communications professional. I'm a manager."" The executive with more than 50 years in the railway business told CNN that he could get ""quite emotional"" talking about the train disaster. ""They talked about that I had no empathy, or no sympathy, and in fact I have plenty,"" he said. ""I can imagine myself being in that kind of situation and I also would be grieving and I'd be very unhappy. I'd be very mad about the whole thing so I certainly understand the need to vent. But it comes a point where it's totally unproductive."" Burkhardt told CNN that that is why he has decided not to return to Lac-Megantic Thursday. CNN spoke to him in Sherbrooke, an hour and a half outside Lac-Megantic, the closest area with an available hotel room. ""I'm willing to come back (to Lac-Megantic) at a later date when maybe things are a little calmer, a little more settled down,"" he said.

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Brazil, rocked by recent nationwide protests, hosts two high-profile football games on Sunday in preparation for next year's World Cup. On Saturday, there were demonstrations surrounding the Confederations Cup matches, a World Cup warm-up tournament involving eight nations. In the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte, outside the stadium where Japan and Mexico played, protesters flooded the streets and clashed with riot police. Brazil's state-run news agency, Agencia Brasil, reported that approximately 66,000 people came to protest, according to military police. CNN affiliate Band News showed aerials of crowds clashing with riot police and police using rubber bullets and tear gas to keep protesters at bay. Smaller protests also occurred in other parts of Brazil on Saturday, a day after President Dilma Rousseff addressed the nation, warning that the government would not tolerate violence. In Salvador, a small crowd of peaceful demonstrators gathered outside the stadium where Brazil's national football team won over Italy. Elsewhere, in Sao Paulo, military police estimated a crowd of 30,000 flooded the city's main road, according to state-run Agencia Brasil. The protests over the weekend are part of a movement that has brought together Brazilians angered by their government. Protesters say the government is falling short in its duties to its citizens while spending lavishly on events such as the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games. While most of the protests have remained peaceful, there have been reports of sporadic violence, which has resulted in two deaths. Public transportation fare hikes spurred the discontent weeks ago, but protests continued to escalate last week despite various state governments repealing the fare hikes. Until now, the government's position has been to support the protests as peaceful freedom of expression. It is unclear whether there will be a shift if violent incidents mount and the unrest continues. On Friday, Rousseff announced that she planned to meet with leaders of the protest movement, but did not publicly detail when or where the meetings would take place. Her remarks followed an emergency meeting with her Cabinet.","Brazil hosts two Confederations Cup matches Sunday amid nationwide protests .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A U.S. State Department contractor jailed in Cuba will be allowed to receive a medical exam from a U.S. doctor, a Cuban government official told CNN Wednesday. The family of Alan Gross, 64, for months had asked that they be permitted to send a doctor to examine the Maryland native who is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing to Cuba banned communications equipment as part of a U.S. government-funded program to promote democracy on the island. Gross' family said that he has lost more than 100 pounds since his incarceration in 2009 and that a mass on his shoulder may be cancerous. The Cuban government countered that Gross receives medical care from Cuban doctors at the prison hospital where he is being held and that he is in good condition for a man his age. Jared Gensler, an attorney for Gross, declined to comment on the Cuban government's allowing Gross to receive a visit from a U.S. physician or when the visit would take place. The change in course comes as Cuba has intensified its campaign to secure the release of Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Cuban officials argue that the men infiltrated hard-line Cuban-exile groups to prevent terrorist attacks on the island. But U.S. prosecutors called the men spies, and they were convicted in 2001. Four of the agents remain in U.S. federal prison. The fifth man, Rene Gonzalez, returned to Cuba last month after serving 14 years in prison and on supervised release. Gonzalez, who was born in Chicago, renounced his U.S. citizenship last month as part of a deal that allowed him to return to the island and not serve a final year of supervised release in the U.S. Cuba will continue to push for the four other agents' release, Gonzalez said in a news conference in Havana Wednesday. ""We have hope that if the American people know about the case, the facts, they will put pressure on the White House for a solution,"" Gonzalez said. Last year, Cuban officials said they wanted to negotiate the jailed agents' case along with Gross'. ""The ball's in their court,"" said Johana Tablada, subdirector of the department that oversees U.S. affairs at Cuba's Foreign Ministry. ""We are waiting on the U.S. government's response."" But U.S. officials have rejected calls for a prisoner swap, instead arguing that Gross did not spy during his visits to Cuba and should be released immediately. ""Hopefully, a solution can be found that is mutually beneficial,"" said Kenia Serrano, president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with the Peoples, a Cuban organization working to secure the agents' freedom. ""All the families involved have suffered greatly.""","Cuba to let U.S. doctor examine Alan Gross, 64, a jailed State Department contractor .

"(CNN) -- The headquarters of Mexico's state oil was evacuated Tuesday night -- but it turned out to be a false alarm, the company said. The Pemex Tower in Mexico City was cleared after an unspecified threat, Pemex said on its Twitter feed. A short time later, the company tweeted, ""It was a false alarm."" In February, a deadly explosion at Pemex headquarters killed at least 37 people. Officials said it was caused by a buildup of gas in the basement. Pemex is Mexico's powerful and much-criticized state oil monopoly. Thousands of people work at the company's headquarters, which includes a 54-story building.

"(CNN) -- Johan Friso, the 43-year-old Dutch prince who was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last week, has suffered brain damage, his doctor said Friday. ""After the latest neurological test we conducted yesterday it became clear that the lack of oxygen (to) the brain of the patient caused massive damage,"" Dr. Wolfgang Koller told CNN affiliate SBS NL. ""Fifty minutes of reanimation is a very long time. One could also say too long,"" he added. ""Our hope was that the relatively moderate level of hypothermia might have protected the brain somewhat. Unfortunately this was not the case."" Friso, a son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, had been airlifted to hospital in Innsbruck after the incident. He was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said. No one else in the group was injured. The prince was under the snow for a ""short period of time,"" the spokesman said. He was wearing an electronic beacon that helped rescuers quickly find him. Lech am Arlberg is in Austria's Vorarlberg state, a popular skiing area in western Austria. The town's mayor told the station ""that we have hoped for a miracle."" ""We have hoped that Prince Friso will recover again,"" said Mayor Ludwig Muxel. ""There had been similar accidents and people nearly recovered fully. So we hoped that his health conditions would improve."" The region's avalanche agency reported there was a considerable to great chance of avalanches in Lech last week. It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off.","Dutch prince Johan Friso has suffered from brain damage, his doctor says .

"(CNN) -- As waters receded in some parts of southern Alberta, yet another city evacuated residents and lined up sandbags, waiting for a river to burst its banks. The city of Medicine Hat cast a wary eye on the South Saskatchewan River, which authorities predict will reach its peak on Monday morning and flood at record levels. City Hall was lined with sandbags. Officials told residents they should plan for the Trans-Canada Highway bridge to close Sunday night. The move will essentially split the city in half, allowing no public access between the northern and southern sections. Nearly 10,000 people have been evacuated in Medicine Hat, and almost everyone has complied with evacuation orders, the city's mayor, Norm Boucher, said. City spokeswoman Brandy Calvert said officials expect the flood to eclipse one in 1995, the city's biggest on record. So far, water treatment and power plants in Medicine Hat are protected. The drinking water is safe. ""We don't want to anticipate the worst, but we're going to be prepared for the worst,"" Alberta Premier Alison Redford said. ""We know that, from what we've seen everywhere else, that this is more exceptional than we've ever seen in Alberta before, so we're presuming that that's probably the circumstance that we're looking at (in Medicine Hat) as well."" The extensive flooding that has deluged towns and threatened southern Alberta communities has killed at least three people, officials said. The victims were all found in the Highwood River, about 40 miles south of Calgary. In Calgary, water still covered the city days after the Bow and Elbow Rivers overflowed. Bruce Burrell, director of the Calgary Emergency Management Agency, said power could be out in the core of the city for days or weeks. ""The city of Calgary took a pretty hard hit, but we're a resilient city,"" Burrell said at a news conference Sunday. ""We want to recover as quickly as possible, we want to get people into their homes and businesses as quickly as possible, we want to restore the city as quickly as possible."" The city was under a state of emergency late Saturday, but Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the flow of the water was slowing and some people could start returning home.

"(CNN) -- A new search for an American teen who went missing on a mountain in Ecuador turned up no clues, the teen's father said Friday. August Reiger has been missing since Sunday, when he went on a hike on a mountain overlooking the town of Banos. He was supposed to reunite with his family on the trail, but he was nowhere to be found. Ecuadorian authorities have been searching for him for days, and on Friday, they once again scoured the mountain where he was last seen. ""There's nothing to tell, really,"" said his father, Chris Reiger. ""We still don't have anything."" Search crews that have canvassed the mountain will do so once again to make sure he is not there. Chris Reiger says the family hasn't ruled out the possibility of a kidnapping but adds that ""none of this adds up. None of it."" August Reiger, who was his class valedictorian, has experience traveling abroad, including in his mother's home country of Syria, his father said. ""He's traveled so much before,"" Chris Reiger said. ""We always went (to Damascus) every summer before the war broke out there. He's been to way more dangerous places than this."" Family members say it appears he vanished without a trace after they split up during a hike in the mountainous area 100 miles south of the capital, Quito. Lira de la Paz Villalva, governor of Ecuador's Tungurahua province, said local authorities don't have any leads about what could have caused the teen's disappearance. August had just graduated from the Classen School of Advanced Studies in Oklahoma City, said Shannon Schmoyer, Reiger's father's cousin. The 18-year-old had asked his parents for a trip to a Spanish-speaking country as a graduation present, she said. Gallery: Missing children who were found .

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors in New York on Friday charged a one-eyed veteran Islamist fighter with crimes related to a brazen attack on a gas facility in Algeria earlier this year that left 37 hostages dead, including three Americans. Mokhtar Belmokhtar was charged on various conspiracy counts including hostage-taking, kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda, and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern district of New York. He is currently at large. While there was no elaboration from federal prosecutors on why the charges against a non-U.S. citizen, stemming from an attack in Alergia, were filed in New York, the attack resulted in deaths of Americans. ""Mokhtar Belmokhtar unleashed a reign of terror years ago, in furtherance of his self-proclaimed goal of waging bloody jihad against the West,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a release from the Justice Department. ""His efforts culminated in a five-day siege that left dozens dead, including three Americans, and hundreds of others fearing for their lives."" Belmokhtar is the founder of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, also known as the al-Mulathamun Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for the January attack. ""The charges against Mokhtar Belmokhtar describe a fanatical jihadist leading an extremist vanguard of an extremist ideology,"" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said in the Justice Department statement. ""As alleged, he kidnapped diplomats, formed his own terrorist organization that pledged fealty to al-Qaeda, and masterminded the murderous siege of a civilian plant in Algeria that resulted in the deaths of dozens of hostages."" In the Algerian siege, heavily-armed militants in pickup trucks struck a sprawling state-owned natural gas complex near In Amenas, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up, according to Algerian Prime Minister Prime Minister Abdul Malek Sallal. After taking control of the facility, the militants planted explosives throughout the complex. The military tried to negotiate with the militants, but their demands to release militants held prisoner in Algeria were deemed unreasonable, leading to intervention by special forces troops backed by the Algerian Air Force, according to Sallal. The gas facility operated in cooperation with foreign energy firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP -- and as such, employed workers from several Western countries. Belmokhtar said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. Belmokhtar was designated as a foreign terrorist by the United States Department of Treasury in 2003 and is considered a key figure in al Qaeda's efforts in North Africa. The State Department has a $5 million dollar reward out for information on his whereabouts.","3 Americans died in a brazen attack on a gas facility earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- A third person has died in the extensive flooding that has deluged entire towns and threatens even more communities in southern Alberta, Canada, authorities announced Saturday. The three victims, two females and a male, were all found in the Highwood River that runs through the town of High River, about 40 miles south of Calgary, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Officials did not identify the victims. High River is one of the worst-affected areas in the flooding that began after torrential mountain rains. At one point, the entire town of 13,000 was covered in brown floodwater and all residents are under an evacuation order, Cpl. Laurel Kading of the RCMP told CNN. There was ""substantial"" and ""extensive"" damage in the town, where waters rose so rapidly Thursday that about 1,000 people had to be airlifted or rescued by boat, the RCMP said. Kading described one man who dropped his keys when the water began rising, and when he stood up, the water was at his waist. The local news site High River Online reported river levels down substantially on Saturday in some parts of the town, but high water remaining in others. Photographs from the site Saturday showed a large pickup truck entirely caked in mud, indicating how high the water had reached. Another showed a submerged railway bridge covered in tree trunks and tree limbs. More photos showed buildings and roads still submerged. The RCMP said it was conducting door-to-door checks of homes throughout High River. There also was severe flooding to the west of the town, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. ""All the little towns all the way along have been affected to some degree or another,"" Kading said. ""There are reports of some farms in rural areas where some people have been stranded as well."" To the east, the city of Medicine Hat was preparing for the South Saskatchewan River to burst its banks. City Hall was lined with sandbags. The city predicted water to spill over the banks overnight Saturday and keep rising until it crests Monday morning. About 10,000 people in Medicine Hat, population 62,000, were evacuated ahead of the flooding. City spokesman Brandy Calvert said officials expect the flood to eclipse the one they had in 1995, which was the biggest on record. ""We don't want to anticipate the worst, but we're going to be prepared for the worst,"" Alberta Premier Alison Redford said before visiting the city Saturday. ""We know that from what we've seen everywhere else that this is more exceptional than we've ever seen in Alberta before, so we're presuming that that's probably the circumstance that we're looking at (in Medicine Hat) as well."" Calgary was still covered in water days after the Bow and Elbow rivers overflowed. The city was under a state of emergency Saturday, though Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the flow of the water was slowing and some people could start returning home Saturday night. The home of the NHL Calgary Flames, the Saddledome, also was flooded. The team posted pictures on its website showing the darkened interior of the dome with brown water sitting at row eight, blocking the entrance to the players' tunnel. Downtown Calgary will be closed until the middle of next week at the earliest, said Nenshi's spokesman, Daorcey Le Bray. About 30,000 power customers were without power, the city said. A pedestrian bridge over the Elbow River was damaged and city assessors were trying to determine the state of the dozens of other bridges, Calgary Police said.","The three victims are in the flooded town of High River .

"(CNN) -- Mexican forces scored a potentially strong hit against the Zetas drug cartel with the capture of one of its top leaders, Ivan Velazquez Caballero, alias ""El Taliban."" Mexican marines arrested the person ""presumed to be and who says he is"" Velazquez in the north-central state of San Luis Potosi on Wednesday, officials said. Velazquez is ""one of the principal leaders of the Zetas cartel,"" the Mexican navy said in a statement. Gulf cartel boss arrested . Additional details were to be released Thursday. Velazquez's name appears on the list of Mexico's 37 most wanted traffickers. Authorities were offering a reward of 30 million pesos ($2.3 million) for information leading to his arrest. The Zetas are one of Mexico's major drug cartels, known for its violence. Recent reports indicated that Velazquez was in a power struggle with another Zetas leader, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales. If confirmed, the capture would be another success for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's war on the drug cartels, which has left tens of thousands dead, but done little to reduce the amount of drugs transported through the country.

"(Time) -- The iPhone is known for its simplicity, but not everything about it is obvious. Beyond its straightforward grid of apps lies plenty of tricks that make Apple's phone easier to use. Here are 10 essential iPhone tips and tricks, starting with some basics and moving up to more advanced maneuvers: . Tap up top to scroll back up . If you're ever at the bottom of a long web page or app and need to get back to the top, don't bother scrolling. Instead, just tap the top of the screen, and the iPhone will scroll all the way back up on its own. This one's an all-time classic, and hard to live without once you know it's there. Double-tap home and swipe for quick controls . You may already know that you can double tap the iPhone's home button to bring up a list of most recent apps, but not everyone realizes that this menu swipes in both directions. Swipe from left to right, and you'll get quick access to rotation lock and music playback controls. Swipe again in the same direction for a volume slider. Double-tap home for lock screen music controls . For fast access to music controls while your iPhone's screen is locked, just double tap the home button. The great thing about this feature is that it works with whatever audio app is currently in use, not just the built-in Music player. Take a panoramic photo from either direction . In iOS 6, the iPhone's camera app has a built-in panorama feature, which you can access through the camera's Options menu. By default, you must pan the iPhone from left to right to capture a panorama, but you can reverse the direction by tapping the arrow on the screen. Note that this feature only works on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S. Streamline street names in iOS 6 Maps . Apple's new Maps app is a work in progress, but you can already make it better with one simple tweak: Under iPhone Settings, go to the Maps section and change the label size to small. The smaller text allows more street names to appear on screen at once, so you don't have to zoom in to see them all. The layout looks a bit cleaner too--provided your vision is good enough to read smaller words. New Siri trick: Raise to Speak . Don't want your dialog with Siri to be heard? Go to Settings > General > Siri and turn on ""Raise to Speak."" When enabled, and the screen is on, Siri will start listening when you hold the phone up to your ear--as indicated by a chime--and she'll respond to queries through the iPhone's earpiece instead of the external speakers. You might even fool some people into thinking it's a real conversation. (For more Siri tricks and tips, check out my post from last year.) Attach a photo or video in Mail . Yes, Apple really did take five years to let people attach photos and videos from directly within the Mail app. Just tap and hold anywhere in the message body to bring up a small pop-up box. The option to ""Insert Photo or Video"" will appear unless the e-mail already contains text, in which case you'll have to tap the little arrow on the right side of the pop-up to see the option. Set a time range for do not disturb . Do Not Disturb is a new feature in iOS 6 that lets you silence all incoming text messages, phone calls and notifications. You can toggle Do Not Disturb under Settings, or you can set up daily quiet hours by going to Settings > Notifications and selecting Do Not Disturb at the top of the screen. From there, you can set a time range, always allow calls from certain contacts and prevent silencing on repeated calls. Keep your photos backed up without plugging In . There are several ways to make backups of your iPhone photos without going through iTunes. The built-in solution is Apple's Photo Stream, which makes your last 30 days' worth of photos available on almost any device. Turn on Photo Stream by going to Settings > Photos & Camera, and your photos will automatically show up on your other iOS devices and Macs. To access Photo Stream on a Windows PC, you must download Apple's iCloud Control Panel, which creates a Photo Stream folder under ""Favorites"" in Windows Explorer. Photo Stream isn't the only way to back up your photos. Google+ and Dropbox can automatically upload new photos every time you their respective apps, so you'll always have online copies available from any Internet-connected device. Set up push Gmail or Hotmail . If you're a true e-mail addict, setting up Gmail or Hotmail through the preset ""Add Account"" dialog isn't good enough, because it can't immediately push new messages to the phone. Instead, you can set up these inboxes through Microsoft Exchange, so new emails get pushed right to your iPhone. To get started, go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account... and select Microsoft Exchange. On the next page, enter your full e-mail address, password and whatever inbox name you'd like, then hit ""Next."" More options will appear. Enter ""m.google.com"" or ""m.hotmail.com"" in the Server field, leave the Domain field blank, enter your full e-mail address in the Username field, and your password in the Password field. Hit ""Next,"" and on the next page, deselect Contacts and Calendars unless you want to overwrite your phone's existing contacts and calendar. Hit ""Save,"" and you're good to go.

"Lac-Megantic, Quebec (CNN) -- Edward Burkhardt said he tried to get the people of Lac-Megantic, Quebec, to hear him, to try to understand that he had traveled to their town because he genuinely cared, he told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday. The 74-year-old chairman of Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway wanted to answer any questions from officials and hear people out about the anguish they feel after a driverless train carrying tank cars oil rolled out of control, exploding in an inferno. As of Friday night, 28 people were confirmed dead -- up from 24 earlier in the day -- Quebec coroner's office spokeswoman Genevieve Guilbault said. Quebec Provincial Police Capt. Michel Forget had said a day earlier that about about 30 more were still missing. The blaze may have vaporized victims, authorities said. Burkhardt expected that he'd face raw emotions, but was surprised that so much anger was directed at him. ""I'd been told about it. I'd been warned about it,"" he said. ""But it was worse than I thought. I thought people would respond to my willingness to come there. I mean, they were screaming about how I took three days to get there."" The tragedy occurred Saturday. Burkhardt arrived in Lac-Megantic Wednesday. ""Well, the three days we had a dozen people on the scene and I was organizing all kinds of things that were necessary,"" he said. ""And I figured I didn't really need to be in the way of people there when they were trying to put the fire out and that sort of stuff. ""I would wait till the dust settled to a certain degree and then I would come. That's what I did, but this was not well-received at all."" On Wednesday, two middle-aged men shouted at Burkhardt as he spoke with reporters, calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the tragedy. One of the men, Pierre L'Heureux, told CNN he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing. ""They should put that guy in prison,"" L'Heureux said. ""He's a murderer ... he should be in prison."" ""People wanted to throw stones at me. I showed up and they threw stones. But that doesn't accomplish anything,"" Burkhardt told CNN said. Graphic: Runaway train devastates Canadian town . Attempts to set up meetings with city officials and rescue workers were unsuccessful, he said. ""I failed with all that,"" he told CNN. ""They were too busy. They didn't want to meet."" His visit to the town was ""designed to get a healing process under way,"" he said, but he was misunderstood. ""Maybe I didn't present my case very well. But I'm not a communications professional. I'm a manager."" The executive with more than 50 years in the railway business told CNN that he could get ""quite emotional"" talking about the train disaster. ""They talked about that I had no empathy, or no sympathy, and in fact I have plenty,"" he said. ""I can imagine myself being in that kind of situation and I also would be grieving and I'd be very unhappy. I'd be very mad about the whole thing so I certainly understand the need to vent. But it comes a point where it's totally unproductive."" Burkhardt told CNN that that is why he has decided not to return to Lac-Megantic on Thursday. CNN spoke to him in Sherbrooke, an hour and a half outside Lac-Megantic, the closest area with an available hotel room. ""I'm willing to come back (to Lac-Megantic) at a later date when maybe things are a little calmer, a little more settled down,"" he said. CNN asked the railway executive what he believed was the cause of the disaster. ""Well, there's no question that it's a brake failure on the train. The train rolled away. That speaks for itself, doesn't it?"" he answered. ""There's no sugarcoating that."" ""What caused the brake failure is a bit complex it's more than one factor,"" he continued, saying that the company is still ""trying to pull all the pieces together on that."" Burkhardt has said that the train engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines.

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of more than one million people taking to the streets in anti-government demonstrations, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff vowed Friday to talk with protest leaders but warned the government would not tolerate violence. The warning came amid sporadic reports of looting, people breaking into public buildings and protesters setting fires during demonstrations that appeared to take the government by surprise this week. The movement has brought together Brazilians angered by a government they say is shortchanging its duties to its citizens while spending lavishly on events such as the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games. ""We cannot live with this violence,"" Rousseff said in a nationally televised address. She called on security forces to work within the framework of the country's law to prevent violence and vandalism. Rousseff said she planned to meet with leaders of the protest movement, but did not publicly detail when or where the meetings would take place. Her remarks followed an emergency meeting with her Cabinet. While most of the protests have remained peaceful, there have been reports of sporadic violence that have resulted in two deaths. On Friday, state-run Agencia Brasil reported an employee of the city of Belem, who as cleaning the streets near the mayor's office, died after being ""shocked"" by clashes between police and protesters. The news agency did not say how the woman died, but reported that she suffered from hypertension and was transported to a hospital, where she died Friday morning. Another protest-related casualty reportedly occurred Thursday in Sao Paulo state, where a young man was run over by an SUV at an intersection during a demonstration, state police said. Even after various state governments repealed the public transportation fare hikes that spurred the discontent, more than a million people took to the streets across the country on Thursday. Until now, the government's position was to support the protests as peaceful freedom of expression, and it is unclear whether there will be a shift as violent incidents mount and the unrest continues. ""It's a very delicate balance, and it's not very simple,"" Roberto Jaguaribe, Brazil's ambassador to the United Kingdom, told CNN. The government wants to protect protesters and property, while not being overbearing with its response. It's presumptuous, Jaguaribe said, to assume that the government understands what is taking place on the streets and the forces behind it. Protesters say they want to see more expenditures on education and health care, changes that cannot be done quickly. The majority of marchers are young and well-educated. ""One of the problems is that the normal democratic channels that are established are not followed by these people,"" Jaguaribe said. ""They don't feel represented adequately by these channels. They want to to create something new."" ""We have to understand that and see how it goes,"" he said. The mood in Sao Paulo, one of the centers of the protests, was tense Friday. Many were anxious to hear a message from Rousseff. The protests come amid the soccer Confederations Cup tournament, a friendly array of matches, in which the host country, Brazil, plays against a small group of national teams from around the globe. The cup serves as a precursor to the World Cup. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: President Dilma Rousseff says she will meet with protest leaders .

"(CNN) -- Should baby food makers be required to post lead warnings on their products in California? That's the question at stake in a civil trial that kicked off Monday in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland. Some of the country's biggest baby food makers are defendants in the case, including Beech-Nut Nutrition, Del Monte Foods, Dole and Gerber. In a 2011 lawsuit, the Environmental Law Foundation alleged that many of those companies' foods and juices contain lead and that under California law, they are required to warn consumers. The suit targets products marketed and intended for babies and toddlers, including grape juice, packaged peaches and pears, carrots and sweet potatoes. It seeks to require the companies to put warning labels on their products, and face penalties of up to $2,500 per violation per day. ""Our hope is that rather than put the labels on, these companies will get off their duffs and do what all their competitors are doing and just get the lead out,"" said Jim Wheaton, president of the Environmental Law Foundation, a California-based environmental group. ""We banned lead in paint, we banned it in gasoline. What is it doing in baby food?"" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 500,000 U.S. children ages 1 to 5 have unsafe levels of lead in their blood. Exposure to lead can affect virtually every system in the body and cause intellectual and behavioral deficits. Representatives for Del Monte and Gerber declined to discuss the case Monday, both saying they do not comment on pending litigation. Messages left with Dole and Beech-Nut were not immediately returned. Attorneys for the defendants have previously argued they will show no warnings are required. ""Despite the trace amounts of lead in the products at issue, the federal government has determined that Americans need to eat more -- not less -- of these nutritious foods,"" they said in court documents. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade group, released a statement stressing that Food and Drug Administration tests on products in the lawsuit found they do not pose any health concerns. ""Many minerals, including lead, are found naturally in soil and water throughout the world. As a result, virtually all foods grown in nature, including fruit -- whether fresh or packaged -- contain trace levels of such naturally occurring minerals,"" it said. ""Recognizing this, the FDA regularly tests a wide variety of foods, including fruit juice and packaged fruit products, for lead and other minerals. The FDA has repeatedly concluded that these categories of products do not contain lead in amounts that would pose an unacceptable health risk to adults or children."" The trial, which is expected to last three to four weeks, has no jury. It's being heard by Judge Steven Brick. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","The lawsuit was filed by a California environmental group in 2011 .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- When Ahmed Jama decided to leave behind the successful restaurant he'd started in London to open a new one in one of the world's most dangerous cities, his hometown of Mogadishu, reactions ranged from surprise to scorn to straightforward questioning of his sanity. ""A lot of people think that I am a crazy guy,"" says the Somali chef, his wiry figure looming over roasting pans full of vegetables and meat inside his downtown Mogadishu eatery. ""When I opened this restaurant they could not believe it,"" he remembers. ""When I came here and bought the land some people told me, 'you are not coming back, come back when you're ready' -- I said, 'I am going to build it soon.'"" And he did. A risk taker, in 2008 Jama chose to open his first Somalia-based restaurant in Kilometer Four, a dangerous area in Mogadishu where battles would often rage between various factions fighting for control of the city. ""That is the only reason I opened it,"" says Jama, who grew up in Mogadishu before heading to the UK to study culinary arts. ""If I do, people are going to see; they are going to say, 'he has done it, why are we not doing it?'"" Read this: Holidays in Somalia, anyone? Jama realized that, despite more than 20 years of conflict, there was money to be made here. And now, five years on, Jama owns not one but five popular restaurants across the Somali capital, all of which sell fresh local foods to its growing middle class. But Jama's bold move was spurred on by more than just profits. His mission was to give his fellow countrymen, who'd been scarred by years of war, something greater than just good food. He wanted to offer a taste of normal life and a sense of hope for the future. ""The only reason why I came here is to change the lives of the people who don't have somewhere to work and people who have been locked indoors and they don't have anywhere to go and socialize,"" says Jama. ""Basically, what I am looking for is to show them, 'yes, you can laugh when you finish work, university, office work, wherever you are, you have somewhere to go.'"" War-torn Mogadishu has for decades been known for the lawlessness and poverty governing its streets. But today, things are starting to change as hope gradually returns to parts of the East African country. With increased security and stability, for the first time in a long time Mogadishu is beginning to open for business. International and regional flights are on the rise, real estate is booming and at the seaport, the country's key national asset, there is a frenzy of activity as commercial ships and boats line up in the harbor carrying goods for import and export. Part of this rising business activity is Jama's chain of restaurants, all called ""The Village,"" that dot the city. The chef and restaurant owner is just one of a growing number of Somalis who, after years abroad, are now returning to be part of their country's economic renaissance. ""I wanted to reach where no one has ever reached before and I just wanted to show the world, everyone, that for Somalia this is a time we can take more and remove that dangerous label and to show them that we need help,"" says Jama. ""To show them this is time for peace and for living."" Read this: Rappers defy bullets for Mogadishu concert . From his eatery in the heart of Mogadishu to his seafront restaurant in Jazeera beach, Jama's establishments are known as the go-to places in a city that was mostly off limits until recently. Now people gather here to meet friends, eat freshly made Somali food, sip cappuccino and even smoke a pipe of flavored tobacco, albeit discreetly. ""Here it is a beautiful place to come over the weekends,"" says local client Ali Ahmed. ""It's beautiful to come out and sit and eat food at the restaurant."" The relatively peaceful business environment in Mogadishu is propped up by African Union security forces. They've been able to squeeze out the Al-Qaeda linked militant group Al-Shabaab from the city. But the insurgents seeking to impose strict Islamic rule still launch sporadic terror attacks. Last year, suicide bombers attacked one of Jama's restaurants, killing several people. ""People get into my restaurant feeling like they are going out; they have somewhere to sit and have a nice ice cream, have a nice coffee, lobsters too -- there is all of that that makes people come to my restaurant. But politicians and Al-Shabaab they don't like each other -- that's what makes them target my restaurant,"" says Jama. Despite the danger, Jama is undeterred. He sees his restaurants as more than just somewhere to eat. He sees them as providing hope and has no regrets for leaving the comforts of his life in London to start a business in his country. ""I know why I have done it and I want the people to feel that this is what we need to (make things) change,"" says Jama. ""My dream is to have tourism and travel holidays, a mixture of people -- white, black, everyone -- coming on holiday (to Mogadishu). That's my dream.""","Somali chef Ahmed Jama owns five restaurants across Mogadishu .

"Boston (CNN) -- In the end, the Etch A Sketch didn't work. Mitt Romney, the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the Republican presidential hopeful, failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat President Barack Obama and jump-start the economy. ""We have given our all to this campaign,"" Romney told supporters in his concession speech. ""I so wish that I had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction, but the nation chose another leader, and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation."" The result brought an end to Romney's longtime ambitions to become the nation's commander-in-chief. He had come up short in the GOP primary in 2008, but maintained his ambition and launched his 2012 candidacy on a farm in New Hampshire. Opinion: Romney couldn't overcome contradictions . He stumped across the nation, focusing on key swing states such as Ohio and Florida, selling himself as the ultimate alternative to Obama -- a man who understood how to fix the economy and who had worked across the aisle as governor in largely Democratic Massachusetts. ""America is a land of opportunity. But lately, for too many Americans, opportunity has not exactly come knocking,"" Romney wrote in a recent opinion piece on CNN.com. ""We've been mired in an economic slowdown that has left millions of our fellow citizens unemployed. The consequences in dreams shattered, lives disrupted, plans deferred, and hopes dimmed can be found all around us."" The son of a former Michigan governor and auto executive, Romney has long been known among friends for his leadership skills. ""This guy is impressive as far as executive ability goes,"" Romney friend Philip Barlow wrote his mom in 1982. ""I think he could be president of the United States."" Reflecting on that note now, Barlow said, ""I was that impressed with his executive abilities and him as a leader."" Barlow is a professor of Mormon history and culture and the director of the religious studies program at Utah State University. He served as one of two counselors to then-Bishop Romney in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Portrayals of Romney as ""being out of touch with the poor seem kind of silly to me,"" Barlow said. ""I knew him on that level of real human stuff as opposed to the public image,"" Barlow said. ""The man that I knew is not a caricature. He's not a man without compassion for the poor."" But it is that image of Romney -- an out-of-touch rich guy who shipped jobs overseas as the head of Bain Capital -- that stuck. During various stages along the way, Romney said ""corporations are people"" and that he ""likes being able to fire people."" And that was long before his now infamous 47% moocher line. Romney's Republican opponents in the primaries, and the Obama campaign and Democrats after that, helped create that caricature, defining Romney to the electorate before Romney tried to show them who he was. At one point, senior Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom said the fall campaign is ""like Etch A Sketch. You can shake it up and we start all over again."" It was a comment that dogged the campaign and only served as political fodder of Romney as a flip-flopper, waffler and a candidate with no core values. GOP expands majority in governors' mansions . But even then, he won the GOP primary, although evangelicals initially were lukewarm to embrace a Mormon who seemed disconnected with the Republican base. Trailing Obama in polls through the summer, Romney did try to shake up the Etch A Sketch picture he had created of himself as a ""severely conservative"" candidate, as he once described himself before a gathering of conservatives, tacking to the center in the last weeks of the campaign. But that might have only hurt him, contributing to the image of a politician with no firm convictions. The fallout late Tuesday was almost immediate within the party. How could Obama have won in an electoral landslide when the economy is sluggish, the country is polarized and a sizable chunk of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track? ""The takeaway is that a candidate can run for office with a lot of money, but when it takes him until March of 2012 to even get 25% support within his own party, you're running a weak nominee,"" said Erick Erickson, RedState.com editor and CNN contributor. The tea party was quick to jump on the defeat. ""What we got was a weak moderate candidate, hand-picked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots. The strong language served as a salvo to the GOP and a sign of the potential civil war ahead within the party. Romney had emerged from the primary season as the best alternative after the GOP cycled through a series of hard-line conservatives. In doing so, the once-moderate Massachusetts governor turned to the right, on abortion, health care and immigration. Even within the Republican Party, many wondered what Romney's principles were: Was he the pro-health care governor who supported abortion rights, or the GOP candidate who pledged to repeal Obamacare and spoke against abortion rights? And why was he not touting his economic vision for the country more? ""You can make the case against Mitt Romney that he didn't sell those business credentials well enough,"" said Gloria Borger, CNN's chief political analyst. ""There will be some Republicans who say it wasn't us. It was him."" ""There's pretty common agreement,"" Erickson added, ""that he really didn't run a campaign on the big ideas that he claims. He was rather guarded, even through the debates, on what exactly he was and was not going to do. The Obama campaign hounded him a lot on what his plan was."" The presidential election results are seen as a repudiation of the Republican Party. Most pundits predicted a bitter battle within the party on immigration -- that if the far right doesn't change its intractable position, then the GOP is doomed down the road. GOP retains control of the House . ""The Republican Party needs to move forward, not sideways,"" said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. Castellanos, who was a Romney adviser in 2008, compared this moment to the early 1990s for Democrats, when Bill Clinton brought the party closer to the center. ""They transformed their party. Republicans are still seen as the party of not having enough solutions,"" Castellanos said. ""We've got a failing, tanking economy going over the cliff -- and the opposition party was not seen as an alternative."" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen agreed, saying it's imperative that the GOP transform itself. ""It's extremely unhealthy for the country to have a Republican Party that relies on whites for about 90% of their national vote,"" he said. Borger said President George W. Bush was rebuffed by the GOP base when he pushed for immigration reform 10 years ago -- a stance she said haunted this election for Republicans. ""When you look back on this election, when you look back to the primaries, when you look back to Mitt Romney moving to the right on immigration,"" Borger said, ""I think it was a huge opportunity that they missed."" There will be gnashing of teeth in the days, weeks and months ahead. What lies in store for the Republican Party remains a long way off. Shortly before 1 a.m. Wednesday, Romney walked onto a stage in Boston and told the crowd he had called Obama to congratulate him on the victory. ""I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation,"" he said. At the end, he walked from the podium to the middle of the stage and gave his wife, Ann, a kiss. Running mate Paul Ryan and his wife, Janna, and Romney family members joined him. The crowd chanted, ""Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!"" He and Ann then walked hand-in-hand. The Romneys exited stage right.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the latest salvo of a pitched political battle over Internal Revenue Service targeting, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee said Tuesday that interviews with 15 tax agency employees found no evidence of bias or White House manipulation alleged by Republicans. ""Despite an extremely aggressive investigation involving thousands of documents and more than a dozen interviews of IRS employees, the overwhelming evidence before the committee reveals no political motivation or White House involvement in this process,"" said the memo made public by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's ranking Democrat. The committee chaired by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California will hold another hearing on the IRS targeting on Thursday, continuing a probe that has bitterly divided its two party leaders. Cummings accuses Issa of conducting a partisan witch hunt and making false accusations about the scandal first uncovered in May by an inspector general's report that detailed how the IRS targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Issa and other Republicans have claimed the targeting amounted to a campaign by President Barack Obama's White House to go after political foes, with some comparing it to the Watergate scandal that forced President Richard Nixon from office. Democrats have pushed back, led by Cummings. Last week, he revealed new documents indicating the IRS subjected both liberal and conservative organizations to additional tax scrutiny in recent years. Dems highlight IRS targeting of other groups . The memo Cummings made public Tuesday was written by the committee's Democratic staff. It contained excerpts of interviews with 15 IRS employees from the committee's investigation of the targeting cited by the inspector general's report. In the excerpts, the employees who identified themselves as Republicans, Democrats and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency's handling of tax-exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations. Under tax law and IRS regulations, groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax-exempt status. According to the Cummings memo, an IRS tax law specialist based in Washington who described herself as Republican said ""no, not at all"" when asked if there was any evidence that the agency targeted Obama's political enemies. ""That's kind of laughable that people think that,"" the memo quoted the woman as saying. She described the situation as a lack of guidance regarding how to deal with politically affiliated groups seeking tax-exempt status at the IRS unit based in Cincinnati that handles such applications. Thursday's hearing promises to be a fiery showdown between Cummings and Issa over the initial inspector general's report and the subsequent findings and accusations by both sides. According to the House website, the inspector general for tax administration, who wrote the report on IRS targeting, will be a witness along with past and present IRS employees in the tax-exempt division. Cummings demanded last week the inspector general, J. Russell George, be called to appear again before the committee to answer questions about why his original report failed to note that liberal groups also were targeted for extra scrutiny. The IRS probe ""has been characterized by one-sided and partial information leading to unsubstantiated accusations with no basis in fact,"" Cummings said. George's report in May indicated that lax oversight at the IRS allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups starting in 2010 and continuing until last year. In particular, the report said IRS workers in the tax-exempt unit used ""Be on the Lookout"" or BOLO lists of words such as tea party to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny. George subsequently testified that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted. However, Cummings said the information made public last week showed that George was aware that liberal groups also were targeted. Conservative group takes IRS, top Obama officials to court . In addition, Cummings revealed a May 2013 e-mail from George's deputy that noted how 5,500 internal IRS e-mails were reviewed as part of an effort to discover any directing of staff to target ""Tea Party and other political organizations,"" as well as any subsequent coverup. ""There was a 'Be On the Lookout' (BOLO) list specifically naming these groups,"" the deputy inspector general's e-mail notes. ""However, the e-mails indicated the organizations needed to be pulled because the IRS employees were not sure how to process them, not because they wanted to stall or hinder the application."" The deputy's e-mail goes on to stress that ""there was no indication that pulling these selected applications was politically motivated."" In response to the documents Cummings made public last week, Issa's office said conservative groups underwent tighter scrutiny than liberal groups. ""These documents, once again, refute misleading attempts to equate routine scrutiny of other groups involved in advocacy to the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups by IRS officials,"" spokesman Ali Ahmed told CNN. ""As has been documented, while 100% of Tea Party applications were systematically stopped and scrutinized for a 27-month period, at the same time dozens of progressive applications were approved by the IRS,"" Ahmed said.

"(CNN) -- My name is Shanon and I'm a flirtaholic. As you're reading this, I'm probably flirting with some poor unsuspecting male -- a doorman, my doctor, a rock star. My come-hither-ness was first called out when I was 22. It was a gloriously sunny day in Sydney and the male friend I was having coffee with leaned across the table and said, ""You know, you're an insatiable flirt."" ""That's ridiculous!"" I scoffed while batting my eyelids at him. Flirting is a skill that might come quite naturally (perhaps cringe-inducingly) to some, yet a woman I recently met at a friend's party introduced me to the idea that many people find flirting as terrifying as swimming with sharks. Her name was Tracey Steinberg; she smiled an awful lot, and she told me she was a dating coach who hosts ""flirting parties"" in Manhattan. ""Go on,"" I said with a raised eyebrow. Many of her clients don't know the first thing about breaking the ice with strangers they're attracted to, she explained. They freeze, go mute, look at the floor or blurt out a depressing fact about hurricane devastation. Steinberg arranges outings for groups of five or so adults with the desire to boost their courting potential, takes them to a busy bar, gives them a pep talk, then forces them to approach attractive strangers and, well, get cutesy. This sounded like something I had to witness firsthand. And it made me wonder, if people are willing to pay experts to teach them to flirt ($95 for one of Steinberg's two-hour flirting parties), what does that say about the role flirting plays in our lives? Is it just a bonus skill that's nice to have, like being able to roll sushi or pole dance? Or is it a necessary function of bringing soul mates together? The lost art of offline dating . According to Fran Greene, a dating and flirting coach and author of ""The Flirting Bible,"" it's a bit of both. ""Flirting allows you to meet someone you would ordinarily be too timid or terrified to approach,"" she says. ""No matter what the outcome, there is a sense of magic that occurs when you flirt. The more you flirt, the better you get and the more people you will bring into your life."" Sadly, when I rocked up to Steinberg's flirting party in my flirtiest maternity dress, bitterly cold New York temperatures had kept all but one of her clients away. But this was good news for the single lady, Becky, because with Steinberg all to herself, she'd get more bang for her buck (so to speak.) Over drinks at an upscale pool hall, Steinberg prepped Becky with a recap of the do's and don'ts: ""It's about having a natural smile, soft eyes""... ""make yourself available and approachable""... ""be complimentary' ... ""maintaining eye contact is key""... ""don't be too quick to dismiss him if he says something weird""...""keep the conversation light and breezy."" Becky, an artist in her 30s, nodded slowly, hanging on every word as though she was learning of a secret plot to end the world. Becky's main obstacle to being a pro flirter, Steinberg told me later, is her brain. ""The people I work with tend to be very accomplished in their career, very intellectual,"" she said. ""But it really gets in the way of flirting because flirting is with your body, it's not with your mind."" Perhaps to emphasize that last point, Steinberg put Becky through one final exercise before we got to the practical portion of the evening: . ""Who is your ideal hot guy?"" she asked. ""Hmmm. Daniel Craig,"" Becky said. ""And what would you say to him if he was standing right over there?"" After a couple of dud suggestions from Becky, Steinberg chimed in and threw out a bunch of icebreakers that might snag the attention of our current James Bond. ""OK, let's go meet some guys!"" Steinberg said, all gung-ho. Not satisfied there were enough men at the pool hall, she led us across the street to another bar to find Daniel Craig. To be clear, these parties are not about hooking up. Nor are they about finding your future husband or wife. They're all about getting practice. Nick is a journalist in his late 40s living in New York who found the hands-on approach useful when he attended a flirting party just for dudes a couple of weeks ago. ""Basically, I'm a successful guy,"" he said. ""But the notion of walking up to a woman I've never met and striking up a conversation is paralyzing. Imagine the terror you might feel if you had to give a speech to 10,000 people while wearing only your underwear. That terrifies me less than approaching a woman in public."" Gosh. What helps, Nick has learned, is to get that large pesky brain out of the way. How technology has changed romance . ""Don't think too much,"" he says. ""I can be paralyzed by, say, the fact that I don't have the perfect opening line. ... Tracey preaches not thinking at that moment. You've just got to plunge in and say something."" To be honest, I wasn't sure Becky had the mustard to talk to a single guy in the bar, and I was starting to feel nervous for her. But when she emerged from the restroom, she'd taken her long dark hair out of her ponytail, a definite step in the sexy direction. And with Steinberg at her side goading her, she suddenly picked a target and just went for it. (This was actually Becky's second flirting party, so she knew the drill.) ""Are you all here for a group function?"" she asked a man in his 40s who took an instant liking to her. They chatted for a while until Becky noticed he was wearing a wedding ring and gently extracted herself from the situation. Later, as Becky made her way to the bar, flashing a warm smile was all it took for a tall, handsome guy sipping a glass of red wine to ask her which sport she was watching (we were in a sports bar, because that's where you go when you're looking for bountiful testosterone). The conversation that followed was promising. The handsome dude was from Nigeria, and Becky came up with all sorts of questions to keep things flowing. Unfortunately, one of those questions was ""Do you have a green card?"" which as Steinberg pointed out later, didn't exactly fall under the ""light and breezy"" category. But it didn't matter. Nor did it matter that she'd be going home without a phone number or a date planned. Becky had achieved her goal; she'd put aside fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of being boring, fear of being too short, tall, old, young, whatever, and had broken the ice with complete strangers. ""I'm really proud of you,"" Steinberg said sincerely after a quick debrief. ""You did really well tonight."" Becky looked exhausted but somewhat triumphant as she waved goodbye and headed for the subway. Sure, flirting experts will tell you it's possible to go from having no flirting skills whatsoever to becoming a flirting genius. Greene says she's transformed people in 30 days. Steinberg contends that everyone has the ability to flirt; it's just a matter of accessing that ability and putting some muscle behind it. Dora, a busy finance executive in her mid-40s, rated her flirting skills as one out of 10 before she started flexing her flirtimus to the maximus. ""It was not something that I thought was important in meeting single men in my age range,"" she said. ""My thinking was if someone is interested they will speak to you. Not the case, as I have learned. Men need to know you are open, friendly and approachable. ""For me it was a six-month process of learning this new skill and putting it to work in my life. But once you learn, you realize how easy and fun it really is. You have nothing to lose and all to gain. I can walk into a restaurant, a bar, a dry cleaners, a coffee shop and easily strike up a conversation with a potential adorable single guy."" Scoff all you like at the idea of a dating coaches and the like.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- After a chorus of cries for social justice echoed through the streets of Brazil for days, protesters called for a time out Wednesday. Despite the anticipated lull in street marches, the government will beef up security with the deployment of elite police officers and firefighters. The protests, which started over a hike in bus fares, have had some effect. On Wednesday, the state of Sao Paulo announced that the hike in bus fares would be reversed, state media reported. In addition, a handful of states have passed laws to lower the price of a city bus ticket since protests began, and politicians elsewhere showed signs of bending to the public pressure, saying they may also notch fares back down. Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad had earlier warned that eliminating the fare hikes would mean less investment in other areas, but in the end erased the increases. Not satisfied . Protesters say the poorest are being short-changed while the government spends the large bills on new stadiums and glitzy infrastructure for the soccer World Cup Brazil is hosting next year and the Olympic Games coming in 2016. They complain that corruption is driving up the costs. The country's investment in those projects includes money for health and public transportation, Deputy Sports Minister Luis Fernandes has said. ""There is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a World Cup and investing in health and education,"" he said. But such assurances have not been enough for protesters, who will crank marches back up Thursday. Tens of thousands have confirmed online that they will take to the streets once more cry to out against high taxes and living costs, and for better health care and better education. Bigger, more festive . Wednesday's day off is nothing out of the ordinary for Brazilian protesters, who also took Saturday and Sunday off. But it stands in glaring contrast to the loud, voluminous demonstrations that reverberated across several cities a day earlier. Crowds originally protesting bus fares grew into multitudes decrying social injustice on Tuesday as broad avenues filled to capacity for blocks. There were over 200,000 confirmed participants, according to the main organizer, the Free Fare Movement. The protests come amid the soccer Confederations Cup tournament, a friendly array of matches, in which the host country, Brazil, plays against a small group of national teams from around the globe. The cup serves as a precursor to the World Cup. The National Force, made up of specially trained firefighters and police officers, will deploy to states hosting the games, the Ministry of Justice said late Tuesday. The government has stressed that the force's mission is to mediate and not repress. Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, told peaceful protesters Tuesday that their message was being heard. She praised them as active participants in democracy and said her government is committed to ""social transformation."" Police for the most part stood back, and the atmosphere has grown festive and loud, with throngs singing and beating drums. Are you there? Share photos or video, but stay safe . ""It actually reminded me of Carnival in Rio,"" protester Fernando Jones said. ""All along the avenue, people supporting the cause kept switching their lights on and off in their offices and shouting their support from the windows."" Path of rubble . But hidden in the peaceful multitudes were bands of rowdies, who kicked down doors and broke windows; looted shops, tipped over cars and set them on fire. It left a trail of rubble down the protest routes. Amandeep Gill woke up to the smoldering aftermath Tuesday morning. The American, who lives and works in Rio de Janeiro, took video of smashed store fronts as he arrived at his workplace and posted it to CNN iReport. Smoke rose out of looted shops. Across the street, a row of ATMs stood bashed, with their electronic guts hanging out. His colleagues saw the trouble ignite the night before from their office window, they told him. ""They witnessed a car set on fire in front of our building,"" Gill said. ""They told me they were worried that the building would catch on fire."" While asking police to back off from peaceful protesters, Dilma has condemned ""isolated and minor acts of violence,"" telling police to confront them ""with vigor."" Gill's colleagues in Rio won't let vandalism keep them off the streets.

"London (CNN) -- The Dutch royal family, also known as the House of Orange-Nassau, is symbolic of this nation's fiercely independent spirit. The Netherlands is small geographically but during its ""golden age"" in the 17th century it had what historian Simon Schama called ""an embarrassment of riches."" Over the centuries it has experienced much religious strife, acquired and lost an empire and is now governed by a series of coalitions. The monarchy is a proud symbol of national unity. Members of the House of Orange-Nassau were originally appointed as place-holders, or ""stadtholders,"" under Spanish rule, a post that became hereditary. They became kings after the United Kingdom of the Netherlands was established after the Napoleonic wars in 1815 and their rule has been characterized by the frequent use of the monarch's prerogative to abdicate. The first Dutch monarch, Willem 1, abdicated in 1840 and three successive queens, Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix have also done so. After a reign of 33 years Queen Beatrix bequeaths to King Willem-Alexander a relatively prosperous nation and a monarchy that continues to have enormous popular support. Other countries might well benefit from emulating a system which is as responsive and flexible as this has proved to be. King Willem-Alexander takes Dutch throne . The forceful Queen Wilhelmina ruled for 58 years and her tireless work heading the government in exile in London during World War II and her broadcasts to the nation became symbolic of her country's will to resist the Nazi occupation which included the terrible ""hunger winter"" of 1944/45. The Dutch have also never forgotten that in 1953, when the country was hit by a devastating storm, Queen Juliana personally helped with physically demanding relief work in the finest traditions of public service. This was to be highly significant as her reign, which lasted 32 years, also faced serious crises. In the 1950s, she fell under the influence of a malign faith healer Greet Hofmans who had to be removed from court after parliamentary intervention. In 1976 her husband Prince Bernhard faced charges of accepting substantial bribes in the Lockheed scandal. He had to resign from his official positions and there was no criminal prosecution but posthumously he admitted culpability. In 1966 Juliana's eldest daughter Beatrix's marriage to the German diplomat Claus von Amsberg, who had seen wartime service in the Wehrmacht, caused riots although he later became popular. King Willem-Alexander's marriage when he was crown prince was also controversial. Maxima Zorreguieta's father, Jorge, was minister of agriculture in the Argentinian military junta and her parents were not invited to the wedding in 2002 but her popularity has since soared. However the king's brother Prince Johan Friso lost his place in the line of succession when he married Mabel Wisse Smit in 2004 without parliament's approval. iReport: Happy faces as crowds applaud new king . A series of such crises could have brought down an institution that had a less powerful grip on the loyalties of its people. The soubriquet ""bicycling monarchy"" is largely an invention of the press. In reality it is a style pioneered by Queen Juliana and continued by Queen Beatrix of being less formal and more approachable and this is extremely popular domestically. There is, for example, an investiture, not a coronation and protocol is more relaxed than in most other monarchies. The wealth of the royal family is reportedly substantial and its senior members also benefit from tax-free stipends voted by parliament. Orange succession: Queen Beatrix to Prince Willem-Alexander . Queen Beatrix's consort Prince Claus suffered from severe depression for years and felt constrained by his role. Consequently Queen Maxima will be allowed to carry on her current charitable works which include helping immigrants to integrate and an important role with the United Nations assisting those who have no access to basic financial services. The king has specialized in water management but had to give up all his official duties on his accession to the throne. The House of Orange is Protestant but, importantly, this is by tradition and not a legal requirement as the country today is mainly secular and practicing Protestants are outnumbered by Roman Catholics. The Dutch monarchy is also an exemplary example of adaptability as the 1848 constitution that established parliamentary democracy has undergone alterations that have reduced royal power. The crown's role as head of the armed forces and its right to intervene in the formation of coalition governments have recently been removed. The monarch currently signs bills into law, presides at the ceremonial opening of parliament and has weekly audiences with the prime minister. However the distancing of the institution from political power has its uses, since politics is divisive and coalitions are inherently unstable. The Dutch, who are among the world's most egalitarian nations, have a monarchy that unites a country with a fractious history as shown by the huge support it receives in opinion polls. The institution's friendly image, its involvement with charity at home and abroad and its readiness to allow its powers to be reduced are strengths made all the more potent by the charismatic personalities of the three queens who have been its most recent sovereigns. Their endeavors have been pivotal in enabling their country to play a constructive role on the world stage. Inside Guide: Best of Amsterdam .

"(EW.com) -- How loud was Yeezy's Yeezus listening last night, blasted from the loading dock of westside Manhattan's Milk Studios? So loud that New Jersey heard it. So loud that my kidneys are still vibrating. So loud that even the Spinal Tap dudes were like ""Bro, maybe turn it down to eight and a half?"" It felt like something between lying directly beneath a jet path and getting into a slap bet with Godzilla — and mostly, it was glorious. It was also, for the most part, very very dark. Or as a friend turned and said to me: "" When did Kanye discover Ministry?"" At times, the whole night felt a little bit like that opening scene in Blade (cue the blood sprinklers!). But it was also just a party, with an open bar and dancing and a lot of complicated handshakes between old friends and scenester acquaintances. And 'Ye's full East Coast roster of famous fans came out: Jay-Z and Beyonce were there, glowing with the light of a thousand suns; so were lesser celestial bodies like Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, and Timbaland, plus a towering crew of flamingo-like models and professional athletes. EW: Governors Ball, Day 3 - Kanye West debuts new songs, disses radio, demands croissants . After an hour (only an hour!) of milling around in Milk's dim, cavernous space, the crowd turned to find 'Ye himself onstage, delivering an impassioned, rambling, and sometimes impenetrable introduction — there was a lot of talk of artistry and marketing (""I got a new strategy, it's called no strategy. I have a plan to sell more music, it's called 'make better music.'"") and something about Lindsay Lohan and Jessica Simpson's clothing lines — before he wrapped with ""I had to learn about giving, this whole album is about giving... this whole process is about giving ... NO F--KS AT ALL."" Touché! Go home, kumbaya. EW: Tyler, the Creator under fire after on-stage rant in Australia . This blog post isn't an album review; our writer Ray Rahman will be delivering that next Tuesday, or sooner if the record officially leaks. But I will say that from two listenings, this definitely feels like his Darker, Twistier, Still Sometimes Beautiful Fantasy. Some technical details: West revealed that Daft Punk are on ""three or four"" tracks; Kid Cudi and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and Chief Keef also appear; it was hard to catch titles beyond already-known ones like ""I am a God,"" ""Can't Handle My Liquor,"" ""Black Skinhead,"" and ""New Slaves"" (featuring Frank Ocean), but one that appeared to borrow samples from both TNGHT's ""Higher Ground"" and Billie Holiday's haunting lynching ballad ""Strange Fruit"" will almost definitely be a talking point when it goes wider. Is this record going to be all over the radio? Are these let-the-alpine-blast summer jams? Not in America in 2013, no. But it still sounds — if I could actually hear anything this morning besides a faint post-show mosquito buzz — like a pretty fascinating manifestation of what goes on inside the mind of one of pop music's most confounding, singular, and totally gonzo talents.

"(CNN) -- Dave Matthews supported Barack Obama in the presidential race of 2008, and he's supporting him again in 2012 -- but not without reservations. The multi-platinum Grammy winner laments, ""I wish there was a third party, but right now, I will wholeheartedly support Obama -- even if I'm slightly heartbroken about it."" Matthews spoke with CNN's Kareen Wynter in support of ""Away From the World,"" the sixth consecutive studio album from the Dave Matthews Band to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. No other group in Billboard history has achieved this feat. In the 11 new tracks, Matthews examines love, lust, the politics of relationships and the politics of politics. ""Mercy,"" the lead single, is a plea for citizens to shake off their apathy and pull themselves out of the, quote, ""mess we're making."" The 45-year-old singer-songwriter and father of three elaborates on his thoughts and creativity in the Q & A below. CNN: Your new single, ""Mercy."" I want to read the first couple lines: ""Don't give up, I know you can see all the world and the mess we're making."" Those are pretty strong words there. Dave Matthews: We spend a lot of time bickering at great cost, and very little time actually coming up with solutions. And I think we misuse our ambition for our own gains and rarely for the betterment of ourselves, and people around us and our environment. And I think that's sort of pathetic and desperate. CNN: Are you angry or just disappointed? Matthews: Not like The Hulk, but I think that I'm angry all the time. We've lost our way a little bit, and we blame each other, and we blame God, and we blame the world and we blame each other. But I think we should blame ourselves, and maybe get more things done. Point the finger in. CNN: Do you think artists have a responsibility to speak out? Matthews: I don't feel like I'm standing in a position where I have some right above other people to say what I think. We should all be talking to each other about what we think is important -- whether we're in politics, or whether we're checking out at a grocery store. We shouldn't put walls up between each other. I think we should all talk to our enemies and talk to our friends. Talk! That's the only way we'll find solutions. CNN: When we spoke with you in 2009, you were pretty vocal about racism and the challenges we face. Matthews: When I was a kid growing up in New York, I was pretty unaware of racism. I think when we're young -- before we lose our innocence -- we're sort of unaware of the more flawed qualities of each other. And when I moved to South Africa and I spent my teen years there (under apartheid), I became acutely aware of racism because it was institutionalized, even though I was on the favored side of the line. But when I moved back to America, I was suddenly so overwhelmed by how present (it is). It's so hard for me to even acknowledge America without talking about race and recent issues -- you know, the genocide of the Indians and the incredible flight from slavery to modern days. If you look at our society, if you look at the prisons, if you look at the poverty and which side of the line the majority of people are, we have to acknowledge how we divide ourselves up, that there's racism alive in this country. And it's not in the law. It's in our minds. And that's what we have to actively battle. CNN: So we're not bridging the divide? You think it's getting worse? Matthews: I think we have to be active in teaching our children, and teaching each other. We have to be active about kindness and about peace. I've always fantasized that it would be great if there was a Department of Peace. You know, we have a military, but what if there was a department devoted entirely and truthfully to finding peaceful resolutions? CNN: You supported Obama in 2008. You support him now and played a fundraiser for him in Seattle this past May. Are you concerned about his chances in this election? Matthews: Yeah, I'm concerned about whether Obama can win. I'm also concerned about his policies, you know, because I certainly don't agree with him on a lot of his positions. I think he has a concern for the population that put him in power. A real concern for them. His environmental position -- although I'd like to see him push a little harder -- that's where I'm drawn to him, and that's where I agree with him. I don't believe in trickle-down economics. I don't think that people who have the most are inclined to share it, generally. But I think it's going to be a close race, and maybe it'll be the ugliest election as far as empty falsehoods that the candidates throw at each other. When the truth is not really what's being used to debate things, then it's hard to see what will come out when it's just madness. I think Democrats and Republicans survive on distracting us from the real issues, and so we get very little done when they stay in office. And I wish there was a third party, but right now, I will wholeheartedly support Obama -- even if I'm slightly heartbroken about it. CNN: In 2008, there were so many entertainers pushing forth his message. Do you think that support has wavered this time around? Matthews: I think he had a sort of single message, and it came from him, and it came from his heart or the hearts of a small group of advisers. But then, once he was in office, I think there were a lot more voices that made it harder for him to stay on that message. And so I think -- rightly so -- people are disappointed. Not that it's been easy, because I think that he's been up against an incredibly poisonous opposition during his presidency. Really disrespectful, I think, because he's still the president. But I think I was probably disrespectful of his predecessor. But I think it's reached a new high. I'm disappointed, but I'd be more disappointed by having a president like Romney in there. CNN: When you talk as an entertainer, people listen. Will you use that to encourage people to vote? Matthews: I think people know what my opinion is. I hope that just what I sing about and how I relate to my audience is as much of a political statement as I need to make.","New album is sixth consecutive studio one to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart .

"(CNN) -- It is almost miraculous that three women who have been missing for a decade have turned up. The story of Amanda Berry, who screamed for help and got the attention of a neighbor who broke down a door that set her and two other women free, is riveting. Police have already arrested three suspects. As details emerge in the coming days, many people are asking: How could something like this happen? Why did the police not find them earlier? There are far more questions than answers at this point. Although the terms abduction and missing have become almost synonymous, they are not quite the same. In sexually motivated abduction cases, the child is usually returned before anyone had time to note the child was even missing. The motivation is easier to evaluate, and the investigation usually focuses primarily on any sexual assault. In long-term missing/abduction cases, the motivation is harder to evaluate, and the investigation usually focuses more on finding the ""missing"" child. Such cases are among the most difficult, frustrating and emotionally draining for law enforcement. Children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., runaway, throwaway, lost, injured, etc.) other than abduction and can be abducted for a wide variety of motivations (profit, ransom, custodial disputes, etc.) other than sex. For long-separated families, reunions can be a struggle . What investigators are often presented with is simply the fact that a child is missing -- the child did not return home as expected. Family and friends want an immediate and aggressive response by law enforcement with the issuing of Amber Alerts. Law enforcement, however, must consider and evaluate all possibilities. Especially in cases involving teenagers or families living a chaotic lifestyle, determining that an abduction even took place can be difficult. It is simply not possible or reasonable for law enforcement to respond to every missing child case as if it were a sexually motivated nonfamily abduction. The vast majority of missing children are missing because they were runaways, lost, accidentally injured or gone for a variety of benign reasons (e.g., lost track of time). A runaway or lured-away child, however, can easily become an abducted child when prevented from returning home. In sexually motivated abduction cases, a child will usually be held only long enough for the offender to engage in some amount of sexual activity. A few sex offenders, however, seem to want to believe they will live happily ever after with their abducted victim as a sex partner. In a few cases (e.g., Elizabeth Smart, Tara Burke, Jaycee Dugard, Shawn Hornbeck and Steven Stayner) victims have surfaced alive many months or years after being abducted. Many parents of long missing children understandably pray that their children are among such victims. In cases in which the victims are held and kept alive long term, the offender must have a method of control beyond just typical threats and violence. In my experience, this has sometimes involved the assistance of one or more accomplices or the use of physical controls such as a remote location, soundproof room, underground chamber or elaborate restraining devices. It also usually involves an evolving and changing relationship between the offender and the child victim. The offender gradually moves from being a stranger using force to an acquaintance using seduction to a father-like or domestic figure using a family-like bond. In some cases in which I have been involved, victims have been left alone, were poorly guarded, did not try to escape or seemed almost compliant in a variety of ways in their victimization. Victims may even feel guilt, shame and embarrassment or blame themselves as a result of this. In my opinion, the victims who survived the odds did the right thing, whatever it was. The Patty Hearst case is one in which society and the criminal justice system struggled with abduction victim accountability for behavior that helped lead to survival. Some prefer to explain this as being the result of a mysterious process called ""brainwashing"" or the ""Stockholm Syndrome."" I see it as a perfectly understandable result of adult/child interaction and influence over time. A survival and interdependency bond may develop. It is a kind of adaptation or learned helplessness. This process can vary significantly based on the personality characteristics of both the offender and victim. The case of the three Cleveland women who have escaped their captor after so long is inspiring and offers hope for other cases. But most long-term nonfamily-child abduction cases, unfortunately, do not have such happy endings. However, that should not prevent the continuing efforts to resolve them. The greatest accomplishment of almost any law enforcement investigator would be to be able to return a missing child to his or her parents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth V. Lanning.","Kenneth Lanning: It is almost miraculous that three women missing for a decade turned up .

"Boston (CNN) -- Jurors squirmed Monday as a Massachusetts pathologist detailed the wounds inflicted on the 19 bodies prosecutors have lain at the feet of reputed Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Richard John Evans, the state's former chief medical examiner, described gunshot wounds to the temple, neck, spinal cord or heart in graphic detail. The jury in Bulger's federal racketeering and murder trial was both riveted and visibly uneasy during Evans' testimony, with some of them holding their hands over their mouths as he outlined the damage inflicted by bullets in 17 of the 19 cases. Others twisted in their chairs during the testimony, while many intently took notes. But about eight victims into the litany of death certificates, the jurors appeared more relaxed. Most of the victims were shot repeatedly in the head or neck, Evans testified. They included William O'Brien, who was expecting a baby boy when he was shot 20 times on a Boston boulevard in 1973. ""The most significant of the 20 was a wound to his right shoulder which pierced the spinal cord and lodged in his neck region,"" Evans explained. ""It severed the spinal cord five centimeters from the bottom of the brain stem, which would make breathing impossible."" Former drug dealers detail threats during Bulger's reign . Former gang associate Francis ""Buddy"" Leonard was found in 1975 riddled with 13 bullets, including two to the left side of the head and one in the neck, according to his death certificate. Another victim, Brian Halloran, was shot 14 times in 1975. All of the shots were ""through-and-throughs,"" leaving no with bullets passing completely through the body, Evans testified. Dead alongside him was Michael Donahue, Evans testified, a friend who wasn't affiliated with Boston's criminal gangs. Donahue was giving Halloran a ride home from a bar; his cause of death was ""a gunshot wound to back of head that went into his brain,"" Evans explained. Donahue's son, Tommy Donahue, sat with his head in his hands and his eyes closed during the description of the shot that killed his father. ""Going through it was rough, but I know every word on that death certificate,"" Donahue said after Monday's testimony. He brandished the document, which he has carried to court every day since the beginning of the trial, as he spoke. Prosecutors say Bulger had a nearly 20-year reign of terror as the head of the Winter Hill Gang, the Irish mob that once terrorized South Boston. But during much of that time, they say, he was an FBI informant, and that rogue FBI agents tipped him off to his impending arrest and allowed him to flee a 1995 indictment. Juror view photos of alleged victims' remains . Now 83, Bulger was captured in California in 2011 and brought back to Boston for trial, where a succession of mob figures have tied him to the killings. Former FBI Agent Gerald Montanari testified Monday that Halloran was a ""mid-level strong arm"" who had agreed to wear a listening device and testify against Bulger and his associates. He was protected by the FBI and stationed in a safe house on Cape Cod until he began to ""waffle"" about entering into the witness protection program and refused a polygraph, Montanari said. Montanari said the FBI cut ties with Halloran in 1982. The mobster was found shot to death shortly afterward, and earlier testimony stated that Bulger had Halloran killed after his FBI handler tipped him off to Halloran's cooperation. Former hit man John Martorano -- now the government's star witness -- recounted Bulger's involvement in 13 killings, including O'Brien's and Leonard's. Former associate Kevin Weeks implicated Bulger in three more, including that of Halloran -- whose body was ""bouncing off the ground"" with every shot, he testified. Prosecutors expect testimony later this week from Bulger's former partner and fellow informant Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi to lock up their case. Weeks, Flemmi and Martorano have all testified in exchange for reduced sentences in other murders. Expletives fly Bulger, ex-partner during trial . CNN's Laura Batchelor and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","Medical examiner lays out fatal shots in Bulger trial .

"Boston (CNN) -- Over eight days of testimony, jurors in the trial of reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger have seen tears from witnesses whose loved ones died in bloody gangland shootings, heard horror stories from victims who barely survived drive-by shootouts, and peered into the world of the mob through testimony from an old friend turned star government witness. And things are just warming up -- the trial, which is expected to take up to three months, enters just its third week on Monday. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. After escaping a 1995 indictment, allegedly on a tip from a rogue FBI agent, Bulger went into hiding for 16 years, landing himself on the FBI's most wanted list before getting arrested with his girlfriend in Santa Monica California in 2011. Among highlights from the first two weeks of testimony: . -- In three days on the witness stand, former Bulger associate and hitman John Martorano casually detailed killing after killing, confirming to prosecutors that together he and Bulger were involved in 11 slayings, two of which put Bulger on the firing end of a gun in a killing. Bulger had admitted to another two murders he'd committed on his own, Martorano testified. -- A callous Martorano showed brief signs of emotion, telling the jury that when he found out Bulger was an FBI informant, ""It broke my heart. It broke all loyalties."" Martorano testified that he thought Bulger's FBI confidant, John Connolly, was just doing a favor to Bulger's well-respected politician brother by looking out for ""Whitey"" and the gang. He knew the crew was going to benefit from tips from inside the FBI, but he never though Bulger would become a ""Judas"" or ""a person like an informant, a rat, a no good guy,"" which in ""Southie"" -- south Boston -- was the ultimate sin. -- Defense attorneys and prosecutors were at each others' legal throats all week, taking jab after jab while court was in session. In one spat, defense attorney Hank Brennan accused Martorano of being a liar in front of the jury, turning the room into a vacuum of tension. Prosecuting attorney Fred Wyshak fired off an objection before U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper put the kibosh on the ugly squabble with, ""That's for the jury to decide."" -- Two jurors were reduced to tears as one witness, 63-year-old Diane Sussman de Tennen, alternated between bouts of crying and attempts to smile as she recounted the night she was in a car that suddenly was riddled by bullets, leaving her then-boyfriend a quadriplegic for the remaining three decades of his life. She was riding in a car that Martorano and Bulger rained fire on in March on 1973, mistaking the driver with another gang-rival target, according to Martorano's earlier testimony. Jurors heard gripping testimony from three people who barely survived drive-by shootings, and seven family members of victims who died in alleged mob killings. -- Famed ""Godfather"" actor Robert Duvall was an unlikely spectator in the federal courtroom Friday morning. Duvall is expected to play a federal judge in an upcoming movie called ""The Judge."" A smiling Duvall became immediately stern when court was called into session, paying aggressive attention to Judge Casper. He sat with his hands propped on his knees, and listened intently to the testimony, methodically turning his head back and forth. Bulger sat through all eight days of it, mostly expressionless except for one notable moment. Whitey Bulger fast facts . His former bookmaker, Richard O'Brien, was on the witness stand describing a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money. When the man balked at paying, O'Brien said, Bulger told him, ""We have a business besides bookmaking."" ""What's that?"" the man asked. ""Killing (expletive) like you,"" O'Brien quoted Bulger as saying. The 83-year old defendant threw his head back and let out a laugh. On Monday, the prosecution intends to introduce Bulger's full informant file, a 700-page document detailing his relationship with the FBI over 15 years. Jurors also will hear from former FBI Supervisor John Morris, who gained immunity after agreeing to testify about cash he accepted from Bulger in exchange for protecting the mobster from the law. Tensions in the courtroom are likely to be high in anticipation of a Morris-Bulger face-off. The jury will continue to hear from family members of alleged murder victims, law enforcement operatives from Bulger's past, and at least one more of his former associates in a trial that could last well into August.","Reputed mob leader 'Whitey' Bulger is charged in 19 deaths .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live executives feared Michael Jackson would sabotage his comeback concerts five days before his death, the company's CEO testified Thursday. Randy Phillips refused to advance money to help Jackson pay his staff because he believed the singer was ""in an anticipatory breach"" of his contract because he had missed rehearsals, he testified. Phillips testified in the sixth week of the trial to decide whether the concert promoter is liable in Jackson's death for the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children contends that Phillips and other AEG Live executives pressured Jackson to attend rehearsals despite his deteriorating health and ignored red flags that should have warned them about the dangers posed by Murray. Jackson lawyers questioned Phillips about his e-mail exchanges with Michael Kane -- Jackson's business manager -- when Kane asked for an advance, which was provided for in Jackson's contract with AEG Live for his ""This Is It"" tour. Phillips said he was concerned that because Jackson had missed so many rehearsals, the show would not be ready for its debut in London on July 13, 2009. ""This is why it is impossible to advance any $$$,"" Phillips wrote to Kane on June 20, 2009. ""He may, unfortunately, be in an anticipatory breach at this point."" ""And I thought it couldn't get worse,"" Kane replied. ""It could,"" Phillips said. ""(Show director) Kenny Ortega could quit."" Phillips' testimony that he believed Jackson was contractually obligated to attend rehearsals contradicted AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongware's previous testimony that Jackson was not required to rehearse. Phillips acknowledged that by June 20, 2009, he was worried the production would not be ready on time . Kane, in an e-mail to Phillips, offered to help motivate Jackson to get to rehearsals. ""Would a financial coming to Jesus speech help or add to his pressure?"" Kane asked. ""It would help,"" Phillips replied. ""At this point, we need to break through. I'm going to call his doctor to discuss."" Later that day, Phillips and other AEG Live executives met with Murray and Jackson at the singer's home.

"(CNN) -- Many trials in recent years have implicated our ongoing national struggles with race. But few have gotten as much attention as that of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed young Trayvon Martin 17 months ago in Sanford, Florida. Perhaps the uncertainty of what really happened that night is part of what drew us: Since only two people knew exactly what transpired and one of them is dead, we're free to speculate and argue to our heart's content. It may also be the fact that this young black man wasn't killed by the police, but by an ordinary citizen. So anybody could put himself or herself in the place of Zimmerman or Martin. The verdict by itself says very little about race in America. Juries don't ponder such things; their job is to answer particular legal questions (in this case: Did Zimmerman kill Martin in self defense?)-- which may not be the ones the rest of us are asking. And so Zimmerman's acquittal wasn't much of a surprise. Opinion: When blacks killed by non-blacks, justice rarely served . Trayvon Martin couldn't give his side of the story, leaving ample room for reasonable doubt. More importantly, under Florida law, it's perfectly legal to follow someone for even the worst of reasons, confront them, and even start a fight with them. Then when you lose the advantage to the point where you believe you're in danger of ""great bodily harm,"" you can shoot the other person dead. The law forgives, whether forgiveness is deserved or not. Zimmerman could have had the soul of Martin Luther King or Bull Connor, and it wouldn't have made a difference to whether he was innocent or guilty under this law. Social media erupts in anger, sadness over Zimmerman verdict . That's ""standing your ground,"" the legal world that gun advocates have created and this case has highlighted. Gun rights supporters have a Hollywood fantasy in which a brave homeowner uses his gun to fight off a vicious criminal gang intent on killing his family, but this case showed a far less romantic reality: A nebbishy neighborhood watch volunteer with a never-to-be fulfilled dream of becoming a cop chased down a kid who just wanted to get his Skittles back to his dad's house to watch a basketball game. The state laws governing who you're allowed to shoot and when may not have been built with race in mind, but out in the real world, our perception of what's threatening is still colored profoundly by race. Bill O'Reilly wondered the other day if, after an acquittal, people would ""run out and cause trouble."" After all, you know how those people are. The head of the Miami-Dade police went to a black church to warn, ""Riots are not acceptable and riots are not expected."" Well, if they aren't expected, why was the warning necessary? There were warnings of riots from many corners, just as there were those who saw in this case an excuse to pick at race like a scab, for no reason other than sending their audiences to greater heights of resentment. Rush Limbaugh, for instance, read a story about the Justice Department sending mediators to Sanford to help local officials defuse tensions, and saw a conspiracy from a White House practically taken over by Black Panthers. Opinion: Doing what's right not just about law . ""Stoking the racial stuff is the way Obama was raised,"" said Limbaugh, the most prominent race-baiter in America. ""He's got a chip on his shoulder about it, and he's here to square the deal. And (Attorney General Eric) Holder too. I think all of these guys have an anger about them."" Even as we scorn repellent hate-mongers like Limbaugh, it's good to remind ourselves that we all make assumptions about other people, and we'd all benefit from examining them. Much of our reaction to cases like this one is built on what we assume other people are like, regardless of what we know about them as individuals. That's what turns a kid walking down the street with candy in his pocket into a threat that should be met with a gun at the ready. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Zimmerman trial reflected much of U.S. struggle with race; verdict did not .
He says reasonable doubt and Florida law made acquittal unsurprising .
He says it may not have been law's intent, but the threat it addresses is colored by race .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's last personal assistant claims concert promoter AEG owes him money because, he says, it was responsible for the pop icon's death. Michael Amir Williams, one of the people closest to Jackson in the last two years of his life, filed a lawsuit that he hopes other former Jackson employees will join as a class action. The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, charges that AEG's ""acts and omissions brought about the demise of Michael Jackson."" Judge rejects e-mail ban in lawsuit . The court filing included a copy of AEG's contract with Jackson, revealing that the promoter agreed to advance the singer $15 million to help him buy a 29-bedroom estate that spreads over 16 acres in Las Vegas. AEG's lawyer called the suit ""clearly frivolous"" since Williams has no legal standing to sue because he was not a party to Jackson's contract with AEG. ""It is truly unfortunate that so many see Mr. Jackson's demise as an opportunity to grab as much for themselves as possible,"" AEG attorney Marvin Putnam said. ""This is just the latest wrongful death lawsuit with someone hoping to profit from Michael Jackson's tragic death in the same way they profited from his tragic life."" Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" comeback shows, was convicted a year ago of involuntary manslaughter in the pop star's death. The coroner ruled that Jackson died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with sedatives on June 25, 2009 -- two weeks before the concerts were to begin in London. The suit contends AEG never paid Jackson's staff as required in the January 2009 contract with Jackson. ""After the contract was signed and performance begun, Michael Jackson had problems keeping up with the pace of Tour's rigorous schedule and physical demands,"" the lawsuit said. ""In response, AEG, began a series of unreasonable acts and omissions."" E-mails show promoter's doubts before Jackson's death . The ""acts and omissions"" allegedly involved the hiring and supervision of Dr. Murray. ""AEG used Conrad Murray as a tool to further its business purposes and abused the sole discretion given to AEG under (the) contract,"" the suit said. The company failed to look at ""Conrad Murray's qualifications, experience, and medical specialty,"" but instead weighed the benefits Murray could bring, including ""managing Michael Jackson so that he could meet all deadlines and timetables AEG set in place,"" it said. Testimony at Murray's trial indicated that Jackson chose him to be his full-time doctor for the tour, but that AEG would pay him. AEG, which is also defending itself in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and three children, denies it was responsible for hiring or supervising Murray. That suit is set to be heard by a jury next April. A judge must decide if the newest lawsuit can be made a class-action suit with other former employees joining. Internal AEG e-mails leaked to a reporter in September include one written by Randy Phillips -- the president of AEG Live -- in March 2009 saying Jackson was ""locked in his room drunk and despondent"" the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. ""I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,"" Phillips wrote. ""He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time."" The e-mails, published by the Los Angeles Times, indicated AEG executives had major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. AEG drops Michael Jackson insurance claim . ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware wrote in an e-mail to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: ""He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive."" A loud warning from show director Kenny Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, about a week before the star's death. Ortega wrote to Phillips that Jackson had ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" and suggested they bring a ""top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP."" ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,"" Ortega wrote. ""I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. Those concerns resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray, ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said. A Phillips e-mail sent weeks after Jackson's death called it ""a terrible tragedy,"" but added ""life must go on."" ""AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,"" Phillips wrote. AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary ""This Is It,"" which was produced from rehearsal video.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live's negotiations with a doctor to treat Michael Jackson were ""highly inappropriate,"" a music industry veteran testified Monday. The concert promoter's agreement to pay Dr. Conrad Murray $150,000 a month during Jackson's comeback tour set up an ""egregious"" conflict of interest in which the physician was beholden to the company and himself before Jackson's interests, he testified. David Berman, who once headed Capitol Records and worked for decades as an entertainment lawyer, was brought into court as an expert witness by Jackson's mother and children in their wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live. The tiny Los Angeles courtroom became less crowded Monday after the city fire marshal, acting on a complaint from an unidentified party, ordered that fewer people be allowed inside, according to a court spokesman. Just one seat is allotted to the public and the number of journalists allowed inside was reduced to just eight at a time under the new limits. The 30 seats set aside for lawyers were not reduced. The judge rejected CNN's request to televise the trial in March, but she has allowed a small camera and microphone to be focused on the witness so that people in another courtroom can watch the trial. Michael Jackson's longtime personal chef Kai Chase, who was in his home when he died, is set to testify Tuesday. Also coming up, the Jackson lawyers will show jurors the ""This Is It"" documentary produced using rehearsal video. The wrongful death trial, which is in its eighth week, is expected to last until August, according to lawyers. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish estimated Monday that he would call his last witness around July 8. One of the four alternative jurors asked the judge to dismiss him from the case Monday because he has sold his Los Angeles home and must move to Atlanta. ""If we are only a third of the way through there's no way I can make it,"" he said. Judge Yvette Palazuelos said it is""highly likely I'm going to excuse you,"" but she will confer with lawyers from both sides before deciding. The Jackson lawsuit accuses AEG Live of liability in Michael Jackson's death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Murray told police he used the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals for his ""This Is It"" concerts. The coroner ruled Jackson's death was from an overdose of the drug. AEG Live lawyers argue it was Jackson who chose and supervised Murray. They contend AEG executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using propofol on Jackson. Berman, who is paid $500 an hour by the Jacksons as an expert witness, said he reviewed ""an enormous amount"" of material, including an ""extraordinary number of e-mails,"" to reach his conclusions that Murray's hiring was ""highly inappropriate and ""highly unusual."" ""I have never heard of it being done, and indeed, it is my understanding up until these case, AEG had never done it,"" Berman testified, referring to a concert promoter hiring a doctor for an artist. ""It creates an inherent conflict of interest on the part of the physician,"" Berman said. ""The physician has dual obligations to the patient and the entity that is engaging them and who is paying his compensation. That, in of itself, is a conflict. It's a more egregious conflict in the circumstances in this case."" Berman was critical of AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips' response to an e-mail from show director Kenny Ortega warning five days before Jackson's death about the singer's ""continued physical weakening ad deepening emotional state."" ""Kenny, it is critical that neither you, me, or anyone around this show become amateur psychologists or physicians,"" Phillips wrote ""I had a lengthy conversation with Dr. Murray, who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more. He said that Michael is not only physically equipped to perform and that discouraging him to, will hasten his decline instead of stopping it. Dr. Murray also reiterated that he is mentally able to and was speaking to me from the house where he had spent the morning with MJ. This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he totally unbiased and ethical."" Phillips' response is ""very telling on a number of levels,"" Berman said. ""He is somewhat dismissive of Mr. Ortega's concerns."" ""There are serious problems with that statement because he recognizes the potential of the doctor not being ethical and unbiased if he does need the gig and has financial problems,"" he said. It shows AEG Live was aware of the potential for a conflict, Berman testified. ""When, in fact, Dr. Murray was in dire financial straits at the time and did need the gig."" A Los Angeles Police detective testified earlier in the trial that Murray was more than $1 million in debt and that his Las Vegas medical clinic faced eviction in the months before he was hired to treat Jackson. The contractual relationship between AEG Live and Dr. Murray was ""not unlike the team doctor for a football team, where the quarterback is injured and the doctor comes to the medical conclusion that the quarterback should be taken out of the game for a period of weeks, but the team doesn't want him out,"" Berman said. ""There is an inherent conflict."" Berman also noted that the contract said AEG Live could terminate Murray if concerts were postponed or canceled. ""The fact that if the tour is even just postponed that AEG Live has the ability to cease any further compensation for Dr. Murray, giving Dr. Murray even greater conflict of interest since he was in financial dire straits, he did need this gig and if it was postponed, which could hypothetically be in the best interest of Michael Jackson, he ran the risk of losing any further compensation,"" he testified. Berman was asked about the so-called ""smoking gun"" e-mail sent by AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware ahead of a planned meeting with Dr. Murray: ""We want to remind him that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want him to understand what is expected of him."" The e-mail indicates AEG Live executives wanted ""to control, to some extent, Dr. Murray"" by reminding him they are paying his salary, Berman said. Is that reasonable, he was asked. ""Certainly not,"" Berman said. ""It is indicative of the fact that they want to control the services of Dr. Murray, as opposed to the artist."" Berman testified that AEG Live executives should have recognized there could be a problem with Dr. Murray when he initially asked for $5 million for one year as Jackson's doctor. ""That is a pretty bizarre amount,"" he said. The eventual agreement to pay the doctor $150,000 a month was still ""an exorbitant amount, more than any other person on the tour was paid,"" he said. ""Even more of a red flag since AEG was aware of another doctor who was willing to take the job for $40,000 a month."" ""It's indicative of something out of whack,"" Berman testified. Berman also said it was ""inappropriate"" for AEG Live to not loop in any Jackson lawyer or manager into the negotiations with Murray. ""I find that extremely unusual,"" he testified. Murray signed the contract and faxed it back to AEG Live on June 24, 2009 -- a day before Jackson's death. But AEG Live's executives never signed and the signature space for Jackson's signature was also left blank. ""That is not inconsistent with this being a valid oral agreement,"" Berman said. Berman testified the e-mails confirmed an oral agreement was in place. It is a common practice in the music industry for oral agreements to be put in writing long after the services are commenced, he said. He pointed to the certification of sponsorship AEG submitted to the British government for Murray to practice in England as evidence they considered him hired.","Music industry veteran David Berman testifies for Jackson side in wrongful death trial .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's elderly mother will soon tell jurors about her most famous son, as the wrongful death trial of his last concert promoter reaches a midpoint. Jurors heard one of Jackson's former doctors testify last week that the top producer of Jackson's comeback concerts knew about the singer's drug dependency on a previous tour. Katherine Jackson, 83, has sat on the front row of the Los Angeles courtroom almost every one of the 46 days of testimony. She's shed tears, sometimes laughed, and at one point last week shouted out the name of one of her son's movies when a witness couldn't remember it. Her emotional testimony will be followed by AEG Live lawyers presenting their defense, which they've warned will include ""ugly stuff"" to prove that Michael Jackson was responsible for his own death. Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon's overdose death. Murray admitted giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which the coroner ruled killed the singer on June 25, 2009. AEG Live lawyers argue their executives had no way of knowing that Murray -- whom they say Jackson chose and controlled -- was giving him the dangerous infusions in the privacy of Jackson's bedroom to treat his insomnia. ""They were a concert promoter. How could they know?"" AEG lead lawyer Marvin Putnam asked during his opening statement 12 weeks ago. ""Don't be a Dr. Nick"" Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware -- the top producer of Jackson's ""This Is It"" comeback tour -- should have known the hazards of hiring Murray because of his personal experience with Jackson and his work with other artists, including as a promoter on Elvis Presley's last tour. Gongaware denied in his testimony that he ever knew that Jackson had drug dependency problems while touring. But video testimony shown to the jury last week contradicts Gongaware's claim. CNN obtained video segments from the deposition of Dr. Stuart Finkelstein, who served as Jackson's doctor during his 1993 ""Dangerous"" tour, which ended early because the singer entered a drug rehabilitation program. ""I said I think we're going to have a problem,"" Finkelstein testified that he told Gongaware, who was then serving as a tour manager on the ""Dangerous"" tour. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle: ""Did you tell Mr. Gongaware that you thought Mr. Jackson had a dependency on opiates?"" Finkelstein: ""Yes."" Boyle: ""And what did Mr. Gongaware say to you?"" Finkelstein: ""He said, 'Don't be a Dr. Nick.'"" Boyle: ""And by Dr. Nick, was he talking about Elvis?"" Finkelstein: ""Yes. He was Elvis' doctor. And I think Elvis died with like 14 different chemicals in his system. And he was kind of warning me that, you know, don't get all infatuated where you start administering meds to a rock star and have the rock star overdose and die on you."" Dr. George Nichopoulos, known as ""Dr. Nick,"" was ""the doctor whose overprescription of drugs to Elvis had led to Elvis' death,"" according to a court filing by Jackson lawyers. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of Graceland, his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion, on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. Nichopoulos said later he was treating Presley for insomnia. He was charged with overprescribing drugs to Presley, but he was acquitted. He later lost his medical license in another case. Presley's death came days before he was to begin a new tour organized by the concert promoter Concerts West, the company that gave Gongaware his start in the music industry. One of his jobs was working with Presley in his last years on the road, he testified. Jackson ""needed to be detoxed"" Finkelstein testified that he and Gongaware had discussions about Jackson's use of Demerol, morphine and other opiates during the ""Dangerous"" tour. ""We thought we needed to do an intervention, that he needed to be detoxed,"" Finkelstein said. The tour came to an early and abrupt end when actress Elizabeth Taylor flew to Mexico City to lead an intervention that convinced Jackson to enter a rehab facility in London. Finkelstein said Gongaware called him again in the spring of 2009 as preparations for Jackson's comeback tour were beginning. ""Hey, Stewie, you may have another chance,"" the doctor quoted Gongaware as saying. ""Michael's doing another tour to London and he's going to want to take a physician."" ""Were you interested in going on that tour to London?"" Boyle asked. ""Very much so,"" Finkelstein replied. Finkelstein said he had five to 10 conversations with Gongaware about the job with Jackson and he offered to take it for $40,000 a month. But Finkelstein, who is now an addiction specialist, said he had one requirement -- that Jackson be clean of drugs. Instead, Gongaware agreed to pay Murray $150,000 a month to work as Jackson's personal physician. Drug dependent, not addicted . A drug addiction expert testified earlier this month that there was ""not a lot of evidence to support"" the belief that Michael Jackson was addicted to drugs, but that he was ""drug dependent."" If he was an addict, Jackson ""would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional, taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug-seeking behavior,"" Dr. Sidney Schnoll testified. Evidence shows Jackson sought drugs from a number of doctors, but that was not inappropriate because he needed them ""to treat a legitimate medical problem,"" including back pain, scalp pain and dermatologic issues, Schnoll testified. The painkillers that forced Jackson to end his 1993 ""Dangerous"" tour early so he could enter a rehab program were taken to relieve the pain from scalp surgery needed to repair burns suffered when filming a Pepsi commercial, Schnoll said. The burns left scars on damaged nerves in his scalp, which becomes ""excitable tissue"" that ""can be firing just like the nerve,"" he said. The result ""can be very painful, like a burning kind of pain -- persistent, sharp, shooting kind of pain,"" he said. ""It's very uncomfortable and one of the most difficult to treat."" Pain relief is a legitimate use of opioid drugs and a person can function normally if they are taken under a doctor's care, he said. Jackson went from 1993 until 2008 without using Demerol, Schnoll said. The doctor conceded under cross-examination by an AEG Live lawyer, however, that a gap in available medical records may be misleading. Finkelstein testified that many of his records for Jackson had been lost. Jackson's use of sedatives was an effort to treat his chronic insomnia, Schnoll said. If the underlying sleep problem could be resolved, the chances of ending Jackson's use of the drugs would have been good, he said.","Katherine Jackson's testimony will be followed by defense from AEG Live lawyers .

"(CNN) -- As long as there have been movies, there have been bad movies. For a long time, they were forgotten -- or wished to be. But there were those who remembered. One of them was Harry Medved. In the 1970s and '80s, he co-wrote four books on bad movies, some with brother Michael. Along with Danny Peary's 1981 book ""Cult Movies,"" Medved's works helped blaze a trail. The films included the high and low. Alain Resnais' inscrutable ""Last Year at Marienbad"" was in there; so were ""Robot Monster,"" ""The Horror of Party Beach"" and the films of Ed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" Wood. The choices got attention. Medved was written up in People magazine and guested on talk-show panels. ""We were thrilled at becoming part of the national discourse on movies that are so bad they're good,"" says Medved, who now writes for the film and ticketing site Fandango. Some of his targets weren't so thrilled. Medved remembers sharing a couch on the old ""Merv Griffin Show"" with Burt Reynolds. ""He accused me of making money off of bad movies,"" Medved recalls. ""I told him he had made millions off of his own bad movies, so I didn't see the problem."" Other actors can only smile and shrug. Carrie Fisher, no stranger to bad films, told CNN that she made one film because it earned her a trip to Israel. Michael Caine, who starred in ""Jaws: The Revenge,"" once wrote, ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts, it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."" Gradually, Hollywood detritus got more attention from the mainstream. Joel Hodgson and his colleagues created ""Mystery Science Theater 3000,"" which featured the cast watching bad movies and yelling jokes at the screen. The show ran from 1988 to 1999. Putting Hollywood's biggest bombs back together . Hodgson, who confesses that ""when I was a kid, I thought God made the movies,"" says that he could always find something good in what he was joking about. ""When you write (the riffs), you spend a lot of time with the film,"" says the comedian. ""There are certain things that you can't get over, like certain performances that are great, but they're within the body of this (bad) movie."" These days there's an afterlife well beyond ""MST3K."" Medved mentions there's a book in the works about the production of ""Robot Monster.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The disgraced politician at the center of China's biggest political scandal in years has been linked to a criminal act for the first time since he was removed from office, the state-run Xinhua news agency has reported. Bo Xilai, who was head of the Communist Party in the southwestern city of Chongqing and once seen as a future president, was reportedly warned by his former right-hand man that his wife was suspected of murder. The revelation came during this week's trial of Wang Lijun, Bo's former police chief and vice mayor in Chongqing. In the first official account of the two-day hearing, the court was told that Wang was ""angrily rebuked"" and slapped on the face by Bo -- who the report referred to as the major official in charge of Chongqing's municipal party committee -- when he revealed his suspicions, Xinhua said. Former Chinese police chief charged . Wang was on trial charged with abuse of power, defection and bribe-taking. The case, which precipitated Bo's downfall, began after Wang arrived at the U.S. consulate in the nearby city of Chengdu one evening in February in an apparent asylum attempt. During a frenzied 24 hours, he reportedly revealed to U.S. officials a jaw-dropping tale of corruption and murder involving his boss. Wang was later collected by central government authorities and disappeared from the public eye. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . According to Thursday's Xinhua report, Guo Weiguo, a former high-ranking police official, heard the exchange between the two men on January 28 this year. He told police: ""Once Wang was slapped, the hostility between Wang and Bo came out into the open."" Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was found guilty of murder in the death of a British businessman Neil Heywood last month. Chinese authorities reported that Gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests."" Gu Kailai avoids death penalty . Prosecutors at his trial allege Wang knew Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood last November but covered up for her. But this relationship became increasingly strained as Wang became concerned by the number of people who became aware of the murder case. In his confession, Wang described how Gu became hostile ""and began to guard herself against me,"" Xinhua said. Bo had been an influential and controversial member of the Communist Party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run China. Appointed to the top job in Chongqing in 2007, Wang was assigned to lead his crime-fighting program. Under Wang, the ""da hei"" or smash black campaign reportedly caught nearly 3,000 criminal groups and detained thousands of suspects. It also led to the execution of notorious figures in the city's underworld. Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal . The crackdown, along with economic reforms in the city of more than 30 million, helped burnish the political credentials of Bo, who aspired for a spot in the Party's Standing Committee of the Politburo, a nine-member body that effectively rules China. But Wang's heavy-handed, crime-busting methods were decried as brutal by critics. Bo's red-tinged economic policies -- which have included millions spent on social housing -- garnered him a rock star status in Chongqing but in Beijing, some party chiefs were taking a different view. His populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The political divisions came to a boil in March when China's national legislature convened its annual meeting in Beijing. Speaking to reporters on March 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of Chongqing delegates, Bo defended his policies. ""Ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they'll say 'yes',"" he boomed. Addressing the rich-poor divide, he said: ''If only a few people are rich then we are capitalists, we've failed."" That may have been Bo's last stand. On March 14, Premier Wen Jiabao obliquely reprimanded Chongqing's leadership over the Wang incident during the premier's annual press conference. Wen also referred to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution -- a reference that alluded to Bo's red revival in Chongqing -- and said that the city's stellar double-digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just Bo's work alone. The following day, Bo was sacked and stripped of his political office due to an unspecified ""serious breach of party regulations."" The Party still hasn't revealed what those regulations are. But until the trial of Wang, there had been no suggestion Bo had been aware of his wife's actions before her arrest and conviction for murder. CNN's Steven Jiang, Jaime FlorCruz and Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","Bo Xilai's former right-hand man said he warned his boss his wife was a murder suspect .

"(CNET) -- Coming from a company known more for its plasma HDTVs, the Panasonic TC-32LX85 is a pleasant surprise in the 32-inch LCD category. Attractively designed and well appointed with generous connectivity, it is also a good performer overall, although by no means perfect. I was particularly impressed with the set's color accuracy, which is something I really don't expect from entry-level displays. Compared with the competition, the LC-32LX85 represents a compelling value in small LCD screens when you consider its performance characteristics. Design . Basic in its design, but simultaneously elegant-looking, the TC-35LX85 has a glossy black finish, with a 3-inch-wide bezel surrounding the screen on all sides. It is a small and unobtrusive television that will fit into just about any decor nicely. Side panel AV inputs are neatly tucked away behind the right side of the screen. The remote control is identical to Panasonic's current plasma line of HDTVs, with an excellent ergonomic design. It is on the large side, but slender enough to fit in the hand comfortably. Unfortunately, the remote is not backlit. The internal menu graphical user interface is also quite simple and intuitive to use and navigate. Features . The Panasonic TC-32LCX85's offers a fairly comprehensive feature package for an entry-level 32-inch LCD TV. Its native resolution is 1366x768, or around 720p, whereas many higher-end models have a 1080p native resolution. At this screen size, however, the benefits of 1080p resolution are nearly impossible to discern with moving video, whether standard- or high-definition. If you plan on regularly using your 32-inch LCD TV as a computer monitor, however, you might want to consider a 1080p model. Picture adjustment options are OK, but not as extensive as found on the Samsung LN32A450 or LG32LG30 for example. Preset picture modes include Cinema, Game, Custom, Vivid, and Standard. Custom can be adjusted independently per input while the others can be tweaked as well and apply to every input. Selectable color temperatures include Warm, Normal, and Cool. The Backlight feature may be the most important in terms of optimizing the panel's picture, as it helps it achieve reasonably deep black levels when lowered from its factory setting. Some dubious picture-adjusting features include Color Management and AI Picture, both of which should be shut off for optimum performance. AI is an auto-contrast feature that raises and lowers the light output of the panel depending on ambient room lighting. This ultimately makes black and white level a moving target, and both of these parameters really should remain constant. In the Advanced menu there are two varieties of noise reduction, called Video NR and MPEG NR, and for high-quality sources both should be turned-off. Black Level should be set to Light for full shadow detail, although intuitively I would think Dark would be correct. (Panasonic always had Lighter and Darker settings that were intuitively correct at 7.5 and 0 IRE respectively in their DVD players. Strangely, for their TVs, it is backward.) Connection options are generous enough on the Panasonic, although unlike most other small-screen flat-panel sets it lacks a VGA-style PC input. The rear panel does have two HDMI inputs, one component video input, one AV input with a choice of either composite or S-Video, and one RF input. One set of analog audio outputs, and one digital optical audio output for routing sound to an external AV receiver are also on tap. Side panel inputs include one HDMI, and one set of AV inputs with composite video only, and an SD Card slot on the right side of the panel for viewing your digital photos. We'd like to see a headphone jack on the side as well, but no dice. Performance . The Panasonic LC-32LX85 is one of the better performers at its size in the entry-level, 720p-resolution LCD category. Color accuracy and black level performance are its main strengths, while color decoding and standard-definition processing are not. I didn't have to make too many adjustments during the user menu calibration to get the little TV looking its best. Since there are no custom color temperature controls in the user menu, I simply chose the best picture mode (Custom) and color temperature preset (Warm) and then tweaked the remainder of the basic picture controls. Afterward I was pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of the grayscale; you can click here to access my full picture settings. For my comparison I looked at the Panasonic alongside the Sony KDL-32M4000, the Westinghouse VK-40F580D and the Vizio VP322, two LCDs and a 32-inch plasma respectively. Black level: Blacks are reasonably good for an inexpensive LCD flat-panel TV, and deeper than either the Sony or the Vizio, although not quite as deep as the Westinghouse. The Panasonic also delivers the blacker-than-black video signals that many more expensive displays cannot, which helps lead to improved shadow detail. Chapter two of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" showed off the LC-32LX85's compelling blacks very nicely. This high-contrast scene takes place at night, with bright explosions going off to provide a good look at an HDTV's shadow detail capability. There was plenty of fine detail in the background dark areas of the picture. The black areas of the picture were deep, rich, and inky, and the scene was relatively free of low-level noise. Color accuracy: As you can see from the Geek Box, grayscale tracking in the Warm color temperature preset was impressive, and the primary colors of red, green, and blue also measured reasonably close to the HDTV standard, which is unusual even in some expensive flat-panel displays. Color decoding does push red a bit though, so we had to desaturate the color somewhat and remove some of the picture's punch. Colors still appeared vibrant, however, and skin tones looked quite natural. Chapter four of the awesome transfer of ""I, Robot"" proved an excellent scene to show off the Panasonic's contrast ratio--good blacks and whites creating a snappy picture--as well as its accurate color reproduction. Video processing: Unlike most modern HDTVs the LC-32LX85 doesn't accept 1080p sources, so my evaluation had to be with all HD sources set to 1080i. The set lacks an aspect ratio that provides for zero overscan, which would be a bigger issue if it were a 1080p resolution panel, but really isn't a big deal the panel has only a 720p resolution. The video processing does roll off the high-frequency video somewhat, a common flaw with many flat-panel sets on the market today. Uniformity: White-field uniformity was reasonably good on this panel, and that is saying something for an LCD. As you may know LCD display technologies, whether flat panel or projection, suffer from poor white-field uniformity. As a result you may see red and blue splotches in scenes that are primarily white like the ice in a hockey game or a movie like ""Ice Age."" This Panasonic, while not perfect, was better than most in this performance test. Standard-definition: The Panasonic is a mediocre performer with standard-def material. It didn't resolve every line of horizontal resolution according to the charts on the HQV disc, and as a result some images appeared a bit softer than normal. It did a below-average job of smoothing out jaggies on rotating diagonal lines, and there were a good number of such artifacts in a waving American flag. The set's noise reduction, on the other hand, was very good at cleaning up moving motes in low-quality images of skies and sunsets, and the set engaged 2:3 pull-down detection quickly and effectively. PC: Absent a VGA-style PC input I attempted to test the Panasonic's capability to handle digital signals from a PC via its HDMI jack. The best resolution the video card allowed was 1,280x768, which is short of the set's native resolution, and there was enough overscan that important areas of the screen, including the Windows taskbar, were obscured. People who want a PC display should probably choose another set. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. CNET, CNET.com and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- Vince Flynn, the bestselling author of political thriller novels, died early Wednesday after a long battle with prostate cancer, his publisher said. He was 47. Flynn was the author of 14 novels, which regularly appeared on the New York Times bestseller list. All but one of his novels feature counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp. The character and series garnered Flynn legions of followers, with CBS Films buying the rights to the Mitch Rapp character with the intention of creating a movie franchise. Flynn had planned on becoming Marine Corps aviator in the early 1990s, but he was medically disqualified before entering the program, his publisher, Simon & Schuster, said. It was around that time that he first considered writing a novel. Flynn wrote his first novel, Term Limits, while supporting himself by bartending at night. His manuscript was rejected more than 60 times before he decided to self-publish, which was not very common at the time, his publisher said. The self-published book was a hit, and Flynn's career took off. ""Flynn's novels have been praised for their extensive research and prescient warnings about the rise of Islamic Radical Fundamentalism and terrorism,"" Simon & Schuster said in a statement. On his website, Flynn had said that becoming a novelist was an unusual choice because he had been diagnosed with dyslexia as a child, and struggled with reading and writing. He listed his influences as Ernest Hemingway, Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, J.R.R. Tolkien, Gore Vidal and John Irving. Flynn is survived by his wife, Lysa, and three children.

"(CNN) -- Sherman Hemsley, who played the brash George Jefferson on ""All in the Family"" and ""The Jeffersons,"" died Tuesday at 74, his booking agent said. Hemsley played Jefferson, a wisecracking owner of a dry cleaning business, on ""All In the Family"" from 1973 until 1975, when the spinoff ""The Jeffersons"" began an 11-season run on CBS. Police in El Paso, Texas, where Hemsley lived, said there was no evidence of foul play. The cause of death will be determined through an autopsy, according to a news release. For the first few years on ""All in the Family,"" George Jefferson was not seen, only referred to by his wife, Louise, played by the late Isabel Sanford. Sherman Hemsley: A tribute to the great George Jefferson, and more . He told Archive of American Television in 2003 that he was told by the show's producers that Jefferson should be ""pompous and feisty."" Jefferson was every bit as big a bigot as his neighbor, Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor. Jefferson often referred to white people as ""honkies."" He was also mean and condescending to his neighbors, his son Lionel and, when he moved to a ritzy apartment on Manhattan's East Side, to his maid. But his character was still wildly popular with TV audiences. Overheard: So long, Sherman; thanks for the laughs . ""By me loving Louise and Archie loving (his wife) Edith, you got away with being goofy and stupid,"" he said in 2003. ""Because people said at least he loved something."" It made Jefferson human, he said. One of his former co-stars said she was shocked to hear he had died. ""I thought Sherman was doing very well,"" said Marla Gibbs, who played feisty maid Florence Johnston on the ""The Jeffersons."" ""I am saddened to hear that Sherman has made his transition. We were trying to come up with a new show that we could participate in, but of course, that cannot happen now. ""Sherman was one of the most generous co-stars I have ever worked with. He happily set me up so that I could slam him, and I did the same for him. I shall miss him deeply."" Hemsley said he drew on his experiences as a young man to develop Jefferson's celebrated strut, which he did during filming as a joke. ""The way we walked in South Philly, you think you bad,"" he said. ""You gotta be important. ""We had done about seven or eight takes (on the 'Jeffersons' set) ... and then we started clowning around,"" he said of the walk. ""That's the one they kept."" Hemsley also played Deacon Ernest Frye in the sitcom ""Amen."" ""With the passing of Sherman Hemsley, the world loses one of its most unique comedic talents, and a lovely man,"" Norman Lear, the creator of ""All in the Family,"" said in a statement. In 2001, Lear told Larry King that he discovered Hemsley doing the Broadway play ""Purlie."" EW: A tribute to George Jefferson . He remembered him ""singing and dancing, and (Hemsley) was one of the most unique actors on the stage."" In 1990, he released an album, ""Ain't That a Kick in the Head,"" and two years later another, entitled ""Dance."" ""I had the pleasure of working with him on 'House of Payne,' "" said producer and director Tyler Perry. ""He brought laughter and joy to millions. My childhood would have been a lot sadder without him. Thanks for the joy, thanks for your talent and thanks for your life. I celebrate it in all of its beauty. God bless you, Mr. Hemsley.""

"(CNN) -- He'd said his daddy always told him that a fool never changes his mind. And Elwin Wilson didn't want to be a fool. Wilson, a former Ku Klux Klan member who apologized for his racist past and specifically for beating a black man who went on to become a U.S. congressman, has died. He was 76. Wilson came to national attention when he publicly apologized to Georgia Rep. John Lewis. He and his friends attacked Lewis at a bus station in South Carolina some 50 years ago. ""My daddy always told me that a fool never changes his mind, and a smart man changes his mind. And that's what I've done, and I'm not ashamed of it,"" Wilson told CNN's Don Lemon in 2009. ""I feel like I'm apologizing to the world right now."" Lewis, who appeared on the same show, said he forgave Wilson. ""It is very much in keeping with the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence, to have the ability, the capacity, to say I'm sorry, forgive me, and the person that received the attack will say you're forgiven. Because hate is too heavy a burden to bear,"" Lewis told Lemon. He said that Wilson was the first and only person who had attacked him and apologized for it. ""Maybe Mr. Wilson will inspire others to come forth,"" Lewis said. Wilson died Thursday at Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill, South Carolina. He was a native of Gaston County, North Carolina, and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, according to an obituary on a funeral home website. Wilson loved to collect antiques, especially clocks.

"(CNN) -- Tributes are flowing for Scottish author Iain Banks, who has died aged 59 after a short battle with cancer just days before the release of his final novel. The prolific writer, best known for his 1984 debut ""The Wasp Factory"" and 1992's ""The Crow Road,"" was noted as an author of darkly humorous literary and science fiction, the latter of which was published under the name Iain M. Banks. His wife, Adele, said he died in the early hours of the morning and that ""his death was calm and without pain."" Banks released a statement in April revealing he had been diagnosed with late-stage cancer of the gall bladder, after suffering what he believed was a back strain. Writing that it was ""extremely unlikely"" he would live beyond a year, he announced that he had asked his long-term partner ""if she will do me the honor of becoming my widow,"" adding that ""we find ghoulish humor helps."" The couple were married in the Scottish Highlands and honeymooned in Venice and Paris, before Banks was hospitalized in Scotland on their return. Banks asked his publishers to bring forward the release of his final novel, ""The Quarry,"" so he could see its publication. The book, to be released June 20, details the final weeks of a 40-something protagonist, Guy, in his own fight against cancer. His publishers, Little, Brown, said the author had been presented with a finished copy of the book three weeks ago. ""Banks' ability to combine the most fertile of imaginations with his own highly distinctive brand of gothic humor made him unique,"" the company said in a statement. ""He is an irreplaceable part of the literary world."" The rapid passing of the writer, known for his love of malt whisky and strong political views -- he tore up his passport in 2003 in protest at the Iraq War -- drew an outpouring of grief from fellow authors and fans alike. The English writer Neil Gaiman tweeted: ""I'm crying in an empty house. A good man and a friend for almost 30 years."" Referencing the expression for death used in one of Banks' most celebrated novels, the Scottish author Ian Rankin tweeted that his friend was ""away the crow road far too soon."" He added: ""Right now I'd like to kick cancer in its sniggering head, but instead I'll take a single malt."" Fellow Scot Irvine Welsh, the author of ""Trainspotting,"" called Banks ""one of the finest writers and greatest imaginations ever,"" and said his debut novel ""was one of those books that changed my life (and) made me want to be a writer."" Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond described Banks as ""one of Scotland's literary greats who always approached life with extraordinary vitality.""

"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa will stay at Ferrari until the end of the 2013 season after extending his contract with the stable by one year. The Brazilian, who followed up his first podium finish in two years at Suzuka by finishing fourth in Sunday's Korean Grand Prix, agreed the deal after meeting with Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo at Maranello on Tuesday morning. ""I am very happy to have reached this agreement,"" Massa, who has been with Ferrari since 2006, told the team's official website. ""Ferrari is my racing family and throughout my entire time in Formula 1, I have always driven cars powered by engines built in Maranello: I can't see myself driving cars propelled by anything else!"" The announcement comes a day after Di Montezemolo attempted to quash media reports linking Germany's double world champion Sebastian Vettel with a move to Ferrari in 2014 by saying he didn't want ""two roosters in the same hen house"". Read: Ferrari chief dampens Vettel switch talk . With two-time champion Fernando Alonso currently Ferrari's number one driver, the long-standing chief of the Italian firm explained his comments by saying that he wanted two drivers who would be racing ""for Ferrari and not for themselves."" In their statement, Ferrari said that ""one of the reasons that pushed Montezemolo and Massa to decide on announcing the renewal today (was) to put an end to all the speculation."" The constructor added that it hopes that the decision to finalize the 2013 line-up in plenty of time will help Alonso focus on winning Ferrari's first drivers' championship since Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen won the title in 2007. The Spaniard currently lies second in the championship standing -- his tally of 209 points just six fewer than Vettel's with four races of the season left -- while Massa is down in ninth place with 81 points, 30 of which have come in the last fortnight. ""He has been part of our family for over a decade and has shown, especially in this recent part of the season, that he is once again competitive at the highest level, which is what is expected of every driver who gets behind the wheel of a Ferrari,"" said Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicai. ""We have always supported Felipe, even in the most difficult moments of his career and we are certain of his worth and are sure he will know how to repay the confidence this renewal proves we have in him."" One of the most testing moments in Massa's career came when he suffered severe head injuries after a crash in qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, with Ferrari leaving the Brazilian's place open ahead of his return the following season.","Felipe Massa to stay at Ferrari until end of 2013 at least .

"(CNN) -- Since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO of Yahoo last year, there's been a lot of talk about how the famously detail-oriented ex-Googler will ""refocus"" the company. But it's becoming increasingly clear that Mayer is broadening, not narrowing, Yahoo's scope, cementing its once passé reputation as the original internet ""portal."" The latest sign of this trend came just this past weekend, when multiple reports had Mayer in talks to acquire the online television hub Hulu. Less than one week earlier, Yahoo announced it would pay $1.1 billion for microblog network Tumblr. Two months ago, the company paid a reported $30 million to buy news digest app Summly from a British teenager. The common thread: Yahoo keeps expanding into new areas, even though it was already a sprawling internet conglomerate when Mayer took control, with everything from movie listings to stock quotes to a photo-sharing social network to a news hub to a search engine. (And don't forget the ""OMG!"" section.) Yahoo's mission creep is a useful case study in why web companies like Google and Facebook continue to grow their functionality and why startups keep selling to the seemingly bloated leviathans, even though tech advances have made it cheaper and easier than ever for software companies and web services to go it alone, and despite the fact that consumers are migrating to highly specialized mobile apps. Once upon a time, the idea of agglomerating lots of functionality in one website seemed like an obsolete throwback, a vain attempt to carry forward the glory days of the online portal in the late 1990s. Portals had their time and place, but it was in the past, the thinking went, during a transitory period when it was expensive to build the most basic interactive website. That financial barrier gave well-capitalized internet companies the opportunity to dominate many verticals at once. The way of the future was going to be focused sites, like Google.com, whose ultra-bare homepage was about nothing but search (and whose guardian angel of minimalism was reportedly named Marissa Mayer). At one point in 2006, a top Yahoo executive even issued a famous memo comparing Yahoo's extremely broad offerings to peanut butter, ""a thin layer of investment spread across everything we do and thus we focus on nothing in particular... We lack a focused, cohesive vision for our company."" Interestingly, that executive, Brad Garlinghouse, has since recanted his diagnosis of Yahoo, saying the company's real problem was a lack of ""passion and entrepreneurial zeal."" So why is Yahoo in the midst of purposely transforming itself into an über portal even as computer users are migrating to super-focused mobile apps and even when its leader made her name touting simplicity and minimalism? And how did Google, once the poster child for focus, end up as a sort of accidental portal, with its own social network, webmail site, online map, and video sharing service, to say nothing of its smartphone manufacturer or set of operating systems? Because we live in a world where the most valuable information -- and especially the demographic and tracking data coveted by online advertisers -- does not want to be free, and in fact is hoarded in proprietary databases that can only be assembled if you're a portal, or look a lot like one. Or at least this is part of the reason. Consider Google. The company historically derives virtually all its revenue selling ads around keywords, either the ones you type into its search engine or those you embed in your email messages and web pages. But then Facebook came along and began selling ads around social information, like your birthday, what movies you like, and whether and where you want to college. That turned into a multi-billion-dollar business. Then Apple came along and released the iPhone, which has helped turn mobile advertising into another multi-billion-dollar business. Both of these new online ad businesses threatened to replace or at least disrupt Google's bread and butter keyword ads. And Google was locked out of them; the company can't get at your social data on Facebook, and by default it doesn't get your location data or Siri searches on the iPhone. While certain data is freely or routinely shared on the internet — IP and email addresses, search keywords you click on, browser and operating system identifiers — social and mobile data is locked away. So Google went out and built its own social and mobile silos. The results have been mixed, but it's better than nothing. Hyper-focused startups face the same dilemma. Consider the Israeli mapping company Waze. Waze makes an app that lets you easily share and view road traffic conditions, creating a nifty symbiotic relationship between users: you tell me what traffic is like where you are, and I'll tell you what traffic is like where I am. But neither of us has an incentive to share data of value to Waze, information like demographics and shopping preferences that might help the company place high-priced ads within its free app. As a result, Waze has reportedly entered into acquisition talks with both Facebook and Google, two portal-like companies that could instantly monetize Waze by connecting the app to their trove of user dossiers. Which brings us back to Yahoo. You'll notice Yahoo has no world-dominating social network like Facebook, or even a respectable runner up like Google+. It has to cobble together information about you from various sources, like information you've attached to your Flickr photo account, in your Yahoo Mail signup, within your Yahoo Finance portfolio tracker, via your Yahoo search history, and so on. Yahoo is motivated to expand, not narrow, the pool of potential information sources. Buying Tumblr gives the company potentially valuable data on the interests of sophisticated young computer users; Summly lets it see what news you are interested in while mobile; Hulu would provide insight into what television shows you prefer. Meanwhile, each information source also doubles as an ad delivery channel. There is a real elegance to the idea of focused companies with clear missions and simple products. It is similarly attractive to imagine we can improve our complicated lives in this complex world by stitching together highly specialized apps that do one thing and do it well. ""I've always liked simplicity,"" Mayer once told a reporter. But software gets messy fast, and so it is with technology companies. It turns out that even on the open platform of the internet, where it's never been easier or cheaper to launch an app, real benefits still accrue to large organizations with inelegant mashups of functionality and huge proprietary data sets.

"(CNN) -- Forget Ashton Kutcher and Aaron Sorkin. The next Steve Jobs biopic you see will star the ""I'm a Mac"" guy and come from the twisted minds of Funny or Die. The comedy website confirmed Tuesday that it's planning its own feature-length version of the Apple co-founder's life, ""iSteve."" Starring as Jobs will be Justin Long, whom most people know from Apple's ""I'm a Mac-I'm a PC"" ads but who also appeared in TV's ""Ed"" and ""New Girl"" and films like ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" ""Drag Me to Hell"" and ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story."" In a publicity photo, Long mimics the pose Jobs struck on the cover of Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography, ""Steve Jobs,"" looking something like a cross between Jobs and a brainy homeless man. Funny or Die plans to release its movie, which will clock in between 60 and 75 minutes, on April 15. Writer and director Ryan Perez says that although his Web movie faces serious competition from Hollywood, he's confident his take will shine through. ""I got an iPhone last year,"" he said. ""I'm confident that qualifies me to be an expert on Steve Jobs."" He said the project began as one of the short-form sketches Funny or Die is best known for: a spoof trailer for a Jobs biopic. ""At some point, someone just threw out that we should make the movie,"" he said. Perez wouldn't give away any plot details but suggested that the movie -- researched through ""a cursory reading of the Steve Jobs Wikipedia page"" -- will be ridiculous enough that it won't run the risk of offending fans of Jobs', who died in October 2011. ""We took quite a bit of dramatic license with Steve Jobs' life, but not as much as the makers of 'Argo' took with their story,"" he said. The announcement comes as two high-profile Jobs films move along the Hollywood pipeline. Perhaps the most highly anticipated is being penned by Academy Award-winner Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter behind ""The West Wing,"" ""The Newsroom,"" ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The Social Network."" It will reportedly be divided into three scenes, all of which will unfold in real time. ""Jobs,"" a lower-budget affair starring Ashton Kutcher, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to mixed reviews in January. It had been scheduled to open in theaters April 19, to coincide with Apple's 37th anniversary, but now has been pushed back.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan was a ""man-made disaster"" that unfolded as a result of collusion between the facility's operator, regulators and the government, an independent panel said in an unusually frank report Thursday. The report by the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission outlines errors and willful negligence at the plant before the earthquake and tsunami that devastated swaths of northeastern Japan on March 11 last year, and a flawed response in the hours, days and weeks that followed. It also offers recommendations and encourages the nation's parliament to ""thoroughly debate and deliberate"" the suggestions. The crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. Commissioned by the national parliament, the panel's report tellingly blames Japanese culture for the fundamental causes of the disaster. As well as detailing the specific failings related to the accident, the report describes a Japan in which nuclear power became ""an unstoppable force, immune to scrutiny by civil society."" ""Its regulation was entrusted to the same government bureaucracy responsible for its promotion,"" the commission said. Fukushima plant operator: We weren't prepared for nuclear accident . Contradicting claims by Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, the operator of the plant, the report said that ""the direct causes of the accident were all foreseeable prior to March 11, 2011."" The operator, regulators and the government ""failed to correctly develop the most basic safety requirements -- such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans,"" the commission said. Following the quake and tsunami, the lack of training and knowledge of the TEPCO workers at the facility reduced the effectiveness of the response to the situation at a critical time, according to the report. As the crisis escalated, TEPCO, the regulators, government agencies and the prime minister's office were ineffective in ""preventing or limiting the consequential damage"" at Fukushima Daiichi, the commission said. The prime minister's office didn't promptly declare a state of emergency, the commission noted. And chains of command were disrupted amid the crisis, creating confusion, it said. Meanwhile, communication failures about critical decisions undermined trust between the different parties. The report's authors -- led by Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a former president of the Science Council of Japan -- attributed the failings at the plant before and after March 11 specifically to Japanese culture. ""What must be admitted -- very painfully -- is that this was a disaster 'Made in Japan,' "" the report said. ""Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to 'sticking with the program.' "" Fukushima residents call for criminal charges against nuclear officials . Suggesting that the mind-set that supported the negligence at Fukushima ""can be found across Japan,"" Kurokawa also urged citizens to ""reflect on our responsibility as individuals in a democratic society."" The commission made a series of recommendations to try to avoid a repeat of the catastrophe, calling for the overhaul of TEPCO and the nuclear regulators. It urged the establishment of a permanent parliamentary committee to deal with nuclear power and supervise regulators. A ""fundamental re-examination of the crisis management system"" was suggested. The report called for measures tackling public health and welfare issues, including the establishment of a system ""to deal with long-term public health effects,"" monitoring ""hot spots"" and ""the spread of radioactive contamination."" It called for starting ""a detailed and transparent program of decontamination and relocation."" Evacuee's suicide sad reminder how Fukushima continues to claim victims . A system of independent investigation commissions dealing with nuclear issues should be developed, it said. The report comes at a delicate time for the Japanese nuclear sector. This week, the first reactor to be switched on since the Fukushima disaster came back online. All 50 commercial nuclear reactors in Japan had been offline since May 5 for safety checks. The restart of the No. 3 reactor at the Ohi Nuclear Power Plant, which serves western Japan, prompted protests by anti-nuclear activists. TEPCO admitted last month that it was not fully prepared for the nuclear disaster. The company's final report on the disaster said it did not have sufficient measures to prevent the accident. It also acknowledged criticism that TEPCO took too long to disclose information. On Thursday, the company declined to comment on the independent commission's report. The Japanese government has approved plans effectively to nationalize TEPCO with a $12.5 billion capital injection to save it from bankruptcy. Though no deaths have been attributed to the nuclear accident, the earthquake and tsunami killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. Japan once again getting power from nuclear energy . There have been several investigations into the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. In December, a government-formed panel of investigators released an interim report saying poorly trained operators misread a key backup system and waited too long to start pumping water into overheating reactor units. The government's 10-member panel, led by Tokyo University engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura, also said neither TEPCO nor government regulators were prepared for the chance that a tsunami could trigger a nuclear disaster. That panel is due to deliver its final report at the end of July. ""We would like to take a good look into both reports and take appropriate measures,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said at a news conference Thursday, referring to the parliament-commissioned report and the government-requested report.

"Diyarbakir, Turkey (CNN) -- The empty anchorman's chair in the small television studio said it all. Mehmet Ali Birand, Turkey's most charismatic broadcaster, writer and political commentator had passed away. Birand was in his 70s. He had been battling cancer for years. But news of his death after undergoing gallbladder surgery in hospital still came as a shock. On Thursday night, a hush settled over a bustling restaurant in Diyarbakir when a waiter turned the TV up to hear the sad announcement. Only two days before, Birand had been broadcasting from behind that same desk. His eyes sparkled. He smiled as he spoke. He always performed in front of the camera with such energy. It looked like he was popping out of his chair. It's tempting and lazy for me to describe Birand to foreigners as Turkey's own ""Walter Cronkite."" But Birand was so charming, elegant and vibrant, it's not fair to compare the veteran journalist to anyone else. With Birand's passing, Turkey lost one of its most effective communicators -- not only to millions of Turks who watched his news broadcast on Kanal D every night, but also to foreigners like myself who struggle haplessly to explain this fascinating and sometimes frustrating country to the outside world. Birand had a remarkable way with words, even when he wasn't conversing in his native Turkish or in French, which he insisted he spoke far better than English. ""Oh my God, the state has a very heavy hand!"" he exclaimed once, during a radio interview with me in 2007. ""Once you are pursued, once you are sent to trial, everything changes."" We were discussing state persecution of journalists. It was something Birand knew intimately. In the 1990s, his reporting angered the army generals who once controlled so much of Turkey, and he says they sought to punish him for his disobedience. Years later, the subject kept coming up in our conversations every time a reporter was thrown in jail, every time a journalist was murdered -- even as the government denied involvement. ""We don't have enough freedom in criticizing the government, criticizing the police, the security forces. That has to be changed, there is no way out,"" Birand told me in 2010. After the Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink was gunned down on an Istanbul street in 2007, Birand told me he was now living with protection from a body guard. ""I'm self-censoring, I don't want to get into trouble, I don't want to get shot. Unfortunately there is this possibility. I'm afraid!"" he said. But Birand continued writing and broadcasting. Until about a year ago he was managing editor of CNN's joint venture in Turkey, CNN Turk. Every week in his newspaper columns, he gently preached tolerance, urging his leaders and fellow citizens to approach disputes through dialogue rather than fury. His final column published in the English-language Hurriyet Daily News urged hot-headed Kurdish militants and heavy-handed Turkish cops to show restraint at a demonstration Thursday in Diyarbakir for three Kurdish political activists murdered in Paris. ""I want to be hopeful,"" the veteran journalist wrote. As it turned out, the potentially-explosive Diyarbakir gathering passed peacefully, with no tear gas, gunfire or Molotov cocktails. Birand's message of fairness won him supporters, even within the ranks of Turkey's deeply alienated Kurdish youth. As crowds of Kurdish demonstrators dispersed after the memorial gathering on Thursday, a young Kurdish man approached my camera crew. ""Is Mehmet Ali Birand OK?"" he asked, with obvious concern. ""I heard he was in hospital."" I have been a little awestruck by Birand, ever since I first met him a decade ago when I was a foreign correspondent in my 20s. Last year I asked him what words of advice he might have for young Turkish journalists. ""One should not fear the government, especially the civilian government. We did not fear the military government. They should not fear the civilian government,"" said Birand. ""Continue writing. Continue insisting on your views. Don't panic.""

"(CNN) -- Does the Internet need more rules? Does it need any rules at all? Based on the comments to our story ""Meet the Rules of the Internet,"" the judgment is decidedly mixed. The story explained the origin of the Internet's ""rules,"" originally a set of guidelines/inside jokes spawned by a variety of sources, including the Internet collective Anonymous, the site Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan's Christopher Poole. As with many Internet memes, however, the concept quickly spread to the mainstream to the point where it's now fairly routine to run across references to ""Rule 34"" in blog posts and comment strings.

"(CNN) -- In case you haven't heard, Mailbox is the iOS app that everyone wants to get their grubby little paws on. The hip new e-mail app is an alternative interface for Gmail accounts (yes, it only works with Gmail). People who have used it love the gesture-based interface and the ability to ""snooze"" messages—this latter feature prompts a pop-up message to remind you to reply at some point in the future, like later in the day, later that night, or over the weekend. On Friday morning, Mailbox announced that it was acquired by Dropbox. With any luck, that means Mailbox's frustrating rollout policy might be relaxed. The app, which debuted in early February 2013, is so popular that the company has slowed its release through a ""reservations"" system. Presumably to stem the crushing demand, Mailbox restricts the number of new accounts that can be activated at a time.

"(CNN) -- Apple CEO Tim Cook might soon be sharing Silicon Valley's most expensive cup of coffee. Sometime in the next year, Cook will sit down for a cup of mud with someone who has paid at least $210,000 for the privilege. Apple fandom taken to its craziest, and costliest, extreme? Perhaps. But it's all for a good cause. Cook has volunteered, through the online-auction site Charity Buzz, to share up to an hour of his precious time with two lucky (and deep-pocketed) winners. Proceeds from the auction will go to The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights, an international nonprofit founded as a memorial to Robert F. Kennedy by his family and friends. In the auction's first day, Cook had gotten 52 bids, starting at $5,000 and spiraling upward quickly. The leading bid Thursday evening was $210,000, and there were still 19 days to go until bidding closes May 14. The coffee chat will happen at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. The winner may bring along one guest. The move fits in with the more open public persona Cook has adopted since replacing late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs. One of the knocks on Jobs was that he never contributed much of his considerable fortune, or celebrity, to charity -- at least not in the public ways other tech titans like Microsoft's Bill Gates and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg have. By some measures, a $180,000 coffee meeting with the chief of the world's leading tech company might be a bargain. An anonymous bidder paid $3.4 million last year for lunch with investor Warren Buffett. Gladwell: In 50 years, people will forget Steve Jobs . Other celebs taking part in the auction for the RFK Center include Robert DeNiro, Alex Trebek, Carrie Underwood, Peyton Manning, William Shatner and David Letterman. But if you think Apple's typical hyper-controlling approach to its world will be relaxed during Cook's coffee klatch, think again. For one, there will be no live-tweeting. ""The winner cannot blog, social network, talk to press, write about, take pictures or record during the experience in any way due to security regulations,"" reads the auction's legal terms. Visitors will be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement and are subject to a security screening. ""We expect all winning bidders and their guests to conduct themselves appropriately when attending an experience won at Charitybuzz,"" the terms continue. ""Polite manners and respect for the generous donor and adherence to any rules or parameters are a must."" Travel and lodging for the visit, which will last between 30 minutes and an hour, are not covered. No word on whether Cook will pick up the tab for the coffee.","Want to meet Apple CEO Tim Cook?

"(CNN) -- Hacker collective Anonymous announced plans to disrupt Web streams of Tuesday night's State of the Union address in protest of various Obama administration policies. In a posting on one of its Web pages, the group claimed it would target live streams of the speech, to be broadcast on the official White House site as well as many major news websites, including CNN. Television feeds of the speech weren't mentioned. However, the attack didn't appear to happen. None of the major news feeds or the official White House site showed any signs of disruption or delay during the speech. ""The President of the United States of America, and the Joint Session of Congress will face an Army tonight. We will form a virtual blockade between Capitol Hill and the Internet,"" the group declared earlier in the day. Anonymous is a loosely organized collective, and the claims of its purported members can be hard to verify. But a handful of prominent Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous, which have in the past debunked or downplayed statements made in the name of the leaderless movement, appeared Tuesday to support the threat. The @YourAnonNews account, with more than 877,000 followers, tweeted a news story about the effort shortly before 4 p.m. ET and urged followers to ""hijack"" the Twitter hashtag #SOTU -- which users will presumably use to follow the speech. The people behind the account also offered an alternate hashtag -- #opSOTU -- for supporters. During the speech the same account tweeted ""No sign of an #OpSOTU so far other than #SOTU hashtag hijacking."" While there were some Anonymous tweets using the #SOTU hashtag, they seemed largely lost in the noise of regular people commenting on and live-tweeting the speech. Anonymous said it was protesting a list of beefs it has with the Obama administration, including cybersecurity legislation. With the support of Obama, senators plan to reintroduce the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA, on Wednesday. The bill attempts to address cyberattacks by increasing the sharing of information between private companies and the Department of Homeland Security. It was killed in the Senate last year amid concerns about privacy and lack of oversight. President Obama issued an executive order on Tuesday dictating cybersecurity standards for industries with vulnerable infrastructure, such as transportation and power. Like CISPA, the order will promote the sharing of information between private companies and the government. The government wants to use that data to better address future cyberattacks, but detractors are concerned about privacy. Anonymous objects to such sharing, saying it would turn ""private companies into government informants."" The group's call to action also mentioned the recent death of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, the National Defense Authorization Act, the use of military drones, Bradley Manning and warrantless wiretapping. Taking on major news sites and the White House site was ambitious. Anonymous has announced big plans in the past, such as shutting down Facebook, without following through.

"(CNN) -- It's the internet's fault that, if the U.S. Postal Service has its way, you won't be getting letters delivered to your mailbox on Saturdays anymore. After all, how many stamps have you bought lately? But the engine of the USPS's demise could also save it. After all, how many packages have you received from Amazon lately? And wouldn't you like to get them faster? Postal Service spokesman John Friess says that while its letter-carrying business is shrinking, its package-delivery business is growing. (Note that postal carriers will still be delivering packages on Saturdays.) In its anxious search to make money any way possible, the agency late last year began testing a same-day delivery service in San Francisco for online purchases. While the experiment, called Metro Post, is starting out small, it also comes at a time when the world's largest online retailer might be looking for a lot of trucks and a lot of drivers who can do same-day delivery cheap. Amazon's strategy for consumer domination includes erecting million-square-foot warehouses near the country's largest cities. The company has played coy on whether its expanding physical infrastructure signals plans to offer same-day delivery on a wide scale. If so, it will still need a transportation infrastructure to go along with it. And that fleet can't just consist of UPS trucks that Amazon tells to go faster. Same-day delivery requires a fundamentally different logistical framework from its standard system, logistics experts say. To get orders delivered even as quickly as overnight, Amazon pulls together the orders at its distribution centers before turning the packages over to UPS or FedEx. The carriers then feed those packages into their own logistics operations, which typically means traveling to UPS or FedEx distribution centers and depots before heading out on trucks to people's houses. All of that transit doesn't move fast enough for same-day. To make same-day work, the orders must travel straight from the distribution centers to customers. Of course, Amazon could hatch plans with UPS and FedEx to offer same-day. Unlike those two companies, however, which both have thriving businesses doing what they already do, the USPS has drivers with fewer letters to deliver and a desperate need to innovate. According to the optimistic logic of the so-called sharing economy, that seemingly dire scenario doesn't look like a problem; it looks like idle capacity just waiting to be leveraged. According to Friess, the Postal Service wouldn't need to hire new drivers or buy more trucks to offer same-day, Friess says. The agency would simply have to adjust where its drivers were going and when. ""We already have the existing infrastructure in place,"" he says. ""That's what sets us apart."" The postal service still has miles to go before becoming Amazon's courier of choice. The pilot program is limited to delivering a maximum of 200 packages per day to customers of 1-800-Flowers.com's sister brands, which sell popcorn, cookies, chocolate and gift baskets. Friess says the USPS is planning to add more retailers soon. If the test is successful, which he says the agency believes it will be, Metro Post will roll out to other large markets across the country. Friess declined to speculate on whether the USPS' 214,000 trucks â€” what the agency calls the world's largest civilian fleet â€” could end up in the service of Amazon. But he said he believed the USPS will start to look increasingly attractive to other companies exploring the same-day option: ""We'd never close the door on ways to expand our revenue.""

"(CNN) -- Yeah, yeah. We know. You just watch the Super Bowl for the commercials. Here at CNN Tech, most of us also enjoyed what turned out to be a pretty competitive game. Not to mention an excuse to obsess over Twitter for a few hours. But that didn't mean we didn't take notice of which Web and tech companies shelled out the big bucks to nestle in between ads for corn chips and beer in black bottles. Gone are the halcyon days when every tech-bubble startup with a dream and a sock puppet advertised during the game. But plenty of heavy hitters were in evidence. In no particular order, here they are, with a little tech-world analysis about what, if anything, they achieved: . Best Buy . We're calling this one the tech winner of the night. Because who doesn't love Amy Poehler? The ""Parks and Recreation"" and ex-""Saturday Night Live"" star rattles off rapid-fire consumer tech questions while playfully sexually harassing a Best Buy clerk (but in a really cute way). And saying ""dongle."" Is it enough to get tech-obsessed shoppers to forgo online retailers for a good, old-fashioned brick-and-mortar store? We're not sure. But it was a valiant effort. It also showcased the store's emphasis on selling mobile gadgets instead of TVs or home electronics. Some of our favorite one-liners: . • ""What's LTE? Is it contagious?"" • ""Can I use a dongle with this? Does it make you uncomfortable when I use the word 'dongle'?"" • ""What's the cloud? Where is the cloud? Are we in the cloud now?"" • ""Will this (a tablet) read 'Fifty Shades of Grey' to me in a sexy voice? Will you?"" Go Daddy . The Web address clearinghouse kept to its usual Super Bowl-ad strategy. Which is to say, titillating some while annoying or disgusting many others. This year, it was a splotchy-faced nerd (yay, stereotypes!) sucking face with supermodel Bar Refaeli. The makeout session, meant to highlight Go Daddy's ""When Sexy Meets Smart"" slogan, came complete with superimposed sucking sounds that would have felt right at home during a face-hugger assault from ""Aliens."" At least race-car driver Danica Patrick left her clothes on this time. Everyone did, in fact, but that likely didn't appease many critics of GoDaddy's lad-mag-style commercials. Who was the smart one again? Not the woman? Gotcha. All that said, how many more domain-registration companies can you name without a Google search? Samsung . Instead of focusing on a single product, Samsung used funnymen Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd basically to say ""Samsung"" a lot while pretending to fight over who will get to be in the commercial. They both brandish Galaxy Note smartphones, while LeBron James makes an appearance via the screen of a Galaxy Tab. But the main point here seems to be to continue establishing the brand as a fun alternative to Apple (which, notably, didn't buy Super Bowl TV time). And to let the world know Rogen would wear a diaper for Samsung. BlackBerry . Fresh off unveiling its BlackBerry 10 operating system and two new phones, the company tried to keep its badly needed momentum going with a 30-second spot in which a guy uses the new BlackBerry Z10 to set himself on fire, grow elephant legs and magically turn an out-of-control big rig into an exploding pile of rubber duckies. Uh ... yeah. The point? In 30 seconds, it's easier to show you what the phone can't do than all the things it can. We get it. And the important thing is to get people talking. But when Gizmodo asks if it's ""the dumbest tech ad you've ever seen,"" maybe it wasn't exactly the 108-yard touchdown run of advertising. Motorola . Once the darling of the Android world with its Droid phones, Motorola has faded as Samsung's Galaxy S III has become arguably the chief rival to the iPhone. So, how to get back in the spotlight again? Apparently by putting Megan Fox in a bubble bath. She wonders what would happen if she posts a nudie shot using a Motorola Blur. Cue montage: Among scenes of a power line exploding and construction workers looking distracted, there's a stereotypically sassy gay couple slapping each other and some implied ... well, masturbation. Are we sure this wasn't another Go Daddy ad? We're not sure how far this will springboard Motorola, now owned by Google. But people will talk. And ... you know ... other things, apparently. E*Trade . More creepy talking baby. Please -- make it stop.","Super Bowl ads featured some of tech industry's big players .

"(CNN) -- Should the government keep its hands off online shopping? According to the massive response to our stories on a proposed Internet sales tax, many of you think so. On Monday, the U.S. Senate approved the Marketplace Fairness Act. It would allow governments to collect taxes on sales that Internet retailers, from titans such as Amazon and eBay to independent app developers, make in their state. The point, supporters say, is to put traditional brick-and-mortar retailers on equal footing with digital storefronts that, in many cases, haven't been required to add tax to their prices. But in an age when many of us have gotten used to one-click, 24-hour shopping on our laptops, tablets and phones, not many of the readers of our story Monday explaining the bill seemed overly excited at the prospect. ""I will never set foot in another brick and mortar store again,"" wrote a commenter using the screen name Riynko (who was perhaps exaggerating to make a point). ""Their whining just cost us all a lot of money. Let this be the nail in their coffin."" A lot of the objections reflected traditional political arguments. Conservative-minded commenters looked at the bill not as a bid for fairness but as government digging into our wallets once again. ""Its criminal how they tax every dollar you make several times over,"" wrote CNN commenter Diraphe. ""They tax your earnings, tax your spending, tax your property, special taxes, tax your utilities, tax your gas. ... They even tax you when you die!"" Added reader CactusThorn: ""Politicians never saw a source of income they didn't want to tap. Then they waste the money on useless projects and regulations."" But anti-tax arguments sometimes transcended the usual left-right battles. Some comments reflected the ""keep your hands off our Internet"" mindset that has grown among online users who fear the impact both government and big business could have on a free and open Web. Reddit co-founder: I'm not mayor of the Internet . The personal philosophies of billions of Web users obviously run the gamut. But the Internet has always had a sort of Wild West feel to it, and some commenters argue that is why it's grown into the unprecedented force its become. ""Watching Congress debate the Marketplace Fairness Act, I'm reminded of the Aesop's fable where a man and his wife had a goose that laid golden eggs,"" commenter nutemanlll wrote. ""Thinking there may be more value to what's inside the goose than the golden eggs it laid, they killed it, only to realize the value was the golden eggs."" On Twitter, Cynthia Schames said that's what she's worried about. Schames runs Abbey Post, an online marketplace where users buy and sell plus-sized fashions. ""Oh goody, more taxes!"" was her immediate, sarcastic reaction to a post from the CNN Tech Twitter account. ""Abbey Post is a 2-way marketplace. Individuals buy and sell. Only physical retailers and government wastrels want this new tax."" In fairness, the bill as written would only tax sales by online businesses that do more than $1 million in sales annually outside states where they have physical operations. That would, at least in theory, exempt digital mom-and-pop shops and the random Etsy crafter. But corporations with tax attorneys on speed-dial have a way of negotiating such things, as one reader pointed out. ""All it will do is rearrange the Internet businesses,"" commenter 412ctruth wrote. ""If an eBay business does more than 1 million in business they just have to divide their company into segments. Say it is women's clothing store, they just create a women's shoe store, a women's coat and jacket store, and a women's clothing store, all doing less than 1 million dollars each and no taxes."" IT pro and photographer Christopher Souser replied to us on Twitter: ""It wont help small businesses, it will only help large retailers. Online and offline; choking out small online retailers."" Of course, even among engaged Web users, disdain for the plan wasn't unanimous. Some people said that with e-commerce as prominent as it's become, it's only fair that states should get a cut. Others worried about a future in which Web-based sales destroy hometown operations. ""As a small business owner (and right-leaning individual) I applaud this tax,"" commenter imo wrote. ""As a consumer it is not welcomed, but as a small business trying to compete with large corporations it absolutely levels the playing field."" Owning a company with stores in 16 states means having to collect sales taxes in all of them, while major Web players with operations in just one or two don't, the commenter wrote. ""There are many taxes that I disagree with, but this is not one of them."" For it to become a reality, the bill must now clear the Republican-controlled House and be signed by President Barack Obama. It got overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, but the House, much like the Internet, has been known to dance to its own tune on such matters.","CNN commenters mostly dislike the idea of an Internet sales tax .

"(CNN) -- Melissa Earll owns stacks of classic comic books, baseball cards that include a young Hank Aaron and Whitey Ford and other collectibles she wants to sell. But she can't do so on eBay, she says. According to Earll, the popular auction site can't confirm her as a seller because she's deaf. ""eBay keeps me from taking advantage of opportunities that other people have and it's because I couldn't hear,"" Earll, of Nevada, Missouri, told CNN affiliate WDAF-TV. ""Somebody has to have the courage to stand up and say 'this is not right.'"" At issue, according to Earll, is the way the auction site verifies sellers. eBay says it offered Earll alternative ways of verifying her identity. But the dispute casts a light on a bigger question that some experts say may need to go all the way to the Supreme Court: Just how responsive must the Internet be to the Americans With Disabilities Act? The Internet has long been seen as an equalizer, granting everyone the same access to information regardless of cultural background or economic status. But for some users with disabilities, it's not so simple. ""The ADA was signed in 1990. The Internet didn't really start going until the 1990s,"" said William D. Goren, a Decatur, Georgia, attorney who specializes in cases involving the federal law. ""This is a topic we're going to have to be watching. This is not going away."" In Earll's case, she says she can't use eBay's verification system, which requires sellers to retrieve and submit a password from a telephone call. She can't hear the password and says eBay doesn't use voice-to-text or other technologies deaf people often rely upon. ""They said, can your mom or dad answer the phone for you,"" said Earll, who lip-reads and speaks with the assistance of a hearing aid. ""And I said, I'm a 47-year-old adult woman. No. I don't live at home. No."" A federal judge didn't agree with her argument, though. U.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed her complaint after finding it lacked enough facts. Specifically, he said Earll didn't prove that she tried to register as a seller after talking to eBay about a possible solution. ""eBay is pleased with the court's decision to dismiss the case,"" company spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said in a written statement. ""eBay strives to provide all users with the best customer experiences possible, including those with special access needs. eBay will continue to stand ready to assist those who are deaf or hard of hearing become eBay sellers."" Earll is appealing that ruling. Little legal agreement . eBay is the most high-profile website to be involved in a disabilities discrimination case since Netflix, which last year agreed to caption all of its online movies and other shows by 2014. The move, which the National Association for the Deaf called ""a model for the streaming video industry,"" came after Netlix was hit with a 2010 class-action suit because not all of its films were subtitled. A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in the plaintiffs' favor, saying any new laws regarding the Internet should ""complement, not supplant"" the Americans With Disabilities Act. ""The Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund,"" which handled the case, ""hopes that this is the beginning of opening the Internet for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in streamed entertainment, education, government benefits, and more,"" the group said at the time. Arguments for both sides in those and other cases point out something of a problem: There seems to be no agreement on how disability issues on the Web should be handled. Goren, the disability law attorney, said judges have ruled both ways in those cases, and that even those who agreed cited different laws in doing so. Some have stuck close to the original wording of the ADA, which requires that places of business be physically accessible to people with disabilities. Websites that represent brick-and-mortar stores need to comply, courts have ruled, while Web-only businesses do not. Other courts have opined that ADA regulations should obviously be extended to Web companies, since the widespread popularity of Web commerce didn't exist when the law was written. It all makes for a confusing jumble of opinions that legal experts say needs to be clarified. Congress hasn't been much help, either. Even when they made some changes to the original ADA language in 2008, they failed to address online concerns. To the Supreme Court? That, Goren says, means the Supreme Court will ultimately need to settle the issue once and for all. ""This is going to go all the way to the top,"" he said. ""There are so many different approaches. You're going to see the courts split. Unless Congress steps in and talks about how the ADA applies to the Internet, the court's going to have to figure it out."" Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University and director of the school's High Tech Law Institute, thinks current law is somewhat more settled. The argument that won the day for eBay -- that the ADA doesn't specifically mention websites and, therefore, doesn't apply to them -- has prevailed except for in ""quirky rulings,"" he says. ""We might debate the merits of those laws, many of which were written for a different time, but that's for the legislatures to do, not the courts,"" he said. "" As a result, the lawsuits against websites for discriminating against the disabled are not legally meritorious. In this case, the courts bent over backwards -- more than they should have, in my opinion -- to give Ms. Earll a chance to make a valid legal complaint. She couldn't."" That said, Goldman thinks websites should voluntarily be doing more. ""In this case, for example, it seems reasonable that eBay should have a workaround to their authentication system that works for the hearing-impaired,"" he said. ""They may have a workaround -- the materials I've read in this case haven't been clear about that -- but the workaround should be easy enough that Ms. Earll never needed to go to court. ""Some websites may not have the resources to provide full accommodations for the disabled, but a site like eBay does -- and it should do so,"" he added. eBay notes that in her complaint, Earll said company agents told her about alternative methods, including submitting proof of identity and SMS text messages, that she and other hearing-impaired people could use to become sellers. ""eBay offers solutions to help the visually and hearing impaired, individuals with color vision deficiencies, as well as those with limited dexterity access eBay's services,"" said Ramirez, the eBay spokeswoman. On its website, eBay has a page devoted to accessibility issues, including a profie of Rick Willison, a pastor who became a successful seller despite a degenerative eye disease. For her part, Earll says she's willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court if that's what it takes for her to use the auction site as a seller just as easily as she's used it as a shopper. ""You know what's funny -- eBay loved me as a buyer,"" she said. ""Oh, sure ... because they made money off of me.""","Deaf woman: eBay won't let me sell items because I'm deaf .

"(CNN) -- For more than a year, there have been rumors that Amazon is working on a smartphone. Now, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon is actually working on two. The Journal reported Thursday that Amazon is ""developing a wide-ranging line-up of gadgets,"" including two smartphones, one of which will have a 3D screen. Citing multiple anonymous sources, the Journal says the 3D-capable smartphone will not require special glasses and may even let users navigate just by moving their eyes. In addition to the two smartphone models, Amazon is also said to be working on a device for streaming music and a set-top box, the latter of which was also reported by Bloomberg BusinessWeek last month. Amazon did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Until now, Amazon's hardware efforts have centered around its Kindle e-readers and tablets. However, CEO Jeff Bezos suggested in an interview with AllThingsD in September that Amazon was planning to expand on its hardware offerings in the coming year. ""We will certainly â€” not any time soon â€” but next year. We have some more things that we hope people will enjoy,"" he told the publication. ""It's premature for me to talk about them."" While it's not particularly surprising to hear about Amazon working on a smartphone, it is a bit strange to hear news of a possible 3D-enabled device. Despite a fair amount of hype a couple years ago, 3D-technology has had mixed success at best in the consumer technology market. Amazon's stock was up by about 1.5% on the day as of publication.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- American government contractor Alan Gross went on trial in Cuba Friday in a case that appears to have derailed a tentative rapprochement between the long-estranged countries. Cuba claims Gross -- a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development -- imported illegal satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the internet. He would face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. The United States says he was helping the Jewish community improve communications. Gross on Friday was driven into the private drive of the courthouse, located in a converted mansion in a residential neighborhood of Havana. His wife, Judy, arrived on foot. Three U.S. officials also took seats in the courtroom as observers. Gross was held for more than a year before Cuban authorities formally charged him with acts against the country's independence last month. Judy Gross has appealed to Cuba to release him on humanitarian grounds. ""Alan's 88-year-old mother has just been diagnosed with lung cancer,"" she said in a written statement. ""As I deal with that reality and our 26-year-old daughter's recovery from a double mastectomy, I can only continue to hope for Alan's return and beg the Cuban government to free Alan."" He ""is an incredibly loving father,"" she noted in a video recording released shortly after her husband's arrest.  ""We've been married 40 years. His daughters miss him terribly."" In a December 2009 speech, Cuban President Raul Castro said Gross was illegally distributing ""satellite communications equipment"" to dissidents. ""The U.S. government has not renounced its goal of destroying the revolution,"" he said. ""The enemy is as active as always. Proof of that is the detention, in the last few days, of an American citizen."" In a video that recently surfaced on the Web and that appears to be a leaked Cuban intelligence briefing, a speaker accuses Gross of using satellite phones to set up wi-fi hotspots. The arrest put relations between the United States and Cuba back in a deep freeze despite initial signs of a thaw under President Barack Obama. U.S. officials sharply criticized the charges against Gross after they were announced last month. ""We deplore the Cuban government's announcement that Cuban prosecutors intend to seek a 20-year sentence for Mr. Gross,"" said Gloria Berbena, public affairs officer for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana. The White House also chimed in, claiming that Gross ""has been unjustly detained and deprived of his liberty."" ""Instead of releasing Mr. Gross, so he can come home to his wife and family, today's decision by Cuban authorities compounds the injustice suffered by a man helping to increase the free flow of information to, from and among people,"" then-White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Friday that Gross had been ""unjustly jailed for far too long."" He needs to be able to leave Cuba and return home, she said. This is a matter ""of great personal pain"" to his family and concern to the U.S. government. Foreign diplomats have speculated that Cuba will find Gross guilty, but could release him fairly quickly on humanitarian grounds.","Cuba says Alan Gross imported illegal satellite equipment .

"(CNN) -- Apple has published a letter to Chinese customers -- signed by CEO Tim Cook -- that addresses the growing controversy over the company's warranty policies there. Posted to the Chinese version of Apple's website on Monday, the letter (Google translation) discusses changes that Apple plans in China to offer better customer service. In addition to a clear statement on Apple's website regarding its repair and warranty policies, Apple also plans to increase training for its staff and authorized resellers, and plans to improve how it handles iPhone 4 and 4S repairs. ""We are aware ... the lack of external communication in this process ... lead to the speculation that Apple is arrogant, does not care or does not attach importance to consumer feedback. We express our sincere apologies for any concerns or misunderstandings this gives consumers,"" reads a Google translation version of Cook's letter. The letter comes about a week after Chinese state media began its open criticism of Apple and its response -- or lack thereof -- to warranty complaints. The People's Daily even ran a front-page piece calling Apple ""arrogant"" in dealing with Chinese consumers, saying Apple ignored customers and offered sub-par customer service. But China is such an important market to Apple -- Cook won't stop talking about Apple's growth in China during every quarter's fiscal call -- that it's no surprise Apple issued a public response. It will likely take several weeks (if not months) for changes in consumer perceptions of Apple to register. That said, Apple has encouraged Chinese consumers to get in touch with the company directly regarding issues with Apple retail stores or resellers.

"(CNN) -- ""Star Wars"" makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, who helped create Chewbacca, Yoda, Jabba the Hutt and the otherworldly creatures in the trilogy's famous barroom scene, has died, Lucasfilm said Wednesday. He was 98. A creature effects artist, Freeborn also worked on other film classics and was responsible for creating the apelike human ancestors in the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" He also did the makeup for Peter Sellers in ""Doctor Strangelove,"" Lucasfilm said on its starwars.com website.

Playful, impish and imaginative, Freeborn played a pivotal role in developing the character Yoda for ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Director Irvin Kershner said Freeborn put his own image into Yoda the Jedi Master, giving the character inquisitive and elfin features with ""more than a passing resemblance to Freeborn himself,"" Lucasfilm said.

"(CNN) -- Microsoft is working on a touch-enabled smartwatch, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing unnamed supply chain sources, The Journal claims that Microsoft asked Asian suppliers to ship components for the device. If the reports are true, it would be joining the likes of Apple, Samsung, Google, and others looking to capitalize on a forecasted boom in wearable electronics. Microsoft has so far refused to comment on the rumors. This wouldn't be Microsoft's first shot at making a smartwatch. Back in 2004 it fielded a product under the name SPOT that used FM radio signals to send instant messages from Windows Messenger, news headlines, stock information, and weather forecasts as part of a paid subscription service. But production stopped in 2008, and the SPOT (Smart Personal Object Technology) project was finally canceled last year. Interestingly, Microsoft researcher Bill Buxton spoke at length on the 37-year history of smartwatches last month, possibly foreshadowing a return to the market. The news comes days after a bleak report from IDC last week claiming that Q1 2013 marked the steepest decline ever for the PC industry, down 13.9 percent over Q1 2012, a trend that apparently accelerated rather than slowed with the release of Windows 8. It's also the second significant leak in the report's aftermath â€” last week The Journal reported that Redmond was also working on a 7-inch Surface tablet due later this year.

"(CNN) -- Let the iPhone 6 speculation begin. Apple is kicking off production on a new iPhone in the coming months and could announce the device this summer, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The phone would have the same size and shape as the iPhone 5, and Apple might also be working on a cheaper model to sell in developing countries, the report said. The Journal story contained no details about what features the next iPhone might contain, although each new iPhone model has historically boasted a more powerful processor and an upgraded camera. It wouldn't be shocking for Apple to release an iPhone in the summer. The company has released a new iPhone model every year since the device debuted in 2007, and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall. The iPhone 5 came out in September 2012, the iPhone 4S in October 2011, and the three versions before that in the summer months. One possible launchpad for the as-yet-unnamed new device could be Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, typically held each June in San Francisco. Exact dates for WWDC 2013 have not been announced. The Journal report's more interesting nuggets are about the cheaper, more colorful iPhone version. The report says Apple has been ""working on different color shells"" for the less expensive model. There have been rumblings about a cheaper iPhone for a while now. The company has often put quality above affordability, but to be competitive in the booming Asia and South America markets, it will need to drop the price of its lower-end phones. Older, less expensive iPhone versions continue to sell well but are still pricey when compared with the array of cheap Android handsets. The Wall Street Journal cites people ""familiar with the device's production"" as sources for its report. These periodic crumbs of leaked information about Apple launches may help the company, which presents itself as extremely secretive about future products. Such occasional Apple rumor stories keep the iPhone in the minds of smartphone buyers and could influence their decisions about what phone to buy next. It's been six months since Apple released a major new product, and as Fortune recently noted, its fans may be growing restless. Apple may also feel pressure to release a new iPhone soon to compete with archrival Samsung, whose popular Samsung Galaxy S line has emerged as a credible competitor. Reports of new products also would probably look good to Apple investors.","Apple to begin production on latest iPhone model soon, The Wall Street Journal says .
The new model could be ready by this summer .
A cheaper, more colorful version of the iPhone might also be in production ."
"(CNN) -- The long-rumored Facebook phone might finally be ready to make its debut. The company is expected to announce a new HTC smartphone running a special Facebook-centric version of Android on Thursday, according to numerous rumors and leaks on tech sites and major publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and 9to5Google. Expanded smartphone integration is a logical step for the social media company, which has been working hard to increase its mobile presence and make more money off of mobile advertising. The only official hint doled out by Facebook so far is that the announcement has something to do with Google's Android mobile operating system, with the invite asking press to ""Come see our new home on Android"" at its Menlo Park, California headquarters. Rumors of a Facebook phone have been swirling for years, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied the company was ""building"" a phone, saying Facebook was not interested in becoming a hardware company. Those carefully worded denials should still stand. If rumors prove true, Facebook hasn't built a phone, it's just partnered with a phone manufacturer to place its service and apps more front and center on a typical Android smartphone. That device is expected to be an HTC 4.3-inch smartphone called the HTC First that bears a passing resemblance to the iPhone, comes in multiple colors, and packs in the usual mid-range specs at moderate price. There doesn't seem to be much that's exceptional or new about the hardware itself beyond the Facebook makeover. Screens shots that purportedly show the new Android homepage, possibly called Facebook Home, show buttons along the top for common Facebook actions, such as updating a status, posting a photo or checking into a location, and icons for the major Facebook apps including Instagram and Messenger in the center of the screen. Facebook might also release a similar new standalone Facebook Android app for all Android phones. The homepage retooling would expand Facebook's reach beyond the standalone Facebook app, spreading its presence into more parts of the smartphone experience. People would end up spending larger amounts of time using the social network's features, in turn giving Facebook more opportunities to collect data and serve up relevant ads. Smartphone users are already checking Facebook an average of 14 times a day, according to a recent survey by IDC. Facebook was the most popular mobile app across platforms in 2012 in the U.S. according to comScore, and in January more people were checking Facebook on their mobile devices than desktop computers for the first time. If priced low enough, a Facebook-centric phone could be appealing to Facebook fans in developing countries, where the network is popular and smartphone sales are still rising sharply. The partnership could also be a boost for Taiwanese phone manufacturer HTC, which has been struggling to keep up with smartphone leaders Samsung and Apple. Facebook has been focusing intensely on mobile since going public in mid-2012. In the past year it has revamped its iOS and Android mobile apps and started displaying ads on mobile devices. As a result, the company has had signficant success making money on mobile. According to a recent report from research company eMarketer, Facebook is currently the second largest mobile ad publisher in the U.S. after Google, and is expected to make $964.9 million in mobile ad revenue in 2013. This is the third major product announcement from Facebook in recent months. The first was for Graph Search, an advanced search tool for more effectively drilling down into your Facebook to network to find people and pages and companies. Last month the company unveiled a redesigned news feed that looks more like its mobile apps.","Facebook is making an Android-related announcement on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- In that never-ending search for ""the next big thing in tech,"" talk has turned to wearable gadgets, especially in the form of a smartwatch that syncs with your smartphone. Just about every major tech company from Apple to Samsung to Google is reportedly working on its own take on the concept. Assuming the reports are true -- and they're far too numerous and consistent not to be -- a big wave of new smartwatches is coming soon. But these wrist gadgets are nothing new. In fact, smartwatches have a long history of failure, especially in recent years as the modern smartphone market began its explosive growth. Too many companies tried too hard to make the dream of a Dick Tracy-style watch happen before we were ready for it. There's an extensive list of smartwatch blunders in recent years. Microsoft created a software platform called SPOT that delivered news updates to watches via FM radio waves for $59 a year. Companies such as Swatch and Fossil signed on to make compatible devices, but SPOT bombed. Microsoft killed it in 2008. Then there were watches that doubled as smartphones. LG and Samsung gave that category a whirl late last decade, but the devices were way too expensive and not nearly as functional as a traditional smartphone. And Sony, a company desperately trying to remain relevant in today's mobile-centric world, still sells an Android-based smartwatch that it introduced last year, but reviews of the device are pretty bad. So are Apple, Samsung and Google setting themselves up for failure? No way. Look at it this way. Tablets were nothing new when Apple introduced the iPad in 2010. Microsoft was even noodling around with making a bigger push in the space at the time until Apple came along and completely redefined the category. In three short years, tablets have started eating into traditional PC sales as people prefer to buy a device that can do most of the things their laptop can at a fraction of the price. It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad. Last year, a company called Pebble caused a lot of hype when it raised a whopping $10.3 million on Kickstarter from 68,000 people. Pebble makes a smartwatch with a black-and-white screen similar to the E-Ink display on your Kindle. It can connect to your Android phone or iPhone via Bluetooth and display incoming text messages and other notifications. Plus it lets you control basic phone functions such as the music player. With all the hype surrounding this tiny startup, it feels like the hokeyness of a wrist computer has all but evaporated in the public's eye. The answer seems to be to make a device that isn't a replacement for your smartphone, but a clever companion, something that takes away the need to pull out your phone from your pocket or purse. Instead, you'll just glance at your wrist, as if you were simply checking the time, to see what's going on in the world. Or, with Google's much-anticipated Glass connected headset, you'll glance up at a tiny screen above your eye. According to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site BuyVia, the top five features respondents said they'd like to see in a smartwatch were e-mail and texting, phone calls, GPS, Wi-Fi and weather updates -- the same features people now rely on in their smartphones. We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.

"(CNN) -- It's weird out there and getting weirder: A California court just ruled that screwing around with your phone's map app while driving ought to be as illegal as texting or using the device without a handsfree solution. I'll get back to that in a moment, but let's talk briefly about the stuff we do while driving. Some years ago I bought my first car-based GPS, an entry-level Garmin you clipped into one of these windshield holders that attach by plastic cup and a lever you clamp down to really crank the suction. For years, both here in the U.S. and another two living in the U.K., I used the thing to go everywhere. And, I suspect like most people, I'd often fiddle with it while driving, whether adding new routes or destinations, checking sub-screens for additional info, or just tapping to mute it altogether. There's no question that's a distraction, you know, if we define that word as something ""that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else"" (thanks New Oxford American Dictionary). Then again, by that definition, eating in the car counts as a distraction. So does fiddling with the climate control or audio systems, changing CDs, glancing at a piece of paper with a handwritten address or scanning printed route directions. You can make the argument that even stuff along the road, say splashy billboards with clever (or not-so-clever) advertising and political rhetoric are distracting (rubberneck much?). Really, most things we do in life count as distractions. Sitting here typing this, the music that's playing in the background is a distraction (listening to Hiromi's new album, Move, keeps drawing my attention away from writing). The rain splashing the window on what's turning out to be a pretty gloomy Monday is a distraction. The cup of coffee I keep reaching for (and having to refill) is definitely a distraction. (Thus, my excuse for taking too long to type this up: music, rain and coffee.) No, I'm not hurtling down the road in a 2-ton metal hulk on a highway where I'm separated from equally speedy oncoming vehicles by just a few feet. Then again, I often listen to music, most surely have to deal with rain and drink plenty of coffee, all while managing to obey the rules of the road — and, I'd argue anyway, drive defensively. The only serious accident I've had in my life didn't involve a distraction at all, but a patch of unexpected black ice and a sudden crosswind that sent me fishtailing at 70 m.p.h. off the interstate into an Iowa ditch filled, thankfully, with two feet of snow. So I'm a little concerned to see (via Techdirt) that a California judge just ruled using a mobile phone to fiddle with a mapping/GPS program qualifies as distracted driving (thus rendering it illegal per state law). The case involved a driver who'd been cited for ""driving a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone."" The driver claimed to be using the phone for mapping purposes and argued that the state's distracted driving laws shouldn't have applied (he says he was looking at a map on the phone while holding it in his hand). The court, while admitting the state's underlying distracted driving strictures themselves might be too broad, ultimately disagreed with the driver, finding that the law clearly forbids using a wireless phone while driving ""unless the device is being used in a hands-free manner."" So much for maps, apps — you name it. Simply holding the phone in your hands, for all intents and purposes, is pretty much a California no-no. That Garmin I mentioned above? Long gone. I yanked it shortly after picking up my first iPhone in early 2011. Most trips, where I know what I'm doing beforehand, I'll set it up before I pull out of my garage. But occasionally I'll reprogram it on the go, when I need to add a destination or change some detail. And yet Michigan's own distracted driving laws stipulate the following: . ""Reading, typing, or sending text message on wireless 2-way communication device prohibited; use of hand-held mobile telephone prohibited; applicability of subsections (1) and (2); exceptions; violation as civil infraction; fine; local ordinances superseded."" I'm pretty sure typing an address into my phone's navigation app while driving counts as ""texting."" Should it? I suppose it probably should. What's the difference between typing an address into a GPS/mapping app and typing/reading SMS messages, really? The latter activity might continue longer if you're engaged in a conversation, but they're both the same from a motor-skills standpoint, aren't they? What about holding the phone in one hand just to look at your smartphone's map (say you lack a phone-mounting apparatus) as this person claimed to be doing? Should just looking at your phone while driving be illegal? Should cars come with smartphone-mounting kits? Where ought they be installed? Above the dash only? And — here's where it gets really quirky — what's the difference, really, between glancing down at a phone you're holding in one hand, and glancing down at one of these GPS/mapping LCD screens that come built-into so many vehicle dashboards these days? Could some of these issues be remedied through better driver training? Do we need OS-level standards in our mobile computing devices that help govern how we use them in moving vehicles (specifically while driving)? I'm not sure what the answer ought to be, but state legislatures need to tread very carefully and, to the extent this stuff does warrant legislation, propose laws rooted firmly in the actual research, not some legislator's unstudied opinions (like this amendment recently introduced by West Virginia to ban a product that's not even available yet). &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"(CNN) -- For all of their advantages, smartphones still fall a little short for some â€” specifically, for those living with visual impairment. While apps like Siri and SayText do offer a good deal of assistance, 2011 TED Fellow Sumit Dagar had an idea for a more effective solution: a smartphone that's specifically designed for people who have trouble seeing. The phone, which has yet to be officially named, has a screen comprised of a grid of pins, which move up and down to form into Braille shapes and characters whenever an SMS message or email is received. It uses what's called Shape Memory Alloy technology, so as each pin expands, it remembers and contracts back to its original flat shape. In an interview with the Times of India, Dagar describes the phone as ""[the] world's first Braille smartphone ... a companion more than a phone."" Dagar, an interaction design graduate of the National Institute of Design (NID), came up with the idea for the phone three years ago. He's collaborating with IIT Delhi on the prototype, which is being tested at the LV Prasad Eye Institute. The team hopes to release the phone by the end of 2013, for a about $185.

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- I came to Mobile World Congress expected to be wowed by lots of shiny new gadgets, but I'm leaving impressed by the seemingly less sexy subject of mobile operating systems. Turns out there's a lot happening here. A lot of the buzz was focused around the Firefox OS launch on Sunday. A rival to Android, iOS and Windows Phone, it seems unlikely it will get much traction in the West. But in places where people have yet to buy a smartphone it might stand a chance -- it's intended to run on less powerful phones that are cheap to make and sell. One of the aspects of the launch that surprised most people was the number of manufacturers and network operators backing the OS. Tell us: What's your dream smartphone feature? That's a sign of how fed up those parties are getting of being told what to do by Apple and Google, and how worried they are that they are being increasingly locked out of the profits of the smartphone sector. They are lashing themselves to Firefox OS in the hope that it will lead to more money for them down the line. Also shown off for the first time was Tizen, Samsung and Intel's alternative to Android. Due later this year, Tizen has had a long history of false starts, so we were excited to take a look at it. It essentially looks a lot like Android, but seemed pretty janky to us and a long way from being ready for release to consumers. It wasn't the best of debuts for something so important.

"(CNN) -- Almost three years ago Dell launched a phone called the Streak, an Android-based handset with a 5-inch display that was marketed more as a tablet with phone capabilities than the other way around. Critics blasted the device for being too large. Most smartphones at the time were still 3.5 to 4 inches, after all. That was the norm. We didn't see many more mobile phones from Dell after its blunder with the Streak. Now let's jump to the present. Last Thursday, Samsung introduced its new flagship phone, the Galaxy S IV. It also has a 5-inch screen, like the Dell Streak. But this time no one complained. In fact, the reaction was quite the opposite. Critics have been praising the Galaxy S IV's gorgeous display, which is slightly larger than its predecessor. And suddenly the iPhone, which was once the standard for all other smartphones to copy, looks puny next to Samsung's new phone. How'd we get here? In an effort to differentiate themselves from the dominant iPhone, manufacturers that relied on Android to run their mobile devices -- Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and others -- began moving towards bigger and bigger screens. Android was still in its infancy, and it didn't have the smoothness, app selection, and robust feature set that Apple's iOS did. If an Android phone wanted to stand out, it had to offer what the iPhone couldn't on the hardware side. That meant removable batteries, expandable storage, and larger screens. In a few short years the trend snowballed to the point where no one scoffs anymore when a manufacturer launches a phone with a giant screen. In fact, there are plenty of phones with screens that are dangerously close in size to the growing breed of smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 and iPad Mini. And people keep buying them. I overheard one Samsung exec put it this way when recently asked if the company thinks phones are getting too big: ""We'll find out at some point, but we haven't found out yet."" Larger screens appeal to the increasing number of people who use their phones to watch video and play graphics-rich games. In other words, don't expect your next phone to be any smaller than the one in your pocket now. These devices are only going to get larger until they reach a point where they're so big that consumers start turning their noses at them. Some companies are already pushing the limit. At the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona last month, a handful of companies released new phones in the seven and eight-inch ranges. Samsung introduced its new iPad mini competitor, the Galaxy Note 8.0. But unlike the iPad, the Note 8.0 can make phone calls. Asus also has a seven-inch Android phone that it calls the FonePad. Apple did increase the screen size of the iPhone 5 by half an inch over previous models, but it hasn't embraced the big-screen trend yet, and clearly doesn't think it needs to for now. While the company never gives details on what it's working on, its public statements don't offer too much hope that a larger iPhone will arrive anytime soon. During Apple's earnings call in January, CEO Tim Cook said Apple keeps its phone sizes relatively small because it believes that is the perfect form factor for most people. ""It also provides a larger screen without sacrificing one-handed use,"" Cook said, referring to the 4-inch display on the iPhone 5.. ""We put a lot of thought into screen sizes and we think we picked the right one."" Still, Apple's decision to boost the iPhone's size is a tacit admission that plenty of people are clamoring for a bigger phone. There have been rumors that a larger iPhone could hit the market as early as this summer, but it's more likely you'll have to wait until next year at the earliest. That's not to say Apple is doomed if it doesn't get into the so-called phablet business. Apple is clearly doing just fine. But it does suggest that if and when Cook & Co. do release a bigger phone, they will clearly find a receptive market.

"(CNN) -- From the responses to our story Thursday on how tablets are paving a rough road for the future of dedicated e-readers, one thing was clear: We still love our E Ink. Hundreds weighed in with comments, and the overwhelming majority argued that while tablets offer a range of nifty features, they still haven't caught up with Kindles, Nooks, Kobos or Sony Readers for curling up with a good e-book. Many folks said they've found a spot in their digital lives for both types of devices. ""I have a tablet and an e-reader. They both have their place,"" wrote a commenter called Ken. ""I wouldn't give up my e-reader because for one, the battery life is amazing. And two, its e-ink makes it almost look like paper."" (E Ink is a proprietary type of electronic paper that's found in most e-readers.) Seventy-six of you voted up the comment. Ken's clearly onto something. ""My Kobo is so small and light that I can hold it and click on it to turn the page with one hand,"" wrote the ominously monikered Sharkmann. ""And the battery lasts about 1 week even if I use it a lot. For reading a book, e-ink is best, for web browsing and video, a bigger tablet is much better. Trying to make one device for everything leads to a device that does nothing well."" Experts quoted in our report painted a rosier picture for tablets. While the devices haven't yet matched the easy-on-the-eyes look of E Ink, most of the new ones have high-definition screens, and it may only be a matter of time before they catch up. For now, it's the glare from a tablet's screen that's keeping some folks from spending hours on the devices, streaming Spotify and looking up definitions of big words while wading through, say, the bloody ""Game of Thrones"" book series. ""Don't forget that some of us are light sensitive. If I sat down for a long reading session on a tablet, I would get a headache,"" commenter Otorman said. ""For this reason, my e-reader is great. I really do fear that tablets will kill off both paper and e-ink and will diminish the pleasantness of the reading experience."" Still, some folks agreed with what the analysts quoted in the report were saying. ""I can go to any of a dozen sites and order a cheap tablet from China for $50 to $75 (including delivery) that does everything a reader does plus hundreds of things a reader can't do,"" wrote Kevin Walker. ""So why waste money on a inferior product just because of the brand name?"" Added lasertekk, ""It's only a matter of time before an e-ink screen gets combined with a LCD, giving you both devices in one package."" And some of the biggest fans of the readers noted that, in a way, they're victims of their own success. ZJM555: ""Nice thing about an e-reader is you don't have to get the latest and greatest one every six months."" And Amber Hielckert: ""I agree. The real problem with e-readers is that they last (nearly) forever, that people don't need to replace or upgrade every few years or so. I still have the Kindle with the keyboard, and it still works great."" So is there much hope for e-reader fans' beloved devices? Some of you seem to think so. Writing with the screen name guiwhiz, one commenter echoed a scenario voiced by analyst James McQuivey. ""Schools. This is where they are going to be relevant,"" he wrote. ""Giving young teenage children tablets is a big investment not just in hardware, but in all kinds of other costs/headaches as well. Give a kid an e-reader with the textbooks pre-loaded, the 'limited browser' locked down to the school websites/proxy server and then you have a potential replacement for textbooks. ""Just my two cents of course, but boy that is where I would be focusing my (research and development) money if I was Nook."" That, and several suggestions about improving Web browsing and other features, might keep tablets from killing electronic readers. ""Maybe not kill,"" wrote Nodack. ""But put on life support maybe.""","Report on how tablets are hurting the e-reader market got CNN readers talking .

"(CNN) -- Sure, the GPS on your phone or dedicated device can get you from Point A to Point B on the interstate, frustrating ""Calibrating ... calibrating ..."" moments aside. But a new move in mobile tech is seeing startups who want to help you find the store you're looking for in the mall, turn around when you're getting farther from your terminal at the airport or figure out where your friends are in an expansive convention hall. And the big guys of the tech world are taking notice. Apple has bought a company called WiFiSLAM, a 2-year-old Silicon Valley-based startup focused on indoor GPS, the company has confirmed to the Wall Street Journal and other outlets. The reported price was $20 million. That move makes sense for Apple, which in the last year has attempted, with varying degrees of success, to go head-to-head with rival Google in the mapping space. The last several versions of Google Maps have included indoor navigation, at least for locations that have been mapped by the computing giant on its expansive database. Google says it has mapped more than 10,000 buildings in 13 countries. With the Big Two going at it, other companies have teamed up. Sony, Samsung, Nokia and others formed the In-Location Alliance last fall to advance indoor mapping. WiFiSlam, which up until now had been shopping out its system to independent app developers, is one of several startups that are marrying traditional GPS coordinates with smartphone tools like accelerometers and compasses to get more precise coordinates. Those are the same tools used by fitness-oriented digital pedometers to track the number of steps a user has taken, their speed, the distance they've climbed and other location-based data. The company claims to be able to pinpoint the user's location indoors within about 8 feet. Most GPS features, designed for outdoor travel, can pinpoint the user within about 30 feet. ""This accuracy will change how you interact with indoor environments,"" co-founder Anand Atreya, one of the former Stanford University students who started WiFiSLAM, told the MIT Technology Review in 2011. ""Think about going to the supermarket. We can provide information relevant to the product right in front of you."" Depending upon the app that's built on it, the opposite can, of course, be true, too. Theoretically, indoor GPS could be used to let the grocery store know where you are and digitally shout at you that those bananas in front of you are two bunches for $1 today only. Like Google Maps, WiFiSLAM and other new indoor navigators require some advance work. Someone must have mapped out a building with the tool for it to accurately give a good sense of things in a building. So, presumably, any mapping tool Apple offers likely will be available for major locations in major cities first, before spreading elsewhere. ""I could walk into your building and have Wi-Fi location working within an hour,"" Atreya told the MIT review. Presumably, a mall, hospital, grocery store or convention center could create its own app using indoor GPS. (But not WiFiSLAM's now. By Monday afternoon, virtually its entire official presence online had been scrubbed, including, not surprisingly, its spot in the Google Play store). Of course, with any tool designed to track the user's every move, privacy becomes in issue. Google, Apple and other tech and Web heavyweights like Facebook aren't in the business of giving away services; they need to find a way to make money from them. Consumers who want to use such products can't expect to get them for free and have complete privacy, Loo Wee Teck, head of consumer electronics research for Euromonitor International, told tech blog ZDNet. ""Users have to make their own judgment when using them, while companies have to thread a tightrope to ensure they do not enrage the users,"" he said.","Apple buy highlights growing ""indoor GPS"" capabilities .
Tools give users directions inside malls, hospitals, convention halls .

"(CNN) -- More than three out of every 10 smartphone owners don't have a password on the device that could give easy access to their e-mail, bank account, credit card information and other sensitive info. That's one of the findings of a recent worldwide survey by Web security company McAfee. On top of that, 15% of people surveyed said they save password information on their phones to apps and websites they use and more than half (55%) who do have passwords said they've shared those passwords with others. ""The unfortunate reality is that everyone loses things, and our devices can get stolen,"" Robert Siciliano, an identity-theft specialist at McAfee, wrote in a blog post about the findings. "" And when that happens to your smartphone or tablet, it can be devastating."" In all, 36% of respondents said they don't have a phone password. And women are slightly less likely to password-protect their phones. Some 54% of those who said they don't were women. Guys aren't blameless, though. Out of all the respondents who said they ""hide"" passwords to websites and apps in the Notes app on their phone, 62% were men. ""Many of us use upwards of 10 apps on our devices during a typical week,"" Siciliano wrote. ""The majority of these apps are logged into our most critical accounts including e-mail, text, banking, social media, payment apps and others that are linked to our credit cards. ""And because mobile app developers know that we are more apt to use their programs if they are easy to access and convenient to use, a lot of apps are programmed to automatically keep you logged in for days, weeks, months or until you manually revoke access."" He offered some basic tips for protecting data on your phone. Among them: . -- Password-protect all your devices and don't use easy ones such as ""1-2-3-4"" or ""1-1-1-1."" -- Never use the ""remember me"" function on sensitive apps or your Web browser and remember to log out of those apps when you're done with them. -- Consider not sharing your password, even with family members. ""This might be a tough one,"" he concedes. -- Predictably, use a mobile security product -- such as McAfee's.","Survey: Three out of 10 of us say that we don't password-protect our phones .

"(CNN) -- Apple has settled a lawsuit filed by parents who say their kids downloaded free games from the mobile App Store and then proceeded to rack up hefty bills buying in-game extras. Under the proposed settlement of a 2011 class-action lawsuit, Apple will offer a $5 iTunes gift card to any U.S. parent who claims that their child paid for extras without their knowledge. The company will offer larger credits, or cash refunds, for people who can show that their bills were larger than $5. On Friday, the deal will go before a federal judge, who is expected to approve it. The proposed settlement, first reported by legal-news site Law360 and tech blog GigaOM, does not state how much Apple will pay overall or how many users are affected. Apple will create a website for people interested in cashing in on the settlement and send an e-mail notification to roughly 23 million customers. People who want more than $5 must show that a larger amount was racked up by their kids in any 45-day period. Those who can show more than $30 in purchases may choose a cash refund instead of an Apple credit. Purchases made until the date of the settlement would be eligible for refunds. An Apple spokesman said the company would have no comment on the proposed settlement. In the past few years, this ""freemium"" business model has become increasingly popular in mobile and social gaming. Zynga games like ""FarmVille"" led the way for games that are free to download and play but then require players to pay small fees for in-game upgrades or premium content. Those fees can add up quickly. The lawsuit came after media reports of several cases in which kids' in-game purchases led to parental sticker shock. Kevin Ofel, an editor at GigaOM, wrote that he got a 2010 iTunes bill for $375 after his kids spent money on the game ""TapFish,"" a virtual aquarium that can be loosely described as ""FarmVille"" under water. The lure of digital fish is apparently a strong one. A Florida father reported that his 7-year-old amassed a $613 bill playing the same game. On its iTunes page, the latest version of the game, ""TapFish 2,"" lists ""top in-app purchases"" ranging from 99 cents up to $19.99. The game is listed as appropriate for children 4 and older. The settlement notes that Apple offers paid content on free games that are rated appropriate for children older than 4, 9 and 12 in its App Store. In 2011, Apple revised its in-app purchasing policy, requiring users to re-enter their account password before paying for enhancements within games. The lawsuit was filed after that policy change, with plaintiffs arguing that it didn't go far enough since minors could still make purchases.","Apple settles lawsuit over in-game iTunes purchases by kids .

"(CNN) -- Samsung's next Galaxy smartphone might be controlled by nothing more than the user's eyes, according to a new report in advance of its March 14 unveiling. ""Eye scrolling"" will do things like scroll down a page of text when the user's eyes have reached the bottom of the screen, according to a New York Times report. Quoting an unnamed Samsung employee who has used the phone, the Times said the Samsung Galaxy S IV, the next generation in its popular Galaxy S line, will be more heavily geared toward new software than a physical reboot of the Android-based device. The Korean company has for all practical purposes announced the Galaxy S IV will be unveiled at a New York City event on March 14. The Times interviewed Kevin Packingham, Samsung's chief product officer. While he declined to talk about software upgrades, he said hardware upgrades will be significant. ""It's an amazing phone,"" he said. Reports of an eye-control innovation make sense. Samsung has filed in Europe to trademark a technology called ""Eye Scroll"" and another named ""Eye Pause."" Samsung described ""Eye Scroll"" as ""computer application software having a feature of sensing eye movements and scrolling displays of mobile devices, namely, mobile phones, smartphones and tablet computers according to eye movements; digital cameras; mobile telephones; smartphones; tablet computers."" The Samsung Galaxy S III already has a similar feature called ""Smart Stay."" It uses the phone's front-facing camera to register whether the user is looking at it and keeps the display screen from going into sleep mode until the user looks away. Samsung's Galaxy S line has emerged as the strongest challenger to Apple's industry-leading iPhone. The Galaxy S III shipped 18 million units worldwide from July to September, compared with 16.2 million for the iPhone 4S, according to research by Strategy Analytics. With the release of the iPhone 5, Apple retook the lead in the final months of 2012, selling an estimated 27 million. But the S III hung in there with another 15 million units sold.","Report: Samsung Galaxy S IV can be controlled with your eyes .

"(CNN) -- In the future we will have screens not just in the palm of our hands, but all around us, according to Matias Duarte, Google's Director of Android User Experience. Talking to CNN at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Duarte identified gesturing and ""tangibility"" as the next major developments in mobile technology. ""Computers have to work the way people expect and not the other way round. I want everything can you touch on the screen to operate like objects in the real world do. That doesn't mean they have to look like copies of objects in the real world, but they have to be tangible and physical and delightful,"" he said. Admitting that using a phone can be an emotional experience, Duarte said: ""In the old days we used to be poking at phones. If I were to start poking you, you wouldn't like it, but when you start stroking, it's a totally different message. ""Right now we only recognize a couple of fingers, and on screens that are small and always in the palm of your hand. ""In the future, we will look at the gestures of your entire body, facial expressions, arms, all of the fingers that you have, and you're going to have screens not just in the palm of your hand, but all around you,"" he said. Duarte promised that Google would never clamp down on the user's ability customize Android on their phones. And he said one of the biggest challenges for Android was designing a platform for communities. ""We don't look at a single target market, we try to think of this as a gift we're giving to the world and that's a big responsibility we take very seriously.

"(CNN) -- Talk about being a victim of your own success. Among several new initiatives announced by Marvel Entertainment at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival was a two-day giveaway of 700 issues of classic Marvel No. 1 issues via their app. The adventures, new and old, of the X-Men, Spider-Man and the Avengers would be available free, and the first issues would make it easier for new readers to follow. It was an unprecedented offer in the world of digital comics. But perhaps it was one that its technology partner, Comixology, was unprepared for: The servers crashed. One day after the freebies were announced at Marvel's SXSW panel in Austin, Texas, it was put to a halt -- at least temporarily -- by Comixology. The problem: too much interest. ""We expected a high degree of excitement for the Marvel initiative -- and had believed ourselves prepared -- but unfortunately we became overwhelmed by the immense response,"" admitted Comixology's CEO and co-founder, David Steinberger. ""We're still struggling to keep our systems up."" Steinberger added, ""We don't like letting you down. Our teams are working around the clock to resolve these issues so that you can have the experience you've come to expect."" He said the promotion would be ""pausing for the time being."" Comics readers were told to post their e-mail addresses on a form to be notified when the offer would be back up and running. Marvel posted a statement to its website: ""Marvel fans assembled in record numbers to take advantage of the landmark Marvel #1 digital comics sale! The demand has been so overwhelmingly positive, in fact, that a number of technical issues have arisen with our technology partner in getting the more than 700 free issues to each of you. When we have further updates from our partner, we will share them."" The advent of reading comics digitally, especially on tablets, has been seen by some as the future of the comics industry, as print readership continues to decline. To that end, Marvel has increased its presence at SXSW, this year announcing products such as the weekly Infinite Comics, which are specifically designed with the digital reader in mind, and Project Gamma, which adds audio to the digital reading experience.","As part of SXSW, Marvel offered 700 No. 1 issues free for digital download .

"(CNN) -- ""App"" has been a computing term for a lot longer than five years. But, on July 10, 2008, it began its journey to becoming a household word. That's when Apple, a year after launching the iPhone, introduced its App Store to the world. The online marketplace launched with 500 apps, mostly for established Web companies such as Facebook, eBay and Yelp. Today, it has more than 850,000. And, a couple of months ago, it passed a mind-boggling threshold, marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded. Apple can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps, those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do. Google launched its own app store, now called Play, less than a year after Apple. Today, it's on a path toward surpassing Apple's number of downloads. But the iPhone was the first smartphone most folks ever saw, and the App Store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness. On this anniversary, we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the App Store and expanded the capabilities of our phones. 'Angry Birds' Before the App Store, video games were, by and large, for hard-core players with consoles or souped-up PCs. Now the line between who is a gamer and who's not is blurry -- and millions of people have ""Angry Birds"" to thank. The deceptively addictive little game, in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses, is the top-selling paid app in the App Store's history. Since its launch in 2009, the game has become a franchise, with spinoffs, toys, cartoons and even a movie making up just part of Finnish developer Rovio Entertainment's furious, feathered empire. Addicted gamers are sweet on 'Candy Crush' Google Maps . With the rise of Google's Android system as Apple's chief mobile rival, there's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the App Store's success. But since Google Maps rolled out as a native app for the iPhone, the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing's key features. (Does anyone still hand-draw maps?) Yes, there are other map apps out there. But Google's treasure-trove of data makes its maps a go-to for millions. Witness the mini-disaster Apple had on its hands when it bumped Google's offering for its own Maps app last year. Apple's product was so half-baked that CEO Tim Cook, in a rare mea culpa, essentially told users to download Google Maps until it was fixed. How to kickstart your holiday using apps not maps . Pandora . By 2008 Pandora already had become a popular Web-streaming service, letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked. But the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing, and Pandora was among the first apps available when the App Store went live. Since then, it's become the second-most downloaded iPhone app in the store's history, trailing only Facebook. Its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors, from Spotify to Rdio to Last.fm. Why everybody's building a Web music service . Instagram . Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, made all of us photographers. That's a huge shift. But, sadly for most of us, it didn't make us all good photographers. Enter Instagram -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good. Add to that Instagram's social features, complete with Twitter-like hashtags, and you've got a tool tailor-made for mobile. Launched in 2010 by Stanford University students, Instagram now moves about 45 million images every day. Oh ... and those creators also sold it to Facebook last year for a cool $1 billion. Instagram launches 15-second video feature . Shazam . It seems like a little thing, until you stop and think about it: What if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song, then tell you what it is? That would have sounded like magic not so many years ago. Now, we take it for granted. Shazam started in the UK in 2002 as a Web service. But it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution, and is now among Apple's Top 10 downloaded apps, with 350 million users. 20 fun and useful new mobile apps .","Apple's App Store arrived five years ago .

"(CNN) -- It's been framed as a debate between Web freedom and the freedom from stumbling upon potentially offensive content. In recent weeks, several companies have been forced to grapple with sexually explicit images appearing in their popular mobile apps. Such images, a small fraction of the apps' user-generated content, place these companies at risk for being banned from portals such as Apple's App Store, where millions of people gain access to the mobile Web. But some observers see something more at play here. ""In this debate, some may focus on freedom and others may focus on the harm of adult content, but what's really happening here is the crystallization of the power of platform providers -- Apple, Google, Microsoft and even Amazon,"" said James McQuivey, a tech-industry analyst at Forrester Research. ""These companies are free to set their own standards in the interest of their customers, even if that means that they 'censor' some content in service of other content."" The most high-profile episode happened last week after Twitter unveiled Vine, a mobile app that lets users shoot and post looping, six-second video clips. It took off with users even quicker than folks at the social network expected. And, as such, Vine quickly became a victim of what has colloquially become known as the Internet's Rule 34 -- ""If it exists, there is porn on it."" Racy video clips, including one that accidentally popped up in the app's ""Editor's Picks"" section, led Twitter to make it harder for users to seek out adult content using hashtags like #porn and #naked. Before that, Apple had removed Vine from its ""Editor's Choice"" section in its App Store, the only place Vine is currently available. On Wednesday, the age rating for Vine in the App Store was raised from 12+ to 17+, roughly the equivalent of a movie's rating being changed from PG-13 to the more restrictive R. To download the app users must tap a window vowing they are over 17, although there is no verification system. A week earlier, Apple banned 500px, a photo-sharing app, because it said users could easily access sexual images. The app's creators argued that 500px's only adult images were a small number of artistic nude photos. Apple eventually restored the app, but only after 500px agreed to raise its age rating from 4+ to 17+. In the wake of those two moves, Tumblr, the widely popular blogging platform that includes some porn among its roughly 92 million blogs, similarly reclassified itself with the 17+ tag. The significance here, some say, is that the Web is increasingly becoming a mobile one. In the United States, 45% of people owned a smartphone last year, which is more than owned an older-style ""feature phone."" That's not to mention the millions more worldwide using tablets and other devices as their main entry point onto the Internet. ""If iPad Nation were a country, it would be in the top 10 largest countries in the world with more than 100 million citizens,"" McQuivey said. ""This is more evidence that platforms like these companies are becoming more important than governments in some respect."" If those mobile-device owners aren't using Apple products, they probably use Google's Android system, or Microsoft's or BlackBerry's. So, all of a sudden, we're putting big decisions about what we can and can't see into the hands of for-profit companies. That has some observers worried. Yes, virtually all mobile devices have a Web browser that lets the user get to the rest of the Internet's content, app store or not. But a single tap of a finger is a lot easier than thumbing a Web address into a tiny browser. ""There are some advantages to being an application,"" said Parker Higgins of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that promotes digital rights. ""To deny those advantages to certain kinds of unpopular speech doesn't seem appropriate."" Apple ends up at the center of these conversations, both due to its prominence in the tech world and the famously tight controls it keeps on its ""walled garden"" of data. The company continues to argue for an experience that the late CEO Steve Jobs once described as ""(f)reedom from programs that steal your private data. Freedom from programs that trash your battery. Freedom from porn."" But critics, including some app developers, argue Apple's garden isn't policed in a fair way. Why, for example, was 500px banned, but not the more prominent Tumblr? Has Apple leaned on Twitter, which activists have lauded for its devotion to Web freedoms, to change Vine's 12+ age rating? ""I'm not saying that Apple is being malicious -- they have a billion apps in that store,"" Higgins said. ""It's not that they're doing the wrong thing on purpose. It's just too big a job for anyone to be expected to regulate all that."" He notes, though, that the bans haven't always been about porn or spam or inefficient apps. Last year, an app that would have pinpointed the location of U.S. drone strikes in the Middle East was rejected multiple times. And two years ago, Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mark Fiore's app was rejected because it ""contains content that ridicules public officials."" (It was eventually approved after public outcry.) ""That's pretty plainly political speech,"" Higgins said of the apps. Apple did not reply to questions submitted for this article. But the company makes no bones about having tight controls on the App Store. ""If it sounds like we're control freaks, well, maybe it's because we're so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products,"" the company writes in its App Store review guidelines. Google has guidelines for its Google Play mobile store. But they tend to be looser than Apple's. The Android system also lets apps from outside stores be loaded onto the phones and tablets that use it. Google also did not reply to a request for comment. That, of course, opens up the user to the possibilities Jobs mentioned -- call it Android's wild, and potentially dangerous, jungle outside of Apple's aforementioned garden. Regardless of the specifics of their approaches, though, these companies are making decisions that, rhetoric aside, are never wholly about the end users' rights or concerns. ""Their job is to make money by cultivating a base of customers,"" said Forrester's McQuivey. ""If they deem some content will harm that relationship, they are free to ban it. ""As a result, traditional thoughts about government censorship or control are no longer relevant -- no matter how upsetting that will be to people on either side of this particular debate.""","Controversy over adult content on mobile apps highlights control over free speech .

"(CNN) -- The passwords on iPhones can be hacked, giving someone the ability to make calls, listen to your recent messages and tinker with your contact list, according to a new video posted to YouTube. The apparent security flaw is shown on an iPhone 5 and can be exploited on phones running Apple's iOS 6.1, the most recent version of its mobile operating system, and some earlier versions. The technique was posted by a Spanish-speaking user with the account name ""videosdebarraquito,"" who has posted other videos that show what appear to be ways to tweak settings on the iPhone. CNN is not linking to the video, which was published January 31 but recently discovered by tech bloggers. It involves using another phone placed nearby to make a call to the phone, canceling it, then answering with the targeted phone and fiddling with the power button. According to the user who posted the video, it can't be used to access other parts of the phone. And he urged anyone who used it to play nice. Use the bypass ""to joke with your friends.

"(CNN) -- As smoke clears from two deadly bombings near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, focus turns to identifying those responsible. And that's no easy task. The massive number of cell phones and closed circuit cameras on the street provide an incredible wealth of video and photo. ""This is probably one of the most well photographed areas in the country,"" said Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. The wealth of photographic and video evidence available is both a challenge and an opportunity. ""We intend to go through every frame."" The Boston marathon extends over 26 miles of streets and is largely open to the public. The crime scene around the bombing covers 12 city blocks. ""This is the most complex crime scene we've ever had to deal with,"" said Davis at a press conference Tuesday about the bombings. ""We are processing all the digital photographic evidence we can,"" says Richard DesLauriers, the special agent leading the FBI's Boston Division. He asks that ""the public continue submitting whatever they have to police."" There's a huge amount of video evidence to process, he says, creating a logistics issue. Grant Fredericks is a forensic video analyst and instructor at the Law Enforcement and Emergency Services Video Association (LEVA) in Indianapolis. LEVA is the only digital multimedia evidence processing lab in the world designed to train video investigators and analyze massive amounts of forensic video evidence, Fredericks says. Which is exactly what's needed in Boston. Fredericks says there's no standard in law enforcement to acquire video from the public in the wake of a tragedy such as yesterday's marathon bombings. But the best example of mass video collection for investigative purposes occurred in June 2011, when riots occurred after the Vancouver Canucks lost the Stanley Cup finals to the Boston Bruins. The City of Vancouver set up a system in which the public could provide video evidence, such as photos and videos from cell phones, anonymously to police. In response, Vancouver police received 5,000 hours of video from the public. Considering the size of the Boston Marathon and the growing prevalence of smartphone video cameras, the raw volume of footage after this tragedy could be much larger. After gathering those 5,000 hours of footage, Vancouver police then contacted LEVA through the Forensic Video Analysis Response Team to go through all that video. Fredericks says 52 analysts then spent 14 days processing that footage, identifying 15,000 criminal acts perpetrated by 300 rioters. The analysis is not magic, Fredericks says. Three shifts of video forensics experts distributed the raw video evidence to analysts, who then put the evidence into a single interoperable format, and uploaded it into a central management system. From there, it was watched and coded — meaning that anyone perceived to commit a criminal act was profiled and then attached to a special code that would identify, for example, whether they were wearing a backpack or a hoodie, whether they were carrying anything with them, and any other physical attributes that could be identified. (CNN describes the first potential suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing as ""seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt"" and ""trying to get into a restricted area about five minutes before the first explosion."") The purpose of this is to tag people so they can be identified later — to say, ""hey, this is the same person"" identified in previous videos, he says. Fredericks notes that Boston police are likely now going through a similar process, collecting every piece of digital media available from transit and nearly 600 closed circuit television cameras covering the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority alone. According to the ACLU of Massachusetts, ""Stored video can be easily shared with other [police departments] over standard web browsers using a system protected by a basic username and password."" In a post Tuesday, Popular Mechanics quoted the study, inferring: ""If the bomber(s) took public transportation, there's a good chance those steps can be retraced through video footage."" But does this profiling open the possibility for wrongful arrests? Recall the tragedy of Richard Jewell, the security guard falsely accused of bombing Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympics. ""The thing about profiling is that you're not profiling an individual, you're profiling a type,"" Fredericks says. In Boston, authorities are now combing video evidence for ""anyone with a backpack."" In other words, it's not the video analyst's role to worry about whether people are wrongly accused of involvement in the Boston marathon bombings; it'll be up to law enforcement to get evidence before they start arresting people. ""The video officer is just a technician,"" Fredericks says. In an email to The Verge, Larry Compton, a video analyst with Forensic Video Solutions in Washington D.C., sees where improvements might be made in the future to make the process easier. ""What needs to be developed is a solution for governments to accept public video and images for such situations, as there were likely several Zapruders who captured evidence,"" he writes, referencing the famous film of the Kennedy assassination. ""It needs to be far more comprehensive and useful than just random submissions to the 911 centers."" He suggests that such a system should accept wireless, web, and email submissions when activated. Each submission should include basic contact information, camera info, as well as a time sync reference. ""This would provide a quick bigger picture,"" Compton writes. And beyond the video evidence, Fredericks says federal authorities will already have a list of potential terror suspects who could be involved. ""They'll ask, 'who's in town, who are we tracking?'"" Those people become instant suspects before video evidence is analysed. ""The message is this: the most prolific source of evidence available to law enforcement comes from video evidence, comes from video sources,"" he says. ""These kinds of cases really underscore that the general public is collecting video evidence every moment of every day. So when you have a major incident in a major area like this where you have a huge gathering of the public, everyone there with a cell phone now has an evidence collection device that can be used by law enforcement."" ""Law enforcement just needs to get that video."" UPDATE: ""The FBI has set up a tip line — at 1-800-CALL-FBI — for anyone who has information, images, or details relating to yesterday's explosions along the Boston Marathon route. We are particularly interested in reviewing video footage captured by bystanders with cell phones or personal cameras near either of the blasts. In an investigation of this nature, no detail is too small."" Read the original article on The Verge: In Boston bombing, flood of digital evidence is a blessing and a curse . © 2013 Vox Media Inc.

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- A top Cuban official told reporters in Havana on Tuesday that his country's political system is ""sustainable"" and that it will not change. ""In Cuba, there will not be political reform,"" said Marino Murillo, vice president of the island's council of ministers. Those comments appeared a more forceful response to remarks made by Pope Benedict XVI during his flight last week from Rome to Mexico when he told reporters that he believed Cuba's Marxist political system ""no longer responds to reality."" ""With this visit, a way of cooperation and dialogue has been inaugurated, a long road that requires patience but that leads forward,"" the pope said, according to the Vatican. ""It is evident today that Marxist ideology as it had been conceived no longer responds to reality,"" Benedict continued. ""New models must be found, though with patience."" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded to those comments when they were made on Friday, saying his country respects all opinions.

"(CNN) -- Starting February 25, more than 65,000 people are expected to descend on Barcelona, Spain for Mobile World Congress (MWC): a trade show for the mobile industry to show off its latest phones, tablets, apps and services. It's the biggest show for mobile technology, and as mobile is so hot right now, it's arguably the most important show in tech overall. Most companies use it as the platform to set out their agenda for the year and give us a taste of the innovations we can expect to see, but there's a more practical reason why this show matters so much to the companies exhibiting there. There is a brutal war going on right now for new smartphone and tablet customers, with Samsung and Apple winning. According to research firm IDC, Apple and Samsung now have more than half the worldwide smartphone market between them. That makes it vital for all the other major hardware players to have a good MWC, or risk irrelevance. Here's what I'm expecting to see: . Better camera phones . Photography will be a big theme of Nokia and HTC's launches. Nokia generated the biggest buzz at last year's MWC with its PureView camera phone, a model with an unbelievably high 42-megapixel camera sensor. CNET reviewed it after the show was finished, and we loved the camera, but found the Symbian operating system it ran lacking. This year, Nokia watchers are hoping it will put the same camera technology on a Windows phone, which should make it a much more compelling product. The Windows phone platform could certainly do with that sort of boost -- so far, sales haven't exactly set the world alight. HTC also really needs a hit right now, and it's taking no chances by holding its MWC press conference a week before the show actually starts to make sure someone else's shiny gadget doesn't blast it off the news agenda. To tease its announcement on Tuesday 19, the company has released an infographic called ""a brief history of photography"". It doesn't give much away, but the inference is that phone manufacturers have been focusing on increasing the number of megapixels in camera phones, rather than picture quality. We'll know more very shortly. Bigger screens . Large screens are set to dominate: if leaked pictures of various handsets are to be believed, many vendors will be showing off phones with 5-inch screens with a 1080p resolution -- the same number of pixels you get on a high-definition TV. Even a 5-inch screen isn't enough for some people. Samsung single-handedly created a new product category, the ""phablet,"" in 2011 with its Galaxy Note. This phone/tablet hybrid combines a near 6-inch screen with a pen and has sold in the millions. Everyone is going to want a piece of this action at MWC. A game-changing tablet? One product area I'm hoping will see some development at MWC is tablets. No one has made the perfect tablet yet: the iPad is a great product, but it's limited and I find myself having to use a computer to perform certain tasks. Windows 8 tablets are interesting and experimental, but no one has nailed it. The field is still wide open for a company to create a single product that can replace a traditional laptop and an iPad-style tablet. Nokia is working on one, although I doubt it will reveal it at MWC. Samsung used last year's show to show off tablets operated with a pen, so we'll probably see some more of those. But I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a smaller player, perhaps a company like Asus, to show the rest of the world how it should be done. Mozilla's mobile OS . Speaking of smaller players, Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser, is creating a mobile phone operating system and is expected to show off the hardware it will run on at its press conference. I'm not sure the world needs another mobile operating system: if Microsoft is struggling to get traction with Windows Phone against the might of Apple's iOS and Google's Android, what chance does Mozilla have? But for gadget fans like me, it's always good to have something new to talk about. On the services side, I'm going to be looking for anything that takes advantage of the 4G internet connections that are slowly being rolled out across Europe. The promise of the speed 4G offers is that our phones will be able to do many more things. But so far, companies have had difficulty saying what they actually will be, beyond faster web browsing and downloading video. A couple of things we won't see: Samsung won't unveil a successor to its wildly popular Galaxy S3 at MWC. That will come at its own dedicated event later in the year so it can maximize the chatter around it. And although we will hear a lot about apps for Apple's iPhone, Apple itself won't exhibit. Here comes Huawei . My final tip is to watch out for Huawei. You might not see them much in phone shops, but the Chinese mega-corp wants to dominate the Western market. IDC put Huawei as the number three in the world in terms of smartphone shipments. At CNET, we've seen interest in the brand increase by over 800% in a year, based on our internal data, as it released a series of cheap Android phones that were actually rather good. MWC will see it try and build on that success and expand into the high end. It might just work. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jason Jenkins.","Mobile World Congress (MWC) is the year's biggest trade show for the mobile industry .

"(CNN) -- Those of us who have yet to lay hands or eyes on anything but images of Google Glass are prone to daydreaming about how we'll actually interact with the device. We know there are buttons, a tiny touchpad, and voice inputs, but what about the times when we want to check our e-mail and don't want to speak aloud to an inanimate object? A Reddit user who bore into the Google Glass code came out with an interesting discovery: the ability to trigger an event with a ""wink"" gesture. The code includes provisions for enabling and disabling winks as a command, as well as a couple of lines for calibration and one called ""EYE_GESTURES_WINK_TAKE_PHOTO."" The need for calibration suggests that users will be able to set up the wink trigger to prevent Glass from registering a blink as a chance to fire off whatever action is attached to the gesture. While this sounds like a potentially useful feature, we can't help but picture enjoying ourselves in a public space when another person wearing Google Glass catches our eye. We lock gazes. Slowly, deliberately, they wink. Google has apparently been working on a number of control and interaction schemes, including virtual buttons projected onto nearby surfaces (hands, arms) and audio playback designs that vibrate the bones in the user's head to make themselves heard. Explorer editions of the headsets are in developer hands now (as well as those who submitted proposals), and the consumer versions are set to hit sometime next year.

"(CNN) -- With so many advancements in mobile phone technology, it's easy to dismiss most as insignificant. A mega-megapixel camera, a brighter screen and better apps are all good, but they're hardly going to redefine your world. But with 4G you can expect significant life changes. A new generation of the cellular network -- already rolled out in many parts of Asia and the U.S. -- 4G promises to supercharge mobile internet connections across the UK and parts of Europe in the coming year. Speed is the essence of 4G. Since global mobile networks began rolling out in the 1980s, a new generation of handsets has evolved roughly every decade. The latest, promising data speeds equivalent to a standard broadband internet connection, is considered the fourth -- hence 4G. Although 4G coverage is still limited and, some critics argue, it may struggle to fulfil the ambitious claims of network operators, it is likely to make a difference to the millions of people who already channel great chunks of their lives through their mobile phones. Some may argue none of this is a change for the better. With almost every aspect of our waking (and, in some cases, sleeping) lives slavishly conducted through our handsets, perhaps we are in danger of losing touch with the world beyond our small screens. Others would say that by unloading life's chores onto our phones, we will be free to spend more time doing what we want to do. Whether for good or bad, 4G is already changing our world. Here's how: . Watching, not waiting . Whereas 3G networks offered slow video downloads or buffering-plagued live streams, 4G's high data speeds should mean feature-length movies accessed in a matter of minutes, or seamless live TV. High definition video phone calls are possible too. The implications of mobile TV growth are huge. As more people use their handsets as their primary viewing platform, moviemakers and TV producers may find themselves faced with the need to create shows that look good on smaller screens as advertisers move to mobile. Consumers, however, would be advised to change their viewing habits with caution. Video downloads are, and will continue to be, a major drain on data allowances. Keeping up with the Kardashians could cost you fortune. Pros: A cineplex in your pocket . Cons: A wasteland in your wallet . Connecting to the thingternet . The first generation of mobile phones were so large and clunky they were known as carphones. Most mobile calls were made from the comfort of a car because you needed a vehicle to carry around the heavy, ugly box of electronics that kept you connected. With the advent of 4G, you're just as likely to be talking TO your car as talking from it. This is a concept known as the ""Internet of Things,"" a world wide web of everyday items that will soon see our contact books cluttered with the email addresses of washing machines, toasters and microwave ovens (well, almost). Some everyday items, like TiVo cable television boxes, are already hooked up to the internet, allowing users to program them remotely. It is predicted that most high-end electronic goods will soon be embedded with the ability to communicate via the internet. Drivers will be able to defrost cars from the warmth of their bed. Fridges will tell you whether you need to buy more milk. Garden sprinklers will advise you whether the lawn needs a drink. Such communications will flourish under 4G, as networks will offer the extra speed and capacity needed to cope with such an increase in electronic chatter. Pros: Control every aspect of life from your mobile . Cons: Until the battery runs flat, leaving your home in digital disarray . Work, work, work . When the first BlackBerry handsets were unleashed on unsuspecting employees over the last decade they revolutionized the way many of us work. Suddenly, we were dealing with company emails on the train, on the bus and in the bath. Thumbs suffered as people pounded out their replies on tiny QWERTY keypads. Work-life balances suffered as the lines between professional and personal time became blurred. Some relationships suffered as BlackBerrys were inevitably brought into marital beds. These days most of us have adapted to carrying around a portal to the office in our pockets. We might check them obsessively, but we're no longer feverishly addicted to responding in real time. The arrival of 4G could shake things up again. With a mobile network that offers broadband speeds and capacity, it in theory becomes possible to carry out all manner of online activity on the hoof. Secure connections through which employees can access data-heavy company software become possible. As does downloading or uploading huge data files and video conferencing. This will make life easier for workers whose job already takes them on the road. It will also unshackle many more from their desks. But it could also lead to a tricky transition period as millions of us adapt to a new world in which almost every aspect of office life can be lugged around in our laptops. Pro: Being able to work on the beach . Con: Beach vacation ruined! Play, play, play . Even as 4G keeps us connected more closely to our work, it will also plug us into our play. Whether you enjoy listening to music or engaging in multi-player computer combat, 4G should make that a seamless mobile experience via delay-free access to cloud storage or gaming servers. Pros: Mozart on the metro. Alien annihilation on the number 8 bus. Cons: Work and play. Our phones now own us. 2G or not 2G . Whether we like it or not, 4G is the future of mobile telecommunications (at least until 5G comes along). Some people may insist that their old 1G or 2G handsets are all that they'll ever need, but sadly they must soon bow to the inevitable. 4G phone operators have been able to increase network speeds by accessing a broader spectrum of transmission frequencies. These are expensive, with operators often entering highly competitive government auctions to secure a slice of radio bandwidth. As demand for 4G grows, networks will be looking to dedicate more frequencies to their coverage. This will eventually mean re-assigning the frequencies that currently support 1G and 2G devices. And so, after decades of service, millions of old LCD-screened handsets will be forced to beep their last SMS. Pros: Recycling of an obsolete network that had little left to offer . Cons: Ungr8ful, undignified nd 2 a fone srvic dat gave us a nu lngwij & hz coNectd millions of ppl Ovr d years. :-( .","Next generation of phone networks will revolutionize communications with faster speeds .

"(CNN) -- Anyone that bikes dreams of riding a Tron Light Cycle. Revolights, a set of wheel-mounted LEDs, now makes that dream a little closer to reality, and a new built-in version is helping that system become even more lightweight and simple than the original bolt-on setup. The white-and-red lighting comprises a ring of LEDs that you install around the entire edge of each of your bike rims. Using a pair of clever devices, only the forward-facing lights (or backwards, in the case of the rear wheel) illuminate when the wheel spins. The result is beautiful arcs of light that make you visible from all angles, an effect that Revolights' co-founder and CFO Adam Pettler says came by accident. Revolights inventor Kent Frankovich didn't set out to produce the arcs, instead he was looking for a better headlight design, one that would make obstacles stand out more clearly though low angle lighting. The timed blinking of the lights was to prevent them from shining in a rider's eyes. ""It wasn't until after he had created the first prototype that we realized the huge increase in rider visibility that came with it,"" Pettler says, ""He then quickly made a red taillight to match."" The lights use two mechanisms to tell the LEDs when to turn on and off. At low speeds, an accelerometer determines the position of the lights by reading the pull of gravity. At higher velocities, the lights switch over to calculating speed based on the wheel's period of rotation. That allows the system to synchronize a cascading LED pattern. This is Revolights' second Kickstarter campaign. The first one was completed in 2011, raising five times its initial goal. Pettler says this second Kickstarter is being done to celebrate the release of a v2 version of the product. Interestingly, the revamped Revolights City v2.0 kits aren't one of the Kickstarter rewards. ""The City represents our second product, designed with the goal of making Revolights more accessible,"" says Pettler. ""And while it is a new product we now offer, Revolights City is an aftermarket kit you install on your own wheels, and we felt putting it on Kickstarter would be too similar to our last campaign."" So they went bigger. The current Kickstarter is for custom wheels with the lights built right in. It's a project created in partnership with Mission Bicycle Company (also a Kickstarter alum). ""We designed Revolights Wheels to address our largest design challenges: installation and compatibility,"" says Pettler. ""While many cyclists enjoy their existing wheels and want to put Revolights on them, there's a whole other group of riders out there that don't want to install their own lights."" It's a smart way of using Kickstarter. For simple product updates, there's no need (and indeed some discouragement) for using Kickstarter. But by putting together an ambitious product for the crowd funding site and timing that to coincide with an update of your more stable product, you get the best of both worlds as a creator.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Sometimes, a little inspiration can come from unexpected places. In an article on the Atlantic website earlier this month, Fidel Castro was quoted as saying ""The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore."" Then last week, the Cuban government announced plans for the elimination of about 500,000 state-provided jobs. And comments from Raul Castro have indicated that that number could rise to a million. At the same time, it has said it will encourage foreign investment and privately run firms. The new economic policies in Cuba represent a major turn away from a strict economic ideology and toward a more practical approach. But while the Communists in Cuba are becoming more practical in their economic policies, in Washington, any discussion of economic policy is becoming more ideologically entrenched. The Tea Party wing of the Republican Party, fresh off primary wins in Delaware and New York, are adamant in their call for lower taxes and reduction, or elimination, of government regulation. They want to roll back the Obama administration's health care reform and financial market reforms. On the Democratic side, we have the Obama administration's economic advisers who, for the most part, seem bent on increasing spending at any cost. This die-hard Keynesian approach would have Lord Keynes turning in his grave. Maybe it is time for us to admit, like Cuba, that there are parts of our economic system that do not work. The Great Recession surely should be a wake-up call. We must address some of the fundamental misalignment of incentives that exist in our economy. One of them is the economic role the housing industry plays. While public policy that encouraged home building may have made sense during the last century, particularly when America needed more new houses to accommodate the post-war baby boom, does it still make sense today? Today, the American family is shrinking, and yet many continue trading up, and new houses are getting larger and larger. Vast amounts of this country's financial resources still go to the housing market. We should ask: Are there better uses for these resources? Chief among the subsidies the housing industry receives is the income tax deduction for home mortgage interest. According to the Tax Policy Center, this is estimated to cost the Treasury $131 billion in 2012. By eliminating or scaling back the deduction, not only would the government generate more tax revenue, but it would also remove an important distortion in our financial markets. In addition, we need to address the problems these housing industry subsidies have caused. We can do this by establishing special temporary bankruptcy courts that have the legal power to force write-downs on delinquent mortgages. Here in Texas, we had temporary bankruptcy courts in the 1980s to deal with all of bankruptcies resulting from the oil bust. We should do the same thing in states now hit hard by the subprime mortgage crisis. In these temporary courts, those who speculated on the mortgage market should be financially punished, while those who were duped should have their mortgages restructured. This would greatly increase the flow of money through the mortgage market and help revitalize our financial markets. Second, we must address the issue that our financial markets are not doing a very efficient job in allocating capital. Entrepreneurs and small businesses find it difficult to get the capital they need to start and expand their businesses. This is because of misaligned incentives: Banks can borrow money from the Federal Reserve at an interest rate of essentially zero and use those funds to buy and sell stocks, bonds and currencies for a profit. Under this setup, why would banks go to all the trouble of lending money to a small business? It is much easier and profitable for the banks to simply trade financial securities. And that is what they have been doing -- making huge profits without lending to small businesses. Instead of limiting banks' ability to trade securities for their own profits, something former Fed Chair Paul Volcker has suggested, Washington seems interested only in protecting the big banks' profitability. This is not to say we can let the financial system collapse. We need a functioning banking system to make sure workers' paychecks don't bounce. But if, as the big banks claim, they cannot provide basic banking services at a high enough profit level, and thus need to sell complex and risky financial products such as derivatives, then nonprofits should be afforded a larger share of the market. Perhaps credit unions should be allowed to grow in size and in the types of financial products they offer. In addition, to pay for additional regulation, we should work with the Europeans, British and Japanese to establish a worldwide sales tax on financial transactions -- the often discussed modern version of a Tobin tax, named after the late Nobel Laureate James Tobin. A Tobin tax may reduce the amount of financial transactions and even cost jobs in the financial markets. However, as Simon Johnson of MIT has shown, there has been an excessive increase in the amount of resources our financial markets consume. A Tobin tax could reduce this distortion. Making structural changes to our economy will not be easy and, yes, some of them require some people to pay more taxes. But we, like the Cubans, need to realize that parts of our economy are simply not working. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Brandl.","Michael Brandl says Cuba is re-evaluating economy, maybe U.S. should look inward, too .
Parties should not dig into ideologies, he says; instead fix parts of economy not working .
Get rid of costly mortgage tax deduction, he says; get banks to start lending to businesses .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI refused Wednesday to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use as he arrived in Africa for his first visit to the continent as pope. Cameroonian President Paul Biya, left, walks with Pope Benedict XVI at the airport in Yaounde, Tuesday. He landed in Cameroon, the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Angola. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. The pontiff reiterated the Vatican's policy on condom use as he flew from Rome to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said. Pope Benedict has always made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception -- a ""clear moral prohibition"" -- Allen said. But his remarks Tuesday were among the first times he stated the policy explicitly since he became pope nearly four years ago. He has, however, assembled a panel of scientists and theologians to consider the narrow question of whether to allow condoms for married couples, one of whom has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It is still not clear how the pope will rule on the matter, said Allen, who is also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. The Catholic Church has long been on the front line of HIV care, he said, adding that it is probably the largest private provider of HIV care in the world. More than 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, according to a 2008 UNAIDS/WHO report. Nine out of 10 children with HIV in the world live in the region, which has 11.4 million orphans because of AIDS, the report said, and 1.5 million people there died of the disease in 2007.","Pope Benedict XVI refuses to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- It's a spring break with a purpose: Ten days in Texas when the entertainment and tech worlds collide on the neo-bohemian streets of this Texas party town. The annual South by Southwest festival will have its share of parties for the tens of thousands who will attend. But it will also be showcasing the best and brightest in its three main subject areas: Music, film and interactive (read startups, technology and the Web). It's a lot to try to keep up with. So here, broken down by the three major divisions of the fest, are some of the expected highlights we'll be keeping an eye on. Interactive . It could be ideas, not apps that win the day at this year's interactive gathering. If there's a new Twitter, Facebook or Foursquare preparing to break out next week, nobody has pegged it yet. In fact, some of the most ""buzzworthy"" apps pre-festival are the location-based ""discovery"" apps that were supposed to be all the rage last year. (And which, by and large, have underwhelmed most digital travelers and may soon face competition from Facebook). So, if no app leaps to the forefront (and, in fairness, it may take a couple of years to figure out if one did), what will? How about outer space? Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, will be speaking at the festival just days after an unmanned freighter owned by the private company arrived with supplies at the International Space Station. It was the second of 12 missions SpaceX will fly for NASA in the wake of the space shuttle program shutting down. There are no fewer than 15 space-related panels scheduled for Interactive week, including one featuring the Web's viral star of last year's Mars rover landing: NASA ""Mohawk Guy"" Bobak Ferdowsi. While gadgets have never been SXSW's forte -- ceding that to the glitzier Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas -- practical applications for emerging tech like Google Glass, 3-D printers and wearable gizmos like Apple's rumored ""iWatch"" could be on the minds of the technorati gathered in Texas. Other featured speakers at the interactive portion of the festival include Julie Uhrman, who as founder of OUYA seeks to shake up the video game industry with a $99 Android-based console that raised $8 million on Kickstarter, and Matthew Inman, creator of wildly popular webcomic ""The Oatmeal."" Also? Shaquille O'Neal. Yes, Shaq, who is expected to talk about how he followed NBA stardom by becoming a social-media pioneer. His online presence once led Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey to say the site ""wouldn't be what it is today"" without Shaq. Movies . Sundance is still the best-known name, but SXSW has become another top destination for filmmakers hoping to launch an independent film or create buzz for a coming studio release. Having successfully stirred interest in his ""Cabin in the Woods"" in Austin last year, writer and director Joss Whedon is back this year to work with The Bard. Whedon shot his black-and-white take on Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" during his off days from filming ""The Avengers"" and he relies on an ensemble cast from his stable of regulars -- including ""Firefly"" alum turned ""Castle"" star Nathan Fillion. As far as big names go, the festival tops out with Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell in the comedy ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone."" It's a quirky tale, a battle between rival Las Vegas magicians, and seems tailor-made for a South-By crowd. The second coming of cult favorite ""Evil Dead"" will also be showcasing, as will ""At Any Price"" starring Zac Efron, ""The East"" with Alexander Skarsgard and Ellen Page and Matthew McConaughey's ""Mud."" Documentaries are always big at the festival and, this year, ""Hawking"" will bring together film and interactive with a doc about the life of famed physicist Stephen Hawking. The film, which will air on PBS later this year, featured exclusive access to Hawking's life, is narrated in his own voice and includes contributors ranging from Sir Richard Branson to astronaut Buzz Aldrin to actors Carrey and Benedict Cumberbatch. Music . In its secret heart, South by Southwest will always be about the music. Founded 26 years ago to showcase the burgeoning, eclectic music bubbling up deep in the heart of Texas, the festival has become the music world's most well-known and eagerly anticipated annual showcase. More than 2,200 bands turned virtually every square foot of the city into a music hall last year, and organizers promise to ramp it up even more in 2013. Most of the acts that play won't leave Austin with a big contract. But it's worth noting that Alabama Shakes was considered SXSW's musical breakout last year, just months before the group won the Best New Artist Grammy. Established artists will be hitting stages in Austin as well. Green Day, the band that took snarly punk rock all the way to Broadway, will play one of this year's most anticipated sets. The performance will be their first major showcase since front man Billie Joe Armstrong checked himself into rehab seven months ago for what he called a drug- and alcohol relapse that culminated in a profanity-laced rant onstage in Las Vegas. Dave Grohl has parlayed his drummer gig for one of the most influential rock bands of the last quarter-century (that's Nirvana, in case you forgot) into the front man role with perennial Grammy winner Foo Fighters and is now a sort of de facto spokesman for the world of rock. He'll be the music keynote speaker for the festival. Grohl will also be playing with his latest project, Sound City Players, which, against all logic, brings together artists ranging from Rick Springfield and Stevie Nicks to Creedence Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty to members of Slipknot, Fear and Rage Against the Machine. Punk-rock icons Iggy & the Stooges will play, as will gothic troubadour Nick Cave, psych rockers The Flaming Lips and reunited British ska act The Specials. Pop star/actor Justin Timberlake, who has become a bit of a tech entrepreneur in recent years, is hosting a private party and rumored to be pondering a surprise gig himself.","South by Southwest is a 10-day music, film and tech festival in Austin, Texas .

"Barcelona (Mashable) -- Didn't we tell you that the lines between smartphones and tablets are blurred? Case in point: the Asus Fonepad, a 7-inch tablet that's also a phone. Beware: the Fonepad is a completely different device than the PadFone Infinity. There's no smartphone-becomes-tablet witchery here; the Fonepad is a 7-inch tablet, powered by Android 4.1 and sporting a 3G chip. You can use it to make calls, although we don't think a 7-inch device is ideal for the task. The Fonepad looks pretty much exactly like Google's Nexus 7, which is hardly surprising since Asus makes that device as well. However, the Fonepad is very different from most other Android tablets in a one important way: it's powered by the new Intel Atom Z2420 processor (for comparison, the Nexus 7 is powered by ARM's Cortex-A9 CPU). More from Mobile World Congress: Future of mobile is virtual reality, says Android . Intel vice president Hermann Eul claims the processor ""delivers the power, performance and flexibility required to accommodate a range of devices and market needs."" However, the actual CPU model in the Fonepad is a single-core Atom clocked to 1.2GHz, which doesn't inspire confidence. With our short time with the Fonepad, we've tested Eul's claim, and we can say that the Fonepad feels snappy, on par with other tablets of its size of the iOS and Android variety.

"(CNN) -- Starting Monday, Facebook will no longer allow ads on pages that contain sexual or violent content. The move, announced in a blog post, comes after pressure from advocacy groups. It appears to target content that falls into a gray area -- likely to be deemed offensive by many, but which doesn't go far enough to be banned by the site. ""Our goal is to both preserve the freedoms of sharing on Facebook but also protect people and brands from certain types of content,"" the post reads. In May, Facebook was targeted by a coalition of women's organizations complaining about pages or groups that seemed to celebrate or make light of violence against women. As part of the campaign, the groups petitioned Facebook advertisers. The campaign appeared to have some effect. Several advertisers, including Nissan UK and Nationwide, said they were pulling ads from Facebook, while others said they were monitoring the situation. In response, the site announced it was redoubling efforts to stamp out hate speech. Now Facebook says it's implementing new standards for which pages or groups may have advertising placed on them. ""For example, we will now seek to restrict ads from appearing next to Pages and Groups that contain any violent, graphic or sexual content (content that does not violate our community standards),"" the post reads. ""Prior to this change, a Page selling adult products was eligible to have ads appear on its right-hand side; now there will not be ads displayed next to this type of content."" The process will begin with potentially offensive pages being flagged by humans but will eventually give way to ""a more scalable, automated way to prevent and/or remove ads appearing next to controversial content."" With more than 1 billion users to monitor and sometimes grumbly investors to please, Facebook finds itself having to satisfy users of the free service as well as the advertisers that provide the vast majority of its revenue. ""Like any digital platform, we're not going to be perfect but we will be much better,"" Facebook said. ""We'll continue to work aggressively on this issue with advertisers. We are confident the immediate steps we're taking will result in a significantly improved approach to preventing these instances from occurring, and we are committed to making this process work for everyone who uses Facebook.""","Facebook is pulling ads from pages that contain sexual or violent content .

"(Wired) -- Google is barring anyone deemed worthy of a pair of its $1,500 Google Glass computer eyewear from selling or even loaning out the highly coveted gadget. The company's terms of service on the limited-edition wearable computer specifically states, ""you may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."" Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them. It was bound to happen. Strange as it may sound, you don't actually own much of the software you buy today. You essentially rent it under strict end-user agreements that have withstood judicial scrutiny. Google appears to be among the first to apply such draconian rules to consumer electronics. ""If it takes off like iPhones did, this is going to be part of people's everyday activity, and now we are starting down this path that is going to be completely controlled,"" said Corynne McSherry, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's intellectual property coordinator. ""It's not clear to me what they are doing is unlawful. It's a contract issue."" The company knows if the eyewear was transferred because each device is registered under the buyer's Google account. For the moment, not just anybody can buy the eyewear. Google has created the Silicon Valley equivalent of a velvet rope under its so-called Google Glass Explorers program. If Google liked what you posted on social media under the hashtag #ifihadglassand, Google grants you the opportunity to fork out $1,500 for the Explorer edition of the headset. Google declined comment. Google also isn't saying when it would lift its velvet rope and whether the same Draconian terms of service would apply when it does lift the velvet rope. Google's tight rein over the gadget came to light today when one of the first would-be owners of the device abruptly halted an eBay auction because he feared reprisals from Google. ""After getting a message on Twitter from Google saying I had been selected as part of the program a couple weeks ago, it just came to mind if they are giving out to a limited number of people, I could put it out there on eBay and sell it for a lot more than $1,500,"" said Ed, a Philadelphia man who halted his auction Wednesday. (Wired agreed not to publish his last name as a condition of him telling his story.) Because the only correspondence Ed has had with Google is the initial tweet about his acceptance into the program, he had no idea he wasn't allowed to sell his Google Glass, which he had been authorized to purchase for $1,500 in the coming weeks. Instead, he found out via the Glass Explorers Google+ group. He also discovered that some were upset that he had the audacity to sell his Google Glass headset. ""People were acting like I had did something sacrilegious,"" he said. Once Ed learned of the terms of service, he ended the auction â€” which began at $5,000 and ballooned to more than $90,000. No one from Google or eBay had contacted him about the auction, he said. He still wants his Google Glass Explorer headset and hopes that Google doesn't hold it against him for trying to sell the device. ""I'm willing to fork up the $1,500 for it,"" he said. The tech world, including Google, won an approval-of-sorts to control its stream of commerce in 2010, when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said licensing language controls resales. The case concerned a dispute about whether a California man could resell Autodesk software on eBay. Autodesk prevailed in a lawsuit, and the San Francisco-based appeals court pointed out that the shrink-wrap agreement between its customers forbade the resale of it. The Software & Information Industry Association, whose members include Google, Adobe, McAfee, Oracle and dozens of others, urged the court to rule as it did. The Motion Picture Association of America also sided with Autodesk. Federal regulators cited that decision last year (.pdf) when it blocked mobile-phone owners from lawfully unlocking their phones to run on a compatible carrier of choice, saying the ruling was ""controlling precedent."" That's because people don't own the software on their phones that controls access to carrier networks, regulators said. For Ed, it's all a lost opportunity to cash in on being one of the first selected to buy Google Glass. It would have been ""exciting,"" he said, ""to get $100,000 for something that only costs $1,500."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- ""We are now locked in a rolling filibuster on every issue, which is totally gridlocking the U.S. Senate. That is wrong. It is wrong for America."" Who said that? Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate? Guess again. Try former Republican leader Trent Lott, bemoaning the troubled state of the Senate in the late 1990s. No recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a Senate in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber. This is not a new problem. Harry Reid may face a particularly unrestrained minority. But generations of Senate leaders from Henry Clay to Bill Frist have felt compelled to seek changes in Senate rules to make the chamber a more governable place. Some things never change. Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January. Reid argues that Republicans have engaged in unprecedented levels of filibustering. GOP leader Mitch McConnell blames what he calls Reid's weak leadership, arguing that Republicans' parliamentary tactics are a natural response to Reid's partisan ways. There is no innocent party in the parliamentary arms race that engulfs the Senate. Still, many argue that Republicans go overboard in their willingness to exploit Senate rules. Indeed, since 2007, Senate records show that Republicans have filibustered or threatened to filibuster more than 360 times, a historic record. Reform of the Senate is overdue. In 1997, with Republicans controlling the Senate, author Steven Smith and I advocated reforms that sought to trim the filibuster while preserving minority rights. Today, with Democrats in control, I again think changes in Senate rules are due: . Senate should limit the number of motions subject to a filibuster . A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the ""motion to proceed"" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House. When the majority seeks to call up a bill on the floor for consideration, the leader offers a motion to proceed. Because Senate rules deem this motion ""debatable,"" it takes 60 votes to cut off debate and come to a vote on the motion. Banning the filibuster on this motion would still allow a minority to filibuster the underlying bill and amendments to it. But it would give a majority the right to set the chamber's legislative agenda. The change might also rein in senators' secret ""holds"" because the majority leader would no longer need broad support to advance a bill to the floor. Similarly, debate could be trimmed by banning filibusters on the three steps required to send a bill to conference with the House. Conference committees have gone the way of the dodo bird because minorities have been willing to filibuster the steps required to send bills to conference. Banning such filibusters would encourage the use of conference committees and restore the involvement of rank-and-file senators in the process of negotiating bicameral agreements. Senators would still retain the right to filibuster agreements that emerged from conference. Ratchet down the number of votes required to invoke cloture . The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules. If that failed, the next vote would require 57 votes, then 54 votes, and so on, until the Senate reached a simple majority vote for cloture. To guarantee the minority adequate time to debate and amend bills, I would tie the number of days of advance notice of a coming cloture vote to the number of votes required for cloture. The fewer the votes required, the longer the advance notice. Coupling new cloture thresholds and notice requirements would allow the Senate to reach votes by simple majority while still protecting the minority's parliamentary rights. Senate should experiment with new modes of advice and consent for nominations . The confirmation process is a mess, with nominees often waiting months for hearings and confirmation votes. The Senate should consider new ""fast-track"" confirmation rules. For executive branch appointees, the fast track might fix the length of Senate consideration, guaranteeing a confirmation vote within, say, three months. For judicial nominations, fast-track consideration might be given to candidates recommended by bipartisan commissions in their home states. Zelizer: Gridlock in Congress? Blame the GOP . If the White House nominates a candidate approved by such a commission, the Senate would fast-track the nominee to a confirmation vote. Fast-tracks protect the minority's right to scrutinize presidential appointees, but ensure that nominees are guaranteed confirmation votes within a reasonable period of time. Such reforms would restore some semblance of balance to the Senate. For that reason, the minority party is likely to oppose them. Even members of the majority might balk at trimming their procedural rights. That is the unfortunate history of Senate reform: Senators rarely want to give up their parliamentary advantages. Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn. Under some conditions, majorities can avoid filibusters of their reform proposals by using what senators term the ""constitutional option."" But as this week's outrage on the Senate floor suggests, the process of an overhaul can be as explosive as the actual reform. There's no easy path. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Sarah Binder.","Sarah Binder: Minority has always exploited filibuster rules to hang up rival proposals .
Reid's plans to reform procedures have faced tough opposition, she says .
Binder: Senate should set limits on filibuster rules that are fair to each party .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Google is working hard to make you love Google+, its growing but still often-overlooked social network. How hard? The tech titan introduced 41 new Google+ features Wednesday, including a spiffy design, a Hangouts mobile chat feature and more tools for editing your photo library. With some 360 million active users, Google+ has surpassed Twitter to become the world's second-most popular social network, after Facebook. Here's a closer look at the updates, which were announced by Vic Gundotra, senior vice president and Google+ manager, at the company's I/O conference. Google as photo assistant . Google+ has added automated photo-editing features that, depending on how well they work, could save amateur photographers huge amounts of time. Given an unedited batch of photos from a recent family vacation, Google+ can narrow the images down to what it determines are the best shots. ""I don't have time to pick them out (myself) because my vacation is over,"" said Gundotra. The process begins with elimination, culling images that are blurry, duplicates or poorly exposed. It recognizes and includes landmarks and people in its final selections. Google's algorithms have been learning what people find beautiful in a photograph and uses that information to identify shots that are aesthetically pleasing. It also uses facial detection to identify who appears in your photos to find people to whom you are close, such as family members. Once the best shots are isolated, the next step is making them even better. Many people now rely on the auto-enhance button found in photo editing apps, from iPhoto to Instagram. Google+ has added its take on the auto button, which dabbles in white balance, skin softening, vignettes, sharpening and taking out red eye. Finally, Google+ is adding something called Auto Awesome that does kicky things with photos such as turning them into small collages and turning multiple images into everyone's new favorite image format, the animated GIF. Hangouts turns into a chat client . Hangouts, the free group video-calling service that's become one of the more popular Google+ features, is getting into the mobile chat business. Google is rolling out a standalone app version of Hangouts that combines text, photos and live video. The feature will work across Android and iOS devices and can include multiple people. Users of the app will now be able to save logs of chats if they want to swipe back in time to recall conversations. The idea, according to Gundotra, is to offer a communication tool that can be used on any device, regardless of the platform. ""Why should OSes matter? People matter,"" said Gundotra. ""Frankly even Google's own services have been fragmented and confused at times,"" A new G+ look . The new Google+ layout emphasizes multiple streams, or columns, of posts, athough the number you see will change to fit the device you're using, whether it's a giant desktop screen or a small smartphone. Images are front and center in the new design, and photos and videos can fill the entire width of the stream. In other words, Google+ will look more like Pinterest.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A legal battle has put the future of Skype in jeopardy, according to eBay, which owns the online communications system. Skype's online phone and video communication service has been incredibly popular. If Skype loses the right to use a key part of its software and can't create an adequate replacement, ""Skype's business as currently conducted would likely not be possible,"" eBay said in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There is no sign of Skype disappearing soon -- a relief to the more than 480 million registered users who have video or telephone conversations online through the technology. But the battle with Joltid, the company that created the piece of technology at issue, shows no sign of being resolved anytime soon, either. Joltid complains that Skype broke its licensing agreement to use the technology. Skype filed suit against Joltid in Britain, saying it could not terminate the license agreement; Joltid struck back with a counterclaim saying Skype had broken the agreement. A trial is scheduled for June 2010, eBay said in the SEC filing. ""Although Skype is confident of its legal position, as with any litigation, there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation,"" eBay writes. ""Skype has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through Joltid. However, such software development may not be successful, may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful, and will in any event be expensive."" In an e-mail to CNN, Joltid said Skype ""accessed Joltid's source code and modified it -- Joltid then claimed a breach of license."" Skype denies any breach. ""Joltid is enforcing its rights in the courts,"" Joltid said in the e-mail. ""Like any member of the creative industries, Joltid will defend its innovations with determination.""

"(CNN) -- The White House is reportedly considering hiring Twitter's Nicole Wong as part of its legal team to focus on privacy issues, though a final decision on the position has not yet been made. Wong started at Twitter just seven months ago as the legal director for Twitter's products team. According to multiple news reports, Wong is a leading contender for the position of senior adviser to Todd Park, the United States chief technology officer. Previously, Wong worked at Google for eight years as a vice president and deputy general counsel. Before that, she was a partner at the law firm Perkins Coie. The White House has not confirmed the hire, and neither the White House nor Twitter immediately returned requests Tuesday for comment. The news was first reported Tuesday by tech-news site CNET. The UC-Berkeley graduate is no stranger to politically volatile topics. During her time at Google, Wong was in charge of censorship issues for products such as YouTube, deciding whether controversial videos uploaded to the service should be blocked from certain countries' search results. A 2008 New York Times article described the work of Wong's team at Google in depth: . ""They decide what controversial material does and doesn't appear on the local search engines that Google maintains in many countries in the world, as well as on Google.com. As a result, Wong and her colleagues arguably have more influence over the contours of online expression than anyone else on the planet."" If chosen for the new position, Wong would potentially work directly under Park, who started with the White House in 2012 and is the second person to hold the title of U.S. CTO.","Twitter lawyer Nicole Wong is being hired as a privacy adviser, news reports say .

"(CNN) -- Just a year and a half after making their debut, Orica-GreenEdge became the first Australian team to win a stage at the Tour de France as Simon Gerrans finished ahead of the pack in a tight sprint finish in Corsica. A photo finish was needed to separate the Australian from Slovakia's Peter Sagan, after the riders traveled 145.5km from Ajaccio to Calvi for the third and final stage on the island. Belgium's Jan Bakelants -- who won Sunday's stage -- ensured his debut in the famous race, which is celebrating its 100th edition, continued in the brightest vein as he retained the yellow jersey. His RadioShack Leopard team worked hard to enable the 27-year-old to cross the line in 19th place and so retain the prestigious jersey -- but the day belonged to the Australian newboys. ""This is a huge win,"" Gerrans told the team's official website. ""It's a huge moment for the team. We have been so close on so many occasions. Hopefully it's the first of many more to come."" ""I had no idea if I had won. I knew it was really close, and I wasn't going to celebrate too early. Sagan and I were on the opposite ends of the road and we both threw our bikes. ""My win was confirmed a few minutes later. We're all pretty ecstatic."" Sagan's second place allowed him to take the green jersey for the best sprinter from Marcel Kittel, the German who won the opening stage of the race in Bastia on Saturday. Gerrans' victory was his second stage win, having previously achieved the feat in the Alps when riding for CrÃ©dit Agricole in 2008, and partly atoned for sprinter Matt Goss's failure to take a stage at last year's race. ""We had a brilliant first season last year, but we really missed winning a stage on the Tour de France so this year it was a big objective for the team to win a stage and I'm really happy to have done that,"" Gerrans, who won last year's Town Down Under in his home country, said in his post-race press conference. Making their racing debut in January 2012, Orica-GreenEdge were founded the year before with the express intention of becoming Australia's first road race cycling team. Gerran's finish also earned better headlines for a team whose bus driver invited ridicule after becoming stuck under the finish arch on the opening day of the tour. Garikoitz Atxa, a Spanish former cyclist who was on his first day working as the team's bus driver, was caught on camera with his head in his hands when the incident happened -- with the team later fined $2,116 by race organizers. ""We didn't really find out what happened until we finished the first stage,"" said Gerrans, 33. ""Afterwards we saw the footage of the bus being stuck under the finish line, and you can really do nothing but laugh at the situation. It was such a bizarre scenario for that to happen. ""The bus driver did a fantastic job. We are all really proud of how he conducted himself in the team; for sure, he was really embarrassed so we really felt quite sorry for him."" Tuesday's team trial in Nice could see race favorite Chris Froome take the yellow jersey given the strength of Team Sky. The time for each team will be taken when their fifth rider crosses the line. Meanwhile, Andrey Kashechkin of the Astana team and Cofidis' Yoann Bagot became the first two riders to withdraw from this year's Tour after suffering digestive problems and food poisoning respectively.","Simon Gerrans claims historic first stage win for Orica-GreenEdge .

"(CNN) -- Facebook and online privacy: For several years now, it's been hard to talk about one without talking about the other. And Facebook's latest offering, called Home, is no exception. Facebook Home is an Android app that acts like a skin, updating the standard Android mobile operating system with a more modern, Facebooky decor. The Android home screen is replaced with a graphic version of the Facebook news feed that automatically flips through the latest happenings from your friends. The phone's home page has additional Facebook features for posting to the site and communicating with friends. Facebook Home is a more convenient way for heavy Facebook users to use the social network's services. It is also a more powerful tool for Facebook to potentially collect information about a person, and it gives the company more ways and places to serve up ads. This is a tricky balancing act for Facebook, which makes the majority of its revenue on advertising. Knowing more information about a person means Facebook can better target ads to them, and make more money. Some pundits and privacy experts are already raising concerns about the potential for data grabs by Facebook. Om Malik of the site GigaOm says, ""this application erodes any idea of privacy. If you install this, then it is very likely that Facebook is going to be able to track your every move, and every little action."" And Parker Higgins, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Digital Trends: ""They will get information about who you're calling, how often, and how long you're speaking to them. That's a lot of information, and combined with the rest of your Facebook communications, (it) could paint a very clear picture of your private life."" So what will be collected? On a regular phone, Facebook's data collecting powers are limited to what you do inside the official Facebook mobile app or on the site in a browser. Facebook Home frees Facebook from that prison and gives it wider rein to collect more information about a person's location, actions and communications. Built-in GPS technology means smartphones know where a person is at any given time. Phones with Facebook Home could access this information at any time to determine what businesses or neighborhoods you visit the most or even where you live. That data could then be used to serve up a more personalized ad, such as a coupon for a store you're near or coffee shop you visit every Sunday. A Facebook representative told CNN that Home will not actively track users' GPS location. In addition to any Facebook messages or calls you already send or make, Facebook Home pulls SMS text messages into the mix. Who you talk to, when you talk to them and, in the case of text messages, what you talk about are possibly fertile grounds for data collection. Third-party apps are also part of the Facebook Home ecosystem, though in a somewhat limited way. ""For a small randomized rolling subset of users, we will be collecting information ... around what applications you launch and when,"" the Facebook spokesman told CNN in an e-mail. ""We do not collect any information about your activity within third-party apps."" People already willingly share much of this information with Facebook. But Facebook Home, running in the background on your phone, will make it easier for the company to quietly collect data on everything you do. The difference is between actively sharing information -- uploading an image with location data, checking into a restaurant or other business -- and passively sharing it (what the tech companies like to call ""frictionless"" sharing). In other words, telling Facebook where you are, who your friends are and what apps you like won't be optional, it will be automatic. Facebook said Home requires no new privacy controls and will respect all existing privacy settings. Will Facebook fans care? Facebook has long been plagued by privacy concerns over confusing privacy controls and data mining, but such worries don't seem to have had any significant impact on its core users. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of Facebook users have taken a break from the social networking site, but only 4% cited privacy concerns as a reason. Facebook Home, which launches on April 12, isn't being forced on anyone. Downloading the app is entirely optional, as is buying a new HTC phone with Home preinstalled. Much of the outrage over past Facebook privacy issues has been because they were mandatory and affected everyone. Many of the Facebook faithful may have resigned themselves to the idea that what they do on the site is tracked -- a fair enough exchange for a free service that keeps them in contact with friends, family and people they sort of knew in middle school.","Facebook Home could give the company access to more of your personal data .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama is a busy man, what with budget negotiations, gun control issues, international crises and the ever-present back-and-forth political foolery of Washington. So why should he send out tweets on Twitter? According to an article on the Atlantic Wire, he doesn't anymore. ""All of the president's named social media accounts have been handed over to a non-partisan, not-for-profit group that isn't overly concerned if you didn't notice the transition,"" Philip Bump wrote in the article, published Monday. Some of this is, of course, Washington hairsplitting. Though @BarackObama has existed since his candidate days in 2007, most of the posts have been handled by his staff. (Occasionally, the president has posted something himself, tweets denoted by his ""-bo"" signature in the tweet.) The account, which has 29 million followers, has now been handed over to Organizing for Action, an offshoot of the president's 2012 campaign operation. It's as if, Bump wrote, ""the president, mid-conversation, handed his phone to a telemarketer who does a great Obama impression. Or, to be more accurate, one telemarketer -- the campaign -- handed the phone to another one."" There are legal issues involved -- the presidential campaign was set up according to one set of guidelines, and Organizing for Action functions under another -- but there's a larger ethical point as well: Should we believe that tweets are actually coming from the person who owns the Twitter account? After all, even though Twitter takes pains to classify some accounts as ""verified"" -- a service they do proactively, according to the Twitter website -- who knows who's really on the other end? It's an old Internet conundrum, best described by the classic New Yorker cartoon caption: ""On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."" Transparency is best . Jerry Lanson, a journalism professor at Emerson College in Boston, puts it simply: Honesty -- or, at least, transparency -- is the best policy. ""If you're transparent you're off the hook,"" he says. If the Obama administration is up front that the account has been farmed out, then it's up to the public to decide if they want to follow @BarackObama. However, Michael Zimmer, director of the Center for Information Policy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, adds that it's ""reasonable to assume"" that the views of @BarackObama are those of the president, and not some affiliated activist group. ""We'd presume that the message is 'from him' in the sense that someone discussed/cleared with him the kind of content that would be communicated through that channel,"" he says. It's ""much like the White House press secretary: that person speaks on behalf of the White House."" It can be difficult to tell whether the real person or some PR rep is behind the Twitter account of some public figures. All Twitter offers is their ""verified"" symbol. But judging by their tone, some of the most popular feeds appear to come straight from the mouths of the famous, including Shaquille O'Neal (@SHAQ), Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) and Steve Martin (@SteveMartinToGo). Of course, Twitter transparency comes at many levels. Many public figures' accounts have millions of followers, and followers can be purchased inexpensively if someone wants to run up the numbers. Other accounts are ""bots"" -- computer-generated -- inactive, or downright fake. Celebrities have been slammed for these practices, and some accusations of Twittery fakery flew during last year's presidential campaign. Pranksters have also spoofed many well-known Twitter accounts. Over the weekend, megachurch pastor Joel Osteen was the victim of an elaborate hoax that included a fake website, phony headlines and sham Twitter account, all maintaining he had renounced his faith. Osteen's staff actually responded to the hoax on his real Twitter account. Twitter allows parody accounts, as long as the joke is clear. But Twitter's impersonation policy states that ""accounts portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently suspended."" 'You never really know who you're dealing with' It's yet another sign that the Internet remains the Wild West, despite moves to civilize it. In 1992, the Computer Ethics Institute, a Washington-based public policy organization, actually released a ""Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics,"" many of which lend themselves to Twitter users. Among them: ""Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people,"" ""Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness"" and ""Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that insure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.""

"Editor's note: Despite his unfortunate reference to a ""Jedi mind meld,"" some consider President Barack Obama the first geek president for his tech fluency and outreach. Now the White House is launching its #WeTheGeeks initiative, a series of online video chats meant to ""highlight the future of science, technology and innovation in the United States."" The first one happened Thursday at 2 pm ET on the White House's Google+ page and included four leading thinkers in science and technology. We at CNN.com began to wonder what would happen if there really was a part of the dusty old U.S. Constitution devoted to geeks. So we, who are geeks ourselves, drafted one. Below, you will find Article I of the Geek Constitution. THE GEEK CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES . PREAMBLE . We the Geeks of the United States, in order to form a Ford Prefect union, solve equations, ensure scientific literacy, cast magical spells, build the next killer apps, and reap the blessings of geek literacy for ourselves and our geeky friends, do ordain and establish this Geek Constitution for the United States of America. ARTICLE I . Section 1 . All exponential powers herein applied to numbers shall not be imaginary, or be powers of three, unless it is deemed applicable. Each House shall respect curiosity and the search for knowledge. Members are encouraged to make scientific discoveries, if they so desire, but they may indulge any other topic of their choosing. Such proclaimed Geeks shall be able to disarm the Keeg, to be heretofore known as the inverse Geek. Horses may be ridden, unless it is declared that more pony is required. In that case, rainbow-colored ponies shall suffice. Section 2 . The House of Representatives shall be a weekly gathering, and leaders from each state shall be determined by rolling a d20. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have memorized at least 50 digits of the mysterious number pi. Section 3 . The Senate will gather in a laboratory. Some members will be responsible for conducting experiments, while others will take measurements. White laboratory coats may be worn, but are optional. No Person shall be a Senator until they can recite the periodic table of elements in their sleep. Section 4 . The time, place and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives can be calculated using complex equations. Such results shall be recorded in binary format. The Congress shall assemble at least once per year, and shall eat as much pizza as they want. The facilities where the assemblies are held shall be technologically superior, and connected together with Wi-Fi or a LAN. Section 5 . Each House shall congregate in a grassy spot on the field of knowledge. Members may engage in Geek debates or Geek battles as they see fit. If a disagreement cannot be resolved, each House may, only if they choose, do battle against the other by taking turns in a role-playing format. The setting shall be a medieval castle surrounded by a wicked forest. Section 6 . The Senators and Representatives shall receive good compensation for their services, commensurate with abilities and education. No Senator or Representative shall be forced by circumstances to eat ramen noodles, but they may still eat such soups because they are tasty. Section 7 . Some votes of the Geek Congress shall be presented to the Geek President, but some may not. Anyone may question assumed assertions and apply thoughtful, reasoned judgment to solve the problems they face. Section 8 . The hassling of impressionable Geeks who are still in their teens or younger shall be prohibited, and it would not be too horrible if a tax or duty were to be imposed on such acts, at roughly 10 dollars for each person, or perhaps more. In fact, it would be fantastic if no Geeks, or no people, were to be hassled. The privilege of indulging in video games shall not be suspended, lest it should spur a rebellion or harm the public safety by inspiring an invasion of local arcades. If said gaming rights are suspended, washing duties such as sanitation and waste disposal and the washing of clothes and/or dishes shall also be suspended. Such players of games shall have the right to a functional controller and headset, and may refuse the commands of others for every moment they are present in front of the television monitor. Efforts shall be made in order to assure that Alterac Valley be restored to its former glory, instead of the zergfest it has become. Section 9 . The Geeks shall have the power to change the course of the world; . To create the products we will use in the future; . To devise the services that will help us get things done; . To ensure adequate power outlet availability where it is needed; . To code all night long; . To read this list with the ""Star Trek"" theme playing in the background; . To protest networks via social media/strongly worded letters/flash mobs/awkward questions at conventions if a favorite television series gets canceled; . To CONspire to CONgregrate and form a CONglomerate at any CON of their choosing; . To spend untold amounts of time and energy making sure cosplay costumes are screen/page accurate; . To dress up as a superhero whenever the mood strikes; . To lament the cancellation of ""Firefly"" no matter how much time has passed; . To believe that Han shot first; . To be on a first-name basis with their comic-book store clerk; . To consume copious amounts of Hot Pockets and Mountain Dew; . To explain things in more detail than anyone would ever care to know; . To know what a role-playing board game is in the year 2013; . To reminisce about how a favorite thing was much better back in the yesteryears; . Section 10 . No Geek shall enter into situations in which they feel ashamed of their interests or skills; . No Geek shall feel that their ideas are unwanted in society; . No Geek shall fear that they will be bullied because they are a little different; . No Geek shall skip the latest episode of ""Doctor Who""; . No Geek shall pass up an argument about whether ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"" is superior to the other; . No Geek shall be informed that his favorite card game is ""not a sport."" If curling is to be declared a sport, then so shall be ""Magic: The Gathering."" No Geek shall forget that Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams are perhaps the most polarizing humans ever, especially when they kill off favorite characters or use too many lens flares. No Geek shall discuss any edition of Dungeons & Dragons without the obligatory ""Which edition is better?"" tangent. Weapons may not be drawn during such a discussion, but the throwing of dice is permissible. When a Geek's character dies, the character sheet must be relinquished to the Game Master upon his request. A copy may be kept for a member's own records. No Geek shall be required to paint war-gaming miniatures. Such endeavors shall be left to the personal desires of the individual; let it not be said to that the lack of coloration ""ruins the immersion/experience/suspension of disbelief,"" or any similar reason. No Geek shall be concerned with their age in calendar years. A Geek has the right to be a Geek until the day of death. TL;DR: One may become their own kind of Geek, and draw their own conclusions about divisive Geek debates. What would you add? Please add your suggestions in the comments below.

"(CNN) -- When the University of California regents were looking for a new president for perhaps the best public university system in the world -- with 10 campuses and more than 230,000 students -- they chose Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano? What? Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio wasn't available? At UCLA, UC Berkeley, and the other UC campuses, students who are undocumented immigrants -- the so-called DREAM'ers -- should be packing their stuff and seeking sanctuary at the nearest community college. One day, all UC students might need to produce their green cards, birth certificates, or proof of citizenship when they enroll. Soon there will be a new sheriff in town. One who makes Wyatt Earp look like Andy Taylor. It's easy to see why Napolitano might wants this plum assignment -- outgoing president Mark Yudof makes $591,000, triple her salary at DHS. (Yudof's total compensation: $847,149). The real question is why should Californians want her? After all, this is a state where the population is more than 38% Hispanic. And, in the first three years of the Obama administration, with Napolitano -- a former Arizona governor -- at the helm riding herd over Obama's immigration policy, Hispanics were vocal in expressing their anger with them. The president was heckled at the National Council of La Raza conference in July 2011 over the failure to honor his campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority, the record number of deportations on his watch, and his refusal to grant deferred status to DREAM'ers. In Dec 2011, a survey by the Pew Hispanic Center found that Hispanics disapproved of the administration's handling of the immigration issue by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 -- 59% to 27%. In June 2012, Obama announced an accommodation for DREAM'ers where they could apply for deferred status, get a work permit and avoid deportation for two years. But those early years, 2009 to 2011, were terrible, and Napolitano took much of the flak. She is still persona non grata in parts of the Hispanic community. In a statement last week, Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org, a grass-roots organization that goes to bat for immigrants and seeks to give Latinos a voice in politics, was refreshingly direct. Napolitano will, he said, ""go into the halls of history as President Barack Obama's go-to person for implementing the most repressive anti-Latino and anti-immigrant policies our nation has ever seen."" Meanwhile, Obama said this: ""Since Day One, Janet has led my administration's effort to secure our borders, deploying a historic number of resources, while also taking steps to make our immigration system fairer and more consistent with our values."" At current rates, by the end of 2014 the Obama administration will have deported 2 million people, forced local police departments across the country through the Secure Communities program to enforce federal immigration law in an Arizona-crackdown style, divided hundreds of thousands of families, and -- according to data recently obtained by the Chicago-based National Immigration Justice Center through the Freedom of Information Act -- held hundreds of immigrant minors in adult detention facilities without access to legal counsel, for periods ranging from three days to six months. Are these the values you're talking about, Mr. President? Napolitano is a convenient villain for the Left. Yet she merely carried out the president's immigration strategy, which is three parts heavy-handed enforcement to one part feel-good rhetoric about supporting immigration reform with little action to back up the words. This is the game that Obama and Napolitano have been running. Obama would talk about how he'd like to suspend the deportations; then Napolitano would deliver the reality check and say: ""No way, Jose."" Obama would address a Latino group and assure them -- falsely it turns out -- that the only people being deported are violent criminals; and Napolitano would brag to Congress about how her department has deported record numbers of people with all sorts of backgrounds and promise to remove more next year. Obama was the good cop, and Napolitano was the bad cop. Now the bad cop is on her way out, and we're going to see how ""good"" the good cop really is. Now that Napolitano is headed to California, many of us are holding our breath. Who knows what is coming our way? Meanwhile, immigration reform advocates should hold their applause. Her boss is still in Washington, and he is still in charge of an immigration policy that has, for the last four and a half years, wreaked havoc on countless lives. Regardless of who replaces Napolitano, expect more of the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Napolitano DHS deportation record should worry students at UC .
He says her boss, Obama, lagged on immigration reform, but not on record deportations .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- When something big and exciting happens right in your own backyard, you sort of have to stop, pull up a chair, and enjoy the moment. Especially when it's quite literally in your backyard. But I'm easy. Two squirrels fighting over an acorn qualifies as must-see, five-star entertainment. My assistant knows the drill. ""Acorn fight! Diane, cancel all my appointments."" Of course, I don't actually have an assistant named Diane. And I don't have appointments. But if I did, she would clear them for such unexpected awesomeness. Which, when you have my delightfully low standards, would be often. But this weekend, in my figurative backyard of Atlanta, there are some actual, legitimate big-time festivities happening. So big, in fact, it's like THREE squirrels fighting over an acorn. ""Sweet Moses! Diane, bring me nachos."" Naturally, of course, I'm talking about the world-famous, four-day-long, sweaty orgy of humanity known as the NCAA men's basketball Final Four. Mind you, that isn't their official description. But it should be. You know. For kids. And not only is the Final Four completely taking over my city, it's also trending everywhere online in social media. Thus, I figured, so long as people are talking about it, and so long as it's in town, I might as well become one with ""the madness"" and download the official app to learn exactly what's going on. (Ahem, disclosure: CNN is a part of the TBS family, and TBS is a major broadcast partner of the NCAA Final Four. Though I am a team player, this week's topic has nothing to do with my employer. I chose it because I'm lazy and it's happening next door to my office). Sadly, however, the schedule of events doesn't suggest anything about fighting squirrels. ""Diane, take the rest of the day off."" The Final Four Atlanta app is actually pretty useful for sorting out all the weekend's craziness, and I immediately noticed that most of it is happening in a strange place called Bracket Town. I sort of picture a sad little neighborhood where the streets are littered with torn pieces of paper. The men are all clinically depressed because their girlfriends' ""favorite mascot"" strategy works every year. And at the end of March, tradition leads these anguished souls to the top of Heartache Hill to scream profanities at Georgetown. In fact, when it's not serving the Final Four, Bracket Town is actually just the lower level of Building A of the Georgia World Congress Center -- otherwise known as the greatest carpet contract in the history of man. Seriously, this place is huge, and every time I walk through part of the 3.9 million square feet all I can think is that whoever sold the flooring is living large on a private yacht. And it drives me crazy. You see, I currently do not own a private yacht. Which is not to imply that someday I will. Because I most certainly won't. I studied journalism. So, just what is Bracket Town? In their own words -- presumably drafted to charm and delight the Alliteration Appreciation Association Around America -- the NCAA describes it as ""the Ultimate Final Four Fan Fest, offering more than 300,000 square feet of family-friendly activities."" Flippity frick frack! That's a lot of F's. And it's also a lot of floor space. I took a preview tour on Tuesday and needed oxygen. Consider that a regulation basketball court is 4,700 square feet. By doing far more math than the warning label on my discount-bin brain allows, I somehow calculated that Bracket Town is roughly the equivalent of 64 full-size courts. That's massive! Having said that, I realize this is a completely useless statistic, and none of us are any smarter for my calculations. Plus, I now have a headache. And a rash. Unrelated. Long story. Nevertheless, inside Bracket Town, which goes from Friday at noon until sometime Monday when they run out of Fs, ticket holders can experience everything from 3-on-3 tournaments to autograph signings to skills challenges in several of the 80-plus NCAA sports. Sadly, napping on the couch does not appear to be one of them. So, I don't predict any personal success in these challenges. It seems my greatest skill does not lend itself to scholarship opportunities. But for many of the expected 10,000 Bracket Town fans who possess far greater athleticism than I, there will be plenty of opportunities to slam-dunk basketballs, kick soccer goals, and crack home runs. And for my equals who would rather test the limits of their liver than those of their muscles, there's even an adult beverage lounge setup by Bleacher Report. You know, because Mommy needs her medicine. Of course, this is all just one large part of an already action-packed weekend. In addition to Bracket Town, Centennial Olympic Park will be hosting free concerts from My Morning Jacket, Sting, Dave Matthews Band, and more. Which is great, save for the fact that somehow getting home from downtown will require a catapult. And I'm not sure how I feel about being hooked up to a machine just to bypass traffic. So, a bunch of us are just sticking around and taking it all in. Because this is the Final Four, and this is MY backyard. ""Diane, help me find a port-o-john.""","Atlanta hosts the NCAA Final Four .

"(CNN) -- Say what you will about Facebook, but the social network is not too proud to copy. Facebook is reportedly considering co-opting the hashtags that first emerged on Twitter, following its previous aping of the Twitter model of following strangers and sharing content publicly. Facebook is testing the idea of supporting the use of hashtags in posts to the social network, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Facebook has declined to comment on the reports. Hashtags, unique and often cryptic terms preceded by a hash mark (""#""), are specially tracked and aggregated on Twitter as they would presumably be on Facebook. Twitter shows which tags are trending, and clicking on a hashtag brings up other posts with the same tag. Facebook is surely interested in the additional vector they provide for advertisers. On Twitter, advertisers can pay to promote their own hashtags alongside Twitter's list of most common hashtags. The aggregation pages showing posts associated with a hashtag is another natural point for advertising. On Facebook, advertisers could hypothetically ""promote"" user posts that contain particular hashtags just as they now promote ""likes"" of their business pages. Such promoted posts could get more prominent and longer-lasting placement on Facebook's News Feed, where non-promoted items are sorted by relevance. Facebook's apparent tinkering with hashtags is being framed in the tech press, all too predictably, as part of a war with Twitter. But the only battle that matters to Facebook in the end is the one for the attention of its own users for the dollars of its own advertisers. Hashtags will be a way to grow both.

"(CNN) -- Does a special woman in your life spend far too much time thinking for herself? You know. Using her brain for original thought? If so, there's a new consumer electronics product out there that's just perfect for her. But not really. It's the ePad Femme -- an 8-inch tablet device designed specifically for women, and already preloaded with special female-friendly apps. As opposed to, say, Angry Birds which, apparently, requires machismo. Yes, it seems the Dubai-based Eurostar Group figured if there's one thing a woman needs, it's a handheld computer specifically engineered to insult her intelligence. I sort of picture the dudes on their R&D team having several glances through an old copy of Cosmo at the dentist's office and immediately declaring a full understanding of the female brain. ""Our data suggest they enjoy yoga."" And then they made the ePad Femme. It's pink! Perhaps they thought about making one for men, as well. But that was always going to be difficult. Our male minds are just too amazingly complex and superior, for it takes a true stroke of brilliance to successfully belch the entire alphabet. And that's something we're good at. Anyway, I guess men and women are just completely different. And maybe that's why they think the ePad Femme makes a perfect gift for your mom. Or your wife. Or your girlfriend. Or your sister. Or, really, any nice lady you'd like to openly disrespect. What's that you say? Anniversary coming up? No problem. ""Here, babe. Have an ePad Femme. It has recipes."" And that's a big selling point for the manufacturer, who proudly boasts that, unlike all the other touchscreen devices on the market, this thing is the only one designed ""exclusively for women."" That's why they preloaded it with those gender-specific apps -- so a poor, hopeless young lady doesn't have to think about which ones she actually, you know ... wants. Because a female would never understand how to search for apps on her own. Plus, it would just divert time away from being a baby factory and personal chef to the real genius in the house. The one who's in the basement, not wearing pants, working on a statistical analysis for his fantasy baseball draft. Of course, these ePad Femme preselected apps will do almost everything a woman needs in life, from helping her create a shopping list to tracking weight loss to whatever it is the perfume app does. ""Do I smell pretty, now?"" ""Not really. Try rubbing it against your head."" At this very moment, everyone at the Eurostar Group office in Dubai is likely overjoyed by the ePad Femme's sudden emergence on the Web. Though they hope to ""explore all markets,"" right now the device is only sold in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Still, it's trending worldwide. Because it's completely insane. It actually first came out in October as a gift idea -- presumably for the guy who doesn't mind sleeping on the couch. Now, for some strange reason, it's making an internet comeback. Maybe it's the price point. The ePad Femme only costs $200. And it runs on the Android operating system. So, look out Apple. There's a new sexy sheriff in town. It's pink! But what about power and memory? With a 1.5GHz processor and 16GB of memory storage, the manufacturers made the ePad Femme perfectly equipped for even the longest grocery lists. Guys, your lady could literally spend all day at the market buying food before coming home to cook. For you! Look, you've worked hard tweeting critical thoughts on your favorite football team. That's exhausting. So, just relax while she enjoys a little Girl Power in the produce aisle. Plus, what if you decided to have a man-party with your man-friends, and you were planning to watch man-sports and maybe play man-games like ""tickle time"" and RISK? Clearly, you're going to need a lot of man-supplies. With the ePad Femme in your house, you can simply shout upstairs to your woman and demand she start a list. Chips. Dip. Klondike Bars. Whatever you need. She won't forget a single item for her king. And while she does all the shopping -- her very favorite hobby -- you can do far more important things like pass gas and watch fistfights on World Star Hip Hop. On your iPad. Holla! Yes, Eurostar Group literally thought of everything when it comes to the ePad Femme. Sure, they made a few assumptions about what women want, but where they skipped out on any actual science and dignity, they've passed the savings on to you. And you know what else?

"(CNN) -- Facebook is rolling out a fresh design for its central page, the News Feed, at an event Thursday. The main column that cuts down the center of the Facebook home page currently shows a hodgepodge of updates, photos, links and likes from friends, companies, organizations and any other pages you follow. The feed is the heart of Facebook, where many members spend the majority of their time reading, liking and clicking. The invitation from Facebook for Thursday's 1 p.m. ET event is vague, simply beckoning, ""Come see a new look for News Feed."" But there have been some clues about what that new look might entail. Josh Constine at TechCrunch reports that the main news feed will be broken into categories, with content such as music information and photos (including Instagram shots) separated off into dedicated feeds. In January, CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the News Feed as one of the three pillars of Facebook, along with Timeline and the new Graph Search feature, which is still in beta. The largely ad-supported free service likely will update ads and other graphics elements. Facebook users don't always take well to change. Much of the venom is reserved for policy changes, such as confusing updates to privacy settings, but the tweaks to the physical look of the site also generate a lot of feedback. When Facebook rolled out its Timeline feature in 2011, some members balked at the radically different look and even started petitions asking that the new profile pages be made optional. In 2008, the company debuted a major redesign dubbed the ""new Facebook,"" and in 2009 overhauled users' homepages. People were vocal about their issues with those updates, but eventually things quieted down and Facebook went on its merry way, eventually growing its worldwide user base to more than 1 billion profiles. We'll report live on the updates from Facebook headquarters Thursday. Until then, we'd love to hear what you'd like to see changed in your News Feed, or what beloved features you don't want touched. Here are a few suggestions from @CNNTech's Twitter followers: . .","Facebook is unveiling a redesigned News Feed at an event Thursday morning .

It hasn't been radically updated since 2009 ."
"(CNN) -- Facebook wants to cut clutter. The social media site, which has more than 1 billion users, on Thursday announced a newly redesigned news feed that blows up photos and visual content, and adds categories that focus on specific types of content. The Web version of the social network now looks much more like the mobile apps, which are also getting a revamping. Facebook announced the changes during a media event at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California. The new Web version will roll out slowly to users starting Thursday, and updated iOS and Android apps will be available in the coming weeks. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg compared the revamped feed to a local newspaper and the new channels to the traditional sections, such as sports and business, you'd find there. ""I think that there's this important and social place in this world for this customized newspaper,"" Zuckerberg said. He didn't note the irony of comparing Facebook to an industry that his site and others are marginalizing. The news feed is the first, and sometimes only, page people see when they log on to the Facebook website or fire up a Facebook mobile app. The nerve center of the Facebook experience, the news feed fills the middle of this home screen with updates, photos, articles and other content and activity from your friends, such as likes and app updates. Interspersed among that somewhat-chronological content are posts from pages you follow and targeted ads. The main page, which Facebook is calling the ""front page"" to go with its newspaper metaphor, is adding categories so people can look at a more narrow feed of specific types of content as an alternative to the all-in-one view. There are views for all friends, most recent, close friends, music, photos, games and following. Photos will show every single image your friends post as well as the photos posted by the pages you follow, including anything shared to Facebook from Instagram. The music channel will show a combination of nearby concerts, feeds from musicians you follow and the songs friends are listing to with third-party apps such as Spotify. The channels will appear on the mobile apps and Web versions of Facebook. ""Everyone's going to start on the front page like they do today. This just gives people more power to dig into the topics they care about,"" Zuckerberg said. The individual elements that populate the news feed have been redesigned to fill the page better, the company maintains. Text is taking a back seat to visual content, which now makes up almost 30% of the content in the news feed, according to Zuckerberg. Photos, videos and albums are bigger. Shared articles show a bigger image and larger summary along with a logo for the publisher. Content in the feed about individuals and pages will show a little slice of their timeline, including their cover photo and a button to add them as a friend or to like the page. Maps and posts for third-party apps such as Pinterest have also been cleaned up. Previously, the news feed occupied less than 40% of the real estate on the Facebook home page, according to Julie Zhuo, Facebook's director of design. To cut down on clutter and give the feed more room to breathe, navigation elements on the left have been slimmed down to a narrow black column of icons, similar to the mobile interface. One thing that's not changing is the algorithm that decides what posts are displayed in a feed, which has received some criticism. Zuckerberg defended the practice of not showing a full and complete chronological feed of all content, saying people benefit from more important content, such as major life events, being given a more prominent place in their feeds. The filters might be great for users, but they could have a negative effect on companies that have sunk money into promoting their pages and gathering fans, said one analyst. Those fans can switch to a more narrow feed of just their friends (or music content or photos) that doesn't include brand pages, potentially making it more difficult for companies to reach their followers. ""It's going to continue to erode the value of companies having Facebook pages and fans,"" said Forrester analyst Nate Elliott. ""Facebook is walking a really fine line, they're not providing enough value."" Ads will still be featured on the friends-only feeds, so companies and brands that want to reach people who switch to those views can by buying advertising from Facebook. Elliot says this could be interpreted as a ""bait and switch"" by marketers. Ads -- which are included in the redesign -- are Facebook's primary source of income. The company made $4.2 billion off advertising in 2012, which accounted for 82% of the social network's total revenue, according to Engadget. Most of that ad money comes from the Web version of Facebook, and 23% was from ads on mobile devices. The company may get money from advertisers, but it needs to keep the users who click on those ads engaged, active and happy on the network.","Facebook has redesigned the news feed to fill more of the main page .

"(CNN) -- Do a quick search on Facebook, and you're sure to find job talk. A friend who got laid off. A family member turned down for a promotion. Or an old high-school pal celebrating their dream job. On Facebook, employment status is just one more thing people feel free to share openly, not just with those they're closest to. While sharing a job loss or termination may make some cringe, Facebook data scientists say there might actually be some advantages to it. Highlights of a Facebook study, ""Facebook use by job-seekers,"" were posted on the site's data science blog on Thursday. The study tracked several thousand people over three months with monthly check-ins. Of the 3,000 surveyed, 169 were unemployed at some point during the study. Authors Moira Burke and Robert Kraut intended to measure stress levels and support from close friends and family on Facebook during major life events. Burke is a data scientist at Facebook and Kraut is with the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. To determine how connected people were, Facebook was given permission to track participants' time spent on the social network and some of their actions, but not the content of their actions. For example, they tracked whether participants left comments on their friend's photos, but not what was said. In short, everyone who engaged directly, and a slightly more than average amount, with close family and friends experienced more support and were more motivated. They were also less stressed and were generally able to expand their networks. The study also found that people who regularly engaged on Facebook found jobs much faster than those who didn't, although researchers said they did not have enough information to know where they found out about these jobs or if anyone in their networks played a direct role. But the study also found that for a small subset of job seekers, stress levels increased when close friends or family members would repeatedly ask, ""So how's the job search going?"" Stress also increased when participants received unwanted advice or pushed the job seeker to ""try harder."" ""I feel worse about my job when using Facebook,"" one participant wrote. ""I find it really hard to connect with people who care about me/my life. I get a lot of pity comments on Facebook."" Although social networks can be ideal places for support during a crisis, participants found there are limits to online compassion. One study participant said she felt worse during her unemployment, especially when reading News Feed updates about celebrations. ""No one really shares sad or depressing stuff,"" the study quotes the participant as saying. ""They must have some concerns but most of my contacts act as if they do not. So in comparison, I feel worse."" There's a lot of debate about whether the Internet is ""good"" or ""bad"" for us; this study shows that the effects really depend on whom you're talking to and what's happening in your life,"" said Burke in an email. ""In this way, the online world is much like the offline. For the job-seekers out there, recognize that this is a stressful period, but you're not alone and your close friends may be able to help.""","Facebook surveyed 3,000 people about major life events .

"(CNN) -- Assuming Pope Benedict XVI steps down as planned at the end of February, his tenure on Twitter will have been fleeting. The pope has been active on the social-media platform for only two months. During that time he has sent just 34 tweets -- 33 if you don't count one that corrected a typo in a previous message. The spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Catholics stunned the world Monday with the news that he will resign February 28 ""because of advanced age."" Most of the pope's messages to his 1.5 million followers have promoted Catholic doctrine and teachings, although he has also occasionally commented on current events, condemning violence in Nigeria and Syria. One tweet asked followers for suggestions on how to be more prayerful when ""we are so busy with the demands of work, families and the world?"" The first Catholic pope to use Twitter, he tweets under the handle @Pontifex -- meaning ""bridge builder"" in Latin. All his messages have been retweeted by thousands of followers, although others have used Twitter to criticize the Catholic Church over sexual abuse by priests, its stance on gay marriage and other issues. Here are Pope Benedict XVI's five most popular Twitter messages, as ranked by the number of retweets: . .","The pope has been active on Twitter only since December 12 .

"(CNN) -- For a few minutes Thursday evening, Facebook was redirecting users visiting dozens of websites -- including Mashable and CNN -- to cryptic error pages. The reaction online was pretty much what you'd expect, with -- as The Next Web noted -- hashtags like ""Facebookmageddon"" and ""Facebocalypse"" common amongst Twitter users. So what happened, exactly? There was an issue with the Facebook Connect API that caused users on sites that use that API to redirect users to a Facebook error page. For example, if you were visiting Mashable and logged into our site using your Facebook account (and you were also signed into Facebook), you were automatically redirected to a Facebook error page. Exiting the page or attempting to re-access the original site would lead to another. Sites such as The Huffington Post, Kayak, Hulu, The Daily Dot, Pinterest and hundreds of others were all impacted. The bug lasted less than 10 minutes. In a statement, Facebook told Mashable: ""For a short period of time, there was a bug that redirected people logging in with Facebook from third party sites. The issue was quickly resolved and Login with Facebook is now working as usual."" The bug may have been brief, but it has highlighted just how many important websites use Facebook Connect for user authentication. Over the span of just a few years, Facebook logins have become so pervasive that they are nearly second nature. It also shows that if Facebook has an issue, it can affect more than just its site -- it can also impact the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of sites that integrate with Facebook's APIs. What's interesting is that a user didn't even need to be performing the action for the error -- and hijacking -- to occur. Instead, simply being logged into both places (and having the accounts linked) was enough to force users off of a third-party website and onto Facebook's error page. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in nearly 600 years, a reigning pope has resigned. And in what might also be a landmark event, Twitter was not flooded with jokes or parody accounts when the announcement was made two weeks ago. On February 11 @davewiner tweeted, ""Perfect storm for Pope jokes. Since he's not dead no one can complain 'You're being insensitive.'"" But in the days that followed, not much surfaced. It was so odd that tweets like this were more common: ""Did I miss the memo about no Pope jokes?"" tweeted @NouveauBroke. Although a parody account, @RetiredPopeXVI, did appear, it only has 577 followers and sent out a paltry five tweets. That all changed on Thursday when Pope Benedict XVI slipped off his red loafers and officially became pope emeritus. Curiously, the Vatican also deleted all 39 of his tweets from the official @pontifex Twitter account. (They are archived here.) And slowly, the jokes began to surface. Here are a handful we found humorous. Mobile users: Click here to see the Storify . .","Pope officially retires Thursday as Vatican deletes his Twitter history .

"(CNN) -- The newest version of Windows is getting some changes. Among them? A little dose of old Windows. Microsoft is making adjustments to its Windows 8 operating system, beginning with the resurrection of the Start button. The changes, announced today at the Microsoft Build developer conference in San Francisco, address some of the complaints leveled at the hybrid tablet and PC operating system that surfaced when it was released late last year. The company also unveiled improvements to its Bing search engine, built-in support for 3-D printers, an updated Xbox Music app, and new tools for developers making WIndows 8 applications. ""The PC, the Windows device of today, doesn't look a lot like the PC of 10 years ago or of 15 years ago,"" said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a keynote address kicking off the conference. Ballmer outlined some of the new changes to Windows 8.1, which he described as a ""refined blend."" When the radically different, touchscreen-optimized system came out eight months ago, many Windows users were upset about radical departure from the typical Windows interface, especially the lack of a Start button. The button is back, and now it leads to a list of all your applications. The company announced a few new applications for Windows 8, including an official Facebook app, Flipboard and NFL Fantasy football. Though there was a brief preview of a new version of PowerPoint for WIndows 8, the next version of the Microsoft Office suite won't be released until 2014. The speedy Windows 8 update is part of Microsoft's new approach to releasing fixes and adding features to products. The software and hardware company is now focused on a ""rapid release"" cycle, which will let it roll out changes to software in a matter of months instead of years. It has already released a number of changes to Windows 8, but this version is the biggest overhaul so far. A free preview version of the Windows 8.1 update for developers is available to anyone interested in installing it. The version for regular consumers will come out later this year. Other changes include the ability to boot directly into the desktop, more flexibility with the tiles on the Start screen, support for high-resolution displays, and greater Bing integration. ""Search is not just a list of links, it's things you can do,"" said Julie Larson-Green, corporate vice president of Windows, who demonstrated some new Bing features. Developers can now tap into Bing, which has opened up access to its 3-D maps, entities and knowledge database, and natural user interfaces. The big Xbox Music update is a radio feature that builds a station for listeners based on a song, much like Pandora. As part of a feature coming later this year, people will be able to automatically create Xbox Music playlists based on Web pages, like a Pitchfork list of top songs of the year. Microsoft also highlighted a few of the of the 3,000 Windows 8 certified tablets, PCs and hybrids, including an 18-inch Dell tablet. It highlighted more touchscreen devices, ""workhorse"" 2-in-1 tablets and smaller tablets. ""We're going to see a proliferation of Windows 8 small tablet devices over the next few months,"" said Ballmer. Microsoft's own entry in to the hardware world wasn't forgotten. After some scripted banter about how much they loved their own Surface tablets, presenters announced that developers attending the conference would all receive free Surface Pros. Attendees will also get Acer Iconia W3 tablets.","Microsoft previewed the latest changes to its Windows 8.1 operating system .

"(CNN) -- Much of the focus this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video game industry's big annual trade show, will be on Microsoft and Sony, which both have new game consoles coming in time for the holiday shopping season. But the spotlight inside the Los Angeles Convention Center won't be so much on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 as what's really important: the games themselves. With these two next-generation consoles on the near horizon, game developers are in a transitional period between the new devices and the ones that people enjoy in their homes right now. Many of the titles featured during E3 may be playable immediately, with a next-gen option down the road. Sony is bringing more than 40 games for its PS3 and handheld PSVita as well as the forthcoming PS4. ""Beyond: Two Souls,"" ""Gran Turismo 6"" and ""Killzone: Shadow Fall"" are just a few of the much-anticipated titles it'll be featuring. And Bungie, creators of the popular ""Halo"" franchise, will show gameplay from ""Destiny,"" a new game. ""People want to see games, and we are hopefully going to bring a game that people will love,"" said Eric Osborne, senior writer for ""Destiny"" and the head of community for Bungie, the game's developer. ""We've worked really hard, and bleary eyes are starting to give way to smiles. It's just really exciting for us. You always wonder what people are going to say."" Microsoft purposefully split its Xbox One announcement into two parts so it could focus exclusively on games during E3 -- specifically, the 15 exclusive franchises it has promised for the first year of Xbox One. The company announced Monday that the Xbox One will cost $499 and go on sale in 21 countries in November. While it might appear Nintendo is scaling down its E3 efforts by not holding a showcase event, the game company actually has more events planned than usual. It also is appealing directly to consumers by focusing specifically on its software lineup and letting them play new game demos at select Best Buy stores in North America. Ubisoft is another publisher with one foot in the present and one in the future. It will be showing off more of ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag,"" a title due out in October for all current consoles (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii). The company will also provide a little taste of its next-gen offering, ""Watch Dogs,"" at E3. Yannis Mallat, CEO of Ubisoft Montreal Studio, said his company didn't wait around for details on the new consoles but began development on its game years ago with an eye to what could be. Mallat said he believes all that advance planning is going to pay off and people will see the results during the show. Other companies are also looking forward to getting their titles on the E3 global stage. And it wouldn't feel like a complete E3 without a new ""Call of Duty"" or ""Battlefield"" game. ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" (Infinity Ward/Activision), the 10th in the blockbuster franchise, will be playable on current and future consoles. ""Battlefield 4"" (DICE/Electronic Arts) will give gamers a first look at its multiplayer mode at E3. Gamers also are looking forward to getting their hands on ""Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain"" (Konami), ""Duck Tales: Remastered"" (Capcom), ""Batman: Arkham Origins"" (Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment) and the latest funky installment from ""Saints Row 4"" (Volition/Deep Silver). Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing for Bethesda Softworks, said that his company and others must strike a balance between serving their current fan base (with ""The Elder Scrolls Online"") and developing games such as ""Wolfenstein: The New Order"" for future consoles. ""We're still developing games for what is essentially a moving target,"" Hines said. ""I think it is going to be a very fun E3 because it is going to be all about the games and very little talk about some of the other stuff."" Disney also will be making a splash at E3 with ""Disney Infinity,"" a new entry into the toy figurine/video game genre made popular by the ""Skylanders"" franchise. Gamers will be able to play with their favorite Disney and Pixar characters in a video game as well as the toy figurines. Activision isn't letting Disney walk all over its turf though. Its ""Skylanders SWAP Force"" will be on display, offering new innovation for the genre. In this game, interchangeable halves of characters will challenge players' creativity while effectively doubling the number of characters you can play in the game. E3's trade-show floor opens at noon PT Tuesday and runs through Thursday. It was first held in 1995 and is traditionally a media-only event, although many fans find ways to get in.","Electronic Entertainment Expo is the year's premier video game conference and trade show .

"(CNN) -- Despite the fact that basic math and science cause me to bleed from my ears, I once confidently oversaw the design and construction of a fully functional nuclear power plant that provided safe energy to thousands of people. Hell, I even placed it next to a playground. And for decades it never once experienced so much as the slightest hint of disaster. Until the monster came. ""Sir, you better take a look at this."" ""Aww, jeez."" Yes, that was a rather dark day in the thriving metropolis of Jarrett-Is-Awesome-Ville. So, in response, as mayor, I quickly approved funding for a new football stadium. Which didn't seem to help with disaster management. ""Sir, the people would like a word with you."" Of course, I was never really mayor of a town -- I don't wear pants nearly often enough to hold down that kind of job -- but I did enthusiastically play one on the classic city-building simulator, ""SimCity."" So, you can only imagine the excitement I felt recently when the Internet suddenly starting buzzing about the upcoming release of a brand new version of the only video game I ever loved. And as more and more mentions of it started popping up all over the Web, one thing became perfectly clear: I wasn't alone in my undying passion for building fake roads. That said, it's been many years and several epic steps in computer technology since I've actually played the game (it debuted in 1989). However, on March 5, those of us who have long fancied ourselves as urban planners will get a completely modern version of ""SimCity"" to once again assist us in the gleeful neglect of our jobs, family, and personal hygiene. Which, when you think about it, is fairly amazing. ""Sim City"" shouldn't be fun. Not even a little bit. Essentially, it's local governance. And from someone who just went through the process of obtaining a real-life building variance, I can assure you that City Hall isn't exactly the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese. And it probably has more traces of feces. Yet, somehow, laying out your very own town from scratch, managing its budget, and occasionally destroying the whole community with monsters and earthquakes is unquestionably appealing. The true beauty of ""SimCity"" is that for every disgruntled person who ever said, ""This whole place is run by idiots,"" the game offers a way for you to prove to the world -- or at least, maybe, to your cat -- that you can do better. And, if nothing else, you can definitely take out all your day-to-day frustrations by bulldozing a train station. You know, without actually bulldozing a train station. Which, after a full week of intense investigative journalism, I can now confirm is ""illegal."" So, the other day, as a remarkably distinguished member of the international media, I had the opportunity to play a pre-release trial version of the new ""SimCity,"" thus making it a five-star weekend. Whatever. You have your major accomplishments in life. I have mine. Unfortunately, however, on that beautiful and momentous Saturday I actually had to borrow my friend's PC laptop to do so -- which made me feel both confused and dirty. Or at least more so than normal. Sadly, the Mac version of the game won't be available until later in the spring. So, the cool kids will just have to wait. Which is going to be tough. Seriously, if I was a grizzly bear I'd probably just hibernate until late April, wake up, stretch, murder a bunch of salmon, and then immediately download the new ""SimCity."" And then murder more salmon. Because I'm a grizzly bear. Who owns a MacBook Pro. So, here's what I can tell you: The graphics are really pretty. And it's very thorough. Very. I can't confirm this, but it's entirely possible that you have to choose interior wallpaper for the local VD clinic. Also known as the future home of The Purell Center. What can I say? I like to name things in my pretend community. Our future Major League Soccer team will play in the Bill and Melinda Gates Terror Dome! Aside from the updated, fancy graphics and insane attention to detail, the other notable highlight of this new version of the game is the option for multiplayer and multicity. You can actually manage up to 16 towns at once and compete against other people. Though, personally, I prefer to make ""SimCity"" a simple, private affair. It's much easier to willfully launch a tornado on the trailer park when you don't have to answer to anyone. Except The Sims. Your citizens. Who I imagine will be super enthusiastic to live in my temporary disaster housing, Joy Acres. Our motto: ""We want you to be happy!"" And why shouldn't they be? They'll have a great view of the nuclear power plant. ""Sir, the people would like a word with you.""","Jarrett Bellini checks out a trial version of the updated ""SimCity"" video game .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- ""North Korean social media."" In the famously restrictive country, where people have almost no Internet contact with the outside world, it sounds like an oxymoron. But on February 25, Jean H. Lee of the Associated Press became perhaps the first person to send a mobile tweet from North Korea when she posted a message on the country's new 3G wireless network, available only to foreigners. ""Hello world from comms center in â€ª#Pyongyangâ€¬,"" she wrote. Lee has been active from North Korea on Instagram as well, posting snapshots of street scenes, food and government propaganda posters. As the AP's bureau chief for both South and North Korea, Lee is the only American news reporter granted regular access to the secretive nation, which she has visited more than 20 times. She offered a rare glimpse of digital life beyond the DMZ -- the strip of land separating North Korea from its more open rival to the south -- during an onstage chat here Saturday at the South by Southwest Interactive festival. At a time when North Korea is responding to tougher sanctions from the U.N. Security Council with angry rhetoric and threats, Lee described a country with two parallel digital worlds -- one for residents and another for foreign visitors. While foreigners now have access to fast broadband Internet, with no firewall blocking certain sites, North Koreans can only use a state-controlled intranet service. The country lags behind much of the world when it comes to digital adoption, but there are signs that North Korea is trying to catch up, Lee said. The new Koryolink 3G network -- jointly owned by the North Korean government and an Egyptian company -- that launched last month marks a shift in policy for Kim Jong Un's regime, which also has recently begun to allow foreigners to bring their cellphones into the country. ""We are starting to see more openness,"" she said. ""We're talking baby steps. They're a long way from being a free and open society."" When Lee first visited Pyongyang in 2008, security officers confiscated her iPhone at the airport, she said. ""I freaked out,"" she said. ""I tried to hide it in my pocket."" Lee is joined in her social media updates from Pyongyang by AP photographer David Guttenfelder, who posts images often to his 71,000 Instagram followers. His photos offer a fascinating peek at North Korean life and culture: Teens skating on a roller track, a woman braving a snowstorm, photos of his in-flight meal on Air Koryo, North Korea's airline. Lee said that North Korea, a country of about 25 million people, has only about 1 million cellphones, although the devices are gaining in popularity. North Koreans can't access Facebook or Twitter, although they have primitive social networks -- sort of like online bulletin boards -- where users share thoughts about innocuous topics such as pop music, she said. Everything North Koreans do online is tied to their identity, Lee said, so it's easy for the government to monitor users' intranet behavior. Lee said she has spent a little time on the country's limited web but hasn't seen any evidence of people using underground networks to talk more freely. ""I would like to (see that). But it would be very dangerous, I imagine,"" she said. ""They have a culture of fear in North Korea that still exists. That's something that isn't going to change right away."" When former NBA star Dennis Rodman made a bizarre visit to Pyongyang last month, Lee said she encouraged the unlikely ambassador to take advantage of the nation's new 3G cellular network. He took her advice, later tweeting, ""I come in peace. I love the people of North Korea!"" Lee said the North Korean government has never tried to censor what she reports. But she is mindful that authorities may be monitoring her Web use. ""In any situation where I'm accessing their broadband, they can probably see everything I'm doing,"" she said.","Jean H.

"(CNN) -- I drive a Saturn. It's a 4-cylinder, the seats are cloth, and the window sills are permanently caked with dog drool. Which always works out rather well for the guys at the car wash who regularly enjoy the financial benefits of my shame. ""Sir, did something explode?"" ""Here, just take all my money."" But this less-than-spectacular, mid-sized SUV certainly gets the job done. So long as the job doesn't call for impressing exotic, beautiful women. For that I rely on my bald head and lush, ginger beard. All this is to say that I'm a simple man, and at the end of the day my car just needs to do one thing: Get me from Point A to Point B. And preferably without the accelerator getting dangerously stuck at 125 mph on the highway. Because that's exactly what happened to some poor guy in France who recently had the craziest ride of his life. It was a popular trending story online that quickly made its way across the Atlantic, detailing how Frank Lecerf casually drove off from his home in Pont-de-Metz for a weekly routine trip to the supermarket. Then, suddenly, the speed control on his Renault Laguna -- which was specially modified for a disabled driver -- jammed at 60 mph. This, of course, being in Europe, was actually displayed on his dash in kilometers. However, my brain can't handle such a thing, as it requires both math and a basic understanding of the number 10. Nevertheless, in a panic, the terrified 36-year-old attempted to use the brakes. But the more he tried to stop the vehicle, the faster it went, eventually topping out at 125 mph. That is a truly sensational speed that I could never expect out of my own stupid car unless it somehow managed to free-fall from the International Space Station. But Lecerf was evidently going that fast, completely out of control, with no way to stop. And before you rattle off your brilliant solutions, let's at least give him the benefit of the doubt that he unsuccessfully attempted to turn off the ignition and/or drop it into neutral. Yet, somehow, despite miraculously keeping control of his car, Lecerf also managed to multitask and make an emergency call from his mobile phone. ""So, uh, what are you wearing?"" Soon, several police cruisers caught up to the runaway car to escort it through traffic, and later assist with three toll plazas where they called ahead to have the gates raised. All things considered, it must have at least been nice to be king for a day. Emergency services even patched him through to an expert engineer at Renault who tried to help. ""Right. Have you tried using the brakes?"" ""Go to hell."" Incredibly, their only hope was for Lecerf to eventually run out of gas. And that's where this story gets truly amazing. Because it took a while. A long while. About 125 miles and one country later, just over the French border into Belgium, his car finally sputtered dry and crashed into a ditch. Which actually seems like a rather unnecessary ending after you've already managed to safely avoid tragedy while traversing the entire northern coast of France. ""Welp, might as well dump this thing into a hole."" Lecerf later recounted the seemingly endless horror to the Le Courrier Picard newspaper, describing his emotions during the harrowing journey. ""My life flashed before me,"" he said. ""I just wanted it to stop."" And so it did. Amazingly without any casualties. Though the UK's Guardian newspaper reports that while Lecerf wasn't injured, he did suffer two epileptic seizures. Not that we're keeping score, but surely that ought to count. Regardless, everything more or less worked out in the end, and at least he never went flying off a cliff. For Lecerf adhered to the most basic rule of driving: The tires are the things on your car that make contact with the road. And sometimes, just for fun ... with a ditch in Belgium.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at trending topics online .

"(CNN) -- A vial purportedly containing dried blood from former President Ronald Reagan after a 1981 assassination attempt will not be auctioned online, but donated to Reagan's presidential foundation, officials said Thursday. The online sale by PFC Auctions, based on the island of Guernsey, a British dependency, drew national headlines -- and a threat of legal action from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. The foundation's executive director, John Heubusch, called it ""a craven act."" ""We are very pleased with this outcome and wish to thank the consignor and PFC auctions for their assistance in this matter,"" Heubusch said in a statement Thursday. And the seller, who wishes to remain anonymous, said in a statement released by the auction house they ""would personally be delighted to see this important artifact put on public display by the foundation."" Bidding for the vial had topped $30,000 as of Thursday, PFC Auctions said. On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley fired six shots at Reagan as the president left the Washington Hilton after delivering a speech. Reagan was rushed to George Washington University Hospital for emergency surgery. ""Dried blood residue from President Reagan ... can be seen clearly in the vial with a quarter-inch ring of blood residue at the end of the inserted rubber stopper,"" the listing says. In a letter of provenance included in the sale, the writer said it had been in their family's possession since the day of the assassination attempt, according to the auction listing. ""Back in the '70s and '80s, my mother worked for Bio Science Laboratories in Columbia, Maryland,"" the letter says. The lab was contracted with George Washington University Hospital to handle blood testing, and did Reagan's blood work and testing. ""The test tube and the lab slip that I have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on 03/30/1981,"" according to the letter. ""The testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother's desk."" The letter writer said their mother asked the lab director if she could keep the paperwork and test tube, and was allowed to do so. The person said their mother and father have both since died. But ""what has not been widely reported is that the auction consignor purchased the item at a public auction in the USA in February 2012 for $3,550,"" PFC Auctions said Thursday. The seller said the letter of provenance was included when they bought the item. ""I am a serious collector of presidential memorabilia, and have donated to museums before, and thought from the provenance supplied at the auction where I purchased that the Reagan Foundation had no interest in the item,"" the person -- who PFC Auctions said wishes to remain anonymous -- said in the statement. The letter of provenance, according to the auction listing, said the writer had contacted the Reagan National Library and spoke to its director, asking if the library would like to purchase the vial. The director said the library would accept the vial as a donation, the seller said, but the director also wanted to check with legal counsel, the National Archives and the FBI, among others. ""He called back in 25 minutes and said that everything was OK,"" the letter said. ""The National Archives was not interested in what I had, nor was the Secret Service, the FBI and other agencies. Since 30 years had passed by, he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that I was free to do ... whatever I wanted with it."" The writer said he did not want to return the vial to Reagan's family, ""since I had served under Pres. Reagan when he was my Commander in Chief when I was in the Army from '87-'91 and that I was a real fan of Reaganomics and felt that Pres. Reagan himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it."" The publicity generated by the sale on PFC Auctions ""has clearly highlighted the importance of this historical artifact and I would personally be delighted to see this important artifact put on public display by the foundation,"" the recent seller said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A forensic psychologist endorsed a proposal to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. more freedom away from his mental hospital, giving his opinion that Hinckley ""would not pose a significant risk."" Paul Montalbano's testimony in federal court on Tuesday came on the 11th day of proceedings to determine whether Hinckley can spend more time visiting his mother in Virginia and might eventually be released as a permanent outpatient. Montalbano, an expert on risk assessments, is one of a number of mental health professionals who has been following Hinckley's case for more than a decade. He was called by Hinckley's legal team to support the view Hinckley is ready for more privileges and would not be a danger to himself or others. Hinckley, 56, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Thomas Delahanty. Hinckley currently is allowed to spend 10 days a month at the Williamsburg, Virginia, home of his 86-year-old widowed mother. Montalbano said he supports St. Elizabeths Hospital's plan to first give Hinckley two visits of 17 days and then six stays of 24 days. After that St. Elizabeths wants the authority to decide whether Hinckley can be placed on ""convalescent leave"" to live in Williamsburg. Government prosecutors oppose the plan. During court proceedings, mental health professionals have presented varied views about the man who tried to kill Ronald Reagan in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster. Hinckley's experts say his most serious mental diseases are in remission, that he's made progress and can make even more if he's allowed more time outside his mental hospital. Witnesses for the government say Hinckley is isolated and has made no friends during his trips to Virginia. They say he can be deceptive and has problematic relationships with women, most of whom he has met at St. Elizabeths. Hinckley has not testified. His voice has occasionally been heard by court spectators when he enters the court and says ""good morning"" to his lawyers and the judge. He sits quietly listening to experts. The hearing resumes on Wednesday and could conclude this week. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman is expected to take some time to review all the evidence before issuing a ruling on the hospital's proposal.","Testimony in 11th day in hearing on giving John Hinckley more freedoms .

"Washington (CNN) -- A lawyer for presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. made an impassioned plea to a federal judge Thursday to allow Hinckley longer visits to his elderly mother's home in Virginia. ""We submit that you can't afford to go slow,"" Barry Levine said. ""Mrs. Hinckley, who is now healthy, cannot remain healthy forever."" The lawyer said Hinckley needs to spend more time with his 86-year-old mother, Jo Ann, while she's still able to help him integrate into her community in Williamsburg, Virginia. Levine rejected concerns by government mental health experts that John Hinckley is so isolated he has never made any friends in Williamsburg while there during releases, that he is deceptive and that he has problematic romantic relationships with women. ""Not once during any one of these releases has Mr. Hinckley done anything dangerous or violent. Not once,"" Levine said at the conclusion of a multiple-day court hearing on his client's future. ""Mr. Hinckley is entitled as a matter of constitutional law to be placed in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety."" Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty. For three decades Hinckley has been a patient at St. Elizabeths, a mental hospital in the District of Columbia. Currently, Hinckley is allowed 10-day visits once a month to his widowed mother's home. His hospital has proposed increasing that to two visits of 17 days followed by six visits of 24 days. After that, St. Elizabeths would like the authority to decide whether Hinckley could be released on ""convalescent leave,"" which would make him a permanent outpatient. The government opposes the plan. Prosecutor Nihar Mohanty said the hospital and Hinckley's legal team have ""not met the burden"" to prove Hinckley won't be a danger to himself or others if he has more freedom. The government wants to keep the visits limited to 10 days at least until there is a more specific plan in place for Hinckley to attend outpatient group, art and music therapy sessions through a Williamsburg mental health provider. Hinckley already sees a psychiatrist and a case manager during his trips. One of the biggest controversies raised during 13 days of hearings was that Hinckley did not always follow hospital-approved itineraries for how he would spend three hours of unaccompanied time allotted to him twice during each visit. Witnesses testified that in July and September of 2011 Hinckley skipped movies he was permitted to attend and then lied about it. In addition, Secret Service agents who were watching Hinckley testified that in July and October last year, Hinckley went to bookstores and looked at shelves of history books, some of which dealt with presidential assassinations. The St. Elizabeths proposal to expand Hinckley's freedoms would give him more hours of free time and stop requiring that he adhere to itineraries. The government concedes Hinckley's condition has improved through the years, but does not want him to have unsupervised outings at this time. Mohanty said if the judge decides to allow more free time without specific itineraries, the government would want him to wear an ankle monitor. Hinckley does carry a cell phone equipped with GPS, but a subpoena would be needed to access his phone records. The government maintains the GPS-equipped phone is not a feasible way to keep track of Hinckley in real time anyway. Testimony during the proceedings revealed the Secret Service watches Hinckley from time to time while he is in Williamsburg. But lawyers said that from August of 2009 until March of 2011, agents were not doing surveillance while he was going to restaurants, stores, and other activities. Levine bitterly complained during his closing argument about psychiatrists Raymond Patterson and Robert Phillips, who testified as government witnesses. He said their risk assessments on Hinckley were based on ""little more than supercilious swagger."" Their concerns about Hinckley were the same ones they had raised previously through the years, yet Hinckley had never done anything dangerous, Levine said. Patterson and Phillips voiced concerns about the hospital's proposal to greatly increase Hinckley's freedom. Patterson, the former director of forensic psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, told the court he opposes allowing any expansion of Hinckley's trips beyond 17 days and said the unaccompanied time should end. Patterson said he interviewed Hinckley and specifically asked him about lying about going to the movies. He testified Hinckley said the doctor was ""nitpicking."" Patterson and Phillips both said Hinckley should have kept to his itineraries to prove he could be trusted. The doctors also raised concerns about Hinckley's romantic relationships with a series of women he met at St. Elizabeths. Here again Hinckley's truthfulness was called into question with testimony that Hinckley had given different stories to different people about whether he had been engaged to one woman identified only as Miss CB. It was Hinckley's delusional relationship with actress Jodie Foster that motivated him to shoot President Reagan. Hinckley sat quietly during the multiple days of testimony, but never testified. Levine would not discuss his client's views about the hearing but he described him as ""resilient."" Levine said his client had been subjected to ""an unfortunate volley of attacks"" during the course of the court proceedings. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman told lawyers for both sides not to expect his ruling before April or May. Lawyers said it would not be surprising if Friedman took even more time to weigh all the evidence before making his decision. In December, Friedman indicated he was uncomfortable with the proposal for St. Elizabeths to ultimately decide if Hinckley could become a permanent outpatient. Instead, the judge said, that authority should rest with him.","""You can't afford to go slow,"" John Hinckley's attorney tells the judge .

"(CNN) -- Ben Vu's parents and older brother fled South Vietnam by boat in 1975 -- in the chaotic and violent final days before Saigon fell to communist forces from the north. The family emigrated to a small town in Nebraska, where Ben was born, but the story of how the family escaped 38 years ago this month became part of the family lore -- real-life bedtime stories of daring and danger young Ben never tired of hearing. Three decades later, Ben started his own company, SkyVu (pronounced sky-voo) Entertainment, and used these stories as his inspiration for a mobile game called ""Battle Bears."" ""The Battle Bears is a sci-fi journey from one end of futuristic America to the other end,"" Vu said. ""It kind of parallels the story my family tells of moving from Vietnam to America, that treacherous journey. They've always told me that story throughout childhood. It stuck with me."" Since it launched in 2009, mobile gamers have downloaded ""Battle Bears"" more than 24 million times. SkyVu has grown from three employees to 35 and counting. Two ""Battle Bears"" game soundtrack albums sell on iTunes, and the Omaha company is now working on a Web series with Google. Vu's goal is to create an entertainment empire, starting with the Battle Bears -- cartoon characters compared in the gaming press both to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Angry Birds. At 37, Vu is an unlikely tech entrepreneur. He grew up in Norfolk, Nebraska, far from the tech and entertainment hubs of Silicon Valley and Hollywood. His parents, who left a successful coffee-and-tea business behind in Vietnam, worked as janitors, initially. The family lived in a house not far from Johnny Carson's boyhood home. ""Whenever they did 'Johnny Carson comes home,' I remember that TV crew coming to town. It was the biggest thing ever to happen to Norfolk, I think. That was my first encounter with entertainment,"" Vu said. One of the benefits of his father's job was paper. His father would come home with reams of paper from the hospital where he worked. ""That was some of my fondest memories because we would set the reams of paper on the table at the beginning of the evening, we would roll it out and my brother and I would draw out war scenes and weapons and vehicles until our hands couldn't draw anymore,"" Vu said. Ben's mother eventually became a seamstress and his father earned a college degree in computer science. His older brother, Hoa, joined the Army, rising to the rank of captain before co-founding SkyVu with Ben in 2008. Ben recalls being a lackluster student, but says he could always draw and tell stories. He received a master's degree in animation at CalArts and worked on the Oscar-nominated animated film ""Coraline"" before starting SkyVu in the basement of a rented home in suburban Omaha. ""I decided I could spend all my time toiling away in the film industry trying to make my characters realized, or I could start something on my own and aim for a smaller screen,"" Vu says. He funded SkyVu out of pocket, with help from friends and family, before pitching his idea to Nebraska Angels, a group of local venture capitalists. He received his first outside investment of just under $500,000 -- a sum that's not huge by dotcom startup standards but one that made a huge difference for SkyVu. ""I get my hard work ethic from my dad and from mom and from my older brother, but I also have a bit of creativity and rebelliousness that helps fuel the company,"" said Vu. Ben is SkyVu's CEO. His brother remains on the board of directors, but is not involved in day-to-day activities. In ""Battle Bears,"" the bears roam the galaxy trying to keep it safe from threats in a manner that's both cute and quirky. Chief among their foes are Huggables, pink bears that hug the battle bears to death unless the characters shoot their heads off first -- prompting rainbows to spew from their bodies. ""We have very cute bears and they are in very fantastic, wild situations. So they have to 'MacGuyver' their way out with very unique weapons,"" Vu said. ""And that's part of the beauty of the brands. It's the wackiness, combined with just a little bit of violence for dramatic effect."" Walking among the game developers, the space festooned with posters, drawings and 3-D renderings, Vu becomes animated talking about new characters, new weapons and new games in the works. ""This is very much show business, and we have to continue to grow if we're going to become a strong media company,"" Vu says.","""Battle Bears"" creator says family's journey from Vietnam was his inspiration .

"(CNN) -- Electronic Arts will be the exclusive provider of games based on the Star Wars series, Disney and the game developer announced jointly on Monday. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm last year, it shut down the LucasArts game development division, indicating its preference to license console games rather than develop them in-house. Now, Electronic Arts will be the only publisher creating Star Wars games for a ""core gaming audience,"" according to today's press release. Electronic Arts said that its in-house game teams DICE (Battlefield) and Visceral (Dead Space) will work on Star Wars titles, in addition to BioWare, the team behind EA's existing Star Wars MMO The Old Republic. Meanwhile, Disney will ""retain certain rights to develop new titles within the mobile, social, tablet and online game categories."" My initial take: While this might seem like a great arrangement for Electronic Arts and Disney, I cannot see how taking away the element of competition will be good for the quality of Star Wars games. Individually licensing out Star Wars games to different publishers and developers might have ushered in a variety of creative ideas and directions for the franchise, but locking out anyone that isn't affiliated with Electronic Arts seems like a commitment to the same old, same old.

"(CNN) -- The chirp of a robin, the crack of the bat, the thump of a ball smacking a glove. These are the sounds of spring and the beginning of baseball season. In the video game world, that means another Perfect Game Challenge for players of ""MLB2K13."" In a perfect game, the pitcher doesn't allow a single runner on base via hit, walk or other means. There have only been 23 in the history of Major League Baseball, including three last year by Philip Humber (Chicago White Sox), Matt Cain (San Francisco Giants), and Felix Hernandez (Seattle Mariners). This year's contest is a bit different. Instead of everyone just competing to register the first perfect game, the contest is initially split among the MLB's 30 teams, with the best pitcher on each team winning $25,000.There is no limit on the number of team prizes a player could potentially win. The perfect game scores from all players are tabulated and the top four scores will play head-to-head in a sudden death tournament for a top prize of $250,000. The challenge starts April 1 to coincide with opening day for Major League Baseball. Cy Young award-winner and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price graces the box of this year's game. While Price has never thrown a perfect game (not even in video games, he says), he was honored to be portrayed by 2K Games as its cover boy. He talked with CNN about what the recognition means to him, how tough it is to throw a perfect game, and whom he would take if he played in the challenge. How does it feel to be on the cover? ""It's a thrilling feeling. I turned my Xbox on and my face was on there. It's awesome. I dreamed about being a Major League Baseball player and that was good enough for me. It still is. But being a part of this, it's a dream come true really. I never envisioned myself being on a video game cover. Being in one was cool enough for me. Being on the cover of 'MLB2K13' is really tough to put into words."" How tough is it to throw a perfect game? ""It is easier to throw a no-hitter because you can hit somebody, somebody can make an error, you can walk somebody, anything can happen to ruin it. It is definitely easier to throw a no-hitter than a perfect game. Whenever you talk about a perfect game, there are a lot of things that have to go your way. It just kind of happens. When it does, sometimes you don't really understand what's going on or even know you have a perfect game going."" Whom would you use to throw a perfect game in ""MLB2K13"" (excluding yourself)? ""I would go with Justin Verlander with the type of pitcher he is. He's obviously shown everybody he can do it, the way he pitches. A great pitcher. I'm sure he has a great rating in the game. I would go with Justin. R.A. Dickey, the way he threw the ball last year, absolutely. Toronto is going to be pretty good. Brett Lawrie at third, Jose Reyes at shortstop, they have a very good defense. I would go with R.A. Dickey. That knuckleball is so hard to hit."" Is a perfect game more of a team recognition than a pitcher accomplishment? ""The defense really has to be there to throw a perfect game. It is more than just defense. You have to have a good line on the way that you're pitching. I've heard guys talk about that all the time, the older guys. There will never be another 300-game winner because the strike zone is so much smaller than what it used to be and it is just harder to go out and win games like it used to be. (There are) a lot of things to take into effect when you talk about a perfect game."" If someone wins the Perfect Game Challenge using you as the pitcher, what will that mean to you? ""That would mean a lot. I'm sure I'll give them my own little gift package outside of the money. It probably won't mean as much to them as getting all that money. (laughs) I'll give them something out of my personal collection as appreciation for them using me for the Perfect Game Challenge."" Even if they are a Yankees fan? ""Absolutely! I like all fans. I still am a fan of baseball and fans of baseball.""

"(CNN) -- Two years after his wife of 34 years died in a fire, an Iowa man continues to maintain the blaze was started by a faulty cruise control switch under the hood of her 1996 Ford F-150 pickup -- while it was parked in the garage attached to his home. Ford says a faulty cruise control switch did not start the blaze that engulfed Dolly Mohlis' F-150 truck. Although Ford has denied -- and continues to deny -- the switch started the fire that killed 74-year-old Dolly Mohlis in 2005, the company recently settled a lawsuit brought against it by Earl Mohlis. And last week, it issued a recall of an estimated 3.6 million vehicles -- bringing the total recalled over the past decade to more than 10 million -- every single car and truck built with a similar cruise control switch. Dolly Mohlis woke up smelling smoke in May 2005, Earl Mohlis has told CNN. She woke him to find out the source while she called 911. When he looked in the garage, he said, he saw the truck was in flames. Earl Mohlis said he opened the garage door to try to get the truck out, but the wind -- blowing that night at about 50 mph -- fanned the flames, which spread to the house. The fire department in the Mohlises' rural town could not arrive fast enough. Dolly Mohlis, who suffered from debilitating arthritis, was suddenly trapped inside the home. ""I says to Dolly, 'You got to get out of that house,' "" Earl Mohlis told CNN. ""She come a-running, and she never made it.""  Watch Mohlis describe how the flames trapped his wife » . In 2005, CNN began airing a series of investigative reports on unexplained and sudden fires in Ford cars and trucks. They found that a tiny electrical switch in the cruise control system could lead to the vehicle catching fire, even hours after the car was turned off. Although Ford had begun recalling the parts in some vehicles in 1999, a sweeping recall was not issued until earlier this month. Ford says media reports like those on CNN have sparked fear among Ford owners. The newly recalled vehicles, a Ford spokesman told CNN, do not have ""a higher-than-normal fire incidence."" Asked about the recall, a Ford spokesman told CNN the company was voluntarily announcing the recall because it ""could not be confident about the long-term durability of these switches"" and to address consumer concerns about the potential for fires. CNN has learned, however, that federal investigators were continuing to observe what one safety official said were elevated levels of suspect fires in Ford vehicles that had not been the subject of a recall. Since the cruise control switch was introduced in 1992, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had documented more than 600 blazes. The safety official said investigators with NHTSA were discussing safety concerns with Ford when the company announced the massive recall last week. Neither Mohlis nor Ford released terms of the settlement, but Mohlis told the Des Moines Register he still cries for his wife every day.

"Washington (CNN) -- A plan to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to spend more time away from his government mental hospital and eventually to become a permanent outpatient ""lacks specificity,"" a psychiatrist who has closely followed Hinckley's case for over a decade said Tuesday. Testifying on the 10th day of a federal court hearing over Hinckley's status, Dr. Robert Phillips said, ""We are talking about putting someone in a community for extended time who has been institutionalized for 30 years for trying to assassinate the president."" He said the proposal by St. Elizabeths hospital to let Hinckley spend much more time visiting his mother at her home in Williamsburg, Virginia, ""is not good enough"" because it lacks firm details about what kind of therapy sessions, group sessions and art and music classes Hinckley could attend in Williamsburg. Phillips said the Virginia mental facility that agreed to provide outpatient programs for Hinckley has not received records from St Elizabeths about Hinckley's condition it needs in order to construct a program for him. Hinckley, 56, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. Police Officer Thomas Delahanty. The four men survived the attack, but Brady was shot in the head and left permanently disabled, and Delahanty's wound forced him to retire shortly afterward. The psychiatrist, who is acting as an expert medical witness for the government, testified for the second day on Tuesday in proceedings on Hinckley's future freedoms. Hinckley currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in Virginia. Officials at St. Elizabeths want to increase that to two visits of 17 days to be followed by six visits of 24 days. St. Elizabeths is seeking authority to then decide whether Hinckley can be released as a permanent outpatient. During the 10 days of hearings, various experts have said Hinckley's most severe illnesses -- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in full remission. However, Phillips said he does not agree Hinckley's depression is in full remission and says he displays some symptoms, including sullen behavior and weight gain. Phillips said this alone doesn't mean Hinckley shouldn't spend more time in Williamsburg, but he said Hinckley's doctors and case manager need to pay close attention to the problem. Witnesses have testified Hinckley has been taking Zoloft for several years after complaining of anxiety. Phillips said he thinks the drug is also meant to help with depression. Hinckley's defense attorney, Barry Levine, took issue with Phillips. Levine ticked off a list of symptoms for major depressive disorder from a psychiatry publication that said a patient would need to have five of those symptoms to be suffering from the disorder. Phillips acknowledged that Hinckley does not appear to have five of the symptoms but persisted in his view that Hinckley is experiencing some level of depression. Levine noted all of the concerns raised by Phillips -- including Hinckley's relationships with women, the fact that he is sometimes deceptive and his social isolation -- and said that despite those issues, Hinckley had not engaged in violent behavior. Phillips agreed. Phillips said he did not think St. Elizabeths should be given authority to decide if and when Hinckley is permanently released from the hospital. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman indicated in December that he thinks that decision should rest with him. The hearing will resume next week. Hinckley has the right to testify, but his lawyer said he does not expect to call him.","Hearing to determine whether John Hinckley Jr.'s status enters its 10th day .

"Washington (CNN) -- A psychiatrist who treated John Hinckley Jr. in the 1980s and who interviewed him in recent months described the presidential assailant Tuesday as having ""a sense of entitlement"" and being ""absorbed with himself."" During federal court testimony, Dr. Raymond Patterson also said Hinckley ""dives right in"" when it comes to romantic relationships with women, but has not always shown a lot of empathy toward them. Federal prosecutors called Patterson as an expert witness in their effort to block a proposal from St. Elizabeths, the Washington mental hospital where Hinckley has undergone treatment for three decades, to increase Hinckley's periods of visitation to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia, and his possible eventual release as a permanent outpatient. In March of 1981, Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington policeman Thomas Delahanty. All four men survived, and Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity . Patterson, the former director of forensics services at St. Elizabeths, said Hinckley continues to suffer from both narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders. He said the latter problem has led Hinckley to be somewhat removed in personal relationships. In December, experts called by Hinckley's lawyers testified his two most serious mental problems-- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder-- are in full remission. Patterson agreed with the diagnosis on the depressive disorder. He was more circumspect about the psychosis, saying his condition ""tends not to present with obvious symptoms."" The psychiatrist said that in the late1990s he had recommended Hinckley start taking the antipsychotic drug Risperdal to prevent any new symptoms. That was of particular concern, Patterson said, because Hinckley was leaving the hospital periodically. Hinckley is still taking that drug along with Zoloft for anxiety. Patterson said that in his opinion, Hinckley ""continues to be mentally ill now."" The issue of Hinckley's relationships with women has frequently come up during the discussion of increasing his freedom. Witnesses have testified about his girlfriends, including a woman identified only as Miss CB, a former mental patient at Hinckley's hospital. Patterson said Hinckley said he was engaged to CB and was unhappy his mother would not allow her to visit him during his stays at her Virginia home. Hinckley's mother was concerned CB might have a mental breakdown. Patterson said Hinckley showed ""little regard"" for his mother's views. According to Patterson, Hinckley said he had ended his engagement to CB anticipating he would be spending more time at his mother's and would not be able to see her there. Patterson said he was not sure if Hinckley had, in fact, told CB the engagement was over because she continues to visit him when he is at the hospital. The psychiatrist said he asked Hinckley what the impact would be on CB if he were to go to Williamsburg and no longer see her, and Hinckley replied that she has other friends. Patterson said Hinckley showed ""not a lot of empathy."" Hinckley's defense team will get a chance to question Patterson on Wednesday. In his opening arguments in late November, attorney Barry Levine said the central issue is whether Hinckley is dangerous and said no one has offered any proof that he represents a danger to himself or others. Levine said Hinckley is ""flawed,"" but insisted he is ""fundamentally decent."" Hinckley currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in Virginia. Doctors at St. Elizabeths have proposed the visits be increased, first to two stays totaling 17 days. That would be followed by six trips totaling 24 days. Following the extended visits the hospital would like the authority to decide whether Hinckley can be released as a permanent outpatient. In December, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman said the decision should rest with him.","Hinckley ""continues to be mentally ill now,"" Dr. Raymond Patterson testifies .

"(CNN) -- The goal of ""BioShock Infinite,"" creative director Ken Levine said, was to have ""moved the ball down the field"" in terms of how video games can be vehicles for telling engrossing, expansive stories. But the latest entry into the wildly popular franchise does more than just move the ball down the field. It kicks it squarely through the goalposts with a mind-blowing story set in an alternate reality that may be only a short trip from our real-world track. ""BioShock Infinite"" takes place in a version of 1912 America in the floating city of Columbia, a technological marvel on which a prophet has chosen to lead his people away from the ""Sodom below."" Booker DeWitt, a former military man and Pinkerton agent, is charged with going to the city in the sky and rescuing a young girl, Elizabeth, who has the power to manipulate time and space. Indeed, the game plays with the concept of time from its very beginning. An Edwardian barbershop quartet sings ""God Only Knows"" by the Beach Boys. A mechanical horse is advertised as ""Horse of the Future Today."" The city itself feels like a floating World's Fair, with new inventions, a carnival-like atmosphere and everyone speaking about how much better things will be tomorrow -- all based on the prophet's guidance. The environments are colorful and vibrant, reflective of the game's disparate moods of optimism and turmoil. The city feels like it has gravitas while remaining lofty in the clouds. There is even a beach and ""ocean,"" so I guess we get to see where rain really comes from. Steampunkish ""voxophones"" and ""kinetoscopes"" scattered throughout the city help provide aural and visual backstories for current events. They fill in the history blanks and give the player a better understanding of actions that take place. Of course, Elizabeth is key to the Prophet's plan to bring judgment on the sinners below, so Booker's time in Columbia is not going to be an easy one. Combat in ""Infinite"" is based very much on the principles from other ""BioShock"" games, with some slight tweaks. Instead of plasmids (the power source in the first two games), so-called vigors are the source of Booker's environmental powers. From throwing fireballs to directing flocks of ravens or firing lightning bolts, the vigors are permanent once acquired and powered by salts found throughout the city. Think of salts as ammunition for your vigor weapons. 'Bioshock' creator talks history, writing and 'nerdity' There are more traditional weapons as well. Pistols, shotguns, machine guns -- they're all here. Both the guns and the vigors are upgradable through purchased additions at vending machines, so keep an eye out for coins wherever you find them. The nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual-wieldable. You can mow down an opponent with bullets or rockets while tossing them in the air with a Bucking Bronco vigor. In previous games, this was an either/or venture, so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose. However, the heart of the game is Elizabeth. She is your constant companion throughout the game, offering help in combat or pointing out items you might miss as you travel throughout Columbia. Her ability to create windows into other worlds can help bring in supplies or allies during battle as well. She is also a master thief who can pick locks quickly. Elizabeth is never in danger during combat and never takes damage. In that way, she is not one big escort mission but a true companion during your adventures. Getting Elizabeth just right was a massive undertaking for Irrational Games and Levine, who said the game's release date was pushed back a year solely to perfect her. Their success lies in the empathy the player develops toward her as the game progresses. You feel and see her frustrations, her joys and her pain. Her tiny movements, such as bending over to closely examine a new item for the first time (even one that has no bearing on the game), give her a human feeling without treading into Uncanny Valley (where animation comes so close to actual human behavior that it causes discomfort). Without going into spoiler territory, there were two separate instances where I really thought the development teams nailed it. The first was during a tense situation early in the game where Elizabeth is trying to understand what's going on and why people were fighting over her. Booker tries to explain that different sides want different things from her. Her response: ""Well, I want a puppy, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get one."" It felt like the way a teenager would react to a stressful situation. The second came during a scene in which Booker is talking with people who suddenly disappear. As a gamer, I shrugged it off and accepted it. However, when I turned around, I caught sight of Elizabeth, who was standing there with the best ""WTH?"" look I've ever seen in a video game. Little moments like that combine to reveal a character who isn't just a companion but who helps move the story along in a meaningful way. At first, you want to help yourself. Later, you want to help Elizabeth. By the end, you want both. The experiences will linger. And your emotions will be real. In this way, Levine and his team have succeeded in creating not only an excitingly wonderful game but one that will make the player think for days after the game is done. ""BioShock Infinite"" earns its title by the end of the game. The possibilities, like time and space, are endless. The overarching narrative portrays struggles on so many different levels, but it is your story of struggle that is ultimately important and the one you guide to its conclusion. ""BioShock Infinite"" is available worldwide on Tuesday for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. It is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, language, mild sexual themes and use of alcohol and tobacco.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- More than 20,000 current and aspiring game makers have converged in San Francisco for the annual Game Developers Conference, where the next wave of gaming trends is on display: next-generation consoles, the growth of free-to-play and independent games, and the explosion of mobile gaming. Game publishers take advantage of the conference spotlight to showcase new games for the first time. Electronic Arts went big at the show by renting out a movie theater to debut a live gameplay demo of the upcoming military shooter ""Battlefield 4"" on a giant screen. Other game companies rented luxury hotel rooms to offer hands-on previews of new titles across a variety of platforms. Here are five games that stood out: . 'LEGO Marvel Super Heroes' (Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment/TT Games, fall 2013) While Netdevil's massively multiplayer online game ""LEGO Universe"" failed to capture an audience, every LEGO game developed by TT Games has been a huge hit. After having success with DC comic book characters (a result of being owned by Warner Bros.), TT Games has partnered with its archrival, Marvel Entertainment, to give more than 100 superheroes such as Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Wolverine and Captain America the brick treatment. ""LEGO Marvel Super Heroes"" offers the patented co-op gameplay and tongue-in-cheek humor that gamers have come to expect from TT Games. The original story will have players taking control of assorted superheroes as they explore a virtual New York, battling enemies such as Loki, Galactus and Sandman. 'Daylight' (Zombie Studios, fall 2013) With a name like Zombie Studios, you'd assume that ""Daylight"" isn't the first horror game from the independent game developer. But it is. It's also the first horror game for Sony's new PlayStation 4. ""Daylight,"" which runs on Epic Games' new Unreal Engine 4 game engine, traps players inside a haunted insane asylum. Armed only with the light and apps from your in-game smartphone, you must try to get out alive. There are no weapons other than your feet -- which are best used to run. Every time you play this game, the horrors that await -- much like the rooms and hallways -- will be different. The developer has written a lot of back story about centuries of souls who were mistreated within the asylum's walls. And in another twist, the game's female protagonist is mysteriously suffering from amnesia. One of the most impressive things about this macabre-looking adventure is that a team of six people conjured it up and are self-publishing on PlayStation 4. 'Infinite Crisis' (Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment/Turbine, fall 2013) Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (part of Time Warner, CNN's parent company) is showing its commitment to the popular free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena game genre with its second licensed game in as many years. With ""Guardians of Middle-earth"" already a hit, the publisher just unveiled the DC Comics-based ""Infinite Crisis."" This game allows five players to choose a superhero or supervillain and team up to battle against another team in unique environments based on six alternate universes. Inspired by the ""Infinite Crisis"" comic books, this game's original story has the barriers between the different dimensions of the DC Multiverse being torn apart. That opens up six variations of each character -- such as a steampunk-themed Gaslight Catwoman and a bloodsucking Nightmare Batman. Each character will have unique combat abilities and weapons. The game will launch with a dozen characters, including Flash, Gaslight Joker, Green Lantern, Poison Ivy, Wonder Woman and Doomsday, and three maps. Turbine, the developer, says it will regularly expand the universe with new maps and characters. 'Battlefield 4' (Electronic Arts/DICE, fall 2013) While Electronic Arts' ""Medal of Honor Warfighter"" failed to connect with the first-person shooter fan base last fall, the publisher's ""Battlefield"" franchise remains one of its strongest. ""Battlefield 4"" is taking advantage of the new Frostbite 3 engine to bring what the developer promises is the next generation of shooter games this fall. The Swedish developer isn't talking about the game's new multiplayer options, but it offered a live demo of the game's single-player campaign on a movie theater screen. The game's action will send a team of U.S. soldiers, called the Tombstone Squad, to photorealistic locales such as Azerbaijan, Russia and China as they battle a new global threat. The gameplay features a more Hollywood style of action, upping the ante with heavily armed (Russian and Chinese) enemies and tense life-or-death scenarios. This franchise has succeeded on the strength of its wide-open multiplayer battlefields, and this version appears to offer even more open environments and freedom of exploration. 'Thief' (Square Enix/Eidos Montreal, 2014) Developer Eidos Montreal is bringing back a classic first-person action game with ""Thief."" After successfully moving the futuristic sci-fi ""Deus Ex"" action franchise forward with ""Human Revolution"" last year, the studio is going back in time with the fourth installment of ""Thief."" The game is a reimagining of the stealth gaming franchise rather than merely a sequel. Players will once again take on the role of Garrett, a master thief, and explore a fantasy steampunk world brought to life for next-generation consoles. This story-driven game isn't about shooting, or even killing. In fact, like Arkane Studios' ""Dishonored"" last year, the entire game can be played without killing anyone. Garrett uses his stealth and cunning to traverse the city's shadows and achieve various objectives, which, of course, include stealing priceless items. He also has an assortment of weapons, such as specialized arrows and swords. The developer, which most recently worked on the multiplayer gameplay for ""Tomb Raider,"" promises this game will have mainstream appeal while offering new challenges for hard-core fans of the franchise.","Game makers converge on San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference .

"(CNN) -- The new Razer Blade gaming-centric laptop is sleek and powerful, but it's not for every gamer looking to take their action on the go. The second-generation edition is an upgrade from the original, released in February 2012. Razer wanted to bolster the hardware specs without detracting from what makes the Blade unique in portable computer gaming -- its size. The first thing you notice about the Blade is how thin it is. A 17-inch, high-definition screen is housed in a case that is less than an inch thick and weighs 6.6 pounds. The matte black aluminum finish is in stark contrast to the neon green Razer logo and keyboard lighting. It is quite the eye-catching machine and will sit comfortably on your lap. What makes the Blade different than standard laptops is its unique Switchblade interface, which sits on the right-hand side of the keyboard. This LCD touchscreen acts as a traditional touchpad mouse for most options, but can be programmed depending on which game is being played. Ten lighted buttons can be programmed as macro game commands, allowing for handy use. Some game profiles (Team Fortress 2, Battlefield 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic to name a few) are already available and Razer says they are working to add more. The placement of the Switchblade to the right of the keyboard took some getting used to when I just wanted to use it as a touchpad. Frequently, my fingers would seek the touchpad below the keyboard before wandering off to the right. In game, the location was more familiar to me as I treated it more like a gaming mouse. The touchscreen can also act as a secondary, but very small, display. While social media apps were preprogrammed into the buttons, I wouldn't recommend trying to Facebook or tweet on it while gaming on the big screen. However, if you're looking for an edge, a YouTube video walkthrough of the game you're enjoying can be viewed in the small screen while you control the action on the big screen. The next thing you'll notice about the Blade is the lack of an optical drive. Given today's online gaming services (like Steam), that may be less of a problem than it first appears. However, it will limit your ability to play games from a disc or even watch a movie in nongaming moments while traveling. However, this machine is built for gaming performance and that's where most of the improvements were targeted. With a brand-new quad-core processor (i7-3632QM) developed by Intel, a high-end Nvidia GeForce GXT 660M and 8GB of RAM, the new Blade isn't quite at the top of the performance ladder, but is definitely within shouting distance. Playing a variety of games, from ""Diablo 3"" to ""Civilization V,"" on the high detail setting was a visual dream. Graphics were crisp and clear, and movement within the games went along without a hitch. The audio from the built-in speakers wasn't as deep as some other laptop gaming computers. You'll probably want to plug in headphones to get the best quality. Surprisingly, with all that power, the Blade stayed warm without burning me when gaming with it on my lap. The hottest internal parts are positioned along the hinge in the back and the air vents effectively shunt heat away without any loud, noisy fans. Indeed, the computer was surprisingly quiet while working to keep up with the graphical demands of my games. USB ports are all located on the left hand side of the deck so if you want to add a mouse for serious gaming, you'll need a long cord -- or a wireless one mouse. There is also an HDMI output and a headset jack along the left side. A 500 GB hard drive is smaller than some other gaming laptops, but shouldn't be a significant loss. The battery life isn't as long as I'd like, but the battery pack is slim and sleek, which is good for mobile gaming and finding those outlets on the road. The final thing you'll notice about the Blade after oohing and ahhing over its looks and functionality will be the price. The new laptop will set you back $2,500 (according to the Razer website), making it an expensive option in the laptop gaming arena. This price tag puts it squarely at the high end for the gaming audience. The incredibly slim and light design, the powerful engine inside, and a heat dissipation system that won't scald your legs make the new Blade an excellent portable gaming option. Personally, the price tag puts it out of my reach despite all the attractive features. It is a laptop for very serious gamers who want to take their fragging on the road. The demo unit I reviewed used Windows 7, but Razer plans to make Windows 8 available to customers who want it. They are also not doing away with their first version of the Razer, which is priced $600 cheaper, but is a little lighter in the performance department as well.","Review: Razer Blade gaming laptop is sleek and powerful, but not for everyone .

"(CNN) -- While many people still associate Facebook games with casual offerings like Zynga's ""FarmVille,"" the social media giant has expanded its game catalog through titles like KIXEYE's ""War Commander"" and Kabam's ""The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle Earth."" Now, Facebook has partnered with start-up U4iA Games (pronounced ""euphoria"") to launch its first ""core"" video game, the first-person shooter ""Offensive Combat."" The game, which had a soft launch three weeks ago, has already attracted over a half-million players with no marketing. The game is playable as a Facebook App and included in the Action games section of the site's App Center. ""Facebook wants to bring the next-level gaming consumer to their platform,"" said Dusty Welch, co-founder and CEO of U4iA Games. ""Core games monetize the highest and are the stickiest."" Welch and co-founder and CCO Chris Archer have backgrounds that include having overseen huge franchises when they were at Activision like ""Call of Duty,"" ""Spider-Man"" and ""Guitar Hero."" Archer said his studio designed ""Offensive Combat"" for a fast-growing segment of core gamers who want a fine-tuned, shooter game that can be played anywhere, anytime via their Web browser, and not limited by the need for a major software install or dedicated hardware. ""Offensive Combat"" is a shooter that blends elements from the most popular shooters out there like Microsoft's ""Halo 4"" and Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" into a free-to-play experience that's fully customizable. Players can choose from 30 game archetypes like modern soldiers, space marines and robots and engage in a variety of multiplayer modes across nine maps. The online game will expand with new content every two weeks. Players can purchase in-game items, including weapons, to further customize the experience. These micro-transactions will allow players to move through the progressive ""grind"" of leveling up and unlocking content, but Welch said the battlefield will remain even for all players. ""There are millions of consumers around the world who play core games and want to play these types of free-to-play games,"" said Welch. ""First-person shooters have dominated gaming since the early days of 'Doom,' 'Wolfenstein' and 'Quake.' When you look at the success of free-to-play games like Riot Games' 'League of Legends' and Wargaming's 'World of Tanks,' there's room for a first-person shooter like 'Offensive Combat.'"" More than 251 million of Facebook's 1 billion-plus members currently play games every month. Even with droves of players leaving Zynga's games, there remain new audiences that haven't yet gravitated to the platform. ""Gaming on Facebook is all about connecting with friends,"" said Welch. ""FPS games are the most social of all the core gaming genres. FPS fans want to connect with their friends and clans and do it quickly. What better, simpler way to do that than Facebook where there are a billion gamers? The problem has been that the genre hasn't been represented yet."" Michael Pachter, a video game analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the free-to-play business model is popular because it reaches the broadest audience, it's approachable and easy, and there's no barrier to entry. ""You can make $100 million off a game that's free to play like Riot Games' 'League of Legends,' said Pachter. ""Free-to-play takes away some of the risk."" As much money as Activision and Microsoft have generated from billion-dollar shooters like 'Call of Duty,' 'Halo' and 'Gears of War,' Welch believes there's a much larger audience willing to jump into the genre without the requirement of a $60 disc. He also believes there's something to be learned from Zynga's failure to keep its gamers happy. ""It's crucial to continually innovate and stay connected with your community,"" said Welch. ""The lather-rinse-and-repeat methodology that Zynga used too many times gets stale fast with your user base and they degrade and move on. We saw that happen in the console space with games like 'Guitar Hero' and 'Wii Fit.' True innovation creates a sticky audience. Zynga games didn't attract mid-core to core gamers and they flooded back out to 'American Idol' or whatever other entertainment is popular today."" Facebook has partnered with U4iA Games to develop new social mechanics that are being designed to build engaging gaming communities. These features will eventually debut with ""Offensive Combat"" before moving on to other Facebook games. In the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy, violent video games have come under fire in some quarters. Welch believes ""Offensive Combat,"" which was designed as a mash-up of different constructs, offers a more irreverent and light-hearted approach to the genre than more realistic shooters. ""I'm a parent with two children and I believe it's the responsibility of parents to monitor and decide what's appropriate for their situation and we take that very seriously,"" said Welch. ""Facebook is for people 13+ so there's age gating for that platform. While the gameplay experience was designed for hardcore gamers, you can run around in a banana suit with futuristic plasma weapons.""","With ""Offensive Combat,"" Facebook moves into core gaming with its first first-person shooter .
