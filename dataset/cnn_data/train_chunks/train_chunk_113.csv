"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The vast majority of comedians lean to the left. Right-wing comedy is a rarity on the Internet. And Republicans are typically easier to make fun of than Democrats. But comedians shouldn't take a political stance when trying to be funny. That was the consensus of a panel of admittedly left-leaning comedy experts at South By Southwest Interactive, the digital culture festival under way in this Texas capital. ""Comedy has a recklessness that doesn't lend itself to the conservative lifestyle,"" said Rory Albanese, an executive producer and writer for ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" ""It's the same reason why Christian rock bands aren't as good as regular rock bands."" Albanese was joined on the panel by Carol Hartsell, comedy editor of The Huffington Post, and comedian-author Sara Benincasa, a contributor to Vice.com -- although Albanese did most of the talking. During a freewheeling hour, the trio riffed on everything from the nature of humor online to GOP candidate Rick Santorum's recent comment that President Barack Obama is ""a snob"" for wanting young people to attend college. Albanese admitted that after eight years of making jokes about President George W. Bush, it was difficult at first for ""The Daily Show"" to take aim at Obama. He said Obama's measured statements aren't easy targets for parody. ""There's funny stuff on the left, but sometimes you have to dig a little deeper. I can't say all the lies in politics come from the right. I think a lot of them come from the left,"" he said during the event Friday. ""I do think it's important to try and come at things from all sides. What we do is poke fun at the [political] system, poke fun at the process."" Panelists agreed that partisan politics has almost nothing to do with what's funny online. ""I don't think the Internet leans left,"" said Albanese, citing the Drudge Report and the far-right rhetoric in some online-comment threads. ""It's a bad idea [for comedy sites] to pick a path politically before they go after what's funny."" Benincasa agreed, saying there's a reason most of the most popular clips on YouTube don't feature politics but cute cats and guys getting smacked in the groin. Yet asked by moderator Alf Lamont to name a single right-leaning comedy site, the panel drew a blank. They also couldn't name any conservative comedians, save for maybe Dennis Miller. Hartsell said most of the comedians she knows are questioning, angst-ridden people whose insecurities may not jibe with conservative mind-sets. Albanese said the 2011-2012 Republican primary campaign, with such colorful candidates as Rick Perry and Hermain Cain, has been comic gold for ""The Daily Show"" and other jokesters. ""With all due respect to the candidates, there is the view that all of them are insane. A guy like Santorum, who's taking an anti-college stance? That's funny. I mean, who the f--- is against college?"" Satirical TV shows such as ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report"" can raise viewers' awareness about political issues. But Albanese believes they shouldn't be someone's only source of news. ""When people say, 'I get all my news from 'The Daily Show,' I say, 'Well, that's a good start.' It's a launching point. But it's not a place to form your opinions."" Hartsell believes social media has democratized comedy by giving everyone a platform to be funny -- whether it's in Facebook updates, in brief Twitter jokes or goofy images on Pinterest. ""People just naturally want to make other people laugh,"" she said. ""It's hard to find an audience when you want to be funny. When you're a kid, it's your family. But when you're an adult, the Internet gives you a constant audience. It may just be 20 friends on Facebook, but it's an audience.""","It's not easy to find right-leaning comedians or comedy websites, comedy experts say .

"(CNN) -- Graydon Grotberg remembers when his hometown of International Falls, Minnesota, had no commercial airport. Now, he can't imagine life without it. More than a half-century ago, Grotberg boarded a Greyhound bus for the 300-mile trip to Minneapolis-St. Paul where he enlisted in Marine Corps boot camp amid the Korean War. Two years later, he returned home to Minnesota and a bus brought him back to International Falls, safe and sound. But Greyhound doesn't service International Falls anymore. Neither does Amtrak. So Grotberg, now an 81-year-old retired widower, relies on a Delta Connection flight from the International Falls airport to the Twin Cities, where he receives medical treatment for his eye condition. When he can't make the flight, he shares a VA hospital van with several other travelers willing to endure the six-hour drive. Grotberg would drive himself -- if it weren't for his eye condition -- which he says is similar to macular degeneration. It restricts his driving to daytime only -- on non-interstate roads. ""If nobody else is scheduled to take the van, then I have to fly,"" Grotberg says. ""if we didn't have a flight out of here that I could take, I don't know what I'd do. We're kind of stranded up here."" Grotberg's situation could get a lot worse. A House bill proposes virtually killing a subsidy program that helps 162 small rural airports, like the one in International Falls, stay in business. Airports in Alaska and Hawaii would be spared. Subsidized airport locations and amounts . It's a threat that could leave Grotberg and other travelers who rely on tiny local airports with frighteningly few travel options. Without the program -- which is called Essential Air Service, International Falls would change radically, say community leaders. Commercial airlines would pull out, they say, leaving the airport with nothing but income from private aircraft and charter flights. The airport ferries business travelers for a local paper mill as well as hunters and other outdoor sports enthusiasts. Over the long term, officials say, the airport infrastructure would suffer due to the loss of funding. Not only would those travelers be left with few options, the economic effects on the town, they say, would be staggering. ""It would be incredibly difficult, probably impossible, to find another carrier to come here without an EAS contract, unless the economy surges astoundingly and fuel prices simultaneously decline,"" says Susan Baratono, executive secretary of the airport commission. Falling numbers, crucial connections . International Falls' airport started getting the EAS subsidies in 2009. ""For many, many years we never needed it,"" says airport commission chairman Bob Anderson, until the nation's economic crisis took its toll. In the last two to three years the facility's annual commercial airline traffic has plunged from about 25,000 departures and 25,000 arrivals, to recent figures of 13,000 or 14,000 each way, Anderson says. ""But we're seeing those numbers starting to increase."" A recent price for the least expensive round-trip ticket from International Falls to Minneapolis was more than $450, says Pam Pavleck , Minneapolis-area branch manager of Travel Leaders. ""We have a lot of people who come down from International Falls to Minneapolis-St. Paul and shop -- they go to Mall of America -- and we have a lot of people who visit their family,"" Pavleck said. ""And if they're going to stay awhile, they might drive down so they can have their cars, but for weekend trips -- yes they want to fly."" Vacationers from International Falls and Minnesota's other small towns also rely on their local airports to ferry them hundreds of miles to Minneapolis where they must make crucial airline connections in their itineraries. EAS is projected to pay more than $1.3 million in subsidies this fiscal year to Delta Connection for its International Falls service. That works out to a subsidy of about $49.79 per passenger, according to the Department of Transportation. Now Delta Connection is looking to pull its service from the community. Under EAS, airlines can't pull out of an airport until a replacement carrier agrees to fill the gap. Negotiations are now ongoing with Great Lakes Airlines to have that airline replace Delta Connection, Anderson says. Is it obsolete? EAS opponents point to news reports out of Ely, Nevada, describing outrage over last year's sky-high average per passenger subsidy of $3,720. The Essential Air Service program began in 1978 as a temporary way to help small airports survive federal deregulation. Rep. Tom Petri, chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, says the program is obsolete. ""Why should the government have to pay for all this?"" asks Petri, a Wisconsin Republican. Being from a big state, Petri is very aware that small airports are important to rural voters. What does he tell them when they complain about his plan to cut subsidies? ""Up in northern Wisconsin, a number of people weren't happy about this sort of thing,"" he admits. ""I say well ... my part of the state, Appleton, had air service and it was canceled numerous times and each time it was canceled people got together and started a new airline themselves. It's not that hard. You just need a pilot and a small plane."" Petri suggests that these airports join a federal small communities program which provides grants to help start new air service. Supporters say taxpayers shouldn't have a problem with EAS because much of the fund doesn't come from taxpayer dollars. According to the Department of Transportation, $50 million of the fund's $193 million is paid for by foreign airlines through fees they pay to fly over the United States. If EAS dies, says Petri, that money will continue to be collected and could possibly go toward many other goals, including deficit reduction and speeding up implementation of NextGen -- the FAA's massive overhaul of the nation's air traffic system. Petri says it's time for small airport operators to put free enterprise in the driver's seat. For Grotberg, getting in the driver's seat for a holiday visit to see his three daughters and grandchildren is not an option. His eyesight has failed him and now, he fears the airlines and Congress might fail him too. He supports EAS. ""I favor it more than other kinds of government subsidies,"" says Grotberg. ""It's more important than subsidizing oil companies."" House and Senate negotiators are hammering out a compromise bill this month. Petri says they're ""very close"" to an agreement. but it's unclear if the EAS program will survive. If so, full House and the Senate votes on a final bill are expected sometime in January. Some might suggest that Grotberg consider moving closer to his doctor and family in Minneapolis-St. Paul. But after living in International Falls nearly his entire life -- working at the local paper mill and raising his three daughters -- he says that's just not going to happen. ""It's a small town and it's so easy to get around and it has such friendly people. I like my home. I'm comfortable. I don't know if I could ever relocate.""","Minnesota man relies on small airport for medical treatment .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Residents of the southern Chinese village of Wukan held talks with government officials on Wednesday to try to defuse a tense standoff with the authorities following violent protests over land rights. More than 10,000 residents of Wukan, a fishing village in Guangdong Province, claim land has been seized illegally and then sold by the local government to developers for the past decade. News of one recent sale of nearly 1,000 acres of land to developers prompted protests by villagers who say they have not received any compensation and rely on the land for their livelihood. Villagers last week drove out government officials and set up obstacles to prevent the police from entering the village. They say one villager, Xue Jinbo, was beaten to death while in police custody. Zhu Mingguo, Guangdong's deputy party secretary, met with a local village representative on Wednesday, said Liu Jingmao, a spokesman for Shanwei city government, which administers the area. Liu declined to give details of the substance of the discussions. In the negotiations, the villagers were seeking the release of four people who had been detained by the authorities, said a villager who gave only his surname, Chen, for fear of reprisals if he was identified. They were also demanding that the government return Xue's body for investigation into the cause of death. The talks in Wukan come a day after separate demonstrations farther along the southern Chinese coast. Riot police used tear gas to disperse a large crowd of people who gathered to protest a coal power plant in the town of Haimen. In Wukan, Xue, 42, was suspected of leading hundreds of villagers in protests over issues of land use, money and local elections in September that led to two days of rioting, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported last week. His death was caused by cardiac failure and no apparent signs of assault were found on his body, the news agency quoted an investigator from Guangdong Province as saying. The Shanwei government has said it has settled some of the complaints that led to the riots, Xinhua reported, and fired two local officials. China has since censored searches for ""Wukan"" in online micro-blogs and other Twitter-like feeds to prevent the spread of information about the unrest. Searches on Sina Weibo for ""Wukan"" only result with the message, ""according to relevant laws and regulations, results for Wukan cannot be displayed."" Disputes over land use in rural areas of China have increased as discontent has grown over local corruption and environmental issues.","A senior party official meets a representative from the villagers of Wukan .

"New York (CNN) -- Six protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested early Wednesday in New York's Union Square Park during a confrontation with police, authorities said. The demonstrators were arrested after they were asked to vacate the lower Manhattan park at midnight, according to New York Police Department spokesman Detective Marc Nell. ""Protesters were asked to leave because of sanitary reasons. We had people coming in to clean the park. Arrests were made because the protesters were blocking pedestrian traffic,"" Nell said. There were six charges of disorderly conduct, four charges of obstructing government administration, one charge of resisting arrest and one charge of violation of local law, the spokesman said. Anthony Melendez, a Brooklyn resident and former priest who said he was present during the confrontation, told CNN there were roughly 300 protesters in the park by the time police started asking people to leave. Police did not confirm the number of protesters present. The occupiers were unsure as to what laws they were breaking before police ordered them to leave, according to Melendez. ""There were several of us going around sweeping, making sure everything was neat. We even made sure to keep in small groups and maintain space between each other,"" he said. Wednesday's arrests follow the arrest Saturday night of 74 demonstrators after an attempt to reclaim Zuccotti Park to mark the six-month anniversary of the Occupy movement. The Manhattan district attorney's office told CNN Sunday that the arrests were made as police forced the protesters out of the park, the birthplace of Occupy Wall Street. Protesters were allowed to return to Union Square Park at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Since the arrests over the weekend, Melendez said there has been a continuous presence at Union Square. ""The occupation at Union Square is considered the first 24-hour occupation since our November 15th eviction from Zuccotti Park,"" he said. The protests began September 17, with participants decrying income inequality, corporate greed and the influence of the top 1% of Americans. They soon drew the support of organized labor, while similar spinoff movements sprang up in numerous U.S. cities and overseas.","The latest arrests come after 74 people were arrested over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- Businesses are increasingly moving their data storage to big, purpose-built facilities around the world, according to the CEO of Outsourcery -- the UK's leading cloud computing firm. The growing stream of data that need to be stored is prompting companies to look at alternative ways to keeping the information, rather than simply storing it office-based servers. ""In the informational economy, data is everything,"" explained Outsourcery CEO Piers Linney. ""If you go down for whatever reason, you lose everything."" The Nordic region is positioning itself as an ideal location for data-storage centers, with its cold climate helping the sophisticated, high-powered equipment to remain cool. ""Half of our power is used to cool these things down,"" says Linney. ""If we are in a cooler climate like in the Nordic region it lowers our costs, increases our margins, which means we can offer a lower price to the end user."" Outsourcery is not the only company looking to store data in Scandanavia. A small town in northern Sweden has managed to lure the world's biggest social networking site to establish storage centers there. Construction is currently underway for Facebook's data storage facilities in Lulea -- a town of only around 50,000 residents. ""They need to improve their capacity because they have more customers outside the U.S. than in the U.S., so that means they have to be closer to their customers,"" says Matz Engman, CEO of the Lulea Business Agency. Lulea's cold climate serves as natural way to cool the servers, and the town has cheap and plentiful electricity. Local authorities hope other technology companies will follow Facebook and develop their storage centers in the town.","Businesses are moving data storage to purpose-built facilities, says cloud computing CEO .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Mexico football fans are adopting voodoo tactics ahead of Wednesday's crucial World Cup Qualifier with regional rivals the United States. Funny or freaky? Voodoo dolls of U.S. players have been issued in Mexico ahead of a crucial football game. Both sides will be looking to make a strong start to the final phase of qualifying for South Africa 2010, when they meet in the match at Columbus, Ohio. Mexico haven't won in the U.S. for ten years. In the hope of boosting their team's chances, Mexican sport magazine 'Record' has issued coupons for U.S. team voodoo dolls -- which could be attained with five different stamps from the publication. The move has also been supported by U.S. chain Blockbuster, which began trading the coupons for dolls in its Mexican stores last week. Complete with pins, the dolls represent U.S. players, however, users are instructed to wish for Mexican goals, rather than hoping for harm upon the U.S. players. The practise of using voodoo dolls stems from the belief they represent the spirit of a person. It's believed that by taking actions upon the doll, the represented person will be affected. Fans will have to wait until the full-time whistle on Wednesday to see if the dolls have made an impact.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq and the United States are close to reaching a deal under which U.S. combat troops would leave by December 2010 and the rest would leave by the end of 2011, two Iraqi officials said Thursday. U.S. soldiers patrol a street in Baghdad, Iraq, last week. One of the officials, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Haj Mahmoud, said the two governments probably will reach a final deal within days. He and Haider Al-Ababdi, a Shiite parliament member from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa Party, said that under the deal, U.S. troops would be restricted to their bases by June 30 instead of patrolling Iraq's streets. Mahmoud, the head of Iraq's delegation negotiating a deal on how U.S. troops will operate there, also said the Iraqi government would be able to request that some troops stay longer. Two senior U.S. officials said negotiators have made progress and are close to a deal. But they also said that some issues are unresolved and that troop withdrawals would be tied to conditions on the ground.  Watch what hurdles remain before a troop withdrawal » . The U.S. military presence is spelled out by a U.N. mandate, which is to expire by the end of this year. Iraq and the United States want to replace that mandate with a status-of-forces agreement governing how U.S. troops will operate in Iraq. The U.S. officials said U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with al-Maliki on Wednesday to try to resolve the issue of legal immunity for U.S. contractors working in Iraq. The officials described the phone call as tense. Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law. The Iraqi government has criticized the blanket immunity because of incidents such as the fatal shootings of 17 people in Baghdad's Nusoor Square on September 16. Iraqi officials say Blackwater Worldwide contractors killed the 17. Sunni politician killed . Also Thursday, a senior member of a Sunni political party that recently rejoined Iraq's government was fatally shot in the northern city of Mosul, the party said. Gunmen assassinated Mahmoud Younis Fathi, a senior member of the Iraqi Islamic Party in Nineveh province and the director of religious schools for the Sunni Endowment, the party said. Fathi's bodyguard also was killed as the pair traveled to work. Mosul police confirmed the slayings near Fathi's house in the western part of the city. Sunni insurgents have targeted Sunnis who cooperate with the U.S.-backed Iraqi government. American and Iraqi troops have been fighting al Qaeda in Iraq in Mosul and surrounding Nineveh province in northern Iraq. The Iraqi Islamic Party is the largest party in the Iraqi Accord Front bloc, which recently rejoined Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government after bolting last year over disagreements with the leadership. The Accord bloc -- which includes 44 lawmakers in the 275-member parliament -- pulled six ministers from the Cabinet last summer for several reasons, including what it called the monopolization of power by Shiites and Kurds and what it regarded as the unjust detention of Sunnis. But Sunnis have been more friendly toward the al-Maliki government because of its efforts this year in promoting prisoner amnesty, sharing power and taking on militants in Shiite regions such as Basra, Amara and Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood. The leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party is Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents. ""The assassination of Mahmoud Younis Fathi is a cruel crime targeting the national voices and mission of taking care of youths in Mosul,"" the Iraqi Islamic Party said, adding that it ""condemns and denounces"" the killing. In other violence Thursday in Mosul, insurgents killed three police and wounded six people by rigging a cart with explosives. About 8 p.m. Thursday, a suicide bomber's car exploded after Iraqi police shot at it, an Interior Ministry official said. The explosion happened before the car reached a police station in al-Wahda neighborhood in southern Mosul, but eight policemen were wounded, the official said. In another restive area of northern Iraq, Salaheddin province, a roadside bombing critically wounded a police chief, authorities said. Gen. Hamed Namis al-Jabouri, police commander in Salaheddin, and seven other police officers were wounded when the bomb struck a convoy, police in Tikrit said. They were evacuated to a military hospital in Tikrit. Meanwhile, the U.S. military said coalition troops in Iraq detained 25 people in raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq militants. The raids took place in Baghdad, Salman Pak, Mosul, Bi'aj and Baiji. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Arwa Damon in Baghdad and Elise Labott in Washington contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. officials: Rice, al-Maliki have tense discussion on contractor immunity .

"(CNN) -- Remember your first road trip? That sweet taste of independence as you were finally unleashed on America's free and open highways? For Pulitzer-winning automotive columnist Dan Neil, it was the day he turned 16 and passed his driving test. ""The minute I got my drivers license out of the laminator, I was on the road,"" he recalled. ""I took the longest road trip I could take."" Neil pointed his Fiat 124 Spider convertible in the direction of the nearest city: Raleigh, North Carolina. ""I just had to go man, I just had to drive. I must have put 500 miles on that car that day."" Neil said he was part of a mindset that associated the automobile with freedom, mobility and self-determination. Then the excitement in Neil's voice disappeared. ""That was in the mid-1970s, and the road system was a little bit different then."" Indeed it was. The days of America's ""free"" and open roads are gone -- or perhaps they never existed at all. Drivers often forget that they pay for highway construction and maintenance through federal fuel taxes: 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel. ""The notion that the road has ever been free is sort of a self-delusion,"" said Neil. Opinion: Five myths about the highway fuel tax . But the fuel tax is running out of steam, experts warn, because more efficient vehicles are using less fuel and rising fuel prices discourage driving. As tax revenue falls, so does the nation's ability to pay for road construction and maintenance. The solution, say many transportation experts, is to replace -- or supplement -- fuel taxes with a per-mile tax on every vehicle in America. Tax authorities might monitor each vehicle's mileage by installing devices that would transmit data. Unlike a fuel tax, which is somewhat hidden in the price of fuel, a device that spends your money with each tick of the odometer would be a real buzz-kill for millions of road tripping Americans. ""It's just like a speed limit or a toll road or any other kind of interference,"" said Neil. ""It steps on that conception we have of ourselves as a people without borders or boundaries. You step on our ability to take to the open road."" The bottom line . So, what kind of money are we talking about here? Translated into dollars and cents, fuel taxes cost each vehicle owner about $250 a year on average. According to a University of Iowa study, paying that amount on a per-mile basis would come to about 1.6 cents per mile. Whether it is paid for through fuel taxes or taxing per-mile, it's clear the federal highway fund is in trouble. By the end of 2012, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the fund will ""be unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner"" unless Congress injects even more life support from the general Treasury. During the next 20 years, projections show average vehicle fuel efficiency nearly doubling. Revenues from the fuel tax will be slashed by half, according to the Iowa study. Meanwhile, the cost of safe roads, bridges and transit systems will skyrocket. By 2020, says the American Society of Engineers, the price tag could be as high as $1.7 trillion. Bottom line: two cents per mile would be enough to pay for the nation's transportation infrastructure needs. That's according to a 2009 nonpartisan commission headed by two former U.S. transportation secretaries. 'The Man,' with a capital M . Imagine 254 million vehicles. That's the number of cars, trucks and motorcycles that a tax per mile system would have to monitor. Some proposals call for using GPS satellites to gather mileage data on each vehicle. Whoa. Really? When it comes to tracking their vehicles, Americans tend to be really touchy about protecting their privacy. According to a University of Iowa poll, only about 20% of drivers would choose a pay-per-mile tax system if GPS tracking is involved. The anonymous driver will soon be an extinct species, says Neil. ""You can't drop off the grid. Ten years from now, it will be virtually impossible to drive a car that doesn't have an electronic signature,"" said Neil. ""It doesn't matter whether you have OnStar or you rent a car -- it's going to have a 'black box.' If you've got any kind of navigation, The Man -- with a capital M -- knows where you are."" University of Iowa research shows that the public would be more willing to accept per-mile taxes if its monitoring technology doesn't record a vehicle's specific location. Taking your vehicle to have someone read the odometer every year -- like some states do with emissions testing -- might be an option. But some experts fear that method might be too expensive. Also, the resulting once-a-year tax bill might be too much for some drivers to pay. One idea tested in Minnesota eliminates GPS and uses cell phone text messaging technology. During fuel stops at gas stations, a device that already exists in most cars would text the car's mileage information to a ""back office"" data base. The office would then adjust the price of fuel at the pump based on each vehicle's mileage driven. Implementing any system would be tricky, says Paul Hanley, who headed the Iowa study. Retrofitting existing cars with the required technology would be almost impossible, he says. The cheapest and least difficult option says Hanely, would be to install devices in new cars and slowly transition to the new system as the nation's entire fleet of vehicles turns over. It takes about eight years before 90% of our vehicles are turned over, Hanley says, and more than 10 years to convert the fleet to nearly 100%. ""It's inevitable,"" says Hanley, who's been conducting a real-world test of a pay-per-mile system with more than 2,500 drivers in 12 locations from coast-to-coast. Per-mile taxes ""with a combination of tolls is coming as we move away from the fuel tax."" Several states in addition to Iowa and Minnesota are looking into possible pay-per-mile tax systems, including Oregon and Texas. Don't bother, some argue . Leave well-enough alone, says the American Trucking Associations' Darrin Roth, who argues that taxing vehicles per mile is too expensive to implement and administer. Those costs would be passed on to consumers, Roth says. The best and least complicated solution is to raise the fuel tax, which hasn't changed since 1993. But that idea comes with its own set of political challenges. Many members of Congress would likely oppose any kind of tax hike. ""I'm not convinced per-mile taxes are going to happen,"" says Roth. ""If it does, it probably won't happen for a long time."" Despite all the changes technology may bring to the driving experience, ""the American road will still be out there,"" says Neil. ""It's fun and it's incredibly broadening for people ... and it's a great way to spend time with your family,"" he says. ""It might not be as innocent as it used to be, but it's still an important part of who we are as a people."" How to pay for that highway remains a question Americans will debate for a while -- perhaps for years down the road.","Experts: Per-mile road tax will replace or supplement fuel tax .

"(CNN) -- A producer of bagged salad leaves has issued a voluntary recall of various salad blends over concerns they may be contaminated with salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration announced. Taylor Farms Retail of California is recalling 3,265 cases of salads following a random test on a finished package of spinach by the Washington State Department of Agriculture, the FDA said. There have been no reported illnesses attributed to the recalled items, according to the FDA. The products were distributed in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Puerto Rico and sold in various retail supermarkets, the FDA said. The recall affects several salad blends under the brands Fresh Selections, H-E-B, Marketside, and Taylor Farms. The products have ""best by"" dates of between October 18 and 21. The FDA says salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy people may experience fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea that may be bloody. In rare cases, the organism can get into the bloodstream and cause more serious complications.","More than 3,200 cases of salads are being recalled .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to the circular firing squad nature of the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, it had begun to look as if President Obama would coast to re-election in November. But then came along high gas prices. The recent dramatic increase in gas prices could become the issue that slows the economy, stalls the recovery and sinks the president's chances at a second term. As a Republican who recognizes President Obama's great skill as campaigner-in-chief, I'm shocked he has handled the issue so poorly. Even most of those who agree presidents can't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering. Sixty-five percent of Americans tell pollsters they disapprove of the president's handling of gas prices. Average gas prices have reached $3.87 nationwide, the highest ever recorded in March. The prices are expected to go even higher as the summer driving season arrives. If President Obama can't change the perception that he can't do anything about it, he could find himself pumping his own gas after November. The international markets are unlikely to save him, given the current unrest in the Middle East and rising demand in China, India and elsewhere. Popular opinion -- and the U.S. economy -- could take a strong turn against him if the situation is not rectified by summer. Americans will not appreciate paying $5 per gallon or more on their vacations. Those in the battleground states of Florida, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, Nevada and Colorado could be particularly annoyed. They will come to see his energy policy -- calling oil ""the fuel of the past,"" and slowing the permit process for drilling in the Gulf -- as crafted to please his friends in the green movement. And while the president is set to begrudgingly fast track the southern portion of the XL Keystone pipeline, he does not appear to have bought into the merits of the entire project. President Obama can argue that changing his policies would not dramatically increase domestic oil supplies in the short run. While this is technically correct, Americans are unlikely to buy the argument. As economist Larry Kudlow and others have noted, speculators and traders, whom President Obama has blamed for the current crisis, respond to news of new energy exploration. For example, President George W. Bush confronted a similar problem with gas prices spiking during spring and summer 2008. He responded by lifting an executive branch moratorium on oil and gas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf regions in an effort to jump-start production, and high prices subsided by fall. President Obama seems to be leaning toward dipping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which may or may not work since that move does not actually increase production. And he has embarked on an American energy tour, highlighted by stops in three swing states, to convince voters he's doing all he can. The Republican candidates, who seem never to miss an opportunity to take on the president, must seize this moment to push for an energy policy that would better serve the interests of the middle class. They should start a conversation now on how to avoid future gas price spikes. Domestic energy security is one of the nation's most critical issues. President Obama's own Energy Information Agency says we will need almost as much gasoline for transportation in 20 years as we consume today. The president is right that drilling alone will not satisfy our domestic needs. And he has supported an all-of-the-above approach. But his actions haven't completely matched his words. It truly must be all of the above. It must, as Newt Gingrich contends, tap into proven homegrown reserves in the High Plains, in Alaska, off both coasts and in the Rocky Mountains. It must include an all-of-the-above approach to technology as well -- including fracking, mapping and drilling -- and it must again involve building refineries. Such an approach can help drive down oil prices in the short term, boost domestic energy production, reduce dependence on unstable foreign sources, create jobs and provide new revenue streams for the government. It will be environmentally responsible because production of oil under U.S. environmental standards is among the strictest in the world. President Obama has pinned almost his entire re-election hopes on an economic recovery. If gas prices don't retreat soon, Americans will cancel their vacations, the seasonal industries that depend on those vacations will wilt, consumer spending will slow and the administration's hopes of showing concrete signs of an economic recovery by Election Day will fade. In that scenario, the president could find himself out of a job -- and it will be his own fault. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ford C. O'Connell.","Average gas price has reached $3.87 nationwide -- the highest ever recorded in March .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's attorney general Thursday again asked the state Supreme Court to overturn some 200 pardons, including those of convicted murderers, issued by former Gov. Haley Barbour in January during his last days in office. In a brief, Attorney General Jim Hood argued that the case should be reheard because the ""private personal rights"" of the victims, as provided by the state constitution and the Mississippi Crime Victims' Bill of Rights, were violated by the pardons. ""I am so pleased. I am so happy that Jim Hood is not ready to roll over and die yet,"" said Randy Walker, who was wounded by one of the pardoned killers. ""We're excited,"" he said. Walker was shot in the head during a 1993 attack in which David Gatlin gunned down Tammy Ellis as she held her 6-week-old son. Gatlin was her estranged husband and the child's father. ""Our constitutional rights were violated,"" said Tiffany Ellis Brewer, Tammy Ellis' sister. ""We're pretty happy about this news."" In January, during his last days in office, Barbour issued pardons and clemencies to 214 people, including four convicted murderers and an armed robber, who were serving life sentences. A representative for Barbour did not immediately return a call seeking comment. A representative for the attorney general told CNN that Hood would not have any comment on the motion. Earlier this month, the Mississippi high court ruled Barbour had complete power to pardon and his authority could not be challenged. In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it ""reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state,"" but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, state Supreme Court Justice Michael Randolph called the decision ""a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state."" Hood had argued that the state constitution requires that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed each day for 30 days in newspapers where the crimes were committed. Barbour, who also is former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances. Most of the pardons involved convicts who had already served their time and have since been released from prison for their crimes. Victims' families have denounced the former governor for not meeting with them to discuss his reasons why he would show such leniency to these men. But Thursday's last-ditch attempt to short-circuit the pardons has given victims hope. ""I am delighted. I am so glad, so proud that we have an attorney general who cares about the people of Mississippi,"" said Randy Walker, the shooting victim. ""I'm so pleased. We thought we had to accept what was said and done,"" he said. ""My spirit has been renewed.""","Attorney General Jim Hood petitions Mississippi Supreme Court for a rehearing .

"Los Angeles (Financial Times) -- Walt Disney will incur a $200m writedown on John Carter, the action film based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel which has failed at the box office despite a $300m production budget and an extensive global marketing campaign. The film about an American civil war hero who journeys to Mars is shaping up to be one of Hollywood's costliest flops. It has generated $184m in global ticket sales but with about half its takings going to cinema chains, Disney has had to adjust its earnings guidance for the quarter to reflect the film's performance. The company said its ""current expectation"" is that its movie studio division will incur an operating loss of between $80m and $120m for the quarter following the release of the movie. The writedown deals a blow to Rich Ross, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, who has been trying to improve returns at the division following a restructuring and a focus on films made under the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands. The studio has better prospects for the rest of the year, when it will release Brave, the latest film from Pixar, and The Avengers, a superhero movie featuring characters such as Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. Disney said the two movies had ""tremendous potential to drive value for the studio and the rest of the company"". However, the abject failure of John Carter is not likely to be forgotten in an industry where a single flop can wipe out a studio's annual profits. Hopes were initially high for John Carter: Its director, Andrew Stanton, had made the critically lauded and commercially successful Finding Nemo and Wall-E. But the director openly admitted to struggling with the transition from animated film-making to live action directing. Meanwhile, Burroughs' source material, which inspired filmmakers such as James Cameron, has failed to energise young, male cinema goers, a crucial demographic for any big-budget action movie. The film comes a year after another costly Disney flop -- Mars Needs Moms -- but although it is likely to provoke some soul-searching at the company, privately executives are standing behind Mr Stanton and saying the company will continue to take risks in the pursuit of creative success. John Carter was ""greenlit"", or put into development, by the previous management regime at Disney's studio. Since the departure of Dick Cook, the former studio chairman, Disney has cut its marketing costs and reduced the headcount at its home entertainment division to reflect an industry-wide slump in DVD sales. It is also producing fewer movies, concentrating instead on distributing titles produced by DreamWorks, the movie studio created by Steven Spielberg, Pixar and Marvel, the comic book publisher it acquired in 2009 for $4bn. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Walt Disney will incur a $200m writedown on action film John Carter .

"(CNN) -- Playing cards with images of Hitler. Toy fuhrers. And a lamp and church tapestry with swastikas emblazoned across the front. No, it's not a neo-Nazi convention. Rather, it is a groundbreaking exhibit that opened Friday in the German capital and is intended to show Adolf Hitler's relationship with the German people. Germany has produced exhibits on the Holocaust and Nazism before but never since World War II has one focused solely on the man who taught an entire nation to hate. ""Hitler and the Germans"" is not about the fascist dictator's memorabilia, not about the man himself, said curator Hans-Ulrech Thamer. It's not about textbook history or scholarly writings. The everyday objects on display show how Hitler won the heart of the German people. Everyone can read a book, but ""objects have another quality,"" Thamer said. There are rows and rows of magazine covers carrying the face of Hitler as well as enormous metal busts carved for industrial mantle pieces. And propaganda signs, welfare collection boxes, photographs, film footage promoting a visionary leader of the fatherland. Thamer hopes viewers -- many of whom are sure to be Germans who no longer have direct memories of their nation's ugly history -- will look inside themselves as they cast their eyes on ordinary things that back then, served a very extraordinary purpose. Michael Salberg of the Jewish civil rights group the Anti-Defamation League, called the exhibit ""extraordinary."" ""It's the ordinary objects -- that is what makes it powerful,"" he said. They are disquieting, upsetting, even off-putting, he said. Viewers might even go home and turn on a lamp in their living rooms and think about how the objects in the exhibit once occupied the same kinds of places. ""It wasn't just among a group of elites,"" said said Salberg, director of international affairs at the ADL. ""That German society was permeated with the symbols and the images that the regime was promoting was an important first step, and it took hold in a very frightening way."" More than 1,000 people streamed into the museum on opening day, Thamer said. They walked through halls devoted to three chronologically and thematically arranged chapters showing the circumstances of Hitler's rise and rule. Swastikas are banned in Germany but Thamer said museums have special permission to display them for historical purposes. Still, organizers of the show agonized over possible repercussions: inciting neo-Nazi extremists and infuriating the rest of the world. A new study published this week in the German magazine Der Spiegel revealed far-right thoughts are common in Germany today. One-third of Germans said they would send foreigners home if there were not enough jobs to go around. One-sixth of Germans said Jews have too much influence. ""Yes, we have had some objections,"" Thamer said. ""One of the fears discussed in the newspapers is that this might promote extreme groups. But I am not sure they enter museums."" Salberg said he did not believe an exhibit was likely to accelerate or motivate extreme viewpoints. ""People who have a xenophobic view of their society are not going to be any less or more xenophobic because of this exhibit,"" Salberg said. Deborah Lipstadt, a scholar of the Holocaust, also felt such exhibits are important. ""You understand that these things did not come out of nothing,"" said Lipstadt, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. ""There was a method to the madness."" She found powerful a similar exhibition of the power of Nazi propaganda at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Some 55 million people died in World War II, including 6 million Jews who perished in the Nazi-orchestrated Holocaust.","This is the first exhibit in Germany that focuses on Hitler .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban authorities have released dozens of members of the ""Ladies in White"" group after detaining them, a dissident said Monday. All of the members of the group who were detained Sunday were released, said dissident Oscar Ernesto Chepe, who supports the group. Cuba's official state-run media has not reported on the arrests, which occurred about a week before Pope Benedict XVI's scheduled visit to the island. The organization, known as ""Damas de Blanco"" in Spanish, is composed of the family members of Cuban dissidents, many of whom have been jailed. Every Sunday, the women march silently from a Havana church to their homes to protest against the Cuban government. The island's government has said the women are paid by the United States to create disturbances on the island. ""We were doing our march as we usually do when women dressed in civilian clothes stopped us,"" said group member Katia Sonia, who said she was among a group of 22 demonstrators arrested Sunday. Sonia said the women were state security agents, who took the marchers to a police station for questioning. Another 52 women from the group were arrested, she said, as they made their way to the Mass. The arrests may have been the result of the group marching a few more blocks than they typically do, or because tensions before the pope arrives in Cuba are spurring a new crackdown, Sonia said Monday. Last week 13 members of a dissident group were arrested after entering a Catholic church and refusing to leave until there were permitted an audience with the pope. The group was later arrested after church leaders failed to convince them to leave. The Ladies in White have also asked to meet with the pope during his visit to Cuba. So far, no meetings with opposition groups are on the pope's schedule for his three-day trip, which includes two large public Masses. A spokesman for the White House National Security Council accused Cuban authorities Monday of using ""tactics of intimidation and harassment to stifle peaceful dissent"" as the pope's visit nears. ""The detention of members of the Damas de Blanco this weekend in Havana in the lead up to Pope Benedict's visit underscores the disdain of Cuban authorities for the universal rights of the Cuban people,"" spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a statement.","A dissident says all the ""Ladies in White"" who were detained Sunday have been released .

"Washington (CNN) -- There's a lot to like about Herman Cain. He's funny and personable. He's a great American success story. His 9-9-9 tax plan may be half-baked, but the concept behind the plan -- replace the corporate income tax with in effect a consumption tax -- has a lot to recommend it. (Although, the plan has a lot of problems, too.) Finally, in a political cycle that has seen too many coded racial attacks on President Obama and his family, it's a source of great pride to me to see an African-American topping my party's polls. If Herman Cain had served as governor of Georgia, or even mayor of Atlanta, he'd be a valid and credible candidate for president of the United States. But here's the trouble: he has not held those offices or any other executive office at any level of government. He did serve on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the 1990s, including two years as chairman -- a distinguished position and an important responsibility, but not one that involves the management of a public agency. So what? So everything! The president's most fundamental job is to run the government. That job is very, very hard. The consequences of a mistake are very, very serious. For that reason, Americans have historically demanded a record of successful accomplishment in public office from their presidential candidates. The current president is an exception to the rule, and -- well -- enough said. Barack Obama became president despite a negligible record in large part as a reaction against the perceived failures of the George W. Bush presidency. Many voters in 2008 made a calculation like: ""Obama may never have governed anything. But George W. Bush was a two-term governor of the country's second biggest state, and he got us into Iraq and a terrible recession. So maybe experience doesn't count. Maybe what we need is a different style: somebody more cautious than Bush, somebody who doesn't always go with his gut."" You might expect Republicans to react similarly against the Obama presidency, demanding from their nominee skills that Obama lacked: administrative experience, negotiating skill, deep policy knowledge. But no. From Donald Trump to Michele Bachmann to Herman Cain, the Republican activist base has again and again fixed its hopes on people who have never held an executive public office -- and who defiantly reject the very idea of expertise. Meanwhile Mitt Romney -- the man who saved the 2002 Olympics and who inaugurated the nation's first universal health insurance program as governor of Massachusetts -- can't rise above 25% or so among Republicans. And the seemingly most logical alternative to Romney -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- has collapsed in the polls. Perry may not be the sharpest pencil in the pack, but he can at least claim experience in government. The Trump, Bachmann and now Cain boomlets reveal a worrying disinclination among some Republicans not to value government management very highly. These voters assume that if a candidate professes the right values, he or she will make the right decisions. Barry Goldwater gave this disregard its classic expression in his ""Conscience of a Conservative."" ""I have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size. I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them."" But guess what? Repealing laws is just as hard as passing laws. A president who wishes to extend freedom must still staff his or her administration with people who can do their jobs. And the more you reduce government's size, the more important that what remains should work well. Back in 2008, National Review editor Rich Lowry talked about a Republican ""competence primary."" That year, the Republican field was dominated by candidates who could claim some huge success in government: Romney; New York's crime-fighting former Mayor Rudy Giuliani; and the very effective three-term governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee. The race was won by John McCain, the man who had devised and pushed the ""surge"" strategy that turned around the Iraq war. This time, apparently, the competence primary has been canceled. Too bad. In the depths of the worst economic crisis since the Depression, competence is needed more than ever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Herman Cain is a great American success story .
He says Cain's tax plan is off-base but the concept behind it is admirable .

"(CNN) -- You've found a fabulous story to tell. You've snared the hard-to-get interviews. You're on the scene to watch the most dramatic moments unfold. The quotes are memorable, the tension palpable. It's a story that really matters. Now you're back at your desk, buried in a mountain of notes, audio, video and stills. Time to sharpen your editing chops. What drew you to the story in the first place? What surprised you? What choked you up? And, most importantly, what does it all mean? Questions are your friend at every storytelling stage -- from idea incubation to reporting, writing and producing. They can help focus and shape the story. Here are five questions you should ask -- and answer --while whittling down that mountain of material to build your story. It's called editing, but it's really just thinking smartly. 1. Through whose eyes am I telling this story? Whether told in words or pictures, many stories are seen through a wide-angle lens. And the result is that each quote and fact seems to carry the same weight. The story covers a lot of ground, but fails to go deep. Often it is more effective to change that focus, from wide-angle to close-up. In the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti, the mounting death toll threatened to render the victims faceless. And the enormity of the rescue efforts began to feel unfathomable. But CNN's Moni Basu focused on small, singular stories that stood for the universal: She told of one rescuer who became a woman's last hope. She took us inside the mind of one survivor pulled from the rubble after six days. Taking this approach, Basu followed the advice of E.B. White: ""Don't write about Man; write about 'a' man."" 2. Who has something at stake? Lisa Pollak, a former newspaper reporter who is now a producer for This American Life, was asked  to interview the winner of the National Oreo Cookie Stacking Contest. And she did. But a key decision turned ""One Good Thing on Top of Another"" into a delicious surprise. The writing sparkles, but it's the storytelling that  enchants. Read this gem of story, and see what important question led Lisa to a masterful stroke. 3. What's going to happen next? Take advantage of a story's mysteries, the questions raised. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and teacher Tom French calls this question -- ""What's going to happen next?"" -- the engine that propels the story forward. It's like sex, says another writer and editor: You want to hold back the climax. In a story (as in lovemaking), if the climax comes too soon, how long will you stick with it? In writing about his travels with two Muslims on a cross-country road trip for Ramadan, CNN 's Wayne Drash is careful to promise the reader that something surprising and dramatic is going to happen without giving it away. Are you hooked by his hint that the trip wasn't all ""peace, love and Kumbaya""? 4. What's the story really about? Writing guru William Zinsser offers two questions to guide a storyteller in determining what material goes in the story and what hits the cutting-room floor: . 1. What is the story about? 2. What is the point? The first question is about content. The second is about meaning. Everything in your story must go to one of those questions. Otherwise, it stays in your notes. Another useful exercise: Describe your story in three to five words. Now reduce that description to one word. If you can't, you're still focused on the story's content. Finding just one word will force you to name its theme. CNN's Jessica Ravitz wrote about BP oil spill victims from Louisiana traveling to Alaska to see what they could learn from the victims of the Exxon Valdez spill more than 20 years ago. That's what her story was about. What was the point? Read Ravitz's story to see if you can tell how she answered that question. 5. Where should the story begin? Once you know the theme of your story, you have the answer to this question: begin with a scene or a moment or description that contains the story's essential meaning. Note the first image in Walter Astrada's video ""Undesired,"" about the pressure women in India face to bear a male child. It contains the story's essence. Look at the first paragraph in Pollak's Pulitzer-winning story about a boy diagnosed with the same deadly disease as his brother and facing terrible odds. When you learn to investigate your notes and tape for what lies beneath -- the meaning -- your storytelling becomes just that: meaningful. Ready to give these tips a try? Do this: tell the story of an object that reveals something about someone you know. Then join us Thursday, October 14, at 3:30 p.m. ET for a conversation with Winburn.","The iReport Boot Camp challenges iReporters to improve their storytelling chops .

"SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- A Colombian man who authorities say is one of Latin America's biggest drug traffickers wants to be extradited to the United States from a Brazilian jail and is willing to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug agents, his attorney says. Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia appears in an undated photo released by the U.S. State Department. Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia was grabbed in a dawn police raid Tuesday and is being held in custody in Sao Paulo pending the processing of an extradition request. Brazilian and U.S. authorities say he is responsible for shipping thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States and Europe. He also allegedly oversaw a business empire that laundered the profits in Brazil, long a favorite hiding spot for fugitives. His attorney, Sergio Alambert, was quoted Thursday as saying Ramirez Abadia wanted to cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""My client asked that I contact the DEA and show his willingness to collaborate. Two DEA agents are questioning him in the jail,"" Alambert told O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper. Ramirez Abadia wanted to be extradited to the United States, but he hoped to cut a deal for a maximum 30-year sentence to avoid the death penalty, he said. In a 2004 indictment issued by a grand jury in Washington, Ramirez Abadia was accused of shipping about 500 tons of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States between 1990 and 2004. U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Mei said the extradition request was working its way through the formal process. Brazil might want to put Ramirez Abadia -- who is nicknamed Chupeta, or Lollipop -- on trial for money-laundering, and Colombia could try to bring him back to face justice there. Mei could not confirm that the DEA already was questioning the suspect or that U.S. agents took part in Tuesday's operation. ""The operation is an example of the way the DEA and Brazilian authorities work together all the time. This one paid off big time,"" he said. Police and media reports detailed a business empire run by Ramirez Abadia that included property, car dealerships, import and export companies, even a jet-ski store on a busy Sao Paulo avenue. He was trying to set up an air taxi company to help facilitate his business operations, they said. Ramirez Abadia, 44, and his wife lived in luxury in a million-dollar mansion in a Sao Paulo suburb, but they kept a low profile. The house had 10 televisions, a gym and swimming pool, and six cars, Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said. Neighbors said he was a man of few words and always wore sunglasses and a cap when he went out cycling with his wife. Staff at a plastic surgery office in a posh neighborhood where he had operations to change his appearance told Estado they had no idea about his background and that he was always kind and polite. U.S. authorities have described him as extremely violent, and Brazilian police said he was behind at least 15 killings in the United States and more than 300 in Colombia. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A group of men hoist a woman in a wheelchair over the railing of a bridge in Whistler, British Columbia, and let go. The woman screams -- for joy, as her blue bungee cord stretches and goes taut over an icy river 100 meters below. She bounces up and down several times, strapped in her wheelchair, her blond hair flying. ""I'm used to sitting upright all the time so the first two seconds sideways really made my stomach turn,"" said the woman, Christine Rougoor. ""It was amazing!"" Video of Rougoor's fantastic jump is quickly becoming an Internet sensation. The 25-year-old from Niagra Falls, Ontario made the amazing plunge last Thursday after winning a charity contest sponsored by an adventure company specializing in helping people with disabilities achieve their extreme sport dreams. The group 9Lives Adventures was founded by Karim Ladki, who was paralyzed after breaking his neck in an accident but was determined to continue stoking his love for adventure. The group held a video contest for people with physical disabilities, encouraging them to share their stories. The top three won an all-expenses-paid trip to Whistler to go back-country snowmobiling and bungee jumping. Ladki has organized similar trips in the past and says it's perfectly safe. ""I normally tell the first-time jumpers to stay in the chair as it provides a good back support and keeps you upright,"" he said. ""This also prevents any blood from moving around the body too much, furthermore preventing any lightheadedness or black-outs."" That was encouragement enough for Rougoor. ""For me, the last thing I wanted to do was get thrown over (and) then black out and not remember it!"" she said. Rougoor won the trip by submitting a video of her shooting guns, riding high-tech bikes for paraplegics, and playing tennis in her wheelchair. The education student has been in a wheelchair since she broke her spine in a motocross accident while vacationing in Florida in 2008. Rougoor said in her video submission that she was in a coma for three weeks, but was determined to get her life back on track after she got out of the hospital. She returned to college and earned a high school teaching license in art and French, but also has been working hard as a fundraiser for people with mobility issues. The bungee jump was liberating, Rougoor said. ""It was a couple of seconds of freedom from any worries and thoughts."" So would she encourage other people with disabilities to take the leap? ""I would do it again in a heartbeat,"" she said. ""The minute I got back, I begged them to push me back over!""","Rougoor has been paralyzed since a motocross accident in 2008 .

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- A 6-year-old boy abducted Wednesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, has been found safe, the Las Vegas police department announced early Sunday. ""Cole (Puffinburger) has been found, he is safe and in our custody,"" Capt. Vince Cannito told reporters in an early morning news conference. Cannito said that while detectives were canvassing Las Vegas neighborhoods Saturday night with flyers about the boy's abduction, they got a report that a young boy who matched Cole's description was seen walking alone on a sidewalk on the city's east side. ""Detectives rushed there, found the boy and confirmed it was Cole,"" Cannito said. ""It's just a blessing that this child has been found and he's in extremely good condition,"" the captain added. Cole's father, Robert Puffinburger, said the emotion he felt after being informed that his son was safe was ""indescribable.""  Watch Cole's tearful father speak about hearing the news » . ""I'm just glad he's safe,"" Puffinburger said at the news conference, his voice breaking. ""I can't wait to see him!"" Cole was snatched Wednesday in what police are calling a drug-related kidnapping. Three armed men tied up his mother and her fiance and ransacked the home, taking the boy when no money was found, police said. A nationwide Amber Alert was canceled because police believed it had ""run its course,"" Cannito said Saturday. Police say Cole's grandfather, Clemons F. Tinnemeyer, 51, had been involved in ""significant drug dealing"" and may have taken millions of dollars from drug dealers. Authorities say the kidnapping may have been in retaliation for the theft.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona striker Lionel Messi has hailed the performance of his teammates after the Spanish giants beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley on Saturday to lift their third Champions League trophy in six seasons. Messi produced a scintillating performance to enhance his reputation as being the world's greatest player, scoring Barcelona's second goal and tormenting the Manchester United defenders throughout the 90 minutes. However, the 23-year-old Argentine preferred to pay tribute to the players around him, telling the official UEFA website: ""We're very happy to lift another trophy. It was a difficult season, but we showed how good we are. Champions League crown for Barcelona . ""We were the better team. To be the man of the match is the least important thing because it was incredible how we played. We were very good in all areas."" Messi added: ""This team is incredible. I think we can't really fully appreciate what we're doing, what we are achieving. ""We want to keep winning trophies and we can keep going further and further. We were superior against Manchester and deserved the win. ""It is another cup for us and I managed to score a goal again. Now we're going on holiday -- after taking the cup home to our people -- then we will start thinking about what we can achieve next season."" Meanwhile, Brazilian international Dani Alves paid tribute to fellow-defender Eric Abidal, who made a remarkable recovery from a liver tumor operation to play against United -- with the Frenchman being handed the honor of lifting the trophy. ""Even before all of this we all said that our biggest victory, our most important trophy, was the recovery of Abi,"" Alves told UEFA's website. ""We put on a spectacle for everyone who is passionate about football and who loves football -- and I think that people who really like football will be very happy because they have seen a great match."" Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets added: ""We suffered a bit at the beginning, and at the end, but by then the match was already decided for us. ""I think it was an almost perfect game -- we had lots of possession and moved the ball very well. Thanks to that we managed to win.""","Lionel Messi hails the performance of his Barcelona teammates at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- A legal defense fund for Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, charged with 17 murders in a shooting rampage in an Afghan village, has been established, his wife said Saturday. With the support of Bales' extended family, wife Kari formed The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales Legal Defense Fund, she said in a statement Saturday. Regarding the alleged March 11 massacre in Afghanistan, Kari Bales said she ""has no more information about what happened other than what the government and media have released."" She said she ""cannot even come close to covering the legal costs and fees that will accrue."" ""Contributions to the defense fund are welcome only from donors who (1.) grieve with Mrs. Bales over the lives that were lost that night, and (2.) believe that in America everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Over time, the truth will come out. That's why we have due process under the laws of our country. Unfortunately, due process is very expensive,"" Kari Bales' statement said. Contributions to the defense fund, at P.O. Box 2774, Seattle, Washington, 98111, aren't tax deductible, she said. In addition to the 17 charges of murder ""with premeditation,"" 38-year-old Staff Sgt. Bales faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault. Authorities say Bales left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district early March 11 and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers. U.S. and Afghan officials initially said 16 people died in those attacks. Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, on Friday said only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder. There was no immediate indication as to where the other fatality came from, besides the fact it was an adult, and Afghan government officials in Kabul have said they have no record of another death. The six people wounded in the shootings are four children, one woman and one man, according to the charge sheet against Bales. Two of those have been released from a hospital, said Ahmad Javed Faisal, a Kandahar provincial government spokesman. At the minimum, Bales would be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole if he's convicted on even one of the 17 murder charges, according to a statement from the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan public affairs office. At the maximum, he could face the death penalty. The Taliban, in an e-mail Friday to CNN, vowed ""strong revenge"" for the attacks and claimed justice won't be served in U.S. courts, which they said ""are not reliable."" The Islamic fundamentalist group, which been battling coalition and Afghan government forces for years, believes that ""tens of American soldiers, and not one person"" are responsible for the killings, according to the message. ""We don't believe in these (American) courts and reject the decision,"" the Taliban said. ""We will take practical revenge on every single American soldier."" Bales, who was returned to the United States last week, is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.","Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales' wife, Kari, says couple can't cover legal costs .

"(CNN) -- Elected with the largest margin of victory in the history of Taiwan's presidential elections, President Ma Ying-jeou is aiming to bring the good times back to Taiwan while looking to a friendlier future with China. Smiling through it: President Ma Ying-jeou has some tough challenges ahead. Winning 58 percent of the vote, Ma was swept to victory on the promise of economic growth but through the more controversial method of building closer ties with China. With the backdrop of economic depression Ma's calls to reinvigorate the economy by freer trade and improved relations with China proved stronger than the fears that those ties could lead to a loss in independence. Nevertheless, with a message of rapprochement, the charismatic former mayor of Taipei has a tough job on his hands in his first presidency. Born in Hong Kong in 1950, Ma studied at Harvard Law School and worked as a lawyer in New York in 1981 before returning Taiwan. He held a number of posts in government ministries from 1988, including Minister for Justice for three years from 1993. However, it was not until he was elected mayor of Taipei in 1998 that he emerged as a potential future president, and he was elected as chairman of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's Nationalist party, in July 2005. Yet having built up a solid reputation in Taiwan's notoriously volatile political culture, his image was tarnished by allegations of corruption while mayor of Taipei in 2006. It was alleged that he had misappropriated around $340,000, and after resigning his position as head of the Kuomintang to fight the charges, he was finally cleared of all allegations in 2007. With a clear mandate and popular support he occupies a unique position in Asian politics; TIME Magazine has said he is in the rare position of being a politician who has the ""opportunity to shape the destiny not only of their own nation but also of an entire region."" Moving swiftly to build stronger links, the first regular direct flights for nearly 60 years between China and Taipei resumed on July 4. Ma's administration hopes that Chinese tourists from the mainland will boost the sluggish tourism industry and talks are already underway to increase the number of weekly flights. In a further signal of détente, Guangdong province in China has offered the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung two white tigers as a symbol of improved relations. Allaying fears, breaking down generations of mistrust and making Taiwan's economy roar again will be the considerable challenges of Ma's administration; the former barrister will have to use all his negotiating skills to try and fulfill his ambitions.","Taiwan's premier, Ma Ying-jeou, elected by biggest margin in history .

"(CNN) -- Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to redeploy some troops away from the site of a border temple at the center of a tense military standoff in its second week. Thai soldiers take a rest near the Preah Vihear temple in Preah Vihear province. The decision came after the two sides met to resolve the impasse. Government officials from both nations plan to meet again to decide how many troops will remain at the site of the Preah Vihear temple, the Thai News Agency reported Monday. At a later meeting, the two sides plan to discuss how to tackle the thorny issue at the center of the ongoing dispute -- the question of whether land around the temple belongs to Thailand or Cambodia. The 11th century temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. The two countries differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia. The decision to redeploy troops took place after a Monday meeting in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Last week, an eight-hour meeting between Thai and Cambodian officials ended with both sides agreeing on only one point: that troops each country has amassed at the site of the temple will not fire on each other. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 sq. km) area around it was never fully demarcated. Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. This month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. says has outstanding universal value. The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple. Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985, portrayed the U.N. recognition as a national triumph in the run-up to the general elections. Analysts believe that the nationalist sentiments stirred up by the military standoff helped Hun Sen's ruling party win enough seats in Sunday's parliamentary elections so that it can form a government without the need for a coalition. The current flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory. Cambodia claims Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denies that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory.","Cambodia, Thailand to redeploy some troops away from the site of a border temple .

"(EW.com) -- What's the appropriate soundtrack for kids killing kids? That's one of many tough questions that Grammy-winning producer T Bone Burnett had to answer while overseeing this set of songs inspired by the movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel about tweens and teens forced to fight to the death. Fans of the book might imagine its bow-hunting heroine, Katniss Everdeen, slinging arrows to the strains of something decidedly punk-rock. Personally, I'd like to think of her blasting Bikini Kill's ''Rebel Girl'' while she takes out Cato, Clove, Glimmer, and anyone else who underestimates her talent for ripping out tender teenage hearts and entrails. But what puts Burnett in the mood for some good old-fashioned child sacrificing, apparently, is...folk. Or rather, as Taylor Swift recently told EW, ''Appalachian music 300 years from now -- what Americana and bluegrass music would sound like in the future.'' With everyone from Arcade Fire to Maroon 5 on ""The Hunger Games"" Soundtrack, that's a tall order -- though certainly Swift's sweet lullaby ''Safe & Sound,'' backed by breakout Nashville duo the Civil Wars, fits the ''Americana'' part. When she sings to an unlucky fighter, ''Just close your eyes/You'll be alright,'' she sounds like she's finally broken out of fairy-tale-princess territory to real adulthood. Elsewhere, the Decemberists' furious ''One Engine'' and Punch Brothers' pretty ''Dark Days'' carry on the mournful fingerpicking. They're lovely songs, but all that semi-acoustic brooding makes you wonder if ''Appalachian music 300 years from now'' is the same as it ever was. Far more engaging are the artists who imagine they've seen Katniss' future, and all they can say is ''Go back.'' Haunted by gorgeously sad Southern-belle harmonies from Miranda Lambert and her fellow shotgun-toting Pistol Annies, ''Run Daddy Run'' is deeply ominous, a song to sing when ''you hear the devil drawin' near.'' Best of all is Kid Cudi's gothic rap-rock epic ''The Ruler and the Killer,'' which feels every bit as dystopian as Collins' book. With chest-pounding military drums and a menacing Big Brother refrain (''You don't talk/You'll say nothing, okay?''), it doesn't sound anything like Burnett's kinder, gentler vision for the soundtrack. And maybe that's why it totally captures the spirit of the film: If there's one thing that the warriors of District 12 hate just as much as the regular kids who love ""The Hunger Games,"" it's respecting authority.

"(CNN) -- The new nation of South Sudan plans to relocate its capital from the bustling main city of Juba to a smaller town in the north. Moving the capital to the town of Ramciel will provide more room for expansion, the government said in a news release on its website. It did not offer a time frame for the expansion, but said the planning ministry is initiating the process required to implement the resolution. Phone calls to the information minister for details went unanswered early Monday. Ramciel is in Lakes state, about 140 miles north of the current capital. South Sudan gained its independence from the north in July, officially breaking Africa's largest nation into two. Despite South Sudan lagging behind in most development indices and lacking basic infrastructure, Juba has attracted investors from all over the world since the split.","Moving the capital to Ramciel will provide more room for expansion, the government says .

"(CNN) -- Classically trained ballet dancer Riyo Mori had dreams of dancing on Broadway, but her plans suddenly changed when, aged 21, she won the Miss Universe beauty pageant. Riyo Mori is a trained ballet dancer and plans to open her own dance school. Mori was born on December 1986 in Shizuoka, Japan. Her mother is a dance instructor and Mori began dancing when she was four, soon showing she had inherited her mother's ability. While her mother taught jazz dance, tap dance and modern dance, Mori chose ballet as her own medium, and when she was just 16, Mori moved to Canada to study at Quinte Ballet School of Canada. She was set to continue dancing at the Broadway Dance Center in New York, when her grandmother convinced her to enter the Miss Universe beauty pageant. Mori traveled to Mexico City in May 2007 and beat 76 other contestants to claim the coveted Miss Universe crown. After being named Miss Universe, Mori's life became one of airports, interviews, photoshoots and TV appearances. She has traveled the world as a goodwill ambassador and supported numerous charities. Mori says of herself, ""I think I have a samurai soul. I'm very patient and I can serve others."" In October 2007, Mori landed a spot on MTV reality show ""Pageant Place,"" for which she shared a house with Rachel Smith (Miss USA 2007), Katie Blair (Miss Teen USA 2006) and Hilary Cruz (Miss Teen USA 2007). In July 2008, Mori traveled to Vietnam to pass on her crown to Miss Universe 2008, Dayana Mendoza of Venezuela. Mori says that dancing is her true love, adding ""dancing is great because this is how I express myself -- this is where I learn how to be confident."" But she has shown an interest in acting, auditioning for a role in U.S. TV series ""Heroes,"" and it may be that Mori will one day swap Tokyo for Hollywood. Mori still dreams of dancing on Broadway and has plans to open a dance school, saying ""I want to teach the young generation, through dancing, how to be positive, patient and happy. These three things are very important to me."" Still only 22 years old, you get the feeling that anything is possible for this beauty queen with ""a samurai soul.""","Riyo Mori was born in Shizuoka, Japan, and was crowned Miss Universe in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- No one teaches reporters how to cover a war, much less wars that include genocide. Most of us rely on the wisdom of experienced colleagues and a lot of on-the-job training. CNN's Christiane Amanpour in a Sarajevo cemetery; she returned to Bosnia for ""Scream Bloody Murder."" My first war assignment -- Bosnia, in the 1990s -- included visits to the Sarajevo morgue to see the bodies. How else would a journalist know exactly how many Muslim children were cut down by Bosnian Serb snipers? How else could we put names to civilians left faceless by mortar shells from the surrounding hills? I learned what it means to bear witness. I found my voice and my mission in Bosnia. I learned to seek the facts, to tell the truth no matter how difficult or unpopular. I learned that objectivity meant covering all sides and giving all sides their hearing, but never to draw a false moral equivalence when none exists. I learned never to equate victims with their aggressors. I learned that there are limits to the style of journalism that goes: ""On the one hand, on the other hand."" Most of all, I learned that as reporters our words and our actions have consequences and that we must use this powerful platform, television, responsibly. But how many times have people asked me, when I've come back from a place like Bosnia or Rwanda: Is it really that bad? I have found that many people want to believe that I am exaggerating. I guess they do not want to believe such evil can exist. Or perhaps they just do not want to be pushed into that moral space where they would have to take a stand and do something. Genocide is hard to imagine -- despite all we know about the Holocaust. Or perhaps, ironically, as a result of it being the most documented event in modern history. Many people now believe that if the extermination is not done on the Nazis' industrial scale or is less than complete, it is not genocide. They are wrong. Genocide is mass murder with the intent to wipe out a significant part of an ethnic, religious or national group. It means killing people not because of what they did, but because of who they are. It is the world's most heinous crime. And it continues, despite an international treaty written 60 years ago this month. With a unanimous vote on December 9, 1948, the fledgling United Nations adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. The signatories committed themselves to act, although the convention does not say what intervention is required. And sure enough, instead of using the convention as a springboard to action, political leaders in the ensuing years have invoked reason after reason not to stop the bloodshed. If there is any hopeful sign, it is in the voices of people with the emotional and intellectual courage to stand up and scream bloody murder -- often at personal or professional risk. Some are members of the political establishment who believe that doing the right thing is also the pragmatic thing to do. Others are ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. What makes them do it? Over the course of filming a two-hour documentary, I found a few common threads. Unlike politicians who make policy from the detachment of their national capitals, these men and women have been on the front lines. Like Father François Ponchaud, a French missionary in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, they have seen the victims' suffering first hand. Like Peter Galbraith, an idealistic staff member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee who wanted the U.S. to punish Saddam Hussein for using chemical weapons against the Kurds, they are convinced that the accounts of refugees are true. And like Richard Holbrooke, a U.S. diplomat whose Jewish grandfather fled Germany when Hitler came to power, they see where action -- sometimes military action -- can make a difference. None considered himself a hero. And some, like Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who led a U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, believe they did not do enough. Dallaire was one of those good men who put on a uniform and felt that it meant something, that he was actually there to make a difference. Unfortunately, he was sent to Rwanda with an impossible mandate and without the backing of the international community. He was helpless to stop the slaughter of 800,000 to 1 million ethnic Tutsis at the hands of their Hutu countrymen. Imagine if that had happened to you or me? How would we be able to live with ourselves? iReport.com: Have a question for Amanpour? Send it in . In any single crisis, I can understand that political leaders are under pressure not to intervene. But stepping back to look at the consistent pattern, one must ask: Is it acceptable? In the 1970s, the Carter administration touted human rights as a core value in U.S. foreign policy, but knew that military intervention against the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia was politically inconceivable after the disastrous war in Vietnam. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration was courting Iraq as an ally against Iran and as a market for U.S. exports when Saddam Hussein was gassing the Kurds; a punishing trade embargo would have destroyed the budding relationship. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration would not take military action against the Bosnian Serbs without backing from the European allies.  Watch Bosnia's president discuss the 1991 U.N. arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia » . And some U.S. officials even avoided characterizing the slaughter in Rwanda in 1994 as genocide lest it lead to a call for action under the U.N. Genocide Convention.  Military force: The last resort? Or the first resort? » . But three years into the Bosnian war -- after the massacre at Srebrenica -- the U.S. finally forged a coalition of previously reluctant allies to bomb the Bosnian Serb military positions. They stopped the war, then led the peace process and the peace enforcement that has survived to this day. And because we the press, the storytellers, finally made it impossible for our Western democratic governments to tolerate mass murder of men, women and children in the age of 24/7 satellite TV, 3½ years later, the U.S. led its allies in a pre-emptive strike against genocide in Kosovo. NATO, established to protect the West during the Cold War, had launched its largest military strike -- for a purely humanitarian mission. And today, there is a grassroots American movement that has brought the genocide in Darfur to such prominence. We're always told that evil happens when good men do nothing. And the question -- my question as a reporter and as a witness to history is: Will we ever learn? Or will I or my children or my successors be reporting on this same kind of atrocity and inhumanity for years and years to come? This is what I don't understand about the human race. So thank goodness for the few good men and women who summon the courage to do something in the face of evil, to stand up and confront it. They give me hope.","CNN's Christiane Amanpour traveled the globe for documentary on genocide .

"(CNN) -- The head of Dublin-based budget airline Ryanair says that airport operators are holding the aviation industry back -- and describes the average airport as an unnecessary ""international shopping center."" Michael O'Leary, CEO of the carrier he described as ""the McDonald's"" of air travel, told CNN airport operators were hampering the growth of low-cost flight by leveling unrealistic charges on airlines. He questioned the need for the current model of airport, saying changes in technology had rendered many of their operations obsolete. ""If you look at it, we don't really need airports to do much any more,"" he said. ""[The] airport terminal serves very few purposes any more, except that it is an international shopping center, owned and run by rich airports."" Costs could be reduced by simplifying the existing model, he said. ""Check in on the website, arrive at the airport, get through security very quickly, and board your plane,"" he said. ""People want to arrive, get on a plane and fly. They want to spend time at destinations, not waste it at airports."" O'Leary said airports could no longer justify many of the costs they passed on to carriers. ""In the old regulated environment, when you had the flag carriers charging high fares, the airports weren't very good at costs and passed it on to the airlines. Those days are over,"" he said. ""Ryanair [flies] people all over Europe at fares that start at Â£10 one way. And if you want those low airfares, we need low airport costs."" He said the problem was a lack of competition, which meant that many state-owned airports in Europe ""still think they have a God-given right to charge"" high prices for airlines to use their facilities. ""We think the way forward is much lower airport fees and much more rapid traffic growth, much more tourism and job growth,"" he said. Preferably, main centers could support a number of competing local airports, in the way London passengers had the option of Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton. ""It is a better model,"" he said. ""The competition between the airports keeps prices down, keeps services more efficient, and offers you ultimately more choice and lower prices."" He said the European aviation industry was undergoing a ""big change,"" and splitting into two sectors. He predicted the ""three high-fare connecting carriers"" -- British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France -- would triumph at the top end of the market, while Ryanair would dominate the low-cost carrier sector. ""I think you see most of the other flag carriers recognize that they can't compete with Ryanair,"" he said. O'Leary said while Ryanair was affected by the current economic climate, and particularly by high oil prices, the airline tended to do well during economic downturns. ""What happens in a recession, and what happened in the last three downturns in Europe [is that] Ryanair has grown faster. Because people do not stop flying in Europe because of a recession,"" he said. ""You see people get much more price sensitive, [going] to the lowest price operator, so if they are flying, they fly Ryanair."" ""McDonald's does well in a recession. We are the McDonald's, the Ikea, of the airline business.""","Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, blames airports for hampering the aviation industry .

"(CNN) -- A few minutes of what was considered online fun, and one person is dead. Another is convicted of invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. When Rutgers student Dharun Ravi set up a spycam to catch roommate Tyler Clementi in a same-sex romantic moment, and when he tweeted about it and his plans to do it again, little did he think that Clementi would commit suicide or that he would face serious jail time and deportation. Ravi is learning his lesson the hard way. There are lessons for all of us: . What you do online can hurt people. Despite the adage about sticks and stones, words can and do hurt -- especially when anyone can publish information that reaches millions. The Internet is full of homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic content. At a minimum, hate speech is online pollution, but it can go much further. It reinforces stereotypes and strengthens the belief that singling out ""the other"" for abuse is acceptable. Hate speech can harden low self-esteem and intimidate its targets -- and even lead people to commit suicide. Online bystanders have a responsibility. Some students in the Rutgers dorm were amused by Ravi's spycam-Twitter scheme. Others ignored it. They should have been outraged, and they should have done something about it. ""If you see something, say something"" is not an admonition restricted to the security realm. Tools are online for each of us to flag and report content that is objectionable. Many online companies have staffs to review such reports and to take action, from removing the offensive content to ejecting the person who posted it. Each of us should take responsibility to combat hate-filled content. Speak up: Clicking to report hate speech to an online host is not all we can do. Justice Louis Brandeis, in a 1927 Supreme Court case, extolled the virtues of ""counter-speech"" to address objectionable speech. That pre-Internet admonition applies full force to online messages today. Hate speech legitimizes discrimination, and many of the people who post it believe no one objects. So object. Speak up to counter the lies of hate speech or the inappropriate online conduct directed at minorities. Just as the Internet provides thoughtless haters with broadcasting tools, each of us has those same tools at our disposal. A little counter-speech can go a long way. It's time to get serious about cyber-literacy and ethics. The lack of education in schools about the rules that apply to online posting is appalling. Kids are left to their own devices, literally, with little guidance. Given the power in everyone's hands to cause injury -- and to be injured -- schools should provide serious discussions of what is appropriate online behavior. We are well past the time when adults can think of themselves as the digital immigrants who don't fully understand new technologies, compared with their kids, the digital natives who better understand the online world. Privacy is a shared responsibility. Discussions about privacy usually revolve around consumer privacy and protection. But in this era of social media, when everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster, individual responsibility to respect privacy should be the focus. Most people would know that secretly setting up a webcam to spy on someone is wrong. But posting embarrassing photos and videos and making thoughtless comments can be a wrongful invasion of privacy as well. Each of us has a responsibility to consider the privacy implications of what we do online. Homophobia is not funny. Finally, while young straight people today are much more accepting of gay people, an undercurrent of homophobia remains. Ravi most likely would not have set up a webcam to catch his roommate making out with a girl, nor would he have tweeted about it. In some quarters, the put-down ""That's so gay"" is still common parlance. Many think of gays and lesbians as ""the other"" and fair game for jokes. Racist and anti-Semitic jokes still have currency. Ravi may have thought what he was doing to his roommate was funny, but he now knows it was anything but, for Clementi and for himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf.","Rutgers tragedy after webcam intrusion: One person convicted, another dead .

"(CNN) -- New laws going into effect Sunday cover some of the nation's most contentious issues, from immigration to abortion, while others deal with tanning beds, tuition and where you can sell a pet. In all, nearly 40,000 laws were enacted in 2011, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some take effect New Year's Day. Among them is a controversial California provision requiring that schools add ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans"" to the list of those whose contributions ""to the development of California and the United States"" must be taught in schools. Another California law adds ""gender identity and gender expression"" to the list of characteristics that require equal rights. New laws in Delaware and Hawaii make same-sex couples eligible for civil unions and grant them the same rights and benefits as married couples under the law, the legislature group said. NCSL: New state laws for the new year . In New Hampshire, starting January 1, minors will have to inform a parent before getting an abortion or seek a court order to avoid parental notification. Gov. John Lynch had vetoed the bill, saying there must be an exception for rape, incest and abuse. The legislature overrode his veto. New laws in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia require businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to ensure that employees are eligible to work in the United States, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. California, meanwhile, is prohibiting any state or local government office from requiring that employers use E-Verify, unless it is required by federal law as a condition of receiving federal funds. E-Verify is a controversial program designed to check a prospective employee's citizenship or immigration status. Supporters say it helps businesses avoid unintentionally hiring illegal immigrants. Critics complain that it is expensive to operate, pushes undocumented workers further underground, and is not always accurate. Some laws ahead for the new year focus on health issues. One in California prohibits the production or sale of beer to which caffeine has been added. Another in the state would prohibit the sale of dextromethorphan, or DXM, to minors without a prescription. DXM is in many over-the-counter cough suppressants, but it has been used as a recreational drug, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. California also will ban stores from selling expired infant food and formula. Another law in California focuses on school athletes suspected of having a concussion or head injury. A school must remove the athlete from that activity and not allow him or her to resume until clearance is given by a health care provider. Many of the new laws cited by the legislature group are in California, including one prohibiting the use of ultraviolet tanning devices by minors and another making it a crime to sell ""a live animal on any street, highway, public right-of-way, parking lot, carnival, or boardwalk."" Both Oregon and California will prohibit the sale of shark fins in the new year. Oregon is requiring state colleges and universities to waive tuition and fees for foster children under age 25. Some new state laws amend crime provisions. Kentucky will require that certain inmates convicted of drug crimes serve the final six months of their sentences in the community, under supervision. Oregon will require ignition interlock devices -- computerized breath analyzers -- for people convicted of driving under the influence and people who are under intoxicant diversion agreements, which allow prosecution on a DUI charge to be delayed. And more states are joining a nationwide movement for tougher laws against distracted driving. Nevada will prohibit all drivers from texting and using handheld devices, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. North Dakota is banning drivers under age 18 from using cell phones in their cars and barring all drivers from texting.","Nearly 40,000 laws were enacted in 2011, according to legislature group .

"(EW.com) -- They've been separated for about a year-and-a-half , but Courteney Cox and David Arquette are proving once again they have no hard feelings. EW confirms a report that Arquette is set to guest star on ""Cougar Town's"" season 3 finale as a concierge who crosses paths with Jules (Cox) and [spoiler alert] her bridal party. As you might now, this season, (FINALLY) starting February 14, will see Cox's character getting engaged to Grayson (which, creator Bill Lawrence recently joked with EW, ""pretty much makes it the worst [show] title in the history of television""). All of this, of course, comes at the end of a season riddled with as much fun as there is wine in the veins of the cul-de-sac crew. But what exactly is in store? In addition to what EW scooped up out at TCA, here's some more intel for you to drink up (some of which loyal readers of EW's Spoiler Room are already privy to): . - Travis (Dan Byrd) spends seven episodes in a helmet, following an accident that leaves him with a skull fracture. ""Our loyal fans and the writers and staff of the show hated his hair last year, and I was trying to think of a suitable punishment,"" jokes creator Bill Lawrence. ""He wears a big white foam helmet. But I think not only is it funny, but in a positive way, it teaches this young actor not to have ridiculous hair that people complain about."" Adds Cox: ""I don't know that his hair looks much better now."" - Laurie (Busy Philipps), who will later this season also get a new love interest, opens a cake business after she and Jules part ways. ""That's funny in the way that unfolds,"" Lawrence teases. - Bobby (Brian Van Holt) finds a girlfriend in ""Scrubs'"" Sarah Chalke. ""Besides the fact that I think she's very talented and the episodes are funny, it was fun for Courteney and me and the others to have her around her because she's a friend,"" says Lawrence. - Speaking of ""Scrubs,"" Zach Braff will also appear, but, says Lawrence, ""I can only smile because one of the agreements I always make with friends that do favors for me [is that] when they aren't doing big guest star parts, I [won't] use them to promote the show. But I am allowed to say that it is one little scene this year that will certainly melt the brain of different 'Scrubs' fans."" - Jules and Grayson go to marriage counseling, a storyline, in part, inspired by Cox, according to Lawrence. ""When it comes to shrinks, one of the funniest things, between Courtney and me, is that she's a believer in counseling and therapy and stuff. And I've often heard her tell stories or jokingly say that I should go to therapy with her, so it makes me really laugh -- the idea that Jules not only believes in [therapy] for herself but for the people around her, both to help them and as a threat because they misbehave,"" he says. - There's an appearance from The Worthless Peons, a.k.a. Ted's a cappella band from ""Scrubs."" - Grayson's past comes back to bite him. Two words: Love child. ""We pursued this story last year and for the first two years of Josh Hopkins' character, Grayson, wanting a kid and Courteney's character being up for anything. So as writers, we had to solve that, and I didn't think we wanted to do an adoption story because Courteney did that very well on 'Friends,'"" he said. In fact, Lawrence says, that's the situation they often run into. ""One of the worst things about working with Courteney Cox is that every time you come up with what you think is a big funny interpersonal story, someone in the writer's room -- because they all loved her on 'Friends' -- will be like 'Yeah, that's like when Chandler and Monica adopted a baby... ' And I'm like 'Shut up, I'm going to kill you.' I'm not as familiar with 'Friends' as I should be. I would have watched it constantly, but one of the people that created that show fired me early on, so I stopped watching it out of spite."" ""You think I don't have a filter?!"" Cox responds with a laugh. ""YOU don't have a filter."" See the full article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- The European Union imposed fresh sanctions Friday on Bashar al-Assad's inner circle as the familiar sounds of gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria. Ratcheting up pressure, the EU froze the assets of al-Assad's wife, Asma, and his mother, sister and sister-in-law, an EU spokesman said. The women, among a dozen Syrians added to the sanctions list, are also banned from travel to EU nations, although London-born Asma al-Assad cannot be barred entry into Britain despite the EU ban. ""I cannot say to you in strong enough terms how much we are concerned about what's going on in Syria,"" said Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief. ""I'm really worried about the escalating spiral of violence there."" She said sanctions should never be underestimated as an important tool. ""Sanctions make a significant difference because they do two things: One is they target individuals and entities in ways that prevent them from carrying on their business as usual, and secondly, they make a strong political statement about how the international community feels about what's going on,"" she said. The United States, the EU, the Arab League, Turkey and Japan have already slapped sanctions on Syria in an effort to deflate al-Assad's ability to finance attacks on his own people. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland cheered the EU freeze on Friday, saying it sent a strong message. The bloodshed, however, has continued unabated. Syrian forces took aim in rebel strongholds Friday as the opposition urged Syrians to take to the streets of Damascus to bring the fight to the capital. The opposition is calling for ""We are coming to Damascus"" demonstrations as part of its desire to take the protests and, more important, the fight to al-Assad's stronghold. At least 54 people were killed Friday, including three children, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The organization said security forces were heavily deployed in Damascus and were firing tear gas and live ammunition in several neighborhoods. It reported fighting across Syrian cities including Homs, Daraa, Hama, Idlib and Aleppo. The attacks on Friday, Islam's day of prayer, targeted mosques in many of those cities, the Local Coordination Committees said. In recent days, close to 9,000 people have received aid -- such as food, blankets and mattresses -- in Idlib and Homs provinces, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. ""The impact of fighting on the humanitarian situation has increased significantly since December. People have been killed or wounded and tens of thousands have fled their homes, leaving behind most of their belongings,"" according to a Red Cross statement. Meanwhile, Kofi Annan, the U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria, planned to visit Moscow and Beijing this weekend for talks on the Syrian crisis, his spokesman said Friday. The U.N. Security Council this week urged immediate implementation of a peace plan proposed by Annan. The 15-member body, including China and Russia, expressed full support for Annan's efforts. Russia and China have vetoed Security Council attempts to pass resolutions condemning the al-Assad regime for its clampdown. The two countries said they want the violence to stop but argued that previous resolutions were not evenhanded. Both have major trade deals with Syria, and again Friday they refused to condemn al-Assad's regime formally by voting against a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution that condemns ""appalling human rights violations in Syria."" The resolution passed 41-3, with Cuba casting the other negative vote. British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt called the resolution another ""very clear signal"" that the international community will not tolerate human rights violations by al-Assad's regime. Among the dead Friday were a 17-year-old and an elderly woman who were killed in heavy shelling in the besieged city of Homs, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two people, including a 22-year-old in Douma, were killed by direct fire from snipers. Homs has been a hotbed of anti-government sentiment during the yearlong uprising against the Syrian regime. The opposition said the corpses of 39 people killed this month were recovered from the city's Refaie district Wednesday. The Syrian government, which routinely blames the violence on ""armed terrorist groups,"" said a child and his brother were killed by one such group Thursday in Homs. Three people were also wounded in the attack, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Funeral services were held Friday for four soldiers and a civilian, reportedly killed by terrorists, SANA said. In northern Aleppo province, heavy fighting was reported in and around Izaz, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. The opposition is attempting to the strike back at al-Assad in Damascus after last week's clashes in the capital. The opposition believes that gaining a stronghold in Damascus would change the nature of the conflict, with al-Assad being forced to defend his positions within the city rather than take the fight to other provinces. Friday's protests were promoted on Facebook, and they come a day after an al Qaeda-linked website posted a statement from a group calling itself Jabhat al-Nasra claiming responsibility for a recent bombing in Damascus. The statement said it was the group's first news release. The rebel Free Syrian Army and Syrian National Council have pointed fingers at the Syrian government, saying they believe the regime set up a proxy group to take the blame. U.N. officials have said the Syrian conflict has killed more than 8,000 people, while opposition activists put the toll at more than 10,000. CNN's Saad Abedine and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 54 people were killed Friday, says an opposition group .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Soccer fans have never been shy about expressing their opinions, but this year's World Cup in South Africa -- which will be the first of the ""social media age"" according to many -- may see record levels of global interactivity. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were in their infancy in 2006, when the last World Cup took place in Germany, but have since exploded in popularity. Social media now connects millions around the world -- 50 million tweets are sent daily while Facebook boasts more than 400 million active users -- a development that will allow fans separated by distance to celebrate goals or critique referee decisions together online. ""Football is the world's biggest sport, so the world will practically stop for the month of the World Cup,"" Matt Stone, head of new media for world soccer's governing body FIFA, told CNN. ""There will be so much more media consumed, used and published in 2010 than in 2006. Social media can bring fans closer together and give fans more opportunity to communicate with each other,"" he added. FIFA has its own social-networking service on FIFA.com -- called ""The Club"" -- which has 1.6 million members, but the organization is about to make a bigger push into social media. Stone said that Facebook Connect, which allows Web sites to be shared on Facebook, will be incorporated into FIFA.com and that FIFA plans to launch official Twitter accounts for the World Cup too. Stone would not give specifics but he said the accounts may include tweets from people in the ""top echelons"" of FIFA. Could that mean tweets from FIFA president Sepp Blatter himself? Stone wouldn't say, but he promised some ""exciting announcements in May."" Regardless of who does the tweeting for FIFA, expect to see a lot of tweets flying back and forth between fans when the action starts on June 11. The match between the United States and England on the tournament's second day should be particularly fun to monitor on Twitter. ""Our notion is that [the World Cup] will eclipse everything we have seen so far [on Twitter] including the U.S. election, the Oscars or the Super Bowl, simply because it is so international,"" Robin Sloan, a Twitter employee that works on media partnerships, told CNN. Sloan suspects that during the month-long tournament, terms related to the World Cup will rank highly among the service's ""Trending Topics,"" a measure of the most popular discussions on Twitter. And during the last few days of the tournament, he expects World Cup discussion to ""absolutely take over Twitter."" So far, many fans have been using the Twitter hash tag#WC2010 when they tweet about the World Cup. Although Twitter is based in the U.S., where soccer is not as popular in other parts of the world, the service is seeing its fastest growth outside of America, Sloan said. The service is now available in six languages, there are plans to add more, and a recent report found that only half of all tweets are in English. Twitter is also striking deals with mobile providers in other countries so that it is free for subscribers to send and receive tweets on their phones. Sloan said this is particularly important in countries such as South Africa, where access to computers and smart phones is limited. And it won't be just fans tweeting about the World Cup. Several top players including Brazil star Kaka and Landon Donovan of the U.S. are active on Twitter. Stone said FIFA has issued guidelines that players should not tweet from inside the World Cup stadiums, and it is up to individual nations to impose further restrictions. Already, England coach Fabio Capello has reportedly banned his players from posting to Twitter or Facebook during the World Cup. When there is a great goal, or a controversial penalty, fans will likely turn to video sharing site YouTube to watch the watch plays, create parody or ""mashup"" videos and record their own reactions. ""Things like the World Cup really excite us because we see a level of engagement and interaction beyond what we normally see,"" YouTube's sports manager Andrew Bangs told CNN. ""Within minutes of the World Cup starting, we will certainly see thousands and thousands of uploads about the World Cup."" In 2006, after French player Zinedine Zidane head-butted Marco Materazzi of Italy, hundreds of videos parodying the play were posted on YouTube. Some videos placed Zidane in a video game while others showed him in well-known movie scenes. YouTube's popularity has surged since 2006 thanks in part to the advent of inexpensive video cameras and cell phones that can record and instantly upload video to the Web. Bangs predicts there will be more mashups and parodies during the World Cup as well as videos examining the political implications of an African nation hosting the tournament for the first time. He also says there will be lots of videos where fans put the camera on top of their television and record themselves reacting to a goal or red card decision, a relatively new phenomenon. ""We will see no limit to the uses and creativity that emerge around the World Cup,"" Bangs said. Be sure to follow @WorldCupCNN on Twitter for all the latest World Cup news and information.","FIFA has social-networking service called ""The Club"" with 1.6 million members .

"Statins did not help protect against Alzheimer's disease in a study released in 2008. Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins are often hailed as ""wonder drugs."" But a study published in the January 2008 issue of the journal Neurology says they don't protect the brain against Alzheimer's disease. What is Alzheimer's? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps (amyloid plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles) made up of misplaced proteins. These plaques and tangles destroy cognition, personality and the ability to function. Sometimes forgetfulness and loss of concentration are confused with normal aging, the single biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. But an autopsy is always going to give you a definitive measure of the disease. How was the study done? Gupta: Fairly large observational study looked at some 900 members of the clergy -- priests and nuns. Some were taking statins, some not. Not only did patients undergo cognitive tests for 12 years, but they also agreed to a brain autopsy when they died. The conclusion here, supported by these autopsies, is that statins did not help protect against Alzheimer's disease, a finding somewhat contrary to the prevailing wisdom in this area of Alzheimer's research. We spoke to the head of Alzheimer's research at Mayo Clinic. He said that first, this is a population of nuns and priests -- would it be different in folks who take statins but also smoke and drink? Maybe. He also said, when you get right down to it, the numbers of folks in the study that both took statins and had autopsies is pretty small. Still, he said he knows these researchers well and they are good, just not the last word. And of course, there's the compelling question: Why would statins affect Alzheimer's disease? There are a few schools of thought about the mechanism: Some think statins cross the blood-brain barrier, decreasing cholesterol levels and amyloid levels. Others think they work by lowering overall inflammation in the body. What about other benefits of statins? Does this undermine their ""wonder drug"" status? While this study clearly questions the neuroprotective effects against dementia and Alzheimer's disease, scientists believe they are just beginning to uncover potential new benefits of statins. The most immediately promising benefit of statins appears to be their anti-inflammatory properties, which help stabilize the lining of blood vessels. This has potentially far-reaching effects, from the brain and heart to blood vessels and organs throughout the body. Other benefits of statins may include prevention of arthritis and bone fractures, prevention of colon cancer and protection of the kidneys. But we should note, while tolerated well by most people, they do have side effects, including two potentially serious ones: . • Liver damage: Occasionally, statin use causes an increase in liver enzymes and may cause liver damage. • Muscle problems: Statins may cause muscle pain and tenderness (statin myopathy). Also, there are some gastrointestinal issues, including nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Are there ways other than statins to lower cholesterol? The simple B vitamin niacin raises good cholesterol, but there's an interesting side effect: Some forms of niacin, especially in high doses -- 1,000 milligrams or more -- do cause temporary flushing of the skin. While annoying, flushing is not harmful. Aspirin can counteract this flushing effect. Versions of niacin with reduced flushing effects also are available by prescription. Also, studies have shown exercise in general, especially in overweight people, can improve HDL levels. There is some evidence that strength-training exercises that build muscle mass can also improve HDL. Of course, diet. Saturated fats are one of the biggest contributors to cholesterol in the body. A diet high in saturated fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol -- so knock that off!",Bottom Line: Experts at the Mayo Clinic say this study is not the last word on the subject.
"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Their faces and darker skins make them look different. They are routinely called ""slave"" by the majority, whatever their profession. But Iraq's black population hopes that Barack Obama's rise to the White House will mark a turning point for minorities not just in the United States, but also in their country. Jalal Thiyab Thijeel quotes Barack Obama, saying it is time for ""change."" Jalal Thiyab Thijeel, general secretary of the ""Movement of Free Iraqis,"" followed every detail of Obama's election campaign. ""Inspiring,"" he calls it. Inspiring politically, and personally. Like Obama, Thijeel has family roots in Africa. ""We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world,"" he recalls. ""We're going to make him a model to follow. Even our old women were praying for him to win."" When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party. It was a moment, he tells me as we talk on a street in Baghdad, that he'll never forget. ""Now we, the dark-skinned people, feel even closer to the American people because Obama is one of us."" Thijeel's organization estimates there are approximately 2 million black Iraqis. The country's total population is more than 28 million, most of them ethnic Arabs. It's impossible to verify Thijeel's estimate, since the government does not keep statistics on race, but there is no denying there are many black Iraqis in the southern city of Basra. Their history goes back 1,000 years to the time when Africans were brought as slaves to the south of Iraq to drain marshes and build Basra. Many Iraqis still call blacks ""abed,"" an Arabic word that means ""slave."" Thijeel grimaces when he pronounces it. It's demeaning, he says, and he wants the government to forbid its use. Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is. ""I never want my son to go through this,"" he says.  Watch what Obama means to some Iraqis » . He also wants his son -- and his daughters -- to have access to good jobs, something that is not the case now, he says. In Basra, many black Iraqis have menial jobs. Although no one can point to any official discrimination, there are no black members of the Iraqi parliament. The Movement of Free Iraqis was founded two years ago and on January 31 it will run the first slate of black candidates in Iraq's modern history. Thijeel hands me the party's documents that spell out its demands. Foremost is that the government recognize blacks as an official minority in Iraq. This is key, because power in Iraq is apportioned along ethnic, religious and even tribal lines. The party also wants an apology for slavery, although it is not asking for financial reparations. The movement also wants laws to combat racial discrimination. The party has found some nonblack political allies. Awad Al-Abdan of the National Dialogue Front says, ""There's been social oppression for a long time. We have a tribal-based society and, according to traditions and customs, the black man is considered to have lower status."" Some white Iraqis say that founding a political party on racial lines is divisive, especially when Iraqis of different communities need to pull together. But Thijeel, quoting Barack Obama, says it's time for change. Although he's speaking in Arabic, he uses the English word ""change."" ""There's a change in international politics,"" he tells me. ""Obama won, and not that long ago, in his country, black people were marginalized, so this event has shattered all barriers.""","Iraqis of African descent are marginalized by society, called ""slave""
Obama's victory makes black Iraqis feel closer to U.S., one says .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Australia's Qantas Airways said Tuesday its flights are back to normal after a government labor board ordered it to end a dispute with its unions that grounded the airline over the weekend. ""Qantas sincerely regrets the impact on customers of industrial action over recent months and looks forward to a rapid recovery and period of stability,"" the airline said in a statement. Most international passengers were accommodated on flights Monday and overnight, while the backlog of domestic passengers is expected to be cleared by early Tuesday afternoon, said Qantas, which resumed flights on Monday. The first planes to depart were an international flight from Sydney to Jakarta and a domestic route from Melbourne to Sydney. Some 100,000 passengers were affected by the groundings, said Kira Reed, an airline representative. Labor relations tribunal Fair Work Australia ordered an end to the labor dispute ""to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry"" after Qantas grounded its jets Saturday afternoon. The airline grounded 447 flights and, ahead of the order to end the dispute, had announced it would lock out its unionized pilots; engineers; and ramp, baggage and catering crews effective Monday evening. The dispute with the unions has dragged on for 14 months, the labor board said. Qantas argued that the unions' demands would leave the airline ""seriously impaired or destroyed."" The labor board gave the two sides three weeks to reach an agreement, with a possible three-week extension if talks were making progress. The decision ""provides certainty for Qantas passengers,"" company CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement following the decision. He apologized to passengers. The Australian and International Pilots Association said it hoped for a ""positive outcome"" from the talks, calling the decision to ground the airline a ""gross overreaction"" to its demands. ""It is a sign that the current management has lost touch with the traveling public, its workers and the basic Australian ethos of free speech,"" the union said in a statement. The labor dispute involves three unions representing air and ground staff of Australia's largest domestic and international airline. Union officials have accused Qantas of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. Pay and working conditions have also been at the center of the dispute. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second-oldest airline in the world, and marked its 90th anniversary last year. It employs about 32,500 people and flies to more than 180 destinations worldwide, according to the company website. CNN's Hugh Williams and Pamela Boykoff contributed to this report.","NEW: Qantas says all flights are operating on time .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Hey, Hey It's Esther Blueburger"" is the latest comic creation to emerge from the Australian film market. Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving and Terence Stamp star in the camp classic ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" An unabashed celebration of girlishness, the coming-of-age movie tells the story of Esther, a   bespectacled and awkward teen. Looked down on as nerd at her posh private school, Esther (played by newcomer Danielle Catanzariti) reinvents herself after befriending Sunni, an older girl who goes to the local public school. Bearing a passing resemblance to the runaway U.S. indie hit ""Juno"", ""Esther Blueburger"" could well go on to imitate some of the worldwide success of its hipper American cousin. If the film is to do well, its kitschness can surely only work to its advantage. After all, many of the Australian comedies that have found success with an international audience have relied on more than just a smattering of camp. Oddly, from a country that brought the world ""Mad Max"" and Russell Crowe, many of the biggest comic hits fly in the face of the conventional stereotypes of Australian culture as straight-talking and macho. For every ""Crocodile Dundee"", in other words, there is a ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", riding triumphantly over the horizon ready to unsettle the manhood and steal the laughs into the bargain. It was Paul Hogan's comic creation Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, the laidback survivalist from the outback that first put Australian comic films on the map over 20 years ago. The first ""Crocodile Dundee"" film was released in 1986 to huge commercial success worldwide -- it was the highest grossing film internationally that year -- spawned two sequels and was credited with boosting the Australian tourist industry. A lot of the laughs in the film come from the depiction of Mick Dundee (played by Hogan) as an unreconstructed, Aussie bloke struggling to come to terms with modern metropolitan life when he leaves small town Australia to visit New York. In one scene, for example, Dundee's reaction to meeting a cross-dresser on the streets of the Big Apple is to grab the man's crotch to verify his gender. Crocodile Dundee's comic book version of Australian identity may have worked well in the movie theaters, but it was viewed by many critics as hackneyed and out of touch with the reality of modern Australia. The arrival of the writer and director Baz Luhrmann in the early '90s seemed to breath fresh life into Australian film. The stunning critical and financial success of his debut feature, ""Strictly Ballroom"" in 1992 heralded a string of breakout hits that weren't afraid to show their feminine side. The story of a young ballroom dancer who flouts convention and risks the ire of the judges by dancing his own moves, ""Strictly Ballroom"" provoked a bidding war at the Cannes Film Festival after it won the Prix de Jeunesse award. Alongside a realistic portrayal of Australian small town life, there is a warm-hearted send up of the peculiar world of ballroom dancing. From the sequined costumes to the Cyndi Lauper soundtrack, the movie is also saturated in campness and kitsch. The benchmark set by Luhrmann, whose 2001 stellar musical feature ""Moulin Rouge!"" was also defiantly camp, was matched by ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" in 1994 and by ""Muriel's Wedding"" to a lesser extent the same year. ""Priscilla"" in particular created a huge stir when it was first released. Starring the venerable British actor Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving, it is the story of three drag queens driving across the outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a large bus they have named Priscilla. It has gone on to be regarded as a camp classic -- though perhaps not in South Korea, where it was reportedly banned for fear it might encourage homosexuality. Less overtly camp than ""Priscilla"", ""Muriel's Wedding"" celebrates the lighter side of femininity. The story of a socially awkward 'ugly duckling' whose daydreams of a glamorous white wedding are soundtracked by Abba music, the film was a surprise hit globally and launched the Hollywood career of Toni Collette -- who has a role in ""Esther Blueburger"". Muriel (played by Collette) tramps around in leopard skin inviting bitchy comments from her crass friends until she eventually plucks up the courage to head to the city. Like ""Strictly Ballroom"", it exposes the mean-spiritedness that can blight small town life -- in this case the small town in question is the kitschy fictional coastal setting of Porpoise Spit. As well as their camp credentials, one thing these films share in common is a reluctance to slip into stereotyped depictions of Australians. Questions of national identity are explored with more subtlety through a range of characters, and the image of the Aussie bloke immortalised in the character of Mick Dundee is made to look a dated simplification. Still, this onslaught of camp sometimes proves too much, even for some of the films' characters. As Bernadette (played by Stamp) tells her fellow drag queens at one point in ""Priscilla"": ""I'll join this conversation on the proviso that we stop bitching about people, talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes, penises, drugs, night clubs, and bloody Abba!"" To which Weaving's character Tick snaps back: ""Doesn't give us much to talk about then, does it?""","""Hey, Hey It's Esther Blueburger"" is the latest comedy film to come out of Australia .
Like many successful Australian comedies it relies on a high dose of kitsch .
Films like ""Strictly Ballroom"" have subverted the macho Aussie stereotype .
""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" caused a storm on its release ."
"(CNN) -- Desmond Tutu's distinctive cackle cuts through the noisy clatter of cutlery at one of his favorite cafes. Archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu has breakfast at the Scotch Coffee House in Cape Town. The South African cleric is at the Scotch Coffee House, a highland-themed restaurant complete with tartan tablecloths and bagpipes that sits incongruously in downtown Cape Town, a short walk from St. George's Cathedral where he served as Anglican Archbishop for ten years. He has just told a joke to friends who've joined him for breakfast in what has become a tradition of sorts after Friday Eucharist. A CNN production crew is also there filming him for an upcoming edition of Revealed. ""Tell them about the rabbi and the poison... that is so good,"" his colleague and friend Professor Nulda Beyers gently prodded.  With a chuckle, Tutu began, adding, ""It really is a lovely story."" ""This man telephones the rabbi and says, 'My wife wants to poison me.' The rabbi says, 'Oh no, no, ok, let me talk to your wife.' So the rabbi calls the wife and they talk for over three hours and after three hours the rabbi calls the man. The man says 'yes?' The rabbi says, 'I talked to your wife for three hours... take the poison.'"" Tutu erupts into a fit of giggles, a familiar sound to anyone who has met or who has been fortunate enough to be within earshot of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. ""He likes to say that he laughs easily but he cries easily too, and that the emotions are very close to one another,"" said John Allen, author of Desmond Tutu's authorized biography ""Rabble-rouser for Peace."" Allen, a journalist, met Tutu in 1976 around the time of the Soweto uprising when a protest by school students broke into a fatal melee when police officers started firing into the crowd. ""He wears his heart on his sleeve,"" Allen told CNN, adding, ""It can be almost embarrassing at times."" ""Once, as he got upset at a press conference about something F.W. de Klerk, the former president, had done, his face began to crumple as if he was five years old and about to burst into tears. He's an extraordinarily emotional person. And that's what makes South Africans love him. With Tutu, you know what you've got."" Desmond Tutu was born in 1931 in Klerksdorp, Transvaal, the second of three children to a teacher Zachariah Zelilo Tutu and Aletta Dorothea ""Matse"" Tutu.  See a timeline of the life and work of Desmond Tutu » . ""He'll tell you that he was relatively privileged as a child,"" Allen said. ""And I suppose he was in the sense that he was the son of a primary school headmaster in a small, rural town west of Johannesburg. But in fact, he went to school barefoot until probably his teens. In winter, he would wear a cast-off coat of his father's which probably dragged down to the ground."" Desmond Tutu followed his father into an early career as a teacher but felt compelled to leave in 1955 after the government's introduction of the discriminatory Bantu education policy. For the young Desmond Tutu, one of the most appalling aspects of the new educational regime was the premise that black children should not aspire for more. Tutu applied to join the church and was ordained as an Anglican minister in 1961. A year later he took possession of his first passport and left South Africa to further his studies and begin his life's work of preaching tolerance, equality and peace. St. George's Cathedral is a special place for the preacher. After becoming the first black Archbishop of Cape Town in 1986, he gave countless sermons there, railing against a government still consumed by the idea of apartheid and encouraging and inspiring the downtrodden to rise up and reclaim their rights. ""It already had a reputation as a refuge against the viciousness of apartheid,"" Archbishop Tutu told CNN. ""But it became particularly so in the 1980s. For instance, there was a time when there were people who went out on a protest march and were beaten up by the police, and sprayed with pepper dye. And they ran into here. They were really bedraggled and almost had the stuffing knocked out of them."" Tutu was there to provide spiritual support: ""I came and strengthened, or tried to strengthen them, to encourage them."" In 1984, Tutu's efforts to end apartheid in South Africa earned him a place on the rarefied list of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates. ""South Africa was on the backburner, in terms of priorities by the world, and getting that prize at the time helped to turn the spotlight on our situation,"" Tutu said. ""It also gave our people hope that the world is looking on and the world is watching and the world has come to accept that ours was a just cause, and it was also largely a non-violent cause. So I think that in a way could be said to be the watershed event, the before and after kind of thing."" The following year Desmond Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg, then in 1986, Archbishop of Cape Town. It was in St. George's Cathedral in 1989 that the Archbishop issued a call for a peaceful protest that drew more than 30,000 people onto the streets of Cape Town. Within months, anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela was freed after 27 years in prison. Four years later, Tutu danced as he cast his vote in South Africa's first democratic elections; a vote which helped elect Mandela as the country's first black president. Tutu was by Mandela's side on his inauguration day in May, 1994. Today, he's in Washington to witness what he's said to have called the United States' ""Mandela moment."" During his lifetime, Tutu has campaigned tirelessly for the oppressed and disadvantaged. He remains committed to drawing international attention to the AIDS epidemic in Africa, to ending the plight of Zimbabweans under the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe and to appealing for peace in the Middle East and Darfur. He's Chairman of The Elders, a group of exceptional world statesmen and human rights activists, who aim to use their collective experience and unrivaled contact lists to promote peace. On top of his commitments as patron to various hospitals and charities, he's setting up his own organization to perpetuate his legacy. The Desmond Tutu Peace Center is due to open in 2010. With all that on his plate, it's a wonder Desmond Tutu has time for breakfast. ""Your usual milo?"" asked the waitress at the Scotch Coffee House. ""A milo and a fruit cocktail please, yes."" He barely has time to consume them amid the lively conversation. Tutu acknowledges his schedule is crowded, but says he strict when it comes to time with God. ""You just have to be firm and say I am not going to be available. Otherwise, I would disintegrate,"" he said. ""If I didn't have this spiritual backdrop I know I would be just an empty clanging symbol.""

"(CNN) -- Today millions of people will go to the polls to vote in state and local elections.  As they cast their ballot, they cast a vote for the most treasured aspect of our democracy.  The voting booth is the one place where we are all equal -- all Americans are able to have an equal voice in determining the shape of our government. That sacred right is now under the largest assault we have witnessed in more than a century. Through a spate of restrictive laws passed in Republican-led state legislatures, a disproportionate number of African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, the elderly and the young will find voting difficult and in many cases impossible.  These laws  require a state photo ID to vote, limit  early voting, place strict requirements on voter registration and deny voting rights to Americans with criminal records who have paid their debt to society. Larry Butler of South Carolina was born at home in 1926, during a time of strict segregation when most hospitals did not take in African-Americans.  Because Butler does not have an official birth certificate, he was denied the free state photo ID and told it would cost $150 to get the underlying document to obtain one.  It is, in essence, a modern day poll tax used decades ago to deny blacks in the South their right to vote.  Unlike Butler, who is not a wealthy man, most Americans will not have to pay more than $100 to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right.  His voice could be silenced. The states where restrictive laws have already passed represent 63% of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency. A new documentary from Brave New Foundation  reveals strong partisan backing of these laws.  Under the pretense of safeguarding elections against voter fraud, the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative advocacy group that receives funding from the billionaire Koch brothers (who also back the tea party), crafted and distributed model voter ID legislation introduced in more than 30 states this year.  But widespread voter fraud is a myth.  A report from the Brennan Center for Justice says strict ID verification requirements ""address a sort of voter fraud more rare than death by lightning."" An extensive analysis of data from all 50 states by the U.S. Justice Department found that incidents of voter fraud are exceedingly rare. These laws  harm our democracy.  More than 21 million Americans do not have access to the requisite ID.  The Advancement Project found that 25% of voting age African-Americans; 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens age 65 or older, and 20% of voters age 18 to 29 do not have the requisite ID.  In Texas,  according to the Democratic Party, 600,000 registered voters have no driver's license or state-issued identification.  In Wisconsin, more than half of African-Americans and Latinos lack the required ID.  Students in Texas, Wisconsin and South Carolina can no longer use their college identification to vote. In Tennessee, which has never required anyone over age 60 to have a photo on their driver's license, more than 126,000 seniors now face an almost insurmountable hurdle to the polls.  It will be significantly harder for more than 5 million eligible U.S. voters in the states with restrictive laws to cast ballots in 2012 --  a number larger than the margin of victory in two of the last three presidential elections. It will also cost states money.  Advancement Project's report ""What's Wrong with This Picture"" reveals that it is expensive. Taxpayers will bear the cost of providing free IDs, estimated at more than $20 million in North Carolina, for example, during a time of tough budget constraints. While a diligent effort by citizens groups  compelled governors to veto photo ID laws in Montana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina and New Hampshire and civil rights groups are urging the Justice Department to deny approval of laws passed in South Carolina, Florida and Texas under the Voting Rights Act, many states will reintroduce the legislation next year,  just in time for the 2012 elections. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a march in 1963 for jobs and freedom linking the two pillars of America's promise: economic and political democracy. Now, the Occupy Wall Street movement has shone a spotlight on economic injustice.  We must also Occupy the Vote and not allow the same corporate interests that are contributing to economic dislocation for millions of Americans to silence citizen's voices in the voting booth. The sacred covenant of our democracy is that on Election Day, all Americans have an equal say in shaping their government.   We cannot let that right be taken away.  The very soul of our nation's character depends on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judith Browne Dianis.","Judith Dianis: The right to vote is under assault with new restrictions .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea fired back at North Korea on Wednesday after it said three shots from the North hit waters close to the maritime border. There were no casualties reported, the South Korean defense ministry said. Tensions between the neighbors heightened last year after 50 South Koreans were killed in two separate incidents. In November, the South accused North Korea of shelling Yeonpyeong Island, near the border between the two sides. The incident killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. North Korea said the shelling was in retaliation for the South's navy firing into Northern waters. And in March 2010, South Korea accused the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships, killing 46 sailors. North Korea denies attacking the warship Cheonan, though a Seoul-led international investigation found that a North Korean mini-submarine responsible. Tensions remained high after talks between North and South Korea collapsed in February when the two sides failed to reach an agreement on securing high-level military discussions.","There are no reported casualties, the South Korean defense ministry says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Oliver Fisher was just a toddler his father noticed he possessed a natural talent with a plastic golf club. Now 20, he is one of the hottest prospects on the European circuit. Oliver Fisher showed natural talent as a golfer early on. Now he has his sights set on his first Tour title. ""From the time he was two or three and started picking up plastic golf clubs he always had a very natural golf swing, so it was very easy to develop from that stage with proper coaching,"" Rupert Fisher told CNN. CNN's Living Golf met Fisher and his parents at their family home just outside London for February's edition of Living Golf. See below for show times . They have shown tremendous support for their son's choice of career, ferrying him to and from tournaments and building a network of support to ensure he stands a good chance of being the best. Their commitment is paying off. In 2005, at the age of 16, Fisher became the youngest player to take part in the Walker Cup -- the amateur team competition contested between the U.S. and the United Kingdom and Ireland. Having won several tournaments as an amateur, including three straight Faldo Series titles, in 2006 he became the youngest Briton to earn a European Tour card. He's already recorded five top 10 Tour finishes but has yet to take a title. ""I know that I can do it. I know that if I'm in that situation I'm good enough to shoot the scores to win,"" he told CNN's Living Golf . Fisher -- like so many modern golfers -- was introduced to the sport at a very young age, swinging a club for the first time aged just two, and joining his local golf club at the age of eight.  See photos from the Fisher family album » . In the model of another early starter -- Tiger Woods -- the young golfer has been surrounded by a system of support to encourage him to develop. ""Guys of Ollie's age have learnt so much from the Tiger era,"" his father Rupert Fisher explained. ""When you look at players like Tiger, he is the ultimate role model and you can only try to do what they (his team) do."" Making the leap from amateur to pro can be a difficult step. As Rupert put it, ""natural talent just won't get you there."" ""It's totally different from (being) an amateur, because the season as a professional is a lot longer,"" Oliver said. ""I definitely work as hard as a pro as I did when I was an amateur, just for the fact that I've got more time to work at (my game). It is better though, and I like it."" Though his first Tour win still eludes him, the Englishman announced his arrival in golf's top tier at last season's Open de Andalucia, where he recorded a winning 16 under par score of 272. Finishing tied with Frenchman Thomas Levet, Fisher was beaten into second place on the first hole of the playoff, but still earned plaudits as a player to watch. Levet told reporters following the playoff: ""He's one of the best guys I've played with, including Tiger Woods and Nick Faldo."" Sky Sports golf expert Tim Barter said: ""He is a young man who has got the whole package... and he will win golf tournaments."" Fisher's coach Chris Jenkins told Sky Sports News: ""I really do believe he can compete with Tiger and become world number one."" There is no denying he has a great deal to live up to, but it seems -- amid all this praise -- Fisher is managing to keep his feet on the ground, focusing on the next key goal: plying his trade on the European Tour and trying to win his first event. ""If I keep improving on the way I am hopefully I can be in the top 50 in the world and competing for Majors and winning tournaments in the next year or so.""

"London (CNN) -- British lawmakers want to rename one of London's most famous landmarks -- known to tourists around the world as ""Big Ben"" -- after Queen Elizabeth II, for her Diamond Jubilee. The Queen marks 60 years on the throne in 2012, and politicians believe that naming St. Stephen's Tower, the clock tower at the Houses of Parliament, in her honor would be a fitting tribute to her years of service. ""Not many kings and queens have served for such a long time,"" Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is leading the renaming campaign, told CNN. ""Only two have celebrated their Diamond Jubilee -- Queen Elizabeth II, and Queen Victoria. ""The other tower at the Palace of Westminster is named in honour of Queen Victoria; the clock tower has lots of nicknames -- Big Ben, St Stephen's Tower, or just the Clock Tower -- but no official name. ""It seems a superb way to honor a very distinguished life, and the many years of service she has given to the country."" Ellwood said his plan had the support of MPs from across the political spectrum, and that he hoped they would back his bill to officially name the tower after the Queen in the coming weeks -- in time for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in June. ""Of course, if it does go ahead it will mean that the next time a monarch reaches their 60th anniversary we'll have to build another tower -- but I don't suppose we'll have to worry about that for a while,"" he joked. ""Big Ben"" is officially the name of the 13.5 ton bell inside St Stephen's Tower, and not the name of the tower itself. The bell rang out for the first time in July 1859 -- but cracked two months later. Its chimes were silenced for the next four years, until a way was found to make it peal again in 1863 (by turning it slightly), however, the crack is still visible. Today it rings -- in the key of E -- each hour, while a series of quarter bells chime every 15 minutes. It remains unclear whether the new name -- Elizabeth Tower -- will capture the public imagination, or if they will continue to refer to it as ""Big Ben"". However, jokers have already suggested a new nickname: ""Big Beth.""","British lawmakers want St Stephen's Tower to be renamed in honor of Queen Elizabeth II .

"(CNN) -- The trial against members of the so-called Hutaree militia resumes Thursday as the Michigan-based group's leader David Stone Sr. and his son, Joshua, face weapons charges. The stakes, however, are considerably lower after a federal judge in Detroit on Tuesday dropped the more serious charges of sedition and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against the government. The directed verdict cleared several of the original nine defendants of all charges. Federal authorities accused the nine members of the ""Christian warrior"" militia of homegrown terrorism. The FBI planted a secret informant and FBI agent in the militia in 2008 to record the activities of the group. The video and audio recordings became the crux of the federal case, including clips of the elder Stone making anti-government statements and remarks about killing police officers. The defendants all faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. But in a trial that began in early February, federal district Judge Victoria Roberts said she did not find that the government's evidence sufficiently proved that the Hutaree militia had planned a conspiracy against the government. ""The Government's case is built largely of circumstantial evidence,"" Roberts explained Tuesday in her 28-page ruling. ""While this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact finder to conclude that 'something fishy' was going on, it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendants reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the United States Government."" ""Pick a sentence here, pick a sentence there -- the (remarks were) taken out of context,"" a defense attorney for one of the cleared militia members said. ""We always said it was a First Amendment and Second Amendment case, and that's what it ended up being,"" added attorney Michael Rataj, whose client, Tina Stone, is the wife of the elder Stone. The charges dismissed Tuesday marked the second anniversary of the arrests of the nine militia members, at least five of whom no longer face charges after Roberts' ruling. ""We're pleased. It is, in my opinion, a great day for the Constitution and for the rule of law,"" the elder Stone's defense attorney, William Swor, said. ""We're grateful that the judge did what she did."" The Hutaree militia members cleared of all charges are Tina Stone, 46; David Stone Jr., 22, another son of the elder Stone; Thomas Piatek, 48; Michael Meeks, 40; and Kristopher Sickles, 29. Defendant Joshua Clough, 30, awaits his sentence after pleading guilty to a weapons charge in December. Another defendant, Jacob Ward, 35, will be tried separately. The remaining charges of weapons possession rest on the elder Stone and his son, Joshua, both of whom have already spent two years in prison. The government claims the two militia members were in possession of unregistered automatic weapons. If convicted, the pair could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. ""I didn't figure we were doing anything wrong -- in the lines of going out there and doing the trainings -- to me it was basically fun,"" Tina Stone said Wednesday. ""I'm worried for my husband and son. I guess I will be able to live my life a little easier once they're home."" The U.S. attorney's office in Michigan and the FBI declined to comment on the trial while the case is still under way.","Nine members of the Hutaree militia were arrested in 2010 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Scuba divers, take note: Please leave your spear guns at home, or place them in your checked luggage. But do not try to bring them on a plane. A passenger at a New York-area airport learned that lesson the hard way last week when a TSA screener discovered a 21-inch spear gun and a utility knife in a carry-on bag. The passenger arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport ticketed to fly to Antigua. After his weapons were detected, the TSA contacted local law enforcement, who questioned the passenger, said TSA spokesman Kawika Riley. The passenger claimed to be unaware that the weapons were prohibited, the TSA said. There was no impact on airport operations. ""Just to be clear, passengers should not attempt to bring a spear gun as a carry-on item. The same rule holds for utility knifes,"" Riley said. Spear guns are specifically prohibited in carry-on bags. On the TSA web site, they are listed under prohibited sports goods, which include baseball bats, ski poles, and bows and arrows. The TSA said most passengers who carry prohibited items do so without ill intent, but said officers have a responsibility to prevent weapons from getting through the checkpoint. In the week since the spear gun was found, the TSA says it has found 24 loaded and four unloaded firearms in carry-on baggage. CNN's Mike M.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea test-fired a short-range missile off its western coast in the middle of last week, according to Yonhap News Agency. Quoting an intelligence source, Yonhap says Pyongyang launched a KN-06 short-range missile in an attempt to improve it and increase its range. This launch would be the North's first test of a short-range missile in 19 months. In July 2009, North Korea fired a series of short-range missiles off its east coast, a move criticized by the international community. The South Korean Ministry of Defense tells CNN they cannot comment on the report. Tensions have been high between the two Koreas since two attacks last year killed 50 South Koreans. North Korea also announced last week it will cut all ties with the South and threatened to strike with military force. It is not the first time Pyongyang has threatened to attack Seoul.

The number of people arrested in London since the violence began has risen to 334, police said Tuesday. During the overnight hours, standoffs continued at several locations in London as police in riot gear warily watched roaming gangs often just yards away. A bus in Ealing, West London, a bus was vandalized and set on fire, while the driver was still on board. He escaped without injury. There was evidence of vandalism in central London, with visible damage to a number of shops. The developments come as reports flowed in from other parts of the country that outbreaks of violence and vandalism had occurred. In Bristol, in southwest England, police said several shops and vehicles were damaged Monday night and ""a number of main roads have been closed to allow officers to take control of what is currently a volatile situation."" ""Officers are urging people to avoid the city centre at this time. People already in the city centre should leave the area and go home,"" Bristol police said in a statement early Tuesday. Street disturbances appeared to have spread to Birmingham, about 120 miles north of London, where police said ""several premises"" in the city center had been attacked ""with some shop windows smashed and property stolen in various locations."" A police statement issued early Tuesday said about 100 people had been arrested in Birmingham and added there were no reports of ""major injuries of member of the public or police officers as a result of the disorder."" Disturbances also were reported in the Liverpool area, about 180 miles northwest of London, with police there saying officers had responded to ""reports of vehicles on fire and criminal damage"" in south Liverpool. The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Cameron would return to London Monday night, cutting short a vacation in Italy, for meetings to discuss the violence. As disturbances and looting flared in various parts of London, an official from the London Fire Brigade told CNN: ""We are too busy now to take any calls from the media."" Police reported ""fires burning at a number of premises including a very large blaze at a sofa factory"" in the south London borough of Croydon. In the Hackney area of east London, gangs attacked a police car and shops. Video showed riot police involved in skirmishes, youths destroying a police car, smashing shop windows, a sporting goods shop being looted and the window of another shop being smashed. Police said in a statement that a crowd of between 250 and 300 people gathered, with those in the crowd throwing ""petrol bombs"" and setting cars ablaze. In Lewisham in south London, a car was set afire. ""This is just thugs wanting to intimidate people,"" Councillor Michael Harris told the BBC. ""We've had good community relations in Lewisham and it's simply not justified."" He described the people carrying out the acts as young people whose faces were covered with masks. Several hundred people in the center of Peckham in South London threw projectiles -- stones, clay pots and bottles -- with one policeman saying, ""they raided the bottle bank,"" CNN's Dan Rivers reported from the scene. Large numbers of them, many with faces covered by shirts and bandannas, rushed back and forth with police -- in far fewer numbers -- standing their ground at the entrances to roads, Rivers said. Police created a cordon around Clapham Junction, one of London's busiest train stations, with trains unable to go to or from the station. There was no obvious sign of violence at the station but a policewoman told CNN it was not safe for people to go near the station. The policewoman did not explain why. The violence started in the ethnically diverse, working-class suburb north of London's center whose residents are predominantly Afro-Caribbean. Saturday's riots occurred after the shooting death Thursday of Mark Duggan, a black man, as he was seated inside a cab. Officers from Operation Trident -- the Metropolitan Police unit that deals with gun crime in London's black communities -- stopped the cab during an attempted arrest and soon afterward shots were fired, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said. Duggan, a father of four, was fatally shot. Shooting deaths are rare in England. The commission divulged neither who shot Duggan nor why police had stopped the cab, with the incident still under investigation. Some reports suggested that Duggan was held down by police and shot in the head, but the IPCC has denied this. ""Speculation that Mark Duggan was 'assassinated' in an execution style involving a number of shots to the head are categorically untrue,"" the IPCC said in a statement. A British police watchdog group said evidence from Thursday's shooting scene, including a nonpolice firearm, was to undergo forensic testing. The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, gathered Saturday night outside the Tottenham police station to protest. The protest began peacefully but soon devolved into riots as demonstrators -- whose numbers included whites and blacks -- tossed petrol bombs, looted stores and burned police cars. The unrest prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to cut short her summer vacation and return Monday afternoon to London. In all, 35 police officers have been injured since the violence broke out, Metropolitan Police said. On Monday morning, residents in the South London neighborhood of Brixton awoke to see the aftermath of Sunday night's sporadic shooting in the commercial center. A KFC's windows were smashed, a Foot Locker store was burned, and the main street was closed as police investigators combed through the area looking for evidence. Police said they were reviewing closed-circuit television footage in an attempt to identify looters. Looting also occurred in pockets of Enfield, next to Tottenham, in north London. ""The scenes of violence and destruction over the weekend are utterly appalling,"" said London Mayor Boris Johnson, in a statement. ""People have lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods through mindless violence. I understand the need for urgent answers into the shooting incident that resulted in the death of a young local man, and I've sought reassurances that the IPCC are doing exactly that. But let's be clear these acts of sheer criminality across London are nothing to do with this incident and must stop now."" A representative of Johnson said Monday evening that he was cutting short his family holiday in North America to return to London. Police said the rioting and looting in other parts of the capital were ""copycat"" events conducted by opportunists and criminals. ""This is not about the black community and the police, it's about young people and the police,"" said Shaun Bailey, a youth worker, in a statement circulated by the mayor's office. ""And let's not beat around the bush and pretend this is some type of social justice protest -- it's sheer criminality."" The specter that such violence could arise had been a concern to David Lammy long before the weekend. The Labour MP for Tottenham told a reporter in March that Tottenham could become a scene of violence as cuts to social-service programs for youths were implemented. ""It's heartbreaking,"" he told the Tottenham & Wood Green Journal. ""I'm really worried that the social experiment that we're seeing from the Tory-led coalition will lead to scenes akin to something that we see in some of the inner-city areas of America and that's why we need to bring this government down."" But the leader of Enfield Council, Doug Taylor, was unmoved. ""There can be no justification for the violence and the looting,"" the Labour Party member told a reporter. Deputy Prime Minister Nicholas Clegg called the rioters ""opportunists -- cynical folks who are indulging in smash-and-grab criminality."" Police say they have evidence that some of the rioting was coordinated using social media, including Twitter. Tottenham was the site of riots before. In 1985 Floyd Jarrett, who was of Afro-Caribbean origin, was stopped by police near the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham on suspicion of driving with a forged tax disc, a document all British vehicles must carry. A few hours later, officers raided the nearby home of his mother, who collapsed and died during the raid. Rioting erupted shortly afterwards. Like the current violence, a protest outside Tottenham Police Station sparked the 1985 conflict.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Three years ago Tuesday, Leslie Marva Adams, an attractive, 40-year-old hair stylist from Atlanta, Georgia, chatted on the phone with her mother in the morning. Leslie Adams, 40, filed a restraining order against an old boyfriend and disappeared three years ago. It was the last conversation she would have with a family member. On the third anniversary of Adams' disappearance, her family is still waiting for answers. Her daughter, Cierra Burk, 19, clings to the belief that Adams is alive. ""We will find her,"" Burk says. The family became concerned when Adams failed to show up for her sister's birthday party the day after she talked on the phone with her mother. Two days after the missed party, Adams was officially reported missing. At her apartment in suburban Lilburn, police found evidence suggesting foul play -- a 12-inch blood stain near her bed and a .45-caliber bullet casing. Adams' car was parked in her driveway and a handwritten note was found on her door. Investigators soon learned the note was from her sister, Roberta. It said, ""Leslie, we're worried about you, please call me as soon as possible.""  Watch how the mystery began with a missed party » . Adams had been having trouble with her ex-boyfriend, Billy Joe Cook, in the days leading up to her disappearance. She had accused him of stalking her and had filed a restraining order. In the court document, she alleged that Cook had verbally and physically abused her. She said she feared for her life. A temporary restraining order was granted by the court, but Adams vanished before a scheduled hearing on the matter. Phyllis Adams said her daughter told her in their final conversation that she had argued with Cook over the phone on the previous day. According to the temporary restraining order, Cook was not to have any contact with Adams. Police brought Cook in for questioning and learned he had spoken to Adams on the phone twice the day before she last spoke to her family. Although he was questioned extensively, police have not named Cook a suspect. Police say he was very cooperative and there is no evidence suggesting his involvement in her disappearance, although they have not ruled him or anyone else out as a potential suspect or person of interest. Just when they thought the trail had gone cold, police found what could be a lead in the case. In May 2007, clothing was recovered that could belong to the missing hair-dresser. Police found a pair of men's size 8 Reebok sneakers, size 10 capri pants, and a black sweater in the woods along I-85 in Franklin County, 90 miles from Adams' home in Atlanta. They also discovered human bones and a breast implant near the clothing. Police have sent the remains to a DNA testing lab and they have yet to be identified. The results are inconclusive, and police continue to collect DNA samples from Adams family members for future tests. Leslie Marva Adams is an African-American female who stands 5 feet 5 inches, weighs 130 pounds, and has breast implants. Family members fear the remains could be Leslie Adams, but they are still hopeful that she will be found alive and well. Burk, Adams' daughter, says she struggles with her emotions at this time of year. ""I still believe she is alive and we will find her, but this time of year is very hard,"" she said, fighting the tears. ""It's my aunt's birthday, the day my mom didn't show up and we never saw her again, so it's hard not to break down."" Police and family urge anyone with information on the whereabouts of Leslie Adams to call the Gwinett County Police Department at (770) 513-5300. There is a $25,000 reward for information that helps locate Leslie Adams or leads to the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance.","Atlanta hair stylist Leslie Marva Adams disappeared three years ago .

"(CNN) -- Two Irish Republican Army dissidents were found guilty Friday of murdering a police officer in a killing that shocked Northern Ireland three years ago. Catholic constable Stephen Carroll, 48, was shot dead when paramilitaries used an emergency call to lure police into an ambush in Craigavon, County Armagh, in March 2009. The Continuity IRA admitted it set up the attack, which took place just 48 hours after two British soldiers were killed by another splinter group, the Real IRA, in an ambush outside an army base in Antrim, Northern Ireland. The killings led to ex-IRA commander Martin McGuinness describing dissidents as ""traitors to Ireland"" -- a comment that led to his life being threatened by groups that contain old comrades. McGuinness is now deputy first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government and, along with the mainstream IRA, has renounced violence. One of those found guilty Friday of the police officer's murder -- Brendan McConville, 40 -- was formerly an elected public representative of the Sinn Fein party led by McGuinness and Gerry Adams. The other man convicted -- John Paul Wootton, 20 -- was just 17 at the time of Carroll's killing. Both men are from the district where the gun attack took place. The accused chose not to take the stand to defend themselves, but through their lawyers maintained their innocence throughout the nine-week trial at Belfast Crown Court. However, Friday, the judge, Lord Justice Paul Girvan, said forensic and witness evidence proved the men were ""intimately involved"" in the killing. The judge added that both defendants were ""active and committed supporters of a republican campaign of violence."" Girvan branded the killing ""callous and cowardly"" and said Carroll was shot dead simply because he was a police officer. The judge said the two murderers deserved life in prison. The minimum amount of time they must serve before being considered for release from prison will be set at a future hearing. Constable Carroll's widow, Kate, embraced her son when the guilty verdicts were delivered. Wootton's mother had in February pleaded guilty to obstructing the investigation into the killing. Sharon Wootton, 39, admitted moving computer equipment from her home to another address after police raids on the house. Carroll was the first member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be murdered on duty. The force was called the Royal Ulster Constabulary before a reorganization in 2001. Over 300 members of the constabulary were killed and almost 9,000 were injured during the Northern Ireland conflict between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. IRA splinter groups have remained active since the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998.","IRA dissidents Brendan McConville, 40, and John Paul Wootton, 20, are found guilty .

"(CNN) -- A sixth-grade Pennsylvania teacher suspected of drunk driving allegedly struck five high school students, leaving three of them hospitalized, police in Mount Carmel Township said Thursday. Victor Swaboski III, 38, was being held at Northumberland County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail Thursday, following the Wednesday night incident. He has been charged with five felony counts of accidental death or personal injury, five felony counts of assault by motor vehicle while under the influence, felony flight to avoid apprehension, and five misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, police said. He was also charged with driving under an alcohol restriction because he allegedly had two open beers with him at the time of his arrest, said police Chief Brian Hollenbush. Swaboski's attorney couldn't be immediately located for comment. The chief said that DUI charges are pending results from toxicology tests, to be completed within 10 days. According to CNN affiliate WBRE, three of the teens were walking and two were on bicycles when they were hit by a Jeep Liberty as they passed in front of an elementary school about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday. Swaboski was arrested a short distance from the crash scene, WBRE reported on its website. Swaboski had no prior arrests on his record, the police chief said. Student Andrew Cambell, 16, was in serious condition Thursday at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, police said. Tyler Wondoloski, 18, and Seanna Zimmerman, 13, were listed in fair condition, the police chief said.

"London (CNN) -- Syrian athletes will be allowed to attend this summer's London Olympics but officials from the war-torn country will not be welcome, says UK Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I don't think we should punish the athletes for the sins of the region. Syrian athletes will be taking part in the Games, and that is right,"" Cameron said at a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday. But representatives of the President Bashar al-Assad regime will not be welcome, he added. ""Britain has led efforts within the European Union and elsewhere to institute asset bans, travel freezes and punishing sanctions against this despicable regime and anyone covered by one of those travel bans will not be welcomed in London,"" Cameron said. His message of support for Syrian athletes came on the same day as a visit by International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge. Rogge is in London along with other IOC officials to see at first hand how final preparations for the Games (which start on July 27) are progressing. Earlier this month, Rogge said there were between six and eight Syrian athletes who could potentially qualify for the Games, but warned that any athlete implicated in war crimes would be banned. He added that the IOC was currently working with the United Nations (U.N.) to verify lists of those inside the country who are wanted for war crimes. According the U.N.'s most recent estimates, more than 9,000 people have been killed since the conflict between Syrian forces and rebels began in March 2011.","British Prime Minister David Cameron backs Syrian athletes to attend to London 2012 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing an unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot him. ""Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of, 'You're going to die now' or 'You're going to die tonight,' something to that effect,"" Robert Zimmerman told Orlando TV station WOFL. ""He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did."" In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting, which has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Barack Obama to call it a tragedy, and prompted a federal investigation. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. ""He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken,"" Robert Zimmerman said. ""He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete."" Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation. The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts. A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video does not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head, but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face. ""The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all,"" said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. ""He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in any way, shape or form, someone whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone whose nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal."" Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly. ""I believe that this video is the icing on the cake,"" she said. ""This is not the first part of the evidence that they have had. They have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses. This is in addition to what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested."" The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store. Evolution of the hoodie . Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community. Zimmerman has not been arrested, and authorities have said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of what happened. The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling, and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest. Spike Lee apologizes for retweet error . Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism. ""I never foresaw so much hate coming from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP. Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way,"" Robert Zimmerman told WOFL. ""But there's so much hate that I have never been involved in hate and George hasn't. It's really unbelievable."" Robert Zimmerman said his son is not racist and race had nothing to do with the incident. ""He would do anything to help anybody at any time. He's colorblind when it comes to any race,"" Robert Zimmerman said. Tracy Martin, Trayvon Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son. In a recording of Zimmerman's call to police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur. Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman has said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag had been determined to contain marijuana residue. Benjamin Crump, Martin's parents' attorney, said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth. Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida. But as more and more information surfaces, the picture of what happened becomes more complicated. What the witnesses are saying . Despite the twists and turns in the case, Fulton, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case. ""I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,"" Fulton said. ""We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to press on for justice.""

"(Financial Times) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was on Tuesday facing a fresh barrage of allegations over its business practices after an Australian newspaper released 14,000 emails concerning one of the group's security subsidiaries. The emails, said to be from the hard drive of a former head of security at NDS, a former News Corp subsidiary, appear to show that the company paid computer hackers to work with its ""operational security"" unit. The cache sheds further light on commercial disputes between News Corp and pay-TV rivals that now span Australasia, Europe, and the US. The Australian Financial Review claimed that NDS's activities in Australia in 1999 caused millions of dollars of damage to Mr Murdoch's rivals in the country's nascent pay-TV market. The business models of Austar, Optus and Foxtel were all damaged by a wave of high-tech piracy at that time. The Australian newspaper said the emails had originated from the computer of Ray Adams, a former commander in the Metropolitan Police in London, who served as head of operational security for NDS in Europe from 1996 to 2002. NDS had no immediate comment but News Corp said: ""News Corporation is proud to have worked with NDS, whose industry-leading technology has transformed TV viewing for millions of people across the world, and to have supported them in their aggressive fight against piracy and copyright infringement."" Allegations of fierce competitive behaviour, which were not illegal under Australian law at the time, the AFR said, came a day after the BBC's Panorama programme levelled similar charges against NDS's conduct in the UK. The television programme said that NDS used hackers to crack the security of the encryption cards of OnDigital, the UK broadcaster ITV's entrant in the pay-television market, which went bust in 2002 in the face of competition by News Corp's British Sky Broadcasting unit. In one email purportedly from the hard drive, NDS employees discuss the fact that a European pay-TV company which News Corp was poised to take a stake in was ""totally hacked"" by pirates. The sender of the email debated whether, in light of the News Corp interest in the company, NDS should ""start to protect [the particular model of encryption used by the company] while leaving the main . . . platform compromised"". In a detailed statement after the Panorama programme, NDS denied ever using hackers against other companies. ""Like most companies in the conditional access industry -- and many law enforcement agencies -- NDS uses industry contacts to track and catch both hackers and pirates. This is neither illegal nor unethical. And, to ensure that all activity remains completely within legal bounds, NDS staff and their contacts operate under a clear code of conduct for operating undercover. ""These allegations were the subject of a long-running court case in the United States. This concluded with NDS being totally vindicated and its accuser having to pay almost $19m in costs -- a point that the BBC neglected to include."" Some of the emails released on Tuesday played a part in that case, where the US pay-TV platform Echostar won part of its claim, but was awarded trivial damages and was ordered to pay NDS's costs. In the Panorama programme, Mr Adams denied ever having seen or handled encryption codes or cards that would have allowed anyone to hack OnDigital's machines. Tom Watson, the opposition Labour MP who has led British parliamentary investigations into Mr Murdoch's group and the UK phone hacking scandal, said he had written to the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, asking it to include the Panorama allegations in its inquiry into whether News Corp and its executives were ""fit and proper"" to own a broadcasting licence. To date, 22 people have been arrested in connection with the phone hacking investigation at the News of the World newspaper. A separate UK police investigation is looking into alleged corrupt payments to public officials by journalists at The Sun. The FBI is also conducting a wide-ranging investigation. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Australian Financial Review released 14,000 e-mails regarding former News Corp security subsidiary .

"(CNN) -- Some Syrian writers used to like Bashar al-Assad. Choosing their words carefully, they might say they tolerated him. Those who churned out hugely popular soaps and television shows thought Syria's president, in his mid-30s when he took power in 2000, wanted to be known as a modern leader who defended free expression. Some said al-Assad even looked the other way when a sketch comedy show aired for several seasons that made fun of corruption in Syria. At worst, many reasoned, the young president wouldn't be anymore hard-line than his father, Hafez Assad, who had long kept a purple-knuckle grip on all media in Syria. In hindsight it seems Bashar al-Assad was the greatest actor of them all, suggested Khaled Khalifa during a recent phone interview from his Damascus apartment. It was dusk when he picked up the phone. The screenwriter and novelist, one of the most famous writers in Syria, usually spends this time of day writing. But lately he said he's had trouble concentrating. Now he finds himself looking out to the street, watching people gather for demonstrations. Their loud demands fill the night. ""It is a completely different world than a year ago,"" he said. ""People at night do not sleep."" Khalifa's career hit a stride at the same time al-Assad took power. He remembers all the talk of change from Syria's new leader in the early 2000s, just as the proliferation of satellite television throughout the region suddenly gave Syrians access to different entertainment and points of view. Demand for new shows skyrocketed. More manuscripts than ever were flooding into al-Assad's so-called censorship committee (it never had a formal name). TV, to creative optimists such as Khalifa, was the new frontier, a democratic movement not even the regime could stop. Khalifa had known since he was a kid that he wanted to be a writer. He adored poetry. His parents, olive tree farmers in Aleppo, said he should do something else. They talked about law, so he went to law school. But could he be a lawyer? ""I was either going to become a writer or commit suicide,"" he told CNN. With his natural flair for drama, he got a gig writing for TV to support his passion for fiction. To his surprise, he liked the industry. And it liked him back. Khalifa became one of the most sought after dramatic television writers of his generation, a Syrian David Kelley. In 2006, after toiling for 13 years, Khalifa published ""In Praise of Hatred,"" a Faulknerian novel that tells the story of an Aleppo family surviving against the backdrop of the real-life 1980s bloodbath between Syria's military and Islamist militants in the city of Hama. Critics hailed it as a classic, praising its intricate and colorful storyline. They lauded Khalifa's particularly deft ability to narrate in the voice of a young girl. The book was nominated for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction, known as the ""Arab Booker"" prize. Al-Assad's regime promptly banned ""In Praise of Hatred."" From fiction to Facebook . Syrian artists give an oh-well shrug to censorship because it's just part of life in the country, Khalifa said, so he did the same. A poetry and fiction magazine he worked on for years had been banned, and government censors frequently tore his television scripts to bits. He coped, usually with humor. He laughs about smuggling his books across the Lebanese border and giving a moody but curious guard a copy. Booksellers sold ""In Praise of Hatred"" by reportedly switching the book's jacket with another. But Khalifa finds very little funny anymore. The violence marring Syria for more than a year has left him sad and furious, he said. So the writer is doing what few established artists still living in Syria are, especially those who made their professional mint ""working"" with the regime to produce television shows. He is aligning himself publicly with the opposition. Now rather than devoting his days entirely to fiction, the novelist is writing on his Facebook page, constantly posting notes of encouragement to the opposition. He posted March 15, the anniversary of the start of the Syrian uprising: ""On the occasion of the birth of the revolution, can we all remove from our dictionaries words that reference sectarianism -- Sunni -- Shiite -- Alawite -- Christian -- and avoid speaking about weapons. ..."" On International Women's Day, March 8, he posted: ""On this day there is no woman besides the mother of the martyr, the sister of the martyr, and the daughter of the martyr, and all the fighters of this great revolution."" Khalifa told CNN, ""I want to be close to my people, supportive of them and the revolution."" Stark choice for Syrian artists . Khalifa's recent outspokenness shows how artists have survived for years under artistic oppression in Syria, said Christa Salamandra, an anthropologist who lived in Syria off and on until 2010. She studied pop culture and media there and befriended actors and writers such as Khalifa. Syrian artists have always faced a stark choice, she says. ""They can choose exile, which is often unfeasible and of no benefit to the country,"" she said. ""Or they can compromise, an option that can lead to an ultimate good if it enables them to convey subversive or critical messages, however muted."" Khalifa's comments may put him in danger, Salamandra said, noting several reports have been published about the Syrian authorities monitoring dissidents' phone and Internet activity. It's possible, she said, that Khalifa's fame has inoculated him from arrest or other harm. Whatever might be keeping him safe, Khalifa isn't going to stop supporting what he calls ""the revolution,"" even as violence bears down on his city. Increased violence in Damascus, marked by recent twin car bombings that killed at least 27 people and clashes between the military and rebels, portend a dark future for the capital, he said. The fighting has all but stamped out any hope that Damascus could fulfill its potential as an international arts haven, as many predicted a few years ago. In the late 2000s and even as protests against al-Assad's regime began, blogs and mainstream news organizations raved about Damascus as the Arab world's nerve center for contemporary art. Foreign capital was flowing into Syria, which prompted a startling push toward modernity in the capital -- at least on the surface. High-end galleries and boutique hotels opened. Glossy magazines such as Vogue wrote breathlessly about Syria's first lady, Asma al-Assad. Damascus' new opera house was the rage. English-language magazine Syria Today lauded the opening of a new media gallery that sponsored the first international video arts festival in the country. The New York Times reported Syria's art scene might be the Next Big Thing, quoting a California travel agent scoping out Damascus so she could entice rich collectors to go on a buying tour. The buzz wasn't all highbrow. Even American hip-hop songs shouted out to Damascus a few years ago. Wyclef Jean and Missy Elliott told everyone the party was there. A story for the past and future . Pop culture in Syria was driven largely by TV shows for which Khalifa wrote -- melodramas that kept viewers tuning in daily. Khalifa and his TV colleagues became so confident that they could push boundaries with al-Assad that they would send in fake scripts with scenes that would never make it past censors. ""We saw it as a game between us and the regime; one time we won, one time we lost,"" Khalifa recalled. ""Sometimes we would intentionally add a scene in a script that we knew would not pass. But we just did it to make a point."" The ardor of this ostensible openness informs Khalifa's ""In Praise of Hatred."" He set the story against the backdrop of Syrian politics and violence in the 1980s, knowing full well it would irk censors. Many younger readers, including those protesting for a freer Syria, have told him they are reading his book and re-examining his contemporaries' writing to learn about the country's past violence. ""Many of the youth do not know the details of what happened in the '80s so they are going back and reading ...,"" he said. ""They are feeling really angry that the same cycle is happening all over again."" ""In Praise of Hatred"" has been translated into several languages, but for the first time, it's about to be published in English. Khalifa said he is excited about this translation and hopes it will help more people understand the nuances of his country. He wants the world to see what he has seen and to know Syria is more than a nightly news story of blood and despair. He is quiet when asked if he would ever leave Damascus. The question is absurd to him. He would never abandon Syria, he said, even if it meant greater personal safety and more artistic freedom. ""If I had the choice to remain silent in Syria or leave and speak my mind, I would choose to remain silent and stay here,"" he said. ""I feel that I need to remain close to my people and to the revolution and speak of what I believe.""

"(CNN) -- Finnish authorities arrested a man Friday after he fired six shots through a school classroom door and shot an office worker in the hand in two separate incidents, police said. No one was injured in the school shooting, police said. The man first entered an office building in the Tampere area, in southern Finland, and shot a man in one hand with a hunting rifle, a police spokesman said. The injuries are not life-threatening. He then went into the school, where he fired through the door of a classroom, the spokesman said. Police arrested the man at the scene and took him to the Tampere police station, where he is being questioned. The man is believed to hold a permit for three guns, but police cannot confirm whether one of those three guns was used in the attacks, the spokesman said. Police are interviewing witnesses, the spokesman said.","The suspect first shot a man in the hand in an office building, Finnish police say .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean President Lee Myung-bak promised a ""fresh start"" Wednesday after his entire Cabinet and top civil servants offered to resign following street protests. Tens of thousands hold up candles during Tuesday's protest against resuming beef imports. ""I'm determined to make a fresh start. Let's pursue aggressive challenges in these difficult times,"" Lee said in a statement that may indicate sweeping government personnel changes are in the works. The government has been in crisis over a deal to resume imports of beef from the United States after a ban lasting several years due to fears of mad cow disease. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of the South Korea capital, Seoul, on Tuesday over the deal with Washington. Prime Minister Han Seung-soo and the South Korean Cabinet offered to resign Tuesday. The move followed a similar resignation offer last week by eight top Lee aides. Washington and Seoul reached an agreement in April that would clear the way for South Korea to resume importing beef from the United States, but Seoul now has reservations over the terms of the agreement, and South Korean negotiators held meetings in Washington on Wednesday to try to change the terms of the deal.  Watch massive protests in Seoul » . Lee instructed them ""to ensure that beef from cattle 30 months old and older will not be imported under any circumstances,"" his Web site said. ""It will not be easy, but I urge you to do your best to realize what the people want in this matter."" The South Korean move stems from concerns that animals more than 30 months old are a greater risk for mad cow disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the use of certain organs of cattle more than 30 months of age because they represent a greater threat for mad cow disease, but the agency considers the meat from those animals to be safe. While the United States already agreed not export the cattle organs considered most likely to carry disease, the deal put no age restrictions on cattle. Last week, the South Korean government put off the final administrative step needed to resume imports. Without that step taking place, no beef will be imported from the United States. Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal malady in humans. Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997.","S Korean President promises ""fresh start"" Wednesday after Cabinet offers to resign .

"(CNN) -- A judge has sided with Virginia Tech and overturned a $55,000 fine, ruling that the school did not violate a law requiring it to notify students in a ""timely manner"" about threats during a 2007 campus rampage. The shooting, which left 33 people including the gunman dead, started at West Ambler Johnston dormitory with the death of two students. They were the first victims of Seung-Hui Cho, who went on to kill 30 more people at Norris Hall -- home to the Engineering Science and Mechanics Department -- after chaining the doors closed. He also wounded 17 people before killing himself. At question was whether the school gave appropriate warning to students after the dormitory shooting. According to a Department of Education report, police went to the dormitory at 7:24 a.m. The university notified students, faculty and staff of the shooting in an e-mail at 9:26 a.m., the report said. About 15 minutes after the e-mail was sent, Cho began his rampage. ""This was not an unreasonable amount of time in which to issue a warning. Yes, the warning could have gone out sooner, and in hindsight, it is beyond regretful that it did not. However, if the later shooting at Norris Hall had not occurred, it is doubtful that the timing of the e-mail would have been perceived as too late,"" read the decision, issued Thursday. Administrative Judge Ernest Canellos dismissed the $55,000 fine, levied for two alleged violations of the Clery Act, a federal law related to campus safety. The school had been fined for failing to provide a ""timely"" warning and for failing to follow policy. Virginia Tech welcomed the decision Friday. ""While we are satisfied with the ruling that overturns the department's finding, there is no glee. A horrendous event happened on this campus almost five years ago. Profound sadness remains. We continue to grieve for the families of victims killed or injured by a deranged young man,"" associate vice president for university relations Lawrence Hincker said in a statement. The Department of Education, meanwhile, said it would consider its options and continue to work with Virginia Tech and other schools to improve safety. The decision could be appealed to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. ""We are aware of the ruling, and the Department's Office of Federal Student Aid is considering its options. At the end of the day, we all agree that the most important thing we can do as a country is to put safeguards and protections in place that will help prevent a tragedy like this from occurring again,"" spokesman Justin Hamilton said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","The $55,000 fine was for two alleged violations of the Clery Act .

"(CNN) -- Your Facebook password is none of your new boss' business. That's what the American Civil Liberties Union is saying after reports that employers are increasingly asking for access to job applicants' social-media accounts. ""It's an invasion of privacy for private employers to insist on looking at people's private Facebook pages as a condition of employment or consideration in an application process,"" attorney Catherine Crump said in a statement from the ACLU. ""People are entitled to their private lives."" Recently, multiple cases have come to light in which companies have either asked for passwords to Facebook or required that applicants ""friend"" people at those companies. Robert Collins of the Baltimore area has said that he was looking to be reinstated to his job as a correctional officer in 2010 when he was asked for his Facebook password. ""I did not want to do it, but because I really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification, I reluctantly gave him the password,"" Collins said in February in testimony before the Maryland House of Representatives, which is considering ACLU-backed legislation to block such practices. ""He then proceeded to log in to my account using my private credentials. I asked him, 'Why are you logging on?' He said, 'I am looking through your messages, on your wall and in your photos to make sure you are not a gang member or have any gang affiliation.' "" An Associated Press report this week highlighted Justin Bassett, a New York statistician who said that, during a job interview, the interviewer pulled up his Facebook page and asked for his password. He said he refused. The ACLU said it's found an increasing number of companies with such policies on Facebook. They say it's more common with public agencies, such as law enforcement. ""You'd be appalled if your employer insisted on opening up your postal mail to see if there was anything of interest inside,"" Crump said. ""It's equally out of bounds for an employer to go on a fishing expedition through a person's private social media account."" On an ACLU Facebook page Thursday, followers were, not surprisingly, overwhelmingly against the concept. ""I consider it a violation of personal privacy,"" one user wrote. ""Will the next step be to request a key to my house?"" It is technically against Facebook's Terms of Service to share a password. ""You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account,"" the agreement reads. In addition to Maryland, lawmakers in Illinois are considering legislation that would ban the practice.","Some employers are asking for Facebook passwords from job applicants .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has identified a detained American man, who was arrested last year for ""committing a crime"" against the reclusive nation, according to state-run media. ""U.S. citizen Jun Young Su was arrested in November 2010 and has since been investigated by a relevant organ for committing a crime against (North Korea) after entering it,""the KCNA news agency reported Thursday. ""He admitted his crime in the course of investigation."" KCNA did not provide details on the nature of the alleged crime. Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of not being identified told CNN Tuesday that the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea. The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the officials said. The United States is urging North Korean authorities, through Swedish officials, to release the man on humanitarian grounds. Sweden represents America's interests in North Korea because the United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations. The Swedes have been granted consular access to the man and have visited him, the officials said. Swedish officials are asking for regular visits, the officials said. A Swedish official in Stockholm confirmed to CNN that the embassy in Pyongyang is working on the case. The sources declined to provide additional information because of privacy concerns. North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted to commit suicide while in North Korean custody, was believed to be a Christian activist. Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program. The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry out the drills, calling them a provocation and threatening to engulf Seoul in a ""sea of flames."" South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.

"(CNN) -- Diana Nyad's personal test has begun. At 7:45 p.m. ET Sunday she jumped into the water and began her 103-mile swim between Cuba and Florida. ""I'm almost 62 years old and I'm standing here at the prime of my life,"" she said as she walked toward the sea. ""I think this is the prime. When one reaches this age, you still have a body that's strong but now you have a better mind."" Nyad did a few stretches and played reveille, the traditional Army wake-up song, on a bugle before she dived in. Map: Follow Nyad on the position tracker . She likes a challenge. At 61, a lot of people are considering retirement and spending time with grandchildren. Not Nyad. For nearly two years, she's been training to set a record for open-water swims without a shark cage. Nyad in good spirits in 18th hour . Nyad announced Sunday morning at a Havana news conference that she planned to enter the water at Havana's Marina Hemingway to begin her attempt. ""We're going to get started tonight,"" she said early Sunday as she stepped out of a car on her way to the news conference. ""As you can probably tell, I'm pretty nervous. My adrenaline is flowing, but I've been training for two years. ""All my life, I dreamed of being the first one ever to swim across without a shark cage,"" she said, adding that when she turned 60, she ""started thinking what if I went back and started to chase that elusive dream of Cuba."" One theory about Nyad's drive to make this swim is that she's avenging a failed attempt at this trip more than 30 years ago. And though Nyad admits there is some bit of athletic ego involved, she says it's more about proving to herself and to the world that 60 is not old. ""When I walk up on those shores of Florida, I want to prove to the AARP crowd that it's not too late to go back and write that book or adopt that child,"" she said. On Sunday, she said: ""The joke is the 60s are the new 40s, and it's true. ... I want to be there to say we have many, many years of vitality and strength and service left in us."" The swim was planned for summer 2010, but was called off because of bad weather. She continued to train. Immense planning and logistics go into making an attempt like this. First, the sheer amount of training it takes to get her body in shape is remarkable: Almost two years of daily six-, eight, 10- or 12-hour swims. She's faced political as well as physical challenges. Nyad is determined to swim from Cuba to Florida. Getting permission from both sides took several months. At several points along the way, bureaucratic snags threatened to tank the whole operation. Nyad's team of more than 30 people consists of about 10 handlers, who will take turns minding Nyad's every move for the estimated 60 hours it will take her to complete this swim. Boat captains will take shifts driving the five boats in Nyad's small armada. Six ocean kayakers will switch off paddling kayaks mere inches from Nyad's side throughout the journey, towing underneath them electronic Shark Shields that emit a harmless but annoying electrical impulse that repels most species of sharks. Shark safety officers trained to distract any creatures that may get curious will take turns in the water surrounding her. ""There's no getting around the fact that we're in an ocean here where some dangerous species of shark swim,"" she said at the news conference. She said the whitetip shark, however, wasn't bothered by the Shark Shields, so she will also have shark divers on hand to help distract them. ""Nobody is going to use any lethal weapon on this swim,"" she added. A team doctor will also be on board to monitor Nyad's hydration and nutrition and to tend to any bites or stings from jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war and other sea creatures. The navigator will ensure Nyad is swimming in the right direction and guiding her to avoid detrimental ocean currents. CNN will have a crew of seven on board, as well as a special marine tracking satellite dish to provide live pictures of the swim. A sixth boat carrying Nyad's friends is expected to join the flotilla for the last several hours of the trip, and an equally large team of people will be standing by on land to witness the end of the swim. Nyad will be burning tens of thousands of calories. She will be replacing that energy with nutritionally rich fuel. Every hour, Nyad will stop swimming for just a few minutes to take in food and hydration. A typical meal at one of these pit stops may include hard-boiled eggs, protein gels or peanut butter and a few ounces of an electrolyte-filled beverage. Dr. Ken Kamler, a microsurgeon and expert on practicing medicine under extreme conditions, says that as Nyad swims, her body will first turn to glucose for energy. Once her body burns through that available sugar, it will next start burning body fat as fuel, and finally turn to protein once her fat stores are exhausted. Once her body starts burning protein for energy, he says, she will be in a race to hit Key West before her body destroys muscle tissue. Nyad is undaunted. ""I am a better athlete today than I was at 29,"" she told CNN. CNN's Shasta Darlington in Havana, Cuba, contributed to this report.","""I'm standing here at the prime of my life""

"Paris (CNN) -- Nineteen people have been arrested in a series of police raids on suspected Islamists, French President Nicolas Sarkozy told French radio Friday morning. The raids come a week after gunman Mohammed Merah, who killed seven people, was shot dead after a long siege in the southwestern city of Toulouse. The arrests took place in Toulouse, Marseille, Nantes, Lyon and the Ile de France region, around Paris, the Interior Ministry said. Authorities have not said that any of those arrested were directly linked to Merah. Sarkozy told Europe 1 that the decision to act had been taken by the interior minister and foreign minister ""to deny the entry of certain people to France"" who did not share the country's values. ""It's not just linked to Toulouse. It's all over the country. It's in connection with a form of radical Islam, and it's in agreement with the law,"" he said. ""What you have to understand is that the traumatic events in Montauban and Toulouse were profound in our country. I don't want to compare horrors but it's a bit like the form of trauma visible in the United States and New York after 9/11. We have to be able to draw some conclusions."" Interior Minister Claude Gueant said that several firearms, including five rifles, four automatic weapons and three Kalashnikovs, had been found in the searches, as well as a bulletproof vest. Speaking to French media, he said the raids targeted people who have made the claim online that they are ""mujahedeen,"" or Islamist fighters, and support ""an extremely radical ideology."" The authorities' decision to swoop was in part based on the suspects' claims that they had received paramilitary training, Gueant said. Sarkozy suggested that more raids will follow, saying, ""There will be other operations that will continue and that will allow us to expel from our national territory a certain number of people who have no reason to be here."" Sarkozy said he was obliged to act to ensure the nation's safety. ""It's our duty to guarantee the security of the French people. We have no choice. It's absolutely indispensable."" The Interior Ministry media office said ""the police had plans to carry out 19 arrests, and therefore 19 arrests were made in connection with the group Forsane Alizza."" Forsane Alizza is a pro-al Qaeda group in France with a cluster of followers in Toulouse. Merah appeared to have developed connections with the group, according to French media reports. The group was outlawed in January for encouraging French citizens to travel to Afghanistan to fight jihad. Police have been investigating whether Merah acted alone in planning his attacks. He is blamed for the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three Jewish children ages 4, 5 and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in the shootings. Merah told police he had attended an al Qaeda training camp while visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. But his uncle, Jamal Azizi, denied statements by French authorities that Merah was an al Qaeda sympathizer and that he had traveled to Afghanistan or Pakistan to train to use arms. Merah was buried Thursday at a cemetery outside Toulouse. Algeria, where his family is originally from, had refused to accept his body, Merah's father said, citing French authorities. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: The raids targeted people supporting radical ideology online, the interior minister says .

"(CNN) -- Alison Shein considers herself an amateur genealogist, spending hours online searching for information about family members she never knew. Among them: Alison's great-great-grandmother Bella Shein, who died in the Holocaust. The circumstances surrounding her death are still murky. ""They were living in this town called Volkovysk, which is currently in Belarus, and when the Germans were coming, some of her children and her grandchildren said, 'OK, we're going to leave. We're going to go with the Russian army.' And she said, 'I'm too old. I'm going to stay behind.' And that was the last they saw of her."" Through her research, Shein determined that her great-great-grandmother was probably killed in that town, like other elderly people, rather than transported by the Nazis to the Treblinka extermination camp. She is still looking for information about other family members. Shein has also embarked on another project, one that will help others -- strangers -- find clues about what happened to their loved ones in the Holocaust. ""I just think that it's really important to keep the memory of these people who died alive. I've heard stories so many times where they said, 'We had survivors who are our relatives, and they just didn't want to talk about it. We just don't know what happened.' "" Shein is one of more than 2,100 volunteers around the world who have signed on to the World Memory Project, a joint effort by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and Ancestry.com, a family research website, to create the world's largest online searchable database of records related to victims of the Holocaust. It's a massive undertaking: The museum has more than 170 million documents about victims of Nazi persecution, including Nazi concentration camp records and transport lists, records created by Jewish communities and U.S. government documents about people displaced by the war who later emigrated to the United States. The project, which began in May, recruits volunteers like Shein to put names and other key words from the documents into an online database, which is then searchable by anyone in the world. The first data sets became searchable this month. Once people locate information online about family members, they can request copies of the full documents from the museum. The service is free and will remain so permanently. Volunteers have added more than 765,000 records to the database in the six months since the project began, and the number goes up everyday. Compare that with the process before the project's launch, when a museum intern indexed the records and managed to complete about 1,000 records a month. Speed is a key part of the World Memory Project. ""Clearly, we're in a race against time to help survivors find out what happened to their loved ones before it's too late,"" said Lisa Yavnai, director of the project. It allows survivors and family members who are unable to travel to the museum in Washington to access the information from the comfort of their own homes, said Quinton Atkinson, director of Ancestry.com's content acquisition. And for anyone who wants to contribute to the project, they can do so from anywhere in the world. ""You can do it at 2 o'clock in the morning in your pajamas,"" Atkinson explained, just by going to worldmemoryproject.org and following the steps to download the software, which was developed by Ancestry.com. No special skills are required, no computer or language expertise, he said. To ensure accuracy, two volunteers index each document. Their work is reviewed by a third, more experienced arbitrator, who resolves any discrepancies. Both Atkinson and Yavnai describe the response to the project as overwhelming. Volunteers include those as young as 12, with help from their parents, as well as some Holocaust survivors who are in their 70s and 80s. ""This project is about restoring the identities of the victims, the people who the Nazis tried to erase. They -- the Nazis -- gave them numbers, and we are giving them back their names, and the public can help us do this,"" Yavnai said.","More than 2,100 volunteers around the world have signed on to the World Memory Project .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The South Korean Ministry of Unification confirmed Wednesday that it has reopened communication channels with Pyongyang, North Korea, in the border area of Panmunjom. A media officer at the ministry said officials reopened a direct hotline between the two Koreas and Red Cross communication channels. With the reopening of the direct communication line, the two Koreas are able to discuss issues such as holding reunions for separated families and initiate contact for aid or inter-Korean talks. It is the first time in eight months that the two sides have reopened the hotline. North Korea cut off the hotline on May 26 to protest South Korea's response to the sinking of the Cheonan naval ship in March, which killed 46 sailors. South Korea and the international community blamed the North for the sinking, but Pyongyang has denied the accusations. Tensions rose again in November, when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island. The incident killed two South Korean marines and two civilians. North Korea said the strike was in retaliation to South's navy firing into Northern waters.","NEW: The Koreas can discuss reunions for separated families with the reopened direct line .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq's vice president arrived in Qatar Sunday to meet with leaders of the Gulf nation, despite an Iraqi government order banning him from international travel. The visit of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who has been living in Kurdistan since Iraqi authorities issued an arrest warrant for him on terrorism charges, drew sharp criticism from Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Arab countries should not host the wanted vice president, al-Maliki said, according to al-Iraqiya state television. Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political leaders have squared off over an arrest warrant issued last year for the Sunni vice president, who has denied the charged and called them ""politically motivated."" The Iraqi Interior Ministry has said al-Hashimi is banned from leaving the country. And Al-Maliki has demanded that Kurdish lawmakers hand over al-Hashimi, who refuses to return to Baghdad from northern Iraq. In an interview with CNN in January, al-Hashimi accused al-Maliki -- a Shiite -- of pushing the country toward a deep sectarian divide. On his trip to Qatar, al-Hashimi was scheduled to meet with Qatar's prime minister and emir ""based on an invitation he had received earlier,"" a statement from his office said. ""The visit is expected to last a few days, and after that, the vice president will travel to other countries that will be announced later,"" the statement said. ""Following the visits, the vice president will return to his place of residence in Iraqi Kurdistan Region."" The vice president's trip comes several days after Qatar's foreign minister said his country had sent a low-ranking representative to last week's Arab League summit in Baghdad in order to send a message over ""factionalism in Iraq,"" the state-run Qatar News Agency reported. In February, Iraq's top judicial committee accused al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi said the nine-judge council was under the control of the Shiite-dominated central government and the allegations were ""politically motivated."" The charges against al-Hashimi appear to be based on the purported confessions of three men, identified as the vice president's security guards. Iraqi state-run TV aired video of the men's confessions in December. CNN has not been able to verify their identities independently.

"(EW.com) -- Harvey Weinstein never met a ratings controversy that he couldn't massage into a publicity campaign. He did it in the '90s, when he turned up the heat on the teensploitation psychodrama ""Kids,"" all because the film received a rating of NC-17 (which it probably deserved). He did it two years ago, when the downbeat-sexy ""Blue Valentine"" got slapped with the same scarlet letter (which it didn't deserve at all). But in the case of ""Bully,"" Weinstein isn't just mounting a PR blitz -- he's fighting the good fight. The movie is a sensitive and eye-opening documentary about the epidemic of bullying in American public schools. It's a film that would do well to be seen by as many teenagers as possible, and Weinstein had wanted to show it in schools. Yet ""Bully"" received an R rating, all because the F-word is used in it a handful of times. The Weinstein Co. has now decided to release ""Bully"" unrated. This doesn't solve the problem, since some theaters refuse to show unrated movies. So the very audience that Bully was made for still might have a hard time getting near it. Weinstein hired David Boies and Ted Olson, the attorneys who helped overturn California's Proposition 8, to take on the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPAA, with its famously fusty, punitive, and -- some would say -- arbitrary ratings system, defended the R rating for ""Bully,"" stating that it wouldn't be fair to make an exception just because of the movie's good intentions. I agree that they shouldn't just make an exception: They should do a heck of a lot more. That the MPAA is content to keep a film as humane and as deeply unsensational as ""Bully"" away from most of the adolescents whose lives it could possibly help is a folly and outrage. ""Bully,"" directed by Lee Hirsch, takes a sympathetic, insightful look at five anguished kids from suburban and rural communities around the country and how the bullying that they've endured has shaped their lives. Tyler, 17 years old, was so mocked by his peers that he hanged himself. Alex, 12, born prematurely (at just 26 weeks), is a sweet, smart kid singled out because of his ""fish face."" He has been slammed into lockers, sat on during bus rides, called ""b****"" and ""f*****"" -- and after all that, it was only really clear how bad the problem was when he stopped complaining. (Being bullied had become his only reality.) Kelby, a 16-year-old lesbian, suffered abuse to the point that she tried to commit suicide three times. Why are these kids targeted? Some of it is based on looks and prejudice, but much of it represents nothing more -- or less -- than the ostracization of those who are lonely or shy. They're viewed as ""outsiders,"" and then vilified for it. ""Bully"" is a portrait of good kids reduced to shells of themselves by a climate of toxic hate and fear. There's only one thing missing from the movie, and that's an in-depth look at the bullies themselves. We're forced to guess at what has made them into junior sadists. My own conjecture is that their almost complete lack of empathy represents the channeling of a larger current of intolerance now at loose in the culture -- the kind you see increasingly in politics, not to mention all over the Internet. Arguments against the ratings system have, of course, been made many times before: by directors, producers, and film critics -- and, in 2006, by Kirby Dick in his documentary ""This Film Is Not Yet Rated,"" which opened the door on the MPAA's antiquated maze of codes and restrictions. As Dick powerfully argued, what's fundamentally broken about the MPAA isn't the system so much as the thinking behind the judgments. The ratings-board members, swathed in their shadow of anonymity, insist on a nearly Victorian double standard for sex and violence: Anything associated with the former (like the word ""f---"") is treated as taboo, whereas horror and action films that feature over-the-top violence routinely get a PG-13. This outdated distinction may be a reflection of ""American values,"" but that does not make it right. And the fact that the board tends to go easier on big-budget blockbusters may be the shoddiest double standard of all. It's an indication that too many questionable agendas are guiding these judgments. A film like ""Bully"" makes it clear that there's something deeply wrong with this picture. For this is an urgent and moral movie; there shouldn't be a puritanical roadblock standing between it and its audience. As long as the MPAA is issuing its cavalier decrees, though, they're the ones acting like bullies. ""Bully"": B+ . See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors in the Penn State child rape case detailed 15 responses to a grand jury by a former university official and 23 responses by another that authorities allege constitute perjury, according to court documents. Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. In court papers filed Friday, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office provided portions of a transcript of a January 2011 grand jury proceeding in which prosecutors accuse Curley and Schultz of committing perjury during question-and-answer exchanges. Responding to prosecutors' latest court action, the attorneys for Curley and Schultz issued a joint statement to the media: ""We have received the prosecution's filings and look forward to reviewing their responses."" Prosecutors listed the answers given by Curley and Schultz to the grand jury ""with the understanding that any or all of these statements will support the charge of perjury, and that it is not required to prove the falsity of every identified statement."" A judge ruled in December that the perjury case against Curley and Schultz will go to trial, following graphic testimony from the prosecution's star witness in the case against Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Curley and Schultz have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Sandusky, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial. He has pleaded not guilty. The star witness, Mike McQueary, testified that he told university officials that he saw Sandusky possibly sodomizing a boy in 2002, saying that what he saw was ""extremely sexual in nature."" McQueary was a graduate assistant for the football team at the time of the alleged incident. But according to the grand jury transcript, Curley said that McQueary never stated that sexual conduct of any kind allegedly occurred between Sandusky and the boy. Central to the perjury allegations were responses from Curley and Schultz to the grand jury about what said to them regarding the 2002 incident. ""My recollection was that Mike could hear there were people in -- they were in the shower area, that they were horsing around, that they were playful, and that it just did not feel appropriate,"" Curley told the grand jury, according to the transcript. ""I didn't think that it was a crime at the time,"" Curley said at another point. In Schultz's statements to the grand jury, he referred to a conversation he had with McQueary and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, who died in January after battling lung cancer. ""My recollection was McQueary and Joe both only described what was observed in a very general way. There was no details,"" Schultz told the grand jury about the locker room incident. When asked if he formed an impression about the locker room incident, according to the transcript Schultz answered: . ""Well, I had the impression that it was inappropriate. Telling you what kind of thing I had in my mind without being clear, without him telling me, but, you know, I had the feeling that there was perhaps some kind of wrestling around activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed the young boy's genitals or something of that sort is kind of the impression that I had,"" according to the grand jury transcript. Schultz told the grand jury that he had a recollection that the university asked the child protection agency to look into the matter. Curley, 57, is now on leave from the university, and Schultz, 62, retired in the wake of the allegations. Days after a grand jury report was released last November, Penn State trustees fired President Graham Spanier and Paterno amid criticism that they could and should have done more. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Lena Jakobsson contributed to this report.","Prosecutors allege perjury in statements by former Penn State officials to a grand jury .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 25 percent of the homeless population in the United States are military veterans, although they represent 11 percent of the civilian adult population, according to a new report. On any given night last year, nearly 196,000 veterans slept on the street, in a shelter or in transitional housing, the study by the Homelessness Research Institute found. ""Veterans make up a disproportionate share of homeless people,"" the report said. ""This is true despite the fact that veterans are better educated, more likely to be employed and have a lower poverty rate than the general population."" The president of the institute's parent group appealed Thursday to lawmakers and civilians to help solve veteran homelessness before thousands of U.S. service members return from Iraq and Afghanistan. ""We know that veterans don't immediately become homeless after they're discharged, but the difficulties may take years to emerge,"" Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a news conference about the report's findings. Ben Israel, a veteran originally from North Carolina's Camp Lejeune, told reporters at the briefing that his ""main problem has always been housing.""  Watch Israel describe life as a homeless veteran » . Israel said he had been homeless in several cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, Dallas, Texas, and Portland, Oregon. ""I slept in my car many a night,"" he said, ""trying to get to a day labor job because I got kicked out of a shelter at 6 a.m."" The states with the highest number of homeless veterans include Louisiana, California and Missouri, according to the research. Washington, D.C., also had a high rate. About 44,000 to 64,000 veterans are classified as ""chronically homeless"" -- homeless for long periods or repeatedly. Other veterans -- nearly 468,000 -- are experiencing ""severe housing cost burden,"" or paying more than half their income for housing, thereby putting them at a high risk for homelessness. The rates of the burden of housing costs were highest in Rhode Island, California, Nevada and Hawaii, but the nation's capital had the highest rate, according to the organization. To reduce chronic homelessness among veterans by half, the report concluded housing coupled with supportive services should be increased by 25,000 units, and the number of housing vouchers for veterans should be increased by 20,000. Veterans such as Jason Kelley find themselves in a Catch-22, not able to find a job because of the lack of an apartment, and not being able to get an apartment because of not having a job, The Associated Press reported. ""The only training I have is infantry training, and there's not really a need for that in the civilian world,"" the AP quoted Kelley as saying in a phone interview. In addition, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, he told the AP. Kelley served in Iraq with the Wisconsin National Guard, the news agency said. A new Gallup Poll released by Fannie Mae showed that nearly a quarter of veterans, or 24 percent, report having been concerned they may not have a place to live. Eighty-six percent of poll respondents believe homelessness among veterans is either staying at the same level or increasing. In addition, 61 percent of poll respondents believe veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts are at least as likely to become homeless as veterans of previous wars. The poll of 1,005 veterans was conducted September 4-October 17 and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

"(CNN) -- Forget shoot-em-up addicts -- video games are reaching out to the rest of us. The greatest symbol of this is the Wii console from Nintendo. Its innovative wireless control -- the Wiimote -- has even non-gamers excited as they swing it through the air to control, say, a tennis racket on the screen. Wii's Wiimote may play a pivotal role in bringing the visually impaired into the electronic gaming fold. But not quite everyone has been reached. One group is still largely ignored by video game makers: the blind. With that in mind, a team of researchers at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab in Massachusetts set out this summer to make a music-based video game that's designed for mainstream players and also accessible to the blind. Appropriately, perhaps, they incorporated the Wiimote into the game-play, though it's optional. The resulting DJ game, designed for the PC, is called AudiOdyssey. In it, players try to lay down different tracks in a song by swinging and waving the Wiimote in time with the beats. Or they can just use keyboard controls. The game reminded this writer of my lack of any rhythm whatsoever. I used the keyboard version, where you're instructed to follow the beat by hitting an arrow key. Miss a beat and you get an ugly sound. Things sounded pretty ugly. But I did start to get a little better after 15 minutes and was awarded occasionally by crowd cheers. It's a fun game. And I got a kick out of it. So did 41-year-old Alicia Verlager. For her, though, the fun is a bit more significant. She's visually impaired. ""Play is one of the ways in which people build relationships,"" she notes. ""It's fun to take on the challenge of a game and take turns encouraging and laughing at each other's sillier mistakes. That's the experience I am really craving in a game -- the social aspects."" AudiOdyssey is presently single-player only, and there's no scoring system. But a multiplayer online version will be released in a few months. Intriguingly, players in this version won't necessarily know whether their opponent is blind -- and it won't make a difference in the game. ""Ideally, they shouldn't even know that it is designed with the visually impaired in mind, since we want to make a 'mainstream' game,"" says Eitan Glinert, a 25-year-old grad student at GAMBIT and the lead researcher on AudiOdyssey, which is his thesis. That said, ""after they find out that the game is designed to be accessible, it increases awareness,"" he adds. Though using the Wiimote isn't necessary, Glinert believes it's a more fun and expressive option. From a development standpoint, getting the Wiimote to work with a PC game (it's meant to be used only with Nintendo's Wii) was a considerable engineering challenge. And players who want to use the device will have to do a little extra work, as well, including linking a Wiimote to a PC wirelessly via Bluetooth signal (instructions on how to do this are included with the game). Verlager believes AudiOdyssey's use of the Wiimote makes it unique among accessible games. It's also, as far as she knows, the first accessible music game for blind players. A startup called All inPlay offers online games, including poker, designed to allow play between blind and sighted users. For Verlager, it's important that games be mainstream and inclusive -- rather than ""special"" and for blind players. ""I really get frustrated with the way blind people are portrayed as if they live in isolation from the rest of the world and have no sighted family or friends,"" she says. Media, which includes video games, ""is something people share and participate in together, a way of building relationships and exploring feelings and attitudes about real life,"" she says. For now, AudiOdyssey is an ""early concept prototype,"" says Glinert. But ""ultimately, we'd love to bring the game to consoles,"" he adds. ""If we get the chance we'll definitely move quickly on that."" The current version of AudiOdyssey is available for free at the GAMBIT Game Lab Web site.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has placed high-profile prisoner Marwan Barghouti in solitary confinement following his public call for Palestinians to participate in popular resistance against Israel's occupation of lands Palestinians claim, the Israeli Prisons Authority said Monday. Israeli Prisons Authority representative Sivan Weizman said Barghouti had been placed in isolation for a period of seven days following the publication of a letter last week ""that called on Palestinians to take action against Israel."" The letter was considered incitement, she said. In addition to the period of solitary confinement, Barghouti will not be allowed visitors for 30 days, she said. Last week Barghouti released 17-point letter from prison outlining what he said was a new strategy aimed at achieving Palestinian statehood. Among his suggestions, Barghouti called on the Palestinian Authority to halt its security coordination with Israel in the West Bank. ""The job of the Palestinian security services is to provide security and protection to Palestinian citizens, not to protect the occupation,"" Barghouti wrote. He also called for the end of previous efforts by the West Bank government of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to engage in negotiations with Israel and expressed his support for a campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions against the Jewish state. ""It must be understood that there is no partner for peace in Israel when the settlements have doubled,"" Barghouti wrote. ""It is the Palestinian people's right to oppose the occupation in all means, and the resistance must be focused on the 1967 territories."" Barghouti is serving five life sentences following his 2002 conviction in an Israeli court for murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis. He is considered by many Palestinians to be the most important prisoner held by Israel and for some he is seen as the only possible political successor to Abbas. Abbas has said he will not seek reelection. Barghouti has been put in solitary confinement multiple times for public statements leaked from prison. Barghouti is a member of the central committee of the Palestinian movement Fatah, and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council.","Marwan Barghouti gets seven days in solitary and 30 with no visitors, Israel says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Forget the Royal Navy and the U.S. Marines -- the 'computer navy' is on its way, and digital media on the high seas are set to make a steaming comeback. New home? Barges like this one could soon play host to Google's massive data centers. It seemed that floating media firms were a thing of the past when the United Kingdom's last major offshore pirate radio station, Radio Caroline, followed other European and American examples and died out in the early 1990s. But, fast-forward 20 years and enter Internet giant Google. According to a patent application seen by London newspaper ""The Times,"" Google is considering launching barges up to seven miles (11km) offshore to host the massive data centers required to run its Internet search engines. The plan would likely see the data centers -- which consist of huge supercomputers -- use wave energy to power and cool themselves while stationed at sea. In the application Google states: ""Computing centers are located on a ship or ships, anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured, and turned into electricity and/or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away."" Energy consumption is undoubtedly a massive issue for these giant data centers. The servers within each data center need to be air-conditioned to prevent overheating -- and considering a company such as IBM runs approximately eight million square feet of servers -- that's a lot of required cooling. According to a 2005 study by Stanford University consulting professor and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs staff scientist, Jonathan Koomey, the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005. The total annual worldwide power bill for the servers at the time was an estimated $7.2 billion, according to Koomey. The Internet has continued to grow at a rapid rate and other major companies have also been searching for a more efficient method of maintaining their data centers. Microsoft has looked into taking advantage of a cold climate by constructing a data center in Siberia, while Sun Microsystems is reported to be sending its computers down a former coal mine, using water below the ground as a coolant. But, how workable is Google's project, really? And does it mark a potential new future for the maritime industry? Dr Brad Karp, reader in Computer Systems and Networks at University College London, described the move as ""an audacious risk"" that will push the boundaries for major companies in future. Karp said the project would carry significant risks, but potentially very high rewards. ""Anytime you take on several new technologies at the one time -- and you are trying to build something highly reliable -- there are going to be real technical challenges, which there will be for these data centers,"" he said. Some major benefits of Google's project include being able to save money on rent and property taxes by being positioned offshore, as well as saving money on electricity bills. ""If you look at the percentage of power being used by these centers ... it seems like a good long-term bet for the future,"" Karp told CNN. Karp believes Google could also benefit from snaring a ""green"" image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems, in addition to providing a quality service to users. ""One of the reasons Google has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are. This will still allow them to do that."" He said there were some logistical issues, but if the ships were stationed not far from the coast, they should not have too many operational concerns. ""At that distance (11km) you would want to provide wired network activity -- some sort of under-sea cable. The sheer bit-rate needed for an operation like this is usually too high for most wireless systems,"" Karp said. Karp does point out there could be plenty of maintenance required on such a system: ""The sea is not exactly a friendly environment for cables."" Although some commentators have raised concerns about the ships leaving themselves open to attack, Karp did not feel it was a major issue. ""It's not the kind of thing you see reported on very often. Typically the kind of things we worry about more is network-based attacks."" Current data centers are defended by corporate-type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances.  Karp envisages a similar level of protection for the centers at sea, potentially using a protective barrier or guarding vessels. If this project is realized, it offers the potential to alter not only online commerce, but also introduces the potential for new strands of business in the maritime industry. Maritime eCommerce Association spokesman Ake Nilson said: ""So far as I know there isn't anything quite like it. We haven't really seen anything like this since the old pirate radio stations."" Nilson says that if the project goes ahead -- and more companies attempt to adopt a similar program -- it could provide a sizable boost to the maritime industry through the ships and workers required to establish, run, protect and maintain such operations.","Google has sent a patent application to launch barges to host its data centers .
Wave energy could be used to power and cool the data centers' servers .
The project would save Google money on power bills, rent, and property tax .

"(CNN) -- Severe flooding in the Pacific island nation of Fiji has killed four people and left 800 people seeking shelter in evacuation centers, a government official said Monday.

"(CNN) -- Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter. It could be an uphill battle. J.M. Smucker Co. wants to assure consumers that its Jif brand of peanut butter is safe to eat. Companies such as ConAgra Foods Inc. and J.M. Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak. Eight people have died and nearly 600 have been sickened in the outbreak. The original peanut butter recall launched weeks ago has expanded to include more than 1,000 products. On ConAgra's Web site, a letter assures customers that the company's peanut butter is safe. ""ConAgra Foods, the maker of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, has confirmed that none of the ingredients used to make Peter Pan Peanut Butter come from Peanut Corporation of America, the company linked to the government's current salmonella investigation,"" the letter says. ""We are extremely confident in the safety protocols."" J.M. Smucker, maker of Jif peanut butter, had a similar message for customers. ""Our Smucker's peanut butter brand and peanut butter products are safe for consumption. The J.M. Smucker Company does not purchase peanuts or any ingredients from Peanut Corporation of America,"" its Web site says. The Peanut Corporation of America is under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration, and the FBI searched its Blakely, Georgia, plant on Monday, CNN affiliate WALB-TV in Albany, Georgia, reported. Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe.  Watch a senator express outrage at the outbreak » . ""With eight dead and almost 600 sick, it's a time to be prudent,"" said Dr. Douglas Powell, an associate professor of food safety at Kansas State University, which is the home of the International Food Safety Network. There's another problem, Powell said: ""None of these companies are really coming out and saying this is what we do to ensure safety. They say, 'Yeah, we test for salmonella.' But are those tests public? They're not."" Shoppers are wary because they don't know which products are safe, he said. Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores. But that isn't preventing consumers from playing it safe. Powell said he understands. ""If you're a parent packing a lunch and you have all the hectic things going on in the morning, is it really realistic to say, hey, before you put that peanut snack cracker individually wrapped item into your kid's lunch, you're going to go onto the Internet and check a Web site? I think that's a bit much. I think it's prudent to avoid this stuff until we see where this is going,"" he said.","Makers of Peter Pan and Jif distance firms from salmonella contamination .

"(CNN) -- Zombies, ghosts, even the devil himself are jumping off the page in this week's hot reads for Halloween. So if you're in the mood for something wicked, we've got you covered with some brand-new bone-chilling best-sellers. Although they're never actually called zombies in Colson Whitehead's ""Zone One,"" this is a zombie novel with real brains, a panache of pop-culture references and post-9/11 New York gloominess. n this darkly comic take on the apocalypse, a plague has killed off most of the world's population, leaving behind a wave of walking dead, called skels and stragglers. One of the survivors and the narrator of the novel, Mark Spitz, leads a team of ""sweepers,"" clearing the undead out of Zone One in lower Manhattan. While on its surface, this appears to be a zombie tale, it's really a survivors' story; most suffer from PASD, post-apocalyptic stress disorder. While the novel is speculative, it gives you a very realistic sense that the apocalypse, zombies and all, could happen anywhere, anytime. Whitehead, an up-and-coming voice in American literature, is not your run-of-the-mill horror writer. He's an award-winning novelist, a recipient of the MacArthur Genius Grant, author of a series of online essays on competing in the World Series of Poker and a frequent, funny and sardonic contributor to Twitter. You can follow him @colsonwhitehead. But he was raised on horror and science fiction stories, comic books and movies. He counts George Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead' as a key influence. While Whitehead puts his own fresh spin on the genre, the touchstones are there for old-school horror fans. Whitehead himself says, ""I like my zombies like I like my women: slow and implacable."" Read an excerpt from ""Zone One."" ""Are you there, Satan? It's me, Madison,"" begins the 11-year old narrator of Chuck Palahniuk's new novel, ""Damned."" It's the story of a little girl, the daughter of a film star and a billionaire, who dies unexpectedly and then has to navigate her way through the underworld. Accompanied by hell's version of ""The Breakfast Club,"" she treks through the Dandruff Desert, across the River of Vomit and up the Mountain of Toenail Clippings to face off with Satan. Like most of Palahniuk's work, it's not for the faint of heart or the easily offended. With a career spanning 15 years and 11 novels, including the iconic ""Fight Club,"" here, Palahniuk imagines hell as a bit like ""Dante's Inferno"" meets ""South Park,"" a land where ""The English Patient"" plays on endless repeat and the damned constantly interrupt your dinner from their afterlife call center. Palahniuk, who's lived through some pretty tough episodes himself, says his mother's battle with cancer was the inspiration for ""Damned,"" leaving him wondering about heaven and hell and what the afterlife holds. Here, he's come up with a thoroughly original vision, satiric and horrifying, enough so you'll want to repent after you read. Read an excerpt from ""Damned."" The ""Saw"" movie franchise has been a favorite of horror fans for years. Now, the authors behind several in the slasher series have moved from the big screen to books. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan wrote the screenplays for ""Saw IV,"" ""Saw V,"" ""Saw VI"" and ""Saw 3D."" They've teamed up with Stephen Romano, an acclaimed author, screenwriter and illustrator, on their debut novel, ""Black Light,"" which comes across like ""Ghostbusters"" on steroids. Paranormal private eye Buck Carlsbad sees dead people in this supernatural noir. He's an exorcist for hire, ready to get rid of your ghosts, for a fee. Haunted by his past, Buck has spent years seeking out the person, or thing, that murdered his parents and left him for dead. In his latest case, Buck is hired to ride shotgun on a high-tech bullet train as it speeds across the desert version of the Bermuda Triangle at 400 miles per hour. The triangle is a place where Buck almost died a few years ago and where he swore he would never return. Now he's back to brave myriad ghouls, ghosts and spirits and hopefully solve the most harrowing unfinished case of his career.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The leaders of five of the world's top emerging economies moved closer Thursday toward establishing a development bank that could one day serve as an alternative to the World Bank. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- collectively known as the BRICS -- ""agreed to examine in greater detail a proposal to set up a BRICS-led South-South Development Bank, funded and managed by the BRICS and other developing countries,"" said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. The leaders were meeting in New Delhi on Thursday for their fourth annual summit. Finance ministers from the five countries have been directed to look into the idea of the development bank and report back at the next summit, Singh said. The leaders also asked the International Monetary Fund to speed up changes in its governance to better represent the developing world as a voting bloc. ""The rapid recovery of the BRICS economies from the financial crisis highlighted their role as growth drivers of the global economy,"" Singh said. Together, the BRICS nations make up more than 40% of the world population and one-fifth of the global economy. The group called for peaceful resolutions of the Syria and Iranian crises. ""We agreed that a lasting solution to the problems in Syria and Iran can only be found through dialogue,"" Singh said. Besides the IMF, the leaders also urged reforms of the United Nations and other international bodies for a larger voice for the developing world. ""Institutions of global political and economic governance created more than six decades ago have not kept pace with the changing world. While some progress has been made in international financial institutions, there is lack of movement on the political side,"" Singh said. ""BRICS should speak with one voice on important issues such as the reform of the UN Security Council.""","The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa hold talks Thursday .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- U.S.-South Korean joint military drills kick off Monday, one day after North Korea threatened to engulf Seoul in a ""sea of flames."" The annual exercises are taking place amid high tensions. North Korea shelled Yeongpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians, last November. The U.S insists the drills are defensive in nature while training forces to respond to any provocation but North Korea has always denounced them as preparing for an invasion to topple Kim Jong-il's regime. North Korea's military said Sunday it would retaliate with ""an all-out offensive to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' military occupation of South Korea."" The military also said the world will see actions ""engulfing Seoul in a sea of flames, smashing every move for confrontation."" The North often issues such warnings before military drills, but tensions are higher after November's shelling and the March sinking of the South Korean warship, Cheonan, which the South blames on the North. North Korea also threatened to fire on sites in South Korea where activists and politicians have released balloons carrying propaganda leaflets and DVDs showing anti-government protests across the Middle East and northern Africa. The balloons sometimes carry food and clothes. The North condemned the ""psychological warfare"" of ""clothes, rotten videos and books."" The two drills, Key Resolve, which ends March 10, and Foal Eagle, which finishes at the end of April, will involve 12,300 U.S. forces, many of them coming from units stationed outside Korea. They will also include 200,000 military personnel from South Korea. There are reports of a U.S. aircraft carrier taking part, but neither side has confirmed this. A U.S. military official told CNN there are no plans for exercises to involve the five frontline islands in the Yellow Sea that are closest to North Korea.","First of two joint military exercises starts Monday .

"(CNN) -- The Texas Rangers will raise the height of the rails at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, the team said Tuesday, after a 39-year-old fan fell to his death while trying to catch a ball. ""Even though all current rail heights in Rangers Ballpark in Arlington currently exceed code, the Rangers intend to raise the height of all rails in front of seating areas to the highest standard in the United States at this time,"" the team said in a statement. As the rails are being refitted, the Rangers said they would take ""interim"" steps, such as posting new signs that will remind fans not to lean, sit on or stand against the rails. The team will also issue a warning prior to the start of each game via its public address system, the Rangers said. The news comes in the wake of the death of Shannon Stone, a veteran firefighter and Rangers fan whose death prompted a national outpouring of condolences. In the second inning of the ill-fated game on July 7, star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into an area near a scoreboard, suffering fatal injuries. Stone is survived by his wife, Jenny, and his young son, Cooper, who witnessed the tragic accident. Another man fell at the stadium last year but survived. On July 6, 2010, a fan fell while trying to catch a foul ball. The man, Tyler Morris, survived the 30-foot drop but fractured his skull and injured his foot and ankle. ""The safety of our fans is our top priority,"" Rangers CEO and President Nolan Ryan said in the statement. ""The initiatives we are announcing today for Rangers Ballpark in Arlington will help to ensure that we meet that priority.""","The team will also post new signs warning fans not to lean, sit on or stand against the rails .

"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, Bob Crowley reports from Boston, Massachusetts. Hardware store owner Brendan Kenney says ""people who have money should go out and spend it."" BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Brendan Kenney has seen enough bad news about the economy. ""I'm also getting tired of being worried,"" he says. His family has been running a small hardware store in Brookline, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, for about 56 years. He says business has slowed down a little, but mostly because winter is normally the slow time of year for them. Though he hopes the stimulus plan will help his and other small businesses, he believes people shouldn't be afraid. ""I think the American consumer holds a lot of power,"" he continues. ""I think people who have money should go out and spend it."" Like many in the Boston area, Kenney doesn't want to hear more discouraging stories and sees that as part of the problem. ""It's just negative story after negative story, kind of creating a crisis of confidence.""  Watch Boston-area reaction to the economic slump » . South of Boston, Jose Nieto, from Plainville, has his own reasons to be discouraged. Between September and October of last year, he was laid off twice. Nieto, a civil engineer who works on road construction projects, had felt fortunate. After losing his job of 14 years, he was able to find employment after only being out of work for two weeks. After being on the new job for three weeks, however, he got called into the boss's office. ""I said, 'Oh, no. My God, not again.'"" He was faced with looking for work in an industry that traditionally slows down in the winter months. ""It's more than losing your job. It gives you a feeling of rejection,"" he says. Yet, Nieto feels this is a time to learn valuable lessons, especially for those who need to dip into their savings when unemployment checks don't cover all of the bills. ""I think a lot of people will learn from this situation, and, going forward, they'll try to save more money."" He has been trying to stay healthy, busy and positive. Passing the time working on projects in his basement workshop and taking yoga classes has helped him get through the rough spots, and his luck is turning. He was offered a job that starts in March. ""It is a relief, because I'm employed,"" he says, ""however, I'm taking a job for much less money."" Nieto believes that most employers cannot afford to hire at the salaries they could offer in the past. Like Kenney's hardware store, Sue Stein's American craft gallery, also in Brookline, is not seeing any major shifts in her business, yet. ""Our business has been certainly down, but not devastating,"" she says. Fire Opal, her gallery, sells everything from earrings to pottery to scarves, all made by artists from around the country. To keep her business healthy, she says, she is trying to make adjustments like buying less merchandise. But she is changing her approach to her customers as well. She says she tries to keep ""understanding that people are having a hard time and trying to find things that are more in their price range."" Like Kenney and Nieto, Stein is also trying to stay optimistic. ""I think if we all are very careful,"" she says, ""we'll sort of ride it out and then things will adjust.""","Hardware store owner in Boston slams ""negative story after negative story""

"New York (CNN) -- Most people toss out their busted umbrellas after a strong storm rips them apart. But for Catherine Charlot, these broken remnants are true treasures. After rainy weather hits New York City, Charlot takes to the streets collecting umbrellas from roads, subway stations and trash cans. Then she totes them back to her Brooklyn studio and transforms them from trash into fashion. Her unique pieces are anything but shabby. Charlot creates chic cocktail dresses, tote bags and dog clothes from umbrella material and other recycled fabrics for her clothing line Himane. She has even made a wedding dress using 15 white umbrellas. After watching the film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" Charlot was inspired to make her own version of the little black dress, thinking, ""I really love that black dress, but I don't want to do the same kind of little black dress. What about I try something out of umbrellas? ""And I took 3 umbrellas and I designed a beautiful gown."" Wet-weather months provide an abundance of fabric for Charlot. ""In March, during the rainy month, I collected 237 umbrellas,"" she said. The job can lead to interesting situations. One woman who came across Charlot digging deep in a trash can mistook her for a homeless person and offered her lunch. But Charlot doesn't mind. She believes she is helping to reduce the amount of garbage on the streets. ""I think I'm doing a lot. I'm helping a lot because all those umbrellas and all those fabrics are going to end up in a landfill."" Her creations are mostly sold online. The umbrella dresses start at $200, dog clothes are $40, and purses are about $150. It's fashion for a good cause. Charlot says 10 percent of every sale she makes will go to a school she is building in her home country of Haiti. The school, Charlot said, will be ""something young kids can just go and learn something positive, learn how to recycle, how to do something with their hands, and be useful for tomorrow."" Charlot believes she is making a difference at home, too. ""By purchasing and buying one dress, a bag made out of a recycled umbrella, right there you're showing your support, you're doing something that is right, that is good for the environment, for you, for your kids, or for everybody,"" she said. Meanwhile, Charlot is committed to braving the rainy New York City streets on the hunt for trashed umbrellas.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The United States called on coup leaders in Mali on Friday to step down and allow for elections to take place. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner spoke one day after the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) gave the military junta that ousted Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure three days to hand back power to civilians or face ""diplomatic and financial embargo."" ""We echo ECOWAS's call for the mutineers to step down and allow for a swift return to democratic rule and for presidential elections to ultimately take place,"" he told reporters in Washington. The group of African leaders issued its warning Thursday after meeting in emergency session. ECOWAS ""invite(s) its states to impose a travel ban for members of the junta and a diplomatic and financial embargo on the country if there is no return to constitutional order within a maximum period of 72 hours,"" said Kadre Desire Ouedraogo, the group's president. In addition to closing borders shared with member states and banning travel outside Mali by junta members, ECOWAS said its potential sanctions include a ""freezing of assets of the junta members and their partners, as well as no access to the ports of the coastal countries of ECOWAS."" Mali could also face the freezing of its accounts at the West African Central Bank. The group of heads of states led by Ivorian President and ECOWAS Chairman Allasane Ouattara met in Abidjan, after a pro-junta demonstration at the airport in the Malian capital of Bamako prevented them from landing in Mali for a prearranged meeting. They were heading to to meet with key members of the junta, which wrested control of the West African nation last week. Megan Larson-Kone of the U.S. mission in Mali told CNN that ""a small group of demonstrators ... threatened to put themselves on the runway, making it difficult for the aircraft to land. The diplomatic missions of the countries involved made a decision that it would be safer ... to turn back."" The ECOWAS leaders had arranged a meeting with Capt. Amadou Sanogo, leader the junta that deposed Toure, a two-term president. Coup leaders deposed the president, occupied his residence and took over the national television station after accusing the country's defense minister of failing to provide them with enough resources to fight an insurgency in the north. Meanwhile, the nomadic Tuareg who are fighting for autonomy in the north have taken advantage of chaos in the capital to occupy more territory. Toner, on Friday, said he was aware of reports to that effect and that the United States is ""very concerned."" Now in Mali -- once hailed as a shining example of African democracy, having experienced more than 20 years of democratic government -- the threat of sanctions has prompted some to take precautions. Mamadou Konate, a Bamako resident, told CNN that people were lining up to empty their bank accounts. ""We are stocking up,"" Konate said. ""These sanction are severe and will harm the small people, 80% of the population."" Mali, a poor country with no access to the sea and heavily dependent on foreign aid, is divided after the coup. Many Malians have taken to the streets to show their support for the junta. Likewise, opponents of the junta have demonstrated in hopes of seeing the soldiers go. On Monday, the United States suspended a portion of its aid to Mali in response to the coup. ""We want to see the elected government restored as quickly as possible,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. On Tuesday, ECOWAS suspended Mali's membership, with Ouattara saying, ""Dialogue and consultation will be the first instruments in finding a solution, but (ECOWAS members) will not hesitate to use any other option.""

"London (CNN) -- The leader of the eurozone's fastest growing economy says he has faced broad public opposition at home to bailing out ""rich Greece people who are always drinking the ouzo."" Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip told CNN that many in his country had questioned why they should bear the burden of bailing out Greece -- a larger, wealthier country. ""It is very difficult to explain to our poor Estonian people why we have to help rich Greece people who are always drinking the ouzo and dancing the syrtaki,"" he said. ""This is public opinion,"" he hastened to add. ""In fact, they are hard-working people in Greece."" In January 2011, Estonia became the first ex-Soviet state to start using the single European currency, joining the eurozone as Europe's debt crisis was deepening. Shouldering the financial strain of the European Financial Stability Facility had been ""very unpopular"" among Estonians, said Ansip. ""They would like to get higher salaries today, right now here in Estonia -- they cannot understand why we have to have all this."" Nevertheless, joining the eurozone had been the right decision, he said. ""All people they can understand how beneficial euro was for Estonia,"" he said. Although his country suffered from high unemployment and inflation, the euro made Estonia attractive for foreign direct investment, creating new jobs and export volumes. ""Europe is definitely supporting trade,"" he said. ""Seventy per cent of exports are going to other EU member states."" Stagnant rates of economic growth in Europe were a concern, he said. ""But ... our main export partners are Sweden and Finland, and those economies are doing pretty well."" He added the Greek rescue package was a loan, ""not a bail out."" ""They have to pay back those (loans),"" he said. ""And they also have to pay interest."" Estonia, a Baltic state of about 1.3 million people, joined the European Union in 2004. It is the fourth-smallest member of the eurozone.","Estonia's PM says there are concerns at home about having to bail out out ""rich Greece""

"(CNN) -- The sad state of the economy doesn't appear to be affecting the festive mood in New Orleans, Louisiana. A crowd of people try to catch beads on Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday last year. ""Things are sort of buzzing down here right now, and it feels good,"" said Michael Valentino, a local businessman who owns three hotels in the French Quarter. ""Didn't know what to expect this year, but it appears that interest is high and people are acting on that decision in order to make Carnival part of their travel plans."" Hotel bookings are on pace with last year, and the city is anticipating between 700,000 and 800,000 Mardi Gras visitors this year -- at least as many as 2008. Some tourism officials and business owners expect this year's attendance to top last year's numbers because Fat Tuesday, on February 24 this year, falls nearly three weeks later, giving visitors more time to plan and budget for the trip after the winter holidays. As of Thursday, Valentino's Place d'Armes Hotel was about 96 percent booked for Mardi Gras' busiest weekend, in line with the Greater New Orleans Hotel and Lodging Association's indications for Saturday bookings, the season's peak night. iReport.com: Send your travel photos of New Orleans . Other early indicators also are promising. Crowds for last Friday night's Pygmalion and Oshun parades were as thick as Valentino has ever seen them. He operates bleachers along St. Charles Avenue and is on the street every year. Typically the early, smaller-scale parades don't draw much attention, he said. ""It just appears that people feel the need to relax and celebrate, and Mardi Gras is an opportunity to step back from what they're dealing with every day and spend a little time in a mellower, less threatening, more carefree type of an environment."" Despite high expectations for Mardi Gras, the city's tourism industry hasn't completely dodged the economic downturn. Valentino has seen a dip in corporate and meeting inquiries at his hotels and less interest from leisure travelers during times that don't surround special events. Still, visitation levels for the first quarter of 2009 have remained strong, according to the New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau, which spokeswoman Kelly Schulz attributes to meetings and conventions, Mardi Gras and marketing efforts to promote the city as a value destination compared with other popular American cities. New Orleans' sparkling culinary reputation is part of its unique draw, and Patois, an Uptown restaurant away from the throngs of revelers in the French Quarter, is looking forward to a strong weekend. By Thursday afternoon, the 60-seat restaurant had 90 people on the books for Saturday night. Chef-owner Aaron Burgau said business has been better since the beginning of the year. Patois is closing Sunday, when the restaurant usually is open for brunch, and Burgau plans to ride in the Bacchus parade for the first time Sunday night. The ride comes at no small cost: Burgau estimated he spent about $2,500 on beads, krewe dues, a float assessment and other expenses. Orders from krewes for beads and other throws are up this year, according to Daryl Fletchinger, owner of retail store Mardi Gras Spot and a wholesale business. ""Interestingly, everybody wants to put all of the sad, pessimistic, negative news out of their minds and do something that's very normal for New Orleanians, and that is put on the greatest free show on earth.""","Mardi Gras attendance expected to meet or exceed 2008 numbers .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Police arrested 13 men in Barcelona and Valencia early Tuesday on suspicion of working in an international document forgery ring, possibly with links to Islamic terrorists, a police statement said. Spanish police detain a suspect following the arrests in Valencia and Barcelona Tuesday. ""There are arrests. The police have to determine who is who,"" a government source told CNN. The suspects include 11 Pakistani nationals, an Indian and a Nigerian. Most of the arrests were in Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city, but two were in Valencia, the third-largest city, also on the Mediterranean coast, south of Barcelona, the police statement said. The ring, in addition to providing forged passports, also trafficked in drugs and human beings, in a network stretching to Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Thailand, and police in those countries were part of the investigation, the statement said. The ring operated by stealing passports in various Spanish cities and sending them to Thailand, where they were altered and sent to the other five European countries to criminal networks, to facilitate fraudulent border crossings. Investigators in all of the countries involved were now searching for links between the passport forgery ring and Islamic terrorists, the statement said. Police searches of locales in Barcelona and Valencia turned up material to forge documents, dozens of passports, some already forged and others blank and waiting to be filled in, passport-sized photographs of numerous people, computer information and cell phones. Police did not mention finding any weapons or explosives in their searches. The operation was coordinated by a judge at Spain's anti-terrorism National Court in Madrid.","Most of the arrests were in Barcelona, according to Spanish media .

"Washington (CNN) -- On Capitol Hill, the beginning of this year will look a lot like the end of last year. The fight over extending a payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits picks back up Tuesday as Congress returns to work after its winter break. While aides in both parties say it's likely Congress will resolve that dispute, Republicans are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that Senate Democrats will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year. And Democrats are concerned that House Republicans will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board. The presidential campaign will take center stage this year. President Barack Obama already has made clear he plans to run against a ""do-nothing"" Congress and will likely highlight that theme during the annual State of the Union address next week. Facing that high-profile push against them, and with congressional approval ratings in the single digits and the fight for control of both chambers in the balance, lawmakers know they have a heavy lift to convince voters they deserve re-election. Democrats, who run the Senate, and Republicans, who control the House, acknowledge that outside of the payroll tax cut bill no major legislation is expected to make it through Congress this year. However, each party promises a series of bills to advance what it thinks the public wants from Capitol Hill in response to the weak economy. For both sides, these efforts will be more about political messaging than actually legislating because few, if any, are likely to become law. Congressional tensions . This week House Republicans will huddle at their annual three-day retreat in Baltimore to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to President Obama and Congressional Democrats. But high on the agenda at that meeting for House Speaker John Boehner is likely to be an effort to bridge severe divisions with his own rank-and- file, many of whom questioned his leadership over the course of several showdowns with the White House and Democrats last year. Conservatives want Boehner to be more aggressive in standing for their principles. Tensions between Senate Democrats and Republicans are also high. The president's decision earlier this month to make a recess appointment of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau while the Congress was technically not recessed drew a swift and angry response from Republicans. Top GOP aides privately grumbled the move set a bad tone for the coming year and invited Republicans to be even less cooperative. And with key economic nominees needing Senate confirmation, including a new Director of Office of Management and Budget after Jack Lew was named White House chief of staff, Republicans could cause problems for the president and Senate Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Congress spent months on issues unnecessarily last year, pointing out that President Ronald Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times while in the White House. ""We've had obstructionism on steroids,"" Reid said. A top Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party isn't overly concerned. That's because Democrats believe GOP obstructionism is at such a high level now -- where filibusters are routine -- they already expect a major fight on every nominee. Finishing the payroll tax cut bill . When Congress limped out of town before Christmas, it agreed to a two-month extension of a bill that cuts payroll taxes, extends unemployment benefits and prevents a cut in the rate paid to doctors who care for Medicare patients. As they begin talks on an extension for the rest of 2012, both sides remain highly skeptical and suspicious of each other. Questions linger for congressional negotiators -- how to pay for the $200 billion price tag and whether to tighten requirements for unemployment benefits. Democrats are worried Republicans will push for other issues, such as renewing their demand for the approval of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline or the elimination of a range of EPA regulations on businesses. Some in the GOP are wary the White House and Senate Democrats will try again to pass a surtax on millionaires -- something even some Democrats don't support -- as a way of painting the GOP as protectors of the rich. ""The only way this process will not go smoothly and through regular order is if the White House chooses to disrupt it for political reasons,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. Informal discussions between House and Senate negotiators have already begun. Reid told ""Meet the Press"" that he hopes the tea party faction in the House doesn't have the same influence on talks that it did in December's impasse, calling that ""bad for the country."" ""I would hope the two Republican leaders would have learned from what took place in the previous year,"" Reid said. Debt ceiling again . Right out of the gate when Congress returns, lawmakers will have to respond formally to the president's recent request to raise the debt ceiling. As part of the choreography agreed to last summer, members will get a chance to vote against the president's request, but it's mostly for show because the reality is Congress doesn't have the votes to block an increase. Two other significant bills need attention this winter. One is a new Federal Aviation Administration bill that is stalled over disputes on labor rights and a costly government program to subsidize air travel to rural areas. Senators also want to pass a highway bill that would fund road and bridge construction for the next two years. Obama is supposed to formally submit his budget for 2013 in February. Last year, Republicans criticized his budget for failing to reform entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, which represent the bulk of the nation's massive budget deficit. ""If he punts again, it will be clear the White House plans to spend the year on autopilot. We think that would be unacceptable to the American people,"" Boehner's aide said. On the Keystone matter, the administration already is facing a congressionally mandated deadline on February 21 to approve the project or explain why it won't. Democrats say they expect the White House to reject the plan -- because the administration has said it can't finish its environmental review by then -- but Republicans are promising to continue to hammer the administration on the issue. Bills to help the economy and send a message to voters . In addition to their push for Keystone, House Republicans are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country. The bill will include offshore drilling, energy exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), as well as give money to states along with more flexibility to build roads and bridges. The new spending on highway projects would be offset by revenue from oil and gas leases. But the White House is unlikely to support the GOP proposals and they are unlikely to go anywhere in the Democratic-led Senate. Even without much hope for actually passing these bills House Republican aides stress they will continue focusing on measures to boost the weak economy to show they are responding to voters' concerns, and they emphasize that many of these proposals have had Democratic support. ""The House is going to continue to work hard to produce results for small businesses, working families and middle class Americans,"" one House GOP aide told CNN. ""If the president wishes to ignore Congress and play political games, that's his decision, but by doing so he will own the gridlock,"" the aide said. In addition to the bills on jobs, the House also is expected to take up legislation to make more transparent members of Congress' stock trades and other financial transactions. GOP leaders plan to vote on the so-called ""STOCK Act"" which would ban lawmakers from using any non-public information to trade stocks or make other financial transactions. Senate Democrats want to draw a line to job creation with almost everything they do this year. That starts with the highway and FAA bills, which Democrats say will create thousands of jobs. It will then continue all year with a myriad of bills Democrats think will prove to a wary public they are putting jobs first. A measure to fund school construction is another example of a bill Democrats hope to highlight. Lawmakers from both parties say they are determined before the end of the year to prevent deep cuts to the defense budget as called for after the deficit reduction ""super committee"" failed to reach a deal to slash the deficit. Aides said serious work to find alternative spending reductions probably won't happen until after the election in November. Control of Congress . As voters go to the polls this year, members are expected to spend less time in Washington and more time in their districts making the case for why their party ought to be steering the country's economic agenda. Democrats need to pick up 25 seats to regain control of the House -- a high hurdle, but one many Democrats feel is within reach because they think voters will blame Republicans for the gridlock in Washington. Senate Republicans feel more confident they can win control of their chamber, especially after the retirements of several key Democratic senators in states that lean Republican. Right now the Democrats hold a 53-47 advantage. But Democrats are defending 23 seats this year while Republicans are working to hold just 10. The recent announcement by Sen. Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat from Nebraska, that he would not seek re-election is seen by Republicans as another sign Democrats will lose majority control.","Fight over payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits picks back up .

"(CNN) -- An explosion occured late Monday morning at the Fukushima Daiichi's No. 3 nuclear reactor building, a government official told reporters. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that the head of the nuclear plant reports that the container vessel, surrounding the reactor, remains intact. Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed images of white smoke rising above the facility, which is in northeastern Japan. Citing the nation's nuclear and industrial agency, NHK said that a wall of one of the reactor's buildings had collapsed. The 600 residents remaining within 20 kilometers of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors, according to Edano. The secretary added that initial reports suggested that radiation levels had increased after the blast. But Edano said he did not believe there was a massive leak, given that water continues to be injected into the reactors and that the pressure inside the reactor is ""within a certain range."" ""We are now collecting information on the concentration of radiation,"" Edano said. The facility is in the area of northeast Japan devasted by last week's earthquake and tsunami.","The explosion occurred late Monday morning at the Fukushima #3 reactor building .

"(CNN) -- Apple's voice assistant took an extended coffee break on Thursday. Asked by the blog VentureBeat what she'd been doing during an apparent service outage, Siri, the voice-controlled ""assistant"" that's the standout feature of the new iPhone 4S, replied in a way that would raise any employer's eyebrows: . She just listed the names of a bunch of day spas. ""Siri where have you been all day?"" the blogger asked. Her response: ""I found 12 places matching 'All Day' ... 11 of them are not far from you."" Well, at least she responded. For much of Thursday -- five hours, according to CNN's partner site Fortune -- Apple's voice-controlled assistant wasn't functioning at all for some people, apparently because of a server outage. Siri needs to communicate with computers that are in the cloud to understand and process voice commands, leading observers to believe something went wrong with that system. Apple hasn't commented on the outage and did not immediately respond to CNN's request for information. Many iPhone 4S users, when they asked Siri questions Thursday, reported being greeted with this: ""Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to the network."" That message came even when phones were connected to Wi-Fi or 3G networks, according to the reports, which surfaced on tech blogs and Twitter. Some Siri users felt kind of lost without their personal assistant. That's pretty amazing when you consider that Siri is definitely a new hire. The iPhone 4S went on sale October 14. But some people already have come to depend on her in those three weeks. ""(I)t was awful. I had to use the annoying google app to find a jamba juice!!"" the Twitter user @The_Beer_Baron_ wrote in response to a question from CNN about the outage. ""She's usually pretty reliable although sassy,"" that user said. Tech writers debated which management style might be best for this errant helper. Sarah Perez at TechCrunch thought it might be best to cut her some slack. Or maybe not. ""Granted, Siri is still a beta product -- and this is what happens to beta products -- but when Apple promotes Siri as one of the best and OMG-gotta-have-it new features of its latest device through its cloying new TV ads, it's worth noticing when the service doesn't quite deliver as promised,"" she wrote. Others see her responsibilities -- namely answering her owner's questions, finding directions, calling people and looking up songs to play -- as unrealistic given Siri's job qualifications. Maybe it's too much to think the servers that run Siri -- a complicated and fairly new technology that's been tried and failed before -- would always be up and running. ""Not only is AI still in its infancy -- a condition it's been in for more than half a century -- but it relies in its current incarnation on networks and servers whose unreliability you can bank on,"" Philip Elmer-DeWitt wrote on Fortune's Apple 2.0 blog. ""Good thing the iPhone still has a touchscreen."" Things may turn out OK though. So far, no one seems to want to fire Siri just yet. Well, except maybe this Furby.","Siri, Apple's voice assistant, experienced an outage on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been released from a Virginia hospital 10 days after undergoing a heart transplant, his office said Tuesday. Cheney, 71, who has a history of heart trouble, had surgery at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia. He's suffered at least five heart attacks since 1978, . ""As he leaves the hospital, the former Vice President and his family want to again express their deep gratitude to the donor and the donor's family for this remarkable gift,"" his office said in a statement. Cheney had been on the cardiac transplant list for more than 20 months. In June 2010, he was hospitalized at George Washington University for conditions related to his coronary artery disease. He had a left ventricular assist device implanted to help his heart pump. Nine years earlier, Cheney got a pacemaker after experiencing irregular heart rhythms. The former Wyoming congressman served as an influential vice president with President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, and he had served in and out of government since the late 1960s.","Dick Cheney has been released from a Virginia hospital .

"Seattle (CNN) -- Even as snowfall slowed Wednesday in the Pacific Northwest, officials warned that falling temperatures would make roads icy and dangerous for drivers. ""We are seeing multiple spinouts and collisions,"" the Washington State Department of Transportation reported on its website, advising drivers to slow down as road conditions worsened. Some normally busy streets in Seattle looked more like ski runs, as residents with sleds and snowboards took advantage of what could be one of the area's largest snowfalls in decades. The National Weather Service canceled a winter storm warning for the area Wednesday afternoon, but said a winter weather advisory would remain in effect until midnight. Light snowfall was expected to continue throughout the evening. High-wind warnings were in effect along the coast, where winds could gust to hurricane force, knocking down trees and causing power outages, said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Wednesday's snowfall in Seattle may equal its annual average, Ward said. CNN affiliate KOMO showed images of overturned vehicles and carports and awnings that collapsed under the weight of the snow. Precipitation moving in from the south and west is combining with cold air moving south from Canada to create the heavy snowfall, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist at the weather service's Seattle office. If snowfall amounts top 7 inches, the winter weather event will rank among Seattle's 10 worst since the early 1940s, when record-keeping began, he added. A series of severe winter storms and record-breaking cold also hit the region in the 1950s, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. While that amount of snow is no problem in places that receive snow regularly, heavy snowfall is relatively rare in Seattle, where steep hills can make winter travel treacherous. ""This city shuts down when winter hits. It's nuts. ... This city is just so unprepared for snow,"" Derek Stanek, 25, told CNN's iReport. Are you there? Share your photos and video . Nevertheless, city officials maintained they were ready for the storm. Deicing measures were in place on bridges and overpasses, emergency shelters were opened, schools were closed and some flights were canceled. Using a ruler outside his home near Tacoma, Washington, Joel Pederson measured 6 inches of snow Wednesday. And it was still coming down, Pederson told CNN's iReport. ""We have not had this much snow since the 1980s,"" he said. Official snow measurements for the day were not expected until Thursday morning. But Washington's capital, Olympia, had already received 13 inches of snow by Wednesday afternoon: the third highest 24-hour snowfall on record and the largest amount of snow that had fallen there since 1972, when 14.2 inches of snow fell in one day. As of late Wednesday morning, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport had received 4 inches of snow, with 4.7 inches measured in Tacoma, as the second of twin winter storms moved through, according to the National Weather Service . Up to 8 inches of snow was forecast for the metropolitan area. The town of Winlock, Washington, about 105 miles south of Seattle, had received 16 inches by late Wednesday morning, the weather service said. The town of Chehalis, about 18 miles north of Winlock, had 14 inches. Mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest will see even more snow, with the largest accumulations on the eastern slopes of the Cascades, according to the weather service. Significant snowfall is expected across southern Washington, northwest Oregon and into western Idaho. From late Tuesday through early Thursday, 2 feet to 3.5 feet of snow is forecast for the mountains east of Seattle, Guy said. Mount Rainier could see 10 feet of snow by Friday. However, the snow in Portland, Oregon, had changed into heavy rain Wednesday morning as warm air intruded into the area. The city was under a flood advisory because of the rain and melting snow, the weather service said. High winds were also forecast for the area. At Otter Rock, on the central Oregon coast, a gust of 110 mph was recorded, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris reported, along with gusts topping 80 mph at Lincoln City and Florence. The first storm moved into the area Monday and Tuesday. ""It's pretty big when you get back-to-back storms like that,"" weather service meteorologist Roger Cloutier said. Winter storm warnings Wednesday touched portions of eight states, stretching into Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The snowfall extends south into Oregon, with as much as 18 inches forecast for the Bend area. CNN affiliate KTVZ in Bend said an earlier round of snow over the weekend gave a boost to local ski resorts but also created dangerous driving conditions that left at least one motorist dead. Those conditions were expected to worsen. ""Expect extreme travel difficulties to develop on Wednesday,"" the weather service said, advising those who must take to the roads during the storm to carry a flashlight, blankets and extra food and water. The Washington State Department of Transportation said 1,250 workers will use nearly 500 pieces of equipment statewide to treat and plow roadways. The heavy snowfall will be followed by rain in Seattle, which could produce accumulated water and urban flooding, Guy said. ""It's just gonna be a mess all around,"" he said of the coming few days in the Seattle area. CNN's Thelma Gutierrez, Brad Lendon, Sean Morris and Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.","NEW: Officials say falling temperatures will make roads dangerous for drivers .

"(CNN) -- The JetBlue pilot arrested after an apparent midair meltdown last week was ordered held without bond during a brief appearance before a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, on Monday morning, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The U.S. magistrate ordered that Clayton Osbon, 49, be held in the Randall County jail until a detention hearing to determine his bond on Thursday, the prosecutor's spokesman said. Osbon, the captain of JetBlue Flight 191, has been in custody at a hospital where he has been treated since last Tuesday, when he was arrested and later charged with interfering with a flight crew. His remarks and erratic behavior on the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas led the co-pilot to lock Osbon out of the cockpit, according to a federal criminal complaint. Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the cockpit door so hard that the first officer thought Osbon would come through, the document said. The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who was his co-pilot. ""Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. ""When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon."" The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the jet, which made an emergency landing in Amarillo last week, will be analyzed, officials have said.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Syrian authorities have moved perhaps hundreds of detainees to military sites to hide them from Arab League monitors assessing whether the government is upholding a commitment to end its crackdown on protesters, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. ""Syria has shown it will stop at nothing to undermine independent monitoring of its crackdown,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Syria's subterfuge makes it essential for the Arab League to draw clear lines regarding access to detainees, and be willing to speak out when those lines are crossed."" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told The Independent last week that the international monitors could move around the country ""under the protection"" of the government but would not be permitted to visit sensitive military sites. HRW said it was told by a Syrian security officer in Homs that his prison director had ordered him to transfer about 400 to 600 detainees from his detention facility to other places. ""The transfers happened in installments,"" the official said, according to HRW. ""Some detainees were moved in civilian jeeps and some in cargo trucks. My role was inside the prison, gathering the detainees and putting them in the cars. My orders from the prison director were to move the important detainees out,"" the official said, according to HRW. He said that officials told him the detainees were being taken to a military missile factory in Zaidal, outside of Homs. Other witnesses corroborated his account, HRW said. The Syrian security officer also said the government has issued police identification cards to military officials, according to the human rights group. HRW said it has a document that appears to be from the Syrian Defense Ministry ordering the transfer of personnel from the Defense Ministry to the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police. ""Dressing soldiers in police uniforms does not meet the Arab League call to withdraw the army,"" Whitson said. ""The Arab League needs to cut through Syrian government deception by pushing for full access to anywhere Syria is holding detainees."" Jamal Barakat, a member of the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights, said he is part of the Arab League mission. He said Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby had ""emphasized the importance of neutrality, objectivity and transparency of our work"" during the fact-finding mission. During the mission, the areas visited will include the provinces of Homs, Idlib, Hama, Damascus and Daraa, el-Araby said. In Washington, acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said that the Syrian government has used the last few days -- before the arrival of the international monitors over the weekend and on Monday -- to increase their attacks on Daraa and other cities. ""They saw an opportunity prior to these Arab League monitors arriving,"" he said. ""We obviously look to these individuals to be intrepid in their search for the truth of what's happening on the ground, and we would ask, or demand rather, that the Syrian authorities allow them full access to the Syrian people in order to carry out their mission."" Inside Syria, the carnage continued, with security forces assaulting demonstrators in the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama on Tuesday, witnesses told CNN. An opposition group said 39 people, two of them children, were killed Tuesday. Four deaths occurred along the Lebanese border, 14 in Homs, three at Damascus University, four in Daraa, four in the Damascus suburbs, three each in Idlib and Hama, two in Deir Ezzor and one each in Saraqeb and Latakia, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group that organizes and documents demonstrations. Security forces shot tear gas and bullets at protesters at Clock Square in downtown Homs, where thousands had gathered, said Loubna, a Homs resident who cited security concerns in asking that her full name not be used. She said she saw seven people injured and dozens arrested. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group with contacts across the country, said more than 70,000 protesters tried to enter the square but were dispersed by security forces. Danielle Moussa gave a similar account of events in the city's northeast neighborhood of Khalidiah, where thousands of people had gathered. ""I saw several get shot and I ran,"" said Moussa, an opposition activist whose group was working to retrieve bodies. Some 35,000 protesters had turned up in the neighborhood of Khalidiah, reported the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist network that organizes and documents demonstrations. The observatory estimated the turnout of protesters in Khalidiah at 20,000. Loubna said thousands of the protesters left Khalidiah for Clock Square when they heard the Arab League observers were at the downtown location, also the site of the city's police headquarters and several government buildings. The observatory also reported gunfire near the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. It said security forces fired at mourners attending a funeral for those killed on Monday. The LCC reported ""heavy gunfire and the presence of snipers aiming at everything that moves in the orchards of Baba Amr and Jober."" Alaa Shalaby, a member of the Arab League advance team, said Sudanese Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa Al-Dabi, the head of the observer mission, had returned to Damascus but 10 monitors remained in Homs. Shalaby said residents rushed toward the monitors and security forces fired warning shots. Videos from Hama showed demonstrators amid sounds of gunfire. Avaaz, a political activist group, said ""mass demonstrations took place in Hama today after news reached the city of the arrival of the Arab League observers. Demonstrators attempted to reach al Assi Square but were stopped when security forces opened fire at them."" The LCC had said three people were killed and ""dozens injured in neighborhoods of Mourabet and Barodiyeh after security forces opened fire at protesters attempting to reach al Assi Square."" The Arab League fact-finding team is monitoring an Arab League initiative that calls for President Bashar al-Assad's security forces to withdraw from cities, release detainees and end violence. The monitors arrived amid what opposition members said was a military siege in recent days against protesters in Homs, Syria's third-largest city. The observatory called the reported withdrawal of government forces a deceptive ""show"" for the Arab League monitors. It said at least 11 tanks had repositioned themselves inside government centers in the city from where they could return quickly to their previous positions. ""It shows its (the al-Assad regime's) attempt to circumvent the Arab League mission in order to give credibility to its false stories and deny the crystal-clear fact that there is a huge political crisis and a 'popular revolution', by all the standards, by the Syrian people who are trying to regain power, freedom and dignity,"" the observatory said on its Facebook page. The Arab League observers ""will have access to any place they want, freely,"" said a senior official in the league's advance group. ""The protocol entails that Syrian security only escorts the monitors to the entrances of the city only. According to the protocol, any party on the ground has the right to contact the monitors as they please,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak with the media. The team is composed of 12 international monitors, the senior official said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported on burials of ""martyrs"" from the army and security forces who were killed by ""armed terrorist groups"" -- a phrase Syria uses to describe those responsible for violence during the uprising. The news agency said ""an armed terrorist group"" was responsible for sabotaging a gas pipeline in Homs province on Tuesday. CNN cannot verify opposition accounts of violence or reports of casualties in Syria. Al-Assad's government has restricted access by international journalists. The unrest in Syria began in March when protesters, emboldened by democracy movements in Tunisia and Egypt, called for open elections and an increase in political freedoms and demanded an end to brutal regime actions. The movement quickly spiraled into a call for the ouster of al-Assad as the regime cracked down on peaceful demonstrators. The uprising launched the Free Syrian Army, a rebel force composed of military defectors, and efforts to create a breakaway government. Other opposition groups, most notably the Syrian National Council, have emerged. The Arab League has expelled Syria over its crackdown. Al-Assad has been under enormous pressure from the Arab League, Turkey, the United States, and the European Union to end the violence. More than 5,000 people have died since mid-March, when al-Assad began the crackdown on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster, the United Nations said this month. But activist groups, such as Avaaz and LCC, put the toll at more than 6,000.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It doesn't have the brutality of rugby or the physical intimidation of a boxing match, yet sailing is still one of the most dangerous sports in the world. Capsized: This French catamaran flipped near New Zealand while attempting to win the Jules Verne Trophy. This danger is never more evident than in the epic Volvo Ocean Race. The round-the-world event which begins this month in Alicante, Spain, always throws up its fair share of drama as the crews face all types of conditions right through to the race finish around July 2009. To give an idea of the extreme dangers this year's crews will face over the coming nine months, here is a look at some of the worst tragedies to strike yacht racing. There's no question about it: this is no sport for the faint-hearted. September 2008 Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai Death toll: One . Wilfrid Tolhurst was killed during the famous Régates Royales-Trophée Panerai yacht race off Cannes that sees the major classic yachts in the Mediterranean gather. Skippering the eight-meter yacht, Safir, in the coastal race, Tolhurst was struck by the boat's falling mast that broke off under the impact of a collision with another boat, Rowdy. Although rescue crews reacted quickly to bring the skipper ashore, nothing could be done to save his life. A police inquiry is currently in progress to determine the cause of the incident. September 2008 Sean Whiston Perpetual Cup Race Death toll: One . Kenneth Jones (46) lost his life while sailing in a race from Wicklow to the Poolbeg Yacht Club in Dublin, Ireland. It was not clear what caused the incident, however, a mayday was issued by the yacht Allanah, stating that there was 'a man in the water.' Jones was lifted from the water and transferred to Tallaght Hospital where he later died. May 2006 Volvo Ocean Race Death toll: One . During the seventh leg of the race Hans Horrevoets, 32, of The Netherlands was swept overboard from ABN Amro Two in heavy seas. Although he was recovered from the water, attempts to resuscitate him were not successful. The savage storm that hit the fleet could easily have claimed more lives. The crew of Movistar abandoned ship after the aft end of their keel pivot broke away from their hull in the night -- less than 48 hours after Horrevoets died. The crew transferred to ABN Amro Two which had been standing by and was escorted by HMS Mersey back to land. December 1998 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: Six . One of the saddest events in yachting history began at Sydney Harbor on December 26, 1998, when the annual Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race set off. Fierce storms and violent winds battered the 115-strong fleet in the famously tough event off the eastern coast of Australia and only 44 boats made it to the finish line at Hobart. Met by the massive storms, five boats sank, 66 boats retired from the race, six sailors died, and 55 sailors were taken off their yachts, most by helicopter. Among those who died were; Mike Bannister (Winston Churchill), Glyn Charles (Sword of Orion), John Dean (Winston Churchill), Bruce Guy (Business Post Naiad), Jim Lawler (Winston Churchill), Phillip Skeggs (Business Post Naiad). The vessels; Winston Churchill, VC Offshore Stand Aside, Sword of Orion, Miintinta, and Midnight Special all sank. 1989 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: One . Competing boat Creighton's Naturally suffered a serious broach in the early hours of one morning during the second leg of the race, at about three in the morning. Crew members Anthony (Tony) Philips and Bart van den Dwey were swept over board. Both were pulled back on deck and although Van den Dwey was successfully resuscitated, after three hours of trying, crew members could not revive Philips. Several days later, by radio agreement with his relatives, Philips was buried at sea. December 1989 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Peter Taylor, crew member aboard BP Flying Colours suffered fatal head injuries when a runner on his vessel broke and the rig collapsed in gale-force south westerly winds. December 1988 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . In another grueling race 38 of the 119 starters retired, nearly half of them with broken masts or damaged rigging. Ray Crawford aboard Billabong was killed. December 1984 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Wally Russell of Yahoo II died during the 1984 edition of the race, which was hit by a low pressure system that created two different swell patterns. August 1979 Fastnet Yacht Race Death toll: Fifteen . Huge storms in the Irish Sea wreaked havoc on more than 300 yachts taking part in the biennial race, resulting in 15 deaths and one of the worst yacht race disasters of all time. The race was well regarded after being established in 1925, and in 1979 was the climax of the five-race Admiral's Cup competition. As the storms battered the fleet, naval ships, lifeboats, commercial boats, and helicopters from the west side of the English Channel were brought to aid what was the largest peace-time rescue operation. The rescue effort saw 125 sailors, whose boats had been caught in force 11 storm strength wind gusts, taken to safety, while 15 people could not be saved. In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. December 1975 Sydney to Hobart Race Death toll: One . Zilvergeest III's Hugh (Barry) Vallance was killed during the 1975 event, despite reasonably good sailing conditions. September 1973 Whitbread Round the World Race Death toll: Three . The first race started off from Portsmouth, England on September 8, 1973. Seventeen yachts of various sizes and shapes took part. During the race three sailors were swept over board and died: Paul Waterhouse, Dominique Guillet and Bernie Hosking. Waterhouse and Guillet were never to be seen again.","Volvo Ocean Race begins in Alicantes, Spain in October .

"(Financial Times) -- The tour of China by Tim Cook this week had all the trappings of an official visit by a popular head of state. There were the staged photos of the Apple chief executive's handshake with the Chinese vice-premier and of his visit to an iPhone production line, not forgetting the ""man of the people"" shot of him posing with customers at an Apple store. Mr Cook is, after all, the head of a company whose $108bn in sales in its last fiscal year was equivalent to the gross domestic product of Iraq. The Apple chief appeared to be revered and his attention to China appreciated by ordinary people. ""It is laudable that he shows up here, where people work so hard to make Apple products and spend so much money to buy them,"" said one of many comments on Sina Weibo, China's leading Twitter equivalent. But while this was, by all accounts, a successful diplomatic and trade mission, its political implications spread well beyond China's borders. The visit appeared timed to coincide with Thursday's release of the Fair Labor Association's report on conditions in Chinese factories where Apple products are made. It found at least 50 ""serious and pressing non-compliances"" with its own workplace code of conduct and Chinese labour law. Apple's welcoming of the report's recommendations and Mr Cook's visit to the factory floor seemed intended to soothe international criticism that alleged Apple made huge profits on the back of poorly paid and badly treated assembly workers in China. Dozens of labour rights organisations from the US to Poland, India and Indonesia wrote an open letter to Mr Cook this week demanding Apple provide a living wage for Chinese workers so they did not have to work excessive overtime. They wanted an end to the use of involuntary labour in the shape of student interns and called for staff to be given health and safety training and the ability to form a genuine trade union. The recommendations of the FLA and the agreement to them by Apple and its main supplier Foxconn appear to answer these points. There were commitments that would reduce working hours to legal limits while protecting pay and improving conditions. ""If implemented, these commitments will significantly improve the lives of more than 1.2m Foxconn employees and set a new standard for Chinese factories,"" said Auret van Heerden, FLA president. But perceptions of Chinese conditions and Apple and Foxconn's behaviour are different in China itself, where jobs in the factories are seen as highly desirable and paying well above the going rate. A queue of 1,000 people awaited interviews outside a Foxconn facility near Shenzhen last month. A younger generation of Chinese also have a different work ethic -- preferring to work excessively to get the money they need and then leaving a company -- giving employers like Foxconn the problem of a high turnover rate, one of the biggest issues faced by Chinese manufacturers. The promise to the FLA of more substantial basic pay may actually help Foxconn keep employees longer term. Indirectly, being seen as a force for higher pay and better working conditions in China may also help to support Apple's recent efforts to appeal to Chinese consumers. Although Apple has recognised China in recent years as one of its fastest-growing markets, for a long time it did little to give it special treatment. Its China subsidiary is run by a low-key former Hewlett-Packard executive, who industry insiders say has little clout with headquarters. In stark contrast to many other multinationals, which make great efforts to highlight their special commitment to China with local research and development, frequent new investments and customised products, Apple has refused to divert from the marketing strategy it uses in other markets. For a while, the delayed launches and scarce supply of its products in China seemed to fire up local consumers' enthusiasm for the cult brand even further. But over the past year, the company started seeing limits to that approach and faced a series of challenges. Its past two local product launches triggered riots involving the unlicensed resellers who have come to dominate the distribution and retailing of iPhones and iPads in China. Following the launch of the new iPad this month, Chinese customs started stricter checks aimed at stopping smugglers from bringing in the device for resale in the country. This week, a crackdown on grey-market iPhone resellers in the southern city of Shenzhen triggered a suspension of iPhone sales by a number of unlicensed online traders. Apple is also fighting a legal battle over the Chinese iPad trademark, which is registered under the name of Proview Shenzhen, a struggling technology firm. Analysts expect Apple to swallow much, if not all, of the costs of the improvements recommended by the FLA. Labour rights organisations have pointed out Foxconn's limited ability to do so with profit margins falling as low as 1.5 per cent compared with those of more than 30 per cent for Apple. Foxconn has already implemented a series of wage increases over the past two years. ""When Foxconn hiked wages the last time, Apple paid for it,"" said Kirk Yang, head of Asia ex-Japan tech hardware research at Barclays Capital. ""Apple used to pay Foxconn $8 for every iPhone and $10 for every iPad, but they hiked the price by about 30 per cent."" The larger burden for Apple is part of a shift that has been under way since 2010. When Foxconn announced its first wage increase after a series of suicides among its Chinese workers, it said the time had come for other parts of the technology value chain to shoulder some of the soaring labour costs in China. ""There does seem to be a new trend that customers [of contract manufacturers] are more willing to share the cost when it comes to labour-related issues,"" said Jenny Lai, analyst at HSBC. Thompson Wu, a technology analyst with Credit Suisse, said the review of Apple's supply chain, which is being continued by the FLA beyond the initial three Foxconn factories, was likely to influence other contract manufacturers as well. ""Particularly, Quanta, which plays an important role in the MacBook space, and Pegatron, which assembles iPhones, are likely to come under similar examination,"" he said. With a huge share of contract manufacturing for the global supply chain done in China, many companies with smaller financial resources than Apple -- the world's most valuable company by market capitalisation -- will be viewing the cost of this week's events with trepidation. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","CEO Tim Cook toured Chinese factories that make Apple products .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. and Iraqi negotiators have agreed on a draft of a status-of-forces agreement authorizing U.S. troop presence in Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday. The U.S. wants troops in Iraq to be immune from Iraqi law. The two governments are  reviewing the drafts, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Thursday. Morrell said Defense Secretary Robert Gates ""is in the process of consulting closely with members of Congress"" on the draft agreement. Meanwhile, Iraq's Political Committee on National Security is also reviewing the draft, Morrell said, citing Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. ""We are close, but not at the final status yet,"" Morrell said. ""And as soon as it is final, I think then we can talk in more specificity about what is actually included in it."" The United States' insistence that its troops and contractors remain immune from Iraqi law has been a key obstacle to reaching an agreement, U.S. and Iraqi officials have said. A U.N. mandate authorizing the U.S. troop presence in Iraq expires December 31, and U.S. officials are examining ""contingencies"" in case the Iraqi government is unable to sell the status-of-forces deal to the country's various factions, a senior U.S. official said earlier this week. Other developments: . • Representatives from Bahrain, Syria, Jordan and Spain took their posts Thursday as ambassadors to Iraq after submitting their credentials to Iraq's president, the Iraqi government said. • The governments of Iran and Iraq signed an agreement Thursday aimed at jointly clarifying the fate of those missing from the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The document, signed in Geneva along with the ICRC, establishes a clear framework for collecting information and sharing it between the two countries, the Red Cross said. It also establishes a framework for handing over human remains. CNN's Saad Abedine and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Pentagon spokesman said he can't speak about specifics until it is in final draft form .

"(Mashable) -- Google has topped a list of the most reputable companies in the U.S., according to a Harris Interactive poll. Harris Interactive asked more than 30,000 respondents to identify the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. and rate them based on 20 different attributes, including financial performance, emotional appearance, social responsibility and leadership. Technology companies dominated the top of the list. At number one is Google, which Harris Interactive rates at an 84.05/100 on the reputation scale (80.0 and higher is consider ""excellent""). Other notable tech companies making the top of the list were Apple (No. 5), Intel (No. 6), Amazon (No. 8), Sony (No. 14) and Microsoft (No. 16), all of whom received a rating higher than 80. Rounding out the bottom of the list were insurance conglomerates, banks, and oil companies. AIG received the worst reputation ranking with a 47.77. BP, the company responsible for the worst oil spill in history, had the second-worst ranking. Other companies that made the bottom tier of Harris Interactive's list include Comcast, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ExxonMobile, General Motors, Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Despite government investigations and privacy concerns, the world's largest search engine still enjoys a supremely positive image in the eyes of its millions of users.

"(CNN) -- The French Interior Ministry announced Monday it has deported two Muslims and plans to expel three more in a crackdown after the killing of seven people by a suspected Islamic extremist. A statement by Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the moves were part of ""an acceleration of the deportation procedures of foreign Islamic radicals."" An Islamic militant from Algeria who was involved in 1994 attacks in Marrakech, Morocco, was sent to his home country Monday, the statement said. In addition, a Malian imam was returned to his home country for sermons that promoted anti-Semitism and rejection of the West, it said. Deportation proceedings also have started or are planned against three others: an imam of Saudi nationality, a militant Islamist from Tunisia and an imam from Turkey, the statement said. It cited provisions in the law governing aliens and political asylum, saying the statutes ""allow this type of decision with regards the 'urgent need for state security or public safety' or 'conduct likely to harm the fundamental interests of the state.' "" According to the statement, other expulsions will occur soon. Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy told French radio that 19 people had been arrested in a series of police raids on suspected Islamists. The raids came a week after gunman Mohammed Merah, who killed seven people, was shot dead after a long siege in the southwestern city of Toulouse. Sarkozy, who is running for re-election, said the raids were intended to ""deny the entry of certain people to France"" who did not share the country's values. ""It's not just linked to Toulouse. It's all over the country. It's in connection with a form of radical Islam, and it's in agreement with the law,"" he said. Sarkozy suggested then that more raids would follow, saying, ""There will be other operations that will continue and that will allow us to expel from our national territory a certain number of people who have no reason to be here."" Merah was blamed for the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three Jewish children ages 4, 5 and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in the shootings. Merah told police he had attended an al Qaeda training camp while visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. But his uncle, Jamal Azizi, denied statements by French authorities that Merah was an al Qaeda sympathizer and that he had traveled to Afghanistan or Pakistan to train to use arms. CNN's Tom Cohen and Alex Felton contributed to this report.","An Islamic militant and imam are sent back to their home countries .

"(CNN) -- The head of the General Services Administration resigned Monday after a scathing report that called government spending on a training seminar in Las Vegas ""excessive, wasteful, and in some cases impermissible."" The White House put out a statement that President Barack Obama was ""outraged"" when he found out about the spending. GSA Administrator Martha Johnson admitted in a letter of resignation that her agency had made a ""significant misstep"" and that ""taxpayer dollars were squandered."" A GSA Inspector General's report on the 2010 GSA ""Western Regions"" training conference in Las Vegas shows the government spent more than $822,000 for the 300 attendees, including $75,000 on team building exercises, $6,000 on commemorative coins and $6,000 on canteens, keychains and T-shirts. President Obama was informed about the report last week before his South Korean trip and administration officials said he acted quickly. ""[H]e was outraged by the excessive spending, questionable dealings with contractors, and disregard for taxpayer dollars,"" White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew said in a statement Monday. Lew said the president called for all those responsible ""to be held fully accountable given that these actions were irresponsible and entirely inconsistent with the expectations that he has set as president."" An administration official told CNN the president respects Johnson's decision (to resign), and believes as stewards of taxpayer dollars, these episodes are not acceptable. The Inspector General's findings show the 2010 training conference was held at the lavish M Resort Spa and Casino outside of Las Vegas. The report shows that GSA employees ""scouted"" the location several times before the conference and that travel for conference planning totaled more than $100,000, with catering costs of more than $30,000. Add to that costs for the actual conference of more than $686,000 and the total comes to $822,751. In her letter of resignation, Johnson said that when she was made aware of the allegations of excessive and questionable spending for the conference she launched internal reviews, took ""personnel disciplinary action"" and instituted ""tough new controls to ensure this incident is not repeated."" That was not enough, she said, adding she is resigning to allow the GSA to ""move forward at this time with a fresh leadership team."" Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman leveled bruising criticism. ""This was a stupid and infuriating waste of taxpayer dollars. The people responsible for it should be held accountable,"" Lieberman said in a statement. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, similarly slammed the spending. ""I appreciate the work of GSA Inspector General Brad Miller in investigating this matter. I expect that the committee will have additional questions for him and GSA about this wasteful spending,"" he said in a statement. Johnson came into her position amid controversy. Her appointment as head of the GSA was held up for 10 months through an arcane Senate procedure known as the ""hold,"" in which one senator can delay a nomination without reason. When Johnson was finally confirmed by the Senate in 2010, the White House touted it as an example of why Americans are so frustrated with Washington.","NEW: Rep. Darrell Issa slams the spending .

"(WIRED) -- Researchers at Intel debuted an experimental processor at the company's developer forum this week, which could lead to devices with significantly lower energy consumption. The chip -- codenamed ""Claremont"" -- is known as a near-threshold voltage processor, which allows transistors to operate at super-low, near ""threshold"" voltages to increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption. This level is very near the voltage at which transistors switch on and start conducting current, which is the ""threshold"" voltage. In the demonstration, the experimental low-power processor was used on a PC running Linux OS, powered only off a solar cell the size of a postage stamp. The processor was used in conjunction with another experimental project, a concept DRAM called the hybrid memory cube, which is a super efficient memory interface. ""We used a solar cell in the demonstration to show how little power was required,"" said Intel spokeswoman Connie Brown in an interview. ""But it could run on anything that has power."" Like lemon juice, or perhaps a potato as Brown suggested. ""The key message is the low power and how much more transistors would be power-efficient running at near-threshold."" Several years of research have led to Intel's near-threshold voltage-processor design. It's heat-sink free, and rather than operating at those super low thresholds all the time, it switches into NTV mode (under 10 mW in power consumption) when its workload is light. This means, rather than powering off completely, a device can stay on in an ""ultra low-power state,"" preserving active processes and open applications -- ""always-on"" devices. The technology could even be used to develop ""zero-power"" architectures ""where power consumption is so low that we could power entire digital devices off solar energy, or off the energy that surrounds us every day"", like vibrations or movements, ambient wireless signals or solar power. NTV could find itself in a host of applications ranging from processors and mobile devices to embedded devices, appliances and automobiles. Energy efficiency has always been a concern for device manufacturers and chipset makers, but as the hardware industry moves to mobile and more lightweight computing, it's become a much bigger issue. So far, Intel has had some difficulties finding its way into mobile devices because of power consumption issues. Its low-power competitor ARM has dominated in that area, even threatening to displace it as the processor in Apple laptops and desktops (according to rumor). But Intel's latest offerings, including its Atom processors and Oak Trail processors, have become much more efficient. Intel's latest, the Tri-Gate 3-D ""Ivy Bridge"" transistor, also marks a major improvement, both in design, and in its 30% improvement in performance. NTV is a significantly bigger step than these commercial processors. The technology results in a 5 to 10x improvement in energy consumption. But it's not without problems. When electrical noise is introduced, logic level readings can be inaccurate. So the challenge is to maintain a balance of performance versus efficiency. ""Most digital designs operate at nominal voltages -- about 1V today. NTV circuits operate around 400 to 500 millivolts,"" says Intel researcher Sriram Vangal in a blog post on the subject. Consistently running electronics at such low voltage levels is a challenge because the difference between a ""0â€³ and a ""1â€³ becomes very small (electrical signal-wise). Intel's experimental NTV processor may never find itself in an actual consumer product, Vangal says, but is an important stepping stone towards future processors that will.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As the world was grieving and looking for answers in the death of Whitney Houston, Houston's 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital, police said. Beverly Hills police said Sunday the teen was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at about 11:15 a.m. She was released later Sunday and was expected to head to New Jersey, where her grandmother lives, as early as Sunday night, a source close to the family told CNN. Singer Kim Burrell, a family friend, told CNN on Sunday afternoon from the Grammy Awards' red carpet that she was with the teenager on Saturday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel after Houston died. This was a few hours after Burrell said she'd exchanged messages with her close friend, Houston, after she arrived in Los Angeles for the festivities. Whitney Houston's death sets somber tone for Grammys . ""As to be expected, she's overwhelmed -- it's her mother. She knows how much her mother meant to the world. And Bobbi Kristina has a huge heart, just like her mother,"" said Burrell, adding that that Bobbi Kristina affectionately refers to her as ""Auntie Kim."" ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" Bobbi Kristina Brown was born in 1993, during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became publicly known during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" where she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Houston once said of her only child, ""She encourages me and inspires me. When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'Okay. I can do this. I can do this.'"" Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Results from Houston autopsy could take weeks . Bobbi Kristina Brown proved she could do it on her own when she posted a video on Twitter of herself singing Adele's ""Someone Like You"" last September. So far the video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube. Bobbi Kristina Brown has previously given insight into her relationship with her mother, stating on Twitter, ""I love my family so much ... I'm so thankful for (my mother). Thank you so much lord for blessing me with an Phenomenal family and incredibly phenomenal mother."" Less than 24 hours after Whitney Houston's death stunned fans and the entertainment world, her admirers became tearful and worried again Sunday upon hearing the news that Houston's daughter was taken to the hospital. ""Really, oh my gosh,"" said Trudy Hunchar, a flight attendant who was accompanied by her 12-year-old daughter, Quinn. On Sunday afternoon, the mom and daughter were paying their last respects to Houston outside the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the 48-year-old singer died the day before. The parent and child came to the hotel to add a light-pink rose to a growing sidewalk memorial of flowers and candles created by fans. ""I'm just hoping it's anxiety or a panic attack or hurt,"" Hunchar said of the daughter's hospital visit. Then Hunchar expressed concern about the entertainment industry because the Denver family was visiting Los Angeles so that 12-year-old Quinn, an aspiring actress with a movie credit, could meet with an agent and manager about an acting career. ""With her coming into this business,"" Hunchar said, pointing to her daughter, ""I'll have a tough hand on her. She's got a strong head. She's pretty smart. This business is tough, and as best as I can, I'll have a hand on her.""

"(CNN) -- Last week, we laid out some ground rules for using The Google to see what the Internet's saying about your co-workers, your love interest and yourself. And as soon as the column went live, the reader feedback started pouring in. Hey, Googling is a quotidian skill these days: The ""Sex and the City"" writers made a joke of it almost eight years ago when Carrie looked up her Russian boyfriend ""on Google-dot-com,"" and there's even a snotty website you can send when a knuckle-dragger asks you a question instead of looking it up himself: Let Me Google That For You. So it's kinda surprising that it's still at the center of an amorphous cloud of confusion and questions. But, dear readers, you brought up some nuanced points we couldn't elucidate in last week's column. Allow us to attempt to clear up some of that fog. The Lesson: Once you've dug up some dirt, you can't cover it up again. ""When I started my current job, it was just months after someone I knew was convicted of sexually molesting a child. ... It left me with a really unforgiving attitude about those convicted of sex crimes against children. In the course of my work, I was demonstrating something to my co-worker and randomly selected a co-worker to Google. Lo and behold, the man had similar charges (and a guilty verdict) a dozen years ago, just before coming to work here. I immediately swore the other co-worker to secrecy, having NO IDEA this was even a possibility when entering the name. Unfortunately, the man I searched is my immediate supervisor, and it makes me kind of sick to have to deal with him daily. The job is great, the pay is good, but I just wish he'd hurry up and retire. I can't ask to be transferred, as even asking would spread this information further. Unfortunately, some things you can't just ""un-know"" when knowing is inconvenient."" Whoa, heavy. We're sorry for all the bad happenings, but you bring up an important point: You can't return to blissful ignorance after you've searched for someone. In this case, if you're sure you don't want to talk to a higher-up about transferring (if it was that easy to find in Google, they likely already know), it's probably best to focus on remaining professional around this man. We humans are funny creatures: We're unhappier waiting for test results than hearing a definitive cancer diagnosis. We like to know. Your search for your co-worker was random and innocent, but sometimes we do tumble, ""Alice in Wonderland""-style, into Google rabbit holes that we don't need to conduct. Like a dog rubbing its injured paw into the ground, we get buzzed on pain as we search for ex-significant others, say, or find out more and more about a tragic 12-car pileup a few miles away. So -- cue that guitar-strumming learning-moment music in the excellent '90s television show Step by Step -- if netiquette is all about being nice to people while you're using the Interwebs, that should include being nice to yourself. Know when to pause, X out, and busy yourself with those IRL friends. Remember them? Nice folks. The Lesson: Googling shines a spotlight on what others think about the search term. ""THE ONLY ISSUE ANYONE WOULD HAVE WITH THIS ARTICLE WOULD BE THE FAILURE TO NOTE THAT ANYTHING WRITTEN ON THE INTERNET, OR WORLD WIDE WEB, IS THE PRODUCT OF SOME PERSON'S INPUT INTO A COMPUTER OF THAT DATA. THE DATA MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE COMPUTER BY THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE SEARCH, AND THERE MAY VERY WELL BE NO MEANINGFUL WAY TO ELIMINATE, MITIGATE, CORRECT, OR AMEND INTERNET GOSSIP, RUMOR, SPECULATION, AND HEARSAY. GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT. "" FIRST OFF, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE SHOUTING. SHOUTING TO TWO NETIQUETTE COLUMNISTS SEEMS LIKE AN EGREGIOUS BREACH IN MANNERS. BUT REALLY, YOU ARE TOO KIND, THINKING THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE ONLY ISSUE ANYONE WOULD HAVE WITH OUR ARTICLE. Anyway, you raise a valid (if obvious) point: Much of the stuff that pops up when you Google someone wasn't put there by said someone. But, as we've written about on this very canvas, you can proactively deal with online haters and take charge of your online reputation. That's why you need to be Googling yourself regularly -- so you know what your new boss, new friends and new beau will see when they type in your name. And then when you find out you have a name in common with a cross-country track star/American Girl doll/fugitive on ""America's Most Wanted,"" you can write a charming blog post distinguishing yourself from your name-twin. The Lesson: Admitting to your date that you've Googled him is tricky business. ""I was on a second or third date with a guy who was quite a bit older than me. I asked him his age but he wouldn't tell me. Later I looked him up on a public records site and found it. The next date I told him I had found his age online in what I thought was a playful manner. The relationship didn't last because as it turned out he had a girlfriend in another country for years with whom he has been discussing a serious future, and months later during an argument he told me that my Googling him had really turned him off and included it in a ""want to know how to win a guy?"" e-mail. So, was I a creep for searching for his age online, or just telling him about it, or both? His age had no bearing on my feelings for him. ... I was just curious to know it."" First off, we can answer this question very cleanly: This guy was the creep, and was grasping at straws to find a way to make you feel bad. He wouldn't tell you his age, had a secret relationship and wrote you a nasty e-mail telling you how to win a guy? Major loser, and you have nothing to worry about in the creepiness department. (Unless you made him a scrapbook from everything you uncovered in your public records search. In that case, yeahhh...) But this does bring up a larger point: Discussing Internet searches during the dance of courtship is kind of a Goldilocks sport -- in an eerily parallel situation, we've had a first date (met on a dating site) refuse to share his age when it came up in conversation, blithely bleating, ""I mean it's on my profile, I don't see why I need to say it again."" (He was 32, too old for such nonsense.) That's too little info. We had another first date reveal that he'd clicked through something like 11 pages of Google results (""So, I see you were runner-up in the state spelling bee as an eighth-grader""). Too much. The just right approach is somewhere between keeping your mouth totally shut (let him reveal his penchant for photographing pensive-looking pigeons on his own schedule) or, after a few dates, bringing up something that's on the first page of results (""Not to be creepy but I creepily Googled you the other night -- I had no idea you wrote that book on pigeons as pets! I'm a birder myself."") Hey, everyone loves flattery. Just make sure you're not getting dirt on an unrelated author with the same name. Because a love of pigeons could be a real turn-off.","Our Netiquette columnists answer readers' questions about Googling dilemmas .

"(CNN) -- ""You drive for show, but putt for dough."" That's the often-repeated mantra of the late South African golfer Bobby Locke, who put his own words to good use in winning four British Open titles. Good advice for any golfer, but the skills needed to knock a small ball into a slightly bigger hole can be applied in many walks of life outside of the proverbial pleasant amble spoiled. ""The discipline in setting an immediate, action-orientated target, or job that one is completely in control of, boosts one's concentration, which is vital for success in every area of life,"" Irish professor Aidan Moran told CNN. So, just as top golfers need to do more than just drive a ball 300-plus yards, success in any sphere depends on combining physical capability with mental focus. And the good news is, all it takes is practice. The bad news is, it takes a lot of practice. Moran, who has worked with three-time major champion and fellow Irishman Padraig Harrington, has utilized his expertise in cognitive psychology to produce the CD ""Learn to Win at Golf"" and a series of other media releases. They aim to improve people's concentration and performance in academic and sporting situations, and the results are sometimes remarkable -- if not so easy to achieve. According to Moran, who lectures at University College in Dublin, research has shown that it takes about 10 years -- or 10,000 hours of practice -- to truly master a skill like putting or playing a musical instrument. Former Olympic table tennis star and now Times of London newspaper columnist Matthew Syed has written a book called ""Bounce"" on the same theme. His theory is that anyone can master the skills to become a top-level performer in sports. Champions are made not born, is Syed's central argument; the myth of talent and the power of practice is his sub-text. ""I think everyone who has good hand-eye co-ordination has the capacity to be very good, certainly at an activity like putting,"" he says. ""In my own sport of table tennis, I don't think there's anyone who's reached a high level who actually has faster reaction times than the ordinary person."" Top golfers such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Harrington have suffered from poor putting in between bouts of success, so why is it so difficult? ""My feeling is that it is really upstairs, that putting issues have to do with what's going on between the golfer's ears,"" says Dr. Alan Goldberg, a leading American sports psychologist who has worked with many players on the men's and women's U.S. circuits. Even the professionals can sometimes seem as fallible as ordinary hackers, but Goldberg believes that what separates the superstars of sport from the average person is an almost superhuman ability to ""mono focus"" on tasks. ""I don't think you can coach self-motivation,"" he says. Putting clearly requires no unusual physical ability, but does rely on the utmost concentration and the ability to shut out all distractions, which is why silence is always demanded when the top players prepare to take their shots. ""The biggest challenge in putting is keeping yourself focused away from the outcome,"" Goldberg says. ""Really good putters just concentrate on the feel and just focus on their body, get a right feel for the distance."" Moran believes the key is ""partly physical, partly psychological."" ""People tend to breathe in, so their center of gravity changes. You should breathe out gently when you putt -- it works,"" he says. So plenty of good advice: keep focused, and don't get ahead of yourself -- it's a pity sometimes that the professionals don't take it. American Doug Sanders missed a putt of less than two feet to win the 1970 British Open at St. Andrews, losing in a playoff to Jack Nicklaus. ""Do I ever think about the putt?"" he said 35 years later. ""Only every four or five minutes!"" To escape such nightmares, the long putter seems the obvious refuge as it adds stability to the stroke, with the club anchored under a golfer's belly. It worked to brilliant effect for Keegan Bradley, who became the first professional to win a major with it earlier this year, but Goldberg believes that golfers who switch will make only temporary gains. Better, perhaps, to adopt the attitude of the great South African golfer Gary Player, who often performed miracles around the greens. ""The more I practice, the luckier I get,"" the nine-time major champion was once famously quoted as saying. So for the high-handicapper, the message is that hours of practice makes perfect. Non-golfers can take this tip from Moran and apply it to a host of everyday tasks: . ""Seeing and feeling and performing a skill in your mind's eye, using your imagination to rehearse and practice it to perfection."" The question is: Do you have the dedication to achieve your goals whether on or off the course?","Putting is a skill that can be mastered by anyone, experts tell CNN .
Practice really does make perfect, says Irish professor Aidan Moran .
Research shows there can be transferable skills to other walks of life .
Biggest challenge is keeping focused away from an outcome, psychologist says ."
"(CNN) -- For the second straight year, Taylor Swift won entertainer of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards. ""I want to say to my fellow nominees in this category, I respect you so much and I love you,"" said the 22-year-old star, who was the only female nominated in the category this year. She beat out Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean, Brad Paisley and Blake Shelton. ""To the fans for voting, thank you for doing this. This is exciting,"" she said. ""Thank you!"" Swift's award was the last to be handed out Sunday night in Las Vegas during the 47th annual awards show.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan and the United States may soon reach a deal over night raids by U.S. and Afghan special forces on local dwellings that would increase Afghan control over and participation in the controversial operations. Night raids are deeply unpopular among Afghans, but U.S. officials say they are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents. One Afghan official stressed the deal would mean night raids complied with Afghan laws. A U.S. official insisted any compromise would not impede NATO's effectiveness. ""There has been some very good progress,"" President Hamid Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said. ""Both sides are very close to agreement on a memorandum of understanding under which all night operations will be fully Afghanized and conducted under Afghan laws."" Pentagon spokesman George Little said, ""We believe we are still making progress toward a resolution on the agreement."" But, he said, there's no specific timing on resolving the issue. Another U.S. official declined to comment ""on the specifics of ongoing negotiations."" ""A memorandum of understanding will be in accordance with the ongoing process of Afghanistan of special operations as required by the November loya jirga and will meet U.S. operational needs,"" the official said. A loya jirga is a national assembly of tribal elders. Talks have been going on for weeks now on this key memorandum of understanding to address what is perhaps the most difficult issue in the partnership between Kabul and Washington. The agreement would remove one of the obstacles in the way of a highly symbolic Strategic Partnership Document, outlining the basis for U.S.-Afghan cooperation for the years after NATO's 2014 drawdown. Night raids also present a particular challenge to Karzai. Their strong unpopularity has forced the president to demand they stop, or at least no longer involve foreign troops, despite their operational significance to NATO. Gen. John Allen, who commands U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, last month told Congress how vital and frequent those raids are. Allen said that in 2011, 83% of the raids succeeded in detaining or striking either their primary target or an associated insurgent. ""This last year, we had about 2,200 night operations,"" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""Of those 2,200 or so night operations, on 90% of them we didn't fire a shot. On more than 50% of them we got the targeted individual, and (in) 30% more we got the next associate of that individual as well."" As for civilian casualties, in the 10% of the night raids where shots were fired, ""less than 1.5 % civilian casualties"" resulted, Allen said. Pentagon spokesman Little told reporters Wednesday that over 97% of the night raids are combined U.S.-Afghan operations, and almost 40% of the night raids are now Afghan-led. A senior Afghan official said details of the arrangement on night raids were changing daily and meetings were ongoing, but the issue of compliance under Afghan law was key to the talks. A legal process, such as the issuing of a warrant of arrest, would have to take place before any raids happened, the official said. It would not be enough -- as suggested in some reports -- if the legal process just involved asking a judge after the raid for permission to keep any detainees captured in custody, the official said. Karzai says Afghanistan's homes and villages need to be safe and protected. ""What we are asking for, in very specific and clear terms, (is that) no foreign forces should enter Afghan homes,"" he said last year. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said last month that while it's important that such operations continue, the United States is making changes. Allen said last month that ""we have come a very long way in creating greater capacity among the Afghans to conduct night operations in a very credible way."" ""Now, we're still heavily partnered with them, and we will be for some period of time, but ... all of our night operations are partnered with Afghan partner unit forces."" CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Shots are fired in only one in 10 of the night raids carried out, Gen. John Allen has said .

"(CNN) -- What if you could change history? Would you go back and kill Hitler before the Holocaust? Arrest Oswald before JFK was assassinated? Stop Bin Laden before the 9/11 attacks? Of course you would. But what if you had to stand by and let those events unfold in order to achieve a more perfect future? That's the premise posed in ""The Revisionists,"" a new time-travel thriller from award-winning author, Thomas Mullen. In the future, there's no hunger, no war, no crime. At least, that's what we're led to believe. It's Zed's job to keep it that way. He's been sent back in time, to something similar to our present, to protect the integrity of the future timeline. To do that, Zed has to make sure that an imminent disaster of epic proportions, called ""The Great Conflagration"" happens just as history says it will, or does, or did. In his mission, Zed faces off with other time travelers, enemy agents called Hags, short for historical agitators, who want to prevent this apocalypse. Along the way, Zed crosses paths with an eclectic cast of characters, including a young Washington lawyer seeking answers about her brother, a soldier killed in Iraq; a disgraced former CIA agent; and a young Indonesian woman trapped as an indentured servant to a North Korean diplomat. Soon cracks start to appear in the timeline and Zed starts to doubt his mission. Don't let the description of the plot mislead you, this is not your typical sci-fi novel. Mullen is less concerned with the intricacies of time travel, focusing more on the nature of history and how it's shaped. As the saying goes, ""History is written by the victors"" -- but what if there were no winners in this scenario? In ""The Revisionists,"" Mullen presents a compelling and complex page-turner, a paranoid thriller for the post-9/11 age. CNN recently sat down with Mullen to talk about his new book; the following is an edited transcript: . CNN: What was the spark that led to this book? Mullen: There were a lot of sparks. It's a book that involves different narratives. I'd had the idea of this guy who comes back from the future and has to prevent bad things from happening. He's justifying his bad means because there's going to be a perfect end. I just thought that was an intriguing moral angle. I thought it was fun and I thought it had interesting interplay with the idea of intelligence agencies occasionally doing bad things but saying, oh it's for a good cause. I'd heard a story about this issue of domestic servants basically being kept as slaves in these really nice houses in D.C. because their bosses are diplomats who can hide behind diplomatic immunity, and I thought that was a really interesting idea but I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. I was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents, either governmental or private, following peace activists, because that was happening. It's not legal, it's not supposed to happen, but you hear stories about police officers, mysterious agents, agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists, trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested. You'd like to think these things don't happen, but you keep hearing about things like that happening. I thought that would be an intriguing story. So, I was kind of juggling these different ideas, then I put it aside, but I still, every now and then, would work on it. There were a lot of false starts with this. It took me a while to get some of these threads together in a way that I liked them. There were these different stories that I liked that I wanted to figure out and I asked myself, is this one book? Do these things go together; do I need to cut some of them out? I did end up cutting out some of the activist stuff, but I wanted to find a way to thread these different narratives together and see if it could all come together. It may have been a little messy but I hope in the end it worked. CNN: You really play with the idea of ""history"" in your book. Mullen: As somebody who has previously written two historical novels, in a lot of ways this book is a departure for me. At the same time this book is sort of about history, how it's formed and how we are products of our own history. The question comes up in the book; do we control our own fate? Can we make our own history or are we just pawns? That taps into this conspiracist view of the world that created a lot of great fiction and film in the 1970 like ""All the President's Men"" and ""The Conversation."" There's this sense that there's this vast conspiracy of forces controlling us, that the government is listening to everything we do and there's nothing we can do about it. It's easy to think that way, especially now, but at the same time we also believe we're a country where a skinny interracial kid ... can become president. You never really know what's going to happen; you never know what's going to be historically important. There's the butterfly effect where one little thing here could change the world for someone else. So I was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel; how much control do I have over my fate, the country, my community? Do I really believe in a perfect future? Some of us would like to think we're creating a better future, especially if we're in politics or public service. We're trying to take a bad situation and make it better. But how much better can we make it? Are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it's going to come down and crush us again? Do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that America is a noble experiment and we're still working on it to try and get it right? Can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes? The desire to create a better world is a noble goal and we all have it but it can be taken in scary directions. When you have these totalitarian nations, these communist nations that say they're creating a perfect society when really most of us would say they've done the opposite. Trying to control history, or the lack of control, that's something the book deals with. CNN: How did you handle the idea of time travel in your novel? Mullen: I didn't want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations; I wanted it to be set in the here and now. I liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but I think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now, all the tensions in our society, the issues of race and ethnicity. To him he's coming from many, many generations later. I was influenced by this Time magazine cover story, the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces, many generations later after all the races have mixed, this is what people will look like. If I want to be realistic about the idea of a time traveler coming from the future, he's not going to look like us, he's not going to be a white guy, he's not going to be a black guy, he's going to be kind of this amalgam. In any book, it's not a new idea in a time travel story to have everybody say, wait a minute are you just pulling one over on us, are you crazy, are you a reliable narrator? That was fun to work in. CNN: ""The Revisionists"" includes a lot of great detail about U.S. intelligence agencies. Tell me how you researched all of this? Mullen: As with a lot of fiction, some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading. I wasn't a spy and I don't have any friends who were spies, as far as I know. The book changed a lot; I went in different directions because the more I learned I would find a more believable way to advance the story. I think the initial idea I had wouldn't have worked as well and I don't think it would have made you think, ""Wow, this guy knows what he's talking about."" I learned as I went and I was able to tell a more realistic story as a result. But I didn't go on any drive-bys with any spies, although that would have been cool. CNN: What's next for you? Mullen: I've actually written a lot of my next book already, it's historical again. I'm from Boston, Rhode Island actually, but I'm a Red Sox fan. It's loosely based on a real story, that I found out about in an offhand mention, about FBI involvement in Boston sports, it's a legacy that dates back to 1945 when the FBI was following a group of communists who wanted to racially integrate baseball. I thought, Wow! What's that story? So it's sort of a spy novel, it's also got a bit of romance, and even comedy. I've got an FBI agent, I've also got a female communist sports writer and I've got a baseball star of the Negro League back from World War II. I said I wasn't going to keep writing in a historical vein but sometimes I see an idea and I think that's just too cool. It's been fun to write.

"(CNN) -- Last year, ""Game of Thrones"" became a breakout hit for HBO, turning George R.R. Martin's fantasy novel into an epic show that pleased diehard fans of the book while pulling in a wider audience with ample servings of sex, violence and intrigue to rival ""The Sopranos,"" ""Boardwalk Empire"" and ""True Blood."" And when season 2 debuts Sunday, viewers can expect more of the same. Lots more. The second book in Martin's epic series, ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" is called ""A Clash of Kings,"" and that, in a nutshell, sets the table for what to expect in the show's sophomore outing. Show-runners have promised that everything gets ratcheted up in season 2. Epic battles (largely kept off screen because of cost concerns in season 1) will unfold before our eyes. Even more characters will emerge as players (or pawns) in the so-called War of the Five Kings, and the world will get bigger as key characters travel throughout the kingdom of Westeros and beyond. All of which threatens to get a touch confusing for folks who haven't already delved into Martin's novels -- a series that has spanned 16 years and five books, with two more promised. So here's a quick look at where season 1 left off and, with a bit of insight from the novels, some hints at what to expect as the tale continues to unfold. The players . Joffrey Baratheon: The nasty brat Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne. A Baratheon in name only, the sniveling teen king represents the hopes of the immensely wealthy Lannister clan, most notably his mother, Cersei. But the little-known fact that he's actually not late King Robert's son, instead the inbred offspring of Cersei and brother Jaime, has given hope to his challengers. Robb Stark: After his father, Ned, was beheaded at Joffrey's command, Robb called his troops and headed south, seeking both revenge and the return of his sisters, Sansa and Arya. Along the way, his followers crowned him King in the North, essentially seceding from the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. With the counsel of his mother, Catelyn, he's had great success on the battlefield, taking renowned warrior Jaime Lannister hostage in the process. But he finds himself turned off by the political machinations that come with his new title, not the least of which being the promise of an arranged marriage. Renly Baratheon: Old King Robert's youngest brother, Renly, is charismatic and a familiar face at King's Landing, where he was an adviser to his brother. When season 1 ended, he and ... ahem ... special friend Loras, the Knight of Flowers, have fled the capital with hopes of returning to claim the throne. Unfortunately, even if Joffrey is deemed illegitimate, Renly is not technically next in line, that status instead going to ... Stannis Baratheon: Stannis was an offscreen presence throughout season 1. Ill-suited for the niceties of royal life, Stannis is the polar opposite of Renly in appearance and demeanor. But as Robert's oldest brother, he has the better claim. As Stannis emerges, he'll introduce us to one of the story's most enigmatic characters. Yes, Westeros is roughly equivalent to medieval Europe. But magic exists as well. Daenerys Targaryen: Dany provided the first season's dramatic conclusion, emerging from what appeared to be deadly flames with three hatchling dragons. She's the daughter of the ""Mad King"" who Robert deposed. But season 2 finds her stranded across the Narrow Sea, and most of deceased husband Khal Drogo's followers having deserted her. She's not a player in the current struggle for Westeros. But ... you know ... she's got dragons. Astute readers may have noted that list only includes four kings -- hardly enough for what's called the War of the Five Kings. Rest assured ... treachery, backstabbing and old wounds will remedy that soon enough. Meanwhile, back at the Wall . While the powers-that-be to the south fight amongst themselves, Jon Snow and his sworn brothers of the Night's Watch are the only ones aware of the threat from the mysterious White Walkers and increasingly restless wildlings to the north. Having returned to the Wall after nearly abandoning his post to fight beside half-brother Robb, Jon has joined a band of watchmen making the dangerous trip beyond to seek out his lost uncle, Benjen, and try to learn more about the growing threat. Season 2 will open Jon's eyes to a whole new world and bring changes for Sam, the portly and cowardly brother Jon protected and befriended, as well. Whom to watch . In Martin's world, a relatively minor character can re-emerge as a major player, sometimes long after they're introduced. Obviously, Stannis will become important as he stakes his royal claim. Also keep an eye on Theon Greyjoy. Ned Stark's ward at Winterfell only emerged from the background a few times but will become important as the story moves along. New characters also will appear thoughout the season, notably Brienne of Tarth (a warrior woman and arguably one of the tale's most sympathetic characters) and Melisandre of Asshai (a priestess of far more dubious motivations). And what of Tyrion? Fresh off an Emmy Award, Peter Dinklage has become a fan favorite as Tyrion, the dwarf brother of the tall, strong and beautiful Lannister clan. Having survived captivity at the hand of the Starks and then what should have been a suicide battle mission (ordered by his own father, Tywin), Tyrion will find himself at the heart of the intrigue at King's Landing. Look for him (man-at-arms Bronn and companion Shae in tow) to play a more central role in the power struggle, even as his love-hate (OK ... usually hate-hate) relationship with sister Cersei and father Tywin continues to simmer.","Second season of ""Game of Thrones"" promises more intrigue, bloodshed .

"(CNN) -- Just weeks before a Continental Connection commuter plane crashed near Buffalo, another airline had reminded its pilots about safety issues with instrument approaches at the airport. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. However, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it was extremely unlikely the February 12 crash and the warning were related. Instrument approaches are those in which pilots use cockpit displays to line up their aircraft with the runway when visibility is low. The alert, initially issued by Southwest Airlines and reissued Wednesday by the airline's pilot association, warned there was a ""potentially significant hazard"" concerning the instrument landing system's glide slope guidance signal for runway 23. The airline advised, ""Pilots who are preparing to configure and land have the potential to experience abrupt pitch up, slow airspeed, and approach to stall if conditions present themselves in a certain manner."" Southwest Airlines spokesperson Linda Rutherford said an earthen dam at the end of the runway was interfering with the signal being sent to inbound flights. Rutherford would not confirm if any of Southwest's recent flights into Buffalo experienced problems on approach. ""We often put out alerts on obstructions to a navigation aid,"" Rutherford told CNN. She also pointed out, though landing on the same runway, Southwest Airlines flights approach runway 23 from the north, turning right, while the Colgan Air flight that crashed was approaching from the south turning left. Rutherford called that distinction important.  View a Google Earth image of runway 23 » . The National Transportation Safety Board told CNN the agency was ""aware"" of the Southwest Airlines alert, but would not comment further. The issue is caused by a geographic feature at the airport, a valley, ""something we can't do anything about,"" said FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown. She said the ""altitude reading makes it look like you're a lot higher than you are, because there is a valley there."" The feature has been noted on FAA charts for years, she said. ""As far as we can tell, there is no way this had any role in the accident,"" Brown told CNN. ""It's not a navigation aid that would have applied to the approach."" The alert from Southwest Airlines advises pilots that the problem could cause the planes navigational system to interpret data ""in such a way as to result in a nose-up pitch and loss of airspeed."" Flight data recorders obtained by the NTSB of the crashed Colgan air Flight 3407 show during its approach to runway 23, the twin turbo prop Dash-8 pitched up 31 degrees before going into a stall due to lack of airspeed. Southwest Airlines Pilot Association told its pilots the ""issue is being addressed on several levels in an attempt to address procedures, facilities, and communication regarding this matter.""

"(CNN) -- If Facebook and Wall Street become friends, will you like it? For the past couple of years, the potential for Facebook to go public has been bandied about a lot in tech circles, with more and more of the digital tea leaves suggesting that the social-networking juggernaut will, in fact, one day become a publicly traded commodity. The speculation has heated up again this week. And, amid all the chatter about financial disclosures and initial public offerings, another question has emerged: What would it mean for the average Facebook user? The Wall Street Journal this week quoted unnamed sources who said Facebook is ""inching closer"" to a public offering, in spring or early summer, that would value the company at more than $100 billion. According to the report, Facebook would look to raise a staggering $10 billion during its initial public offering. A $100 billion valuation would price the social-networking giant at more than twice the value of tech institutions such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and 3M Co., the Journal reported. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment for this article. For folks who have followed Facebook's now-iconic rise from dorm-room project to online hangout for more than 800 million users, the money talk may be all well and good. But some of them say they are concerned that, when the stock shares start hitting the market, the ingenuity that built Facebook could disappear. TechCrunch writer Josh Constine wasn't optimistic in a post bluntly titled ""Why Greedy Stockholders and a $100 Billion IPO Could Hurt Facebook."" Constine argues that if Facebook becomes beholden to stockholders, the site would be less free to innovate and would need to make profit a more important consideration than user experience. In other words, it could mean more ads popping up on users' pages, for example. ""(O)utside stockholders could detract from Facebook's vision and momentum,"" he wrote. ""They could push for faster returns, and pressure the company to display more ads, turn mobile into a direct revenue stream, and play it safe with product. This might produce short-term gains, but could hamper what CEO Mark Zuckerberg has built into a core communications utility for the world."" Constine cited Facebook changes such as the News Feed. It's hard to fathom now, but in 2006 when the site's centerpiece feature rolled out, it was a radical departure. And people hated it. If short-term stock price had been the site's prime concern then, he says, Facebook may have hesitated to make such a change. ""Changes that disrupt user behavior and ask people to be more open might cause temporary stock price dips (stockholders) don't want,"" he wrote. ""Instead, they could turn Facebook into Microsoft, slowing innovation and making it vulnerable to more agile competitors."" At ReadWriteWeb, Marshall Kirkpatrick had a more upbeat take, writing that a Facebook flush with new cash could be good for innovation. ""Why? Because the Facebook IPO could mean more and bigger startup acquisitions, more support for more startups and an infusion of smart money and experience into radically new tech experiments."" Kirkpatrick notes that Facebook's IPO documents would detail how it plans to spend the money it raises. ""If the company signals then that more and bigger acquisitions are an important part of its strategy, that alone will be good news for startups,"" he wrote. Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst with Forrester Research who specializes in online commerce, has a take that jibes with some of both arguments. ""The biggest con of going public is quarterly investor scrutiny and the pressure that puts on short-term goals,"" she told CNN. ""The biggest pro is generally the liquidity it offers shareholders, including employees, but in Facebook's case, that may not be such a big benefit as the shares are already being exchanged in the private market."" In a financial landscape dominated by quarterly earnings reports, she said it wouldn't be enough for Facebook to make money. To keep Wall Street happy, it would continually have to make more money than it did the quarter before. ""The impact on users is that Facebook will face significant pressure to grow quarter over quarter -- that may degrade the user experience if the way to achieve that is to blast more useless ads to users,"" she said. ""The biggest challenge for Facebook over time will be to continue to engage users and not alienate them."" And about that $100 billion price tag? She says it's not out of the question. ""Even Groupon, which is horribly unprofitable and has a questionable business model, has a market cap now more than $10 billion,"" she said. ""Is Facebook worth 10 times that? Yes, because it makes much more money than Groupon, has far fewer employees, a stronger management team and a clear target market in display advertising. ""On the other hand, is Facebook worth more than Google, or a third of Apple? That remains to be seen. We're not exactly in a rational market right now.""","Questions arise over what a publicly traded Facebook would mean to users .
Some fear a constant need to please stockholders would mean less innovation and more ads .
Others say a cash infusion would be good for startup companies Facebook may buy .
The Wall Street Journal: Facebook will go public next year at $100 billion valuation ."
"(EW.com) -- When Kevin Smith announced last year that his upcoming hockey movie ""Hit Somebody"" would be his final film as a director, you could almost hear a collective sigh of disappointment from hard-core fans of Dante and Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. Smith's convenience-store drones and derelicts introduced Smith's Jersey brand of profane wit in 1994â€²s ""Clerks,"" and a successful 2006 sequel proved that audiences hadn't had enough. Smith's retirement threatened to kill any chances of completing the Quik Stop trilogy -- a challenge you'd think might tempt the ""Star Wars""-obsessed Smith. Well, there is a new hope. Last week, during a book signing in New York, he revealed that his beloved characters might be heading to Broadway. After seeing the hit play, ""Seminar,"" which reminded Smith of the fundamental stagecraft he used to film ""Clerks,"" he suddenly envisioned breathing new life into the franchise with a stage production of ""Clerks III"" in 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original. It's still only in early talks, but Smith tells EW that he's already broached the subject with several members of the cast, including the hard-to-wrangle Jeff Anderson, who played irreverent slacker, Randal. The writer/director/Silent Bob shared his hopes in an exclusive conversation with EW. Entertainment Weekly: Have you had any recent discussions -- formal or informal -- with the cast from the first two ""Clerks"" about another potential edition, whether it be on the stage or on the screen? Kevin Smith: Jeff was the first person I reached out to. I sent him an email after I'd seen Alan Rickman in ""Seminar"" in February: ""You're the first person I'm gonna tell... ""Clerks III"" is gonna be a play on Broadway. We'll do a six month run and sell out the entirety in advance. You up for six shows a week, sir? Live?"" To which Jeff responded, ""Better lay off the weed, sir."" I told Jason [Mewes], just before we went onstage to do our ""Jay & Silent Bob Get Old"" live podcast in London. He asked if he could be his own understudy. I haven't spoken to Brian [O'Halloran] yet, but he's the only one of us with actual theatrical training, so this will be right up his alley. I know I'll need Trevor [Fehrman] as well, because Elias from ""Clerks II"" will feature prominently. Rosario Dawson's Becky would feature in a pre-recorded bit. EW: Anderson was initially cool to the idea of ""Clerks II."" Is Anderson just a stubborn negotiator, or does he truly lack an interest in doing this again? Smith: It took a long time to convince Jeff to do ""Clerks II,"" but we were both really happy with how the script turned out. Ultimately, I think Jeff would be into it if the script is good and so long as the the Weinstein Company is nowhere near it. But if we don't get Jeff, it won't happen. He's the key to ""Clerks III"" for me. EW: How exactly would Clerks on Broadway work? Smith: I'll make it as painless as I can: a six month run that culminates with a one-night performance we broadcast into movie theaters -- like we did with ""Live From Behind"" a few months back. So ultimately, anyone who can't make it to Broadway to see the show can go to the movie theater the night we stream the production and see if for like 20 bucks. The hardest part for me won't be making it happen; the hardest part at this point, for me, will be standing on a stage for two hours and not talking. EW: Last we saw, Dante and Randal had purchased the Quick Stop, and Dante was going to be a father/husband. Where might they be now? What's changed? Smith: It's finally Randal's turn to fall in love -- just as everything else falls apart. EW: Lastly, and most importantly, would the donkey show in a ""Clerks III"" stage production be depicted by the same puppeteers who perform in ""War Horse""? Smith: If we can woo those f***ers over to our stables, maybe we can get Spielberg to direct the movie version of ""Clerks III."" Then I can direct a ""Jaws"" sequel without feeling like a d***.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Would you be offended if your boss got your name wrong? Maybe. Would you want to leave your job? Maybe not. Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson gave David Beckham the boot after a defeat to Arsenal in 2003. But if you're already unhappy, like Charles N'Zogbia, being called ""Insomnia"" by a no-nonsense and unapologetic Joe Kinnear was the last straw. The winger got his wish to leave Newcastle granted in the January transfer window by moving to Wigan, prompting a war of words between the pair. ""When you hear the manager say something like this about you, then you know he doesn't respect you,"" said the Frenchman. ""If he doesn't respect you, what's the point of playing for him? Newcastle's veteran boss hit back at the 22-year-old, who had refused to play for the club again under Kinnear, for ""living in a fantasy land."" ""There was not a day when he didn't have some Mickey Mouse story about a club that wanted him,"" Kinnear said. ""First it was Arsenal, then Manchester United, then Real Madrid, then Aston Villa and Lyon. I think he needed bringing down to earth and I can assure you nobody tried to stop him going."" The N'Zogbia-Kinnear feud is the latest in a long line of players and managers falling out at club level. Football Fanzone picks out some of most memorable from the last 10 years. Do you agree with our selection? Have your say in the Sound Off box. Davor Suker vs John Toshack, 1999 . Suker had been the World Cup's leading scorer for Croatia in 1998 and was still one of Europe's top marksmen when he had his falling-out with Real Madrid boss Toshack. Reports suggested Suker had been highly critical of Toshack, particularly the Welshman's transfer dealings at the Bernabeu. The club suspended him without pay. Suker conducted a strange clear-the-air-by-blaming-the-media press conference, throughout which he referred to himself in the third person. But he had signed his own death warrant at Real and was sold to Arsenal in the summer of 1999. Alan Shearer vs Ruud Gullit, 1999 . More often than not, when a manager's relationship with a player breaks down irreparably it's the player who loses out. Not when the club is Newcastle and the player is Alan Shearer. Gullit had arrived at Newcastle promising ""sexy football"" but his team weren't even able to flirt with good results. When Gullit dropped Shearer for the local derby with rivals Sunderland, it was considered a bold decision; when Sunderland ended up winning the game, it was considered a stupid one. Shearer, loved by the Toon fans, was going nowhere and made his feelings about the dreadlocked Dutch coach clear. Gullit was sacked shortly after, but still found time to criticize Shearer, saying: ""I told him to his face he was the most overrated player I have ever seen."" Jaap Stam vs Sir Alex Ferguson, 2001 . Stam had proved himself to be one of Europe's top center-backs, with three Premier League titles and a European Cup in his three years at Manchester United. But an ill-advised autobiography in the summer of 2001, from which dressing room secrets and criticisms of the Neville brothers emerged, enraged Ferguson. Stam might have been indispensable to the Old Trafford faithful, but not the combustible Scot who promptly sold the Dutchman in the autumn to Lazio. United shipped goals thereafter. Robbie Fowler vs Gerard Houllier, 2002 . The seeds of Fowler's 2002 exit from Liverpool were sown three years earlier in the infamous 'line-sniffing' goal celebration, which left Houllier irate. The Frenchman had already broken the club's transfer record for Emile Heskey to partner Michael Owen in attack, leaving fans' favorite Fowler as the odd one out. Player and manager had already been at odds over team selection when Fowler was left out of the squad for the start of the 2001-02 Premiership season after kicking a ball at assistant manager Phil Thompson during training. Fowler, becalmed by injuries but still a deadly finisher, eventually apologized but the damage was done and he was sold to Leeds in November 2002. David Beckham vs Sir Alex Ferguson, 2003 . Ferguson was concerned his protégé Beckham was spending too much time indulging in the celebrity lifestyle flaunted by his high-profile wife, Victoria. The England captain's Manchester United form had not dipped alarmingly but Ferguson still wielded the axe -- or, indeed, the boot. An argument between the two erupted in the Old Trafford dressing room after a defeat to arch-foes Arsenal, and Beckham took a boot in the face from a furious Ferguson. The cut forehead healed but the rift didn't and the England captain left for Real Madrid that summer. Wayne Rooney vs David Moyes, 2006 . Rooney had already secured his move away from Everton by the time he had his spat with Moyes, his former boss at Goodison Park. Rooney's 2006 autobiography revealed how he believed Moyes was jealous of his success and that the new Manchester United forward ""would have gone anywhere to get away from him"" -- including signing for Newcastle. Moyes took umbrage and then took Rooney to court, winning a substantial payout from the England star. Andriy Shevchenko vs Jose Mourinho, 2007 . When you're one of the world's most feared forwards and you've just been signed for an eye-watering $45m, the expectation is you'll score goals. Shevchenko, though, turned 30 shortly after arriving at Chelsea -- but played as if he'd just turned 40. Mourinho never wanted the Ukrainian in the first place (he'd been bought by club owner and Shevchenko's friend Roman Abramovich), but after months of heavy-legged displays, the goal-shy striker saw fewer and fewer first-team minutes. Mourinho lost the power struggle with Abramovich when he was sacked in September 2007, and Shevchenko didn't last much longer at Stamford Bridge. Gordon Strachan vs Aiden McGeady, 2008 . McGeady has long been one of those Celtic players you expect to be whisked away following a big-money offer. He is still there -- just. McGeady's departure from the club looked assured when he was banned from training for two weeks and heavily fined after a launching into a dressing-room tirade at Strachan. A home draw to Hearts led to Strachan tearing into the Irishman after the match and McGeady responded with personal abuse. McGeady has since returned to the Bhoys' starting XI but Scotland's player of the year and young player of the year for 2008 is drinking in the last-chance saloon at Celtic Park.","Some of football's biggest names have rowed with their managers .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's new conservative government announced 27 billion euros ($35 billion) in cuts from the budget this year to reduce the deficit in the midst of the nation's prolonged economic crisis. ""We are in a critical situation. This is the most austere budget in our democracy, and with tax measures to bring in new income to guarantee public services,"" Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro said after the weekly Cabinet meeting. There will be an average spending reduction of 16.9% at government ministries. Salaries will be frozen for civil servants, who will be required to work an additional 10 hours per month. Business taxes will increase, but sales tax will not, to avoid further dampening consumption, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said. The much-anticipated announcement came a day after a general strike called to protest labor market reform laws, which the government has approved, that unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. The strike slowed industry and transport but had less impact on commerce. Hundreds of thousands of union supporters demonstrated late Thursday in Madrid and across Spain. There were scattered incidents of violence, including in Barcelona. Spain's unemployment rate is 23%, and twice that for young people. A total of 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work. The government predicts that the economy will contract this year by 1.7%. Spain has come under increased scrutiny from the European Union after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that Spain's deficit, as a percentage of gross domestic product, would not be 4.4% this year, as previously targeted, but 5.8%. Brussels responded by demanding that it be 5.3%. The spending cuts and tax increases announced Friday aim to bring Spain in line with the 5.3% objective. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, attending a European Union ministers meeting in Copenhagen that was closely monitoring Spain's budget announcement, said, ""We are convinced that Spain will stop being a problem for the Union."" Montoro said he would take the budget to parliament on Tuesday. The government has a commanding majority in parliament and does not need the support of any other party to approve its budget. There will be cutbacks in infrastructure investment, defense spending, education scholarships, aid for immigrants and housing subsidies and in foreign development aid, Montoro said. The government has raised income taxes and announced Friday that it would seek more business taxes on large corporations. Analysts said it apparently aims to cut tax loopholes. Pensions will not be affected. ""These are a variety of measures aimed at getting out of this situation and growing the economy and generating jobs,"" Saenz de Santamaria said.","""We are in a critical situation,"" treasury minister says .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- More than 100 people were injured when a strong earthquake shook coastal Peru early Monday, civil defense officials said. The magnitude 6.3 quake hit about 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of Ica, at a depth of 39.2 kilometers (24.4 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Civil defense officials reported that 119 people were injured and 40 homes were either damaged or destroyed. Power was temporarily down in parts of Ica, they said. State-run TV Peru reported that police were patrolling the area while officials assessed damages. A 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck the same region in October, leveling dozens of buildings and leaving some homeless. In 2007, an 8.0-magnitude quake struck southwestern Peru, killing more than 500 people and injuring more than 1,000. The most serious damage from that quake occurred in towns and cities along the country's Pacific coast south of Lima, including Chincha, Canete, Pisco and Ica. CNN's Esprit Smith and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: 119 people are injured, civil defense officials say .

"(CNN) -- He was the soccer referee known as ""golden whistle"" who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics. But a Chinese court has called fulltime on Lun Ju's career by jailing him for match fixing. China's state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Lu has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison by a court in Liaoning Province after accepting $128,000 to fix seven matches in China's national league. Three other officials -- Huang Junjie, Wan Daxue and Zhou Weixin -- were also jailed for seven, six, and three and a half years respectively. The cases were brought after a government crackdown on persistent allegations of gambling, match fixing and corruption in China's football leagues was launched in 2009. But it is the fall of Lu that has grabbed the most headlines around the world. He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. Prior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation. But the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. Huang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated. Zhou was proved to have taken $77,829 to fix eight games. In 2004 he awarded a penalty in a Chinese Super League match that prompted seven clubs to protest against the Chinese Football Association. Zhou and Huang were also found to have fixed the outcome of two international matches, while Wan was convicted of accepting $149,306 to influence games. Former CFA vice-president Yang Yimin and ex-CFA Referee Committee director Zhang Jianqiang are due to be sentenced on February 18, Xinhua reported. The fact that several of China's top clubs were alluded to in the court cases also casts doubt on the new league season, due to begin in March, as they await to hear if they will be sanctioned.","Former World Cup referee Lu Jun jailed in China for match fixing .

"(CNN) -- To the Republican voters in the other 49 states, I sympathize with you. It must be painful to turn on every cable and broadcast network, read the websites and follow the blogs and realize that you mean absolutely nothing when it comes to choosing a GOP nominee for president of the United States. Please, don't even bother. Iowa has it all under control, and what happens there, and in New Hampshire, will settle the race once and for all. What a load of animal droppings on the Iowa farm fields. Conventional wisdom, which really means the opinions of the smart, politically savvy know-it-all sages in Washington, says that if you don't win Iowa or place high there, you won't be able to raise the money to continue, and you might as well go home and lick your wounds. Remember when that was the standard talk in 2008 after then-Sen. Barack Obama won Iowa? The political elites said if he beat Sen. Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, the race was over. A lot of voters in the Granite State were offended to hear that, especially women, and backed Clinton. As a result, those two fought it out for another five months in a grueling race for the Democratic presidential nomination. It has always offended me that voters in the other states are seen as also-rans. And that's the No. 1 reason why Michigan, Florida, Nevada and South Carolina threatened or successfully moved their primaries and caucuses: They wanted to matter, and not just accept what Iowa and New Hampshire gave them. No GOP candidate should entertain the notion of dropping out of the race based on what happens in Iowa on Tuesday night. Why end it after one state? I bet former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty regrets dropping out after the Ames, Iowa, straw poll, which Rep. Michele Bachmann won. Was he having money issues? Sure. But so were Bachmann, Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain. The latter two vaulted to the top of the polls based on debate performances. See, it paid to keep going. It's true that Iowa can be a game changer if you are not expected to win. It was a huge boost for Obama in 2008, but for past Iowa winners such as Mike Huckabee, Pat Buchanan and Paul Tsongas, it didn't lead to winning their respective party's presidential nomination. Now I doubt Mitt Romney, Ron Paul or even Rick Santorum will slip up after Tuesday night, but no one knows for sure. We've seen a lot of crazy things happen in this race so far. So we might as well be prepared for the unpredictable. In fact, I find it hilarious that so many folks in the chattering class say it's all about Iowa, and Mitt Romney turns into The Dominator if he wins. Yet if Ron Paul wins, the results don't matter. Really? So excuse me if I sound like a contrarian by refusing to buy the media hype of putting so much on Iowa. It's one of 50 states. It's the first, sure. But it sure as hell shouldn't be the last, or even next to last, for all of the candidates. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin objects to the notion that you have to take Iowa to win .
Martin: No candidate should drop out based on performance in Iowa or New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona put one foot into the quarterfinals of the Champions League after completing a 3-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday. The reigning European champions dominated possession for large parts of the game with Alexis Sanchez opening the scoring in the 41st minute of the opening leg of the last-16 tie in Germany. The Chilean striker chased onto a pass from Lionel Messi before firing past Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Leverkusen equalized seven minutes after the break as recent signing Vedran Corluka chipped in a cross from which Czech Republic defender Michel Kadlec headed home. But it wasn't long before Barca were back in front as Sanchez bagged his second of the night, scoring from a tight angle after receiving the ball from Cesc Fabregas. Leverkusen had chances to equalize again as Renato Augusto forced a save from Victor Valdes, and midfielder Gonzalo Castro also hit the post in the 64th minute. But it was Messi who had the final say on the evening, converting a cross from Dani Alves in the 88th minute to give Barca a comfortable buffer ahead of the second leg at the Nou Camp on March 7. The world player of the year had started the move, finding Alves down the right with a superb pass, and he earlier hit the post after a sublime flick over the onrushing Leno. In Tuesday's other last-16 tie, French side Lyon scored a narrow 1-0 win over minnows APOEL FC at the Stade Gerland. Alexandre Lacazette's goal in the 58th minute proved the difference between the teams, but the first club from Cyprus to reach the knockout stages still have hopes of progressing with victory in Nicosia on March 7. There were two Europa League ties played Tuesday with Besiktas beating 10-man Braga 2-0 in the first leg of their last-32 tie. Helder Barbosa's dismissal in the first half capped a miserable night for last year's finalists as their Turkish visitors made the most of the numerical advantage with goals in either half from Tomas Sivok and former Portugal international Simao. Olympiakos edged Russian side Rubin Kazan 1-0 thanks to a goal from David Fuster in the 73rd minute. Former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll coming on as a substitute to save a penalty five minutes later to earn the Greek side a hard fought victory.","Barcelona win 3-1 in first leg of Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- A small central Texas community has begun trucking in thousands of gallons of water to avoid running dry during the state's historic drought, a water official said. Two trucks filled with about 8,000 gallons of water reached Spicewood Beach Monday afternoon and the precious liquid was immediately pumped into community water tanks. ""The community could be trucking for two weeks or two months, it just depends on the weather,"" according to Lower Colorado River Association spokeswoman Clara Tuma. ""It's raining right now, though."" The town is under a Stage 4 water emergency -- the most severe level -- and it won't ease until the town gets more rain over an extended period of time. ""The water supply is dangerously low"" in the community of 1,100 about 35 miles northwest of Austin, Tuma said. The town sits on Lake Travis and is popular among retirees and people who own lake houses or second homes. The water level in the Spicewood well has leveled out since the water emergency was declared last week. ""All outdoor watering is now prohibited and customers are strongly urged to cut out all nonessential use of water immediately,"" the company said in a news release on January 24. Officials believe conservation by the community has helped. Residents are only supposed to be using water for bathing, cooking and drinking. Besides trucking in water, the LCRA is looking at other alternatives for water, including digging another well, Tuma said. The Spicewood Beach Regional Water System is served by a single well after three other wells in the community were shut down in recent years. ""We're going to run out of water,"" resident Joe Barberra told CNN affiliate YNN Austin. ""Something should have been done a long time ago ... They waited too long. Now we're in this predicament."" The dry spell began in 2010 and is the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Spicewood Beach may need supplemental water for several months, official says .

"(CNN) -- Some of the bravest, noblest women and men I have met are members of the United States armed forces. To them, military intervention is not about winning a debate on television or sounding smart on Twitter. With the United Nations ruling out support for military options to stop the bloodbath in Homs in Syria, leading U.S. commentators are calling for NATO and the Arab League to intervene militarily. In reality, this would mean the United States would once again carry the heavy burden of war. In NATO's recent operation in Libya, the United States provided 75% of the reconnaissance data, surveillance, intelligence and refueling planes. Syria is not Libya, and NATO without the United States is not up to the job. The Arab League is no match for a brutal Syrian regime backed by Russia, China and Iran. In essence, therefore, we must stop pretending about NATO or the Arab League intervening and accept that it is not ""international intervention,"" but U.S. military intervention that is being sought in yet another Muslim-majority country. The Muslim dimension is important because the lessons of Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan are that, invariably, intervention leads to occupation, which leads to varying degrees of Islamist radicalization. Whatever the motivations to advance U.S. military intervention, we need to address the following questions before contemplating placing U.S. armed forces in harm's way again, and demanding the U.S. taxpayer foot the bill. First, what does such U.S. military involvement look like? In military terms, what is the ""TTP?"" -- the envisaged tactics, techniques and procedures for U.S. armed forces? Is intervention designed to create a safe human corridor through which besieged Syrian citizens in Homs can escape, or are we talking about all-out regime change? Second, if Assad were to be removed by force or arrested by U.S. soldiers for war crimes, who could rule Syria without an ongoing, costly U.S. troop presence on the ground? The U.S.-led, allied mistake in Iraq -- to dismiss the Ba'ath party from power -- led to years of chaos and killing. Today, the Syrian business sector, media, education, security, mosques and police forces are controlled by the Ba'ath party. What happens to this embedded national infrastructure? In other words, what is the day-after plan? Third, how does the United States propose to head off the hostilities of China and Russia, who are Syria's allies? Additionally, Hezbollah, Iran and assorted Jihadist groups will see U.S. forces as sitting targets in an Arab country. Al Qaeda in Iraq will be revived with renewed strategic depth and alliance with terrorists in Syria. What is the potential military and strategic blowback in exposing U.S. forces to an array of enemies at one stroke? Fourth, intervening in Syria sets a new precedent. The Economist reports of unrest in China. If, buoyed by U.S. intervention in Syria, Chinese protesters were to take to the streets and Beijing proceeded to unleash another Tiananmen Square-style massacre, would the United States consider military strikes on China? Why not? Put simply, what ""third and fourth tier effects,"" as they are known by military strategists, have not been thought about by interventionists? I am convinced that military options in Syria will do immeasurably more harm than good. My conviction stems from living in Syria during the U.S. occupation of Iraq and visiting Syria regularly over the last decade. I learned that Syria is a complex nation -- its ethnic, sectarian, tribal and religious composition is fragile. Thankfully, the White House and State Department have so far steered clear of pursuing military options. But the war drums are being beaten in the U.S. media and on the think-tank circuit. Conventional thinking will not solve Syria's complex conflict. These are the questions that should be on the table: How can a face-saving exit route for Assad be found? Will Russia provide a home, or Iran? If protesters in Syria are democracy activists, what stops them from working with their democratic neighbor, Israel? The answer to that question tells us much about anti-Israeli, and by extension, anti-American sentiment in Syria. How can Turkey and Arab nations persuade the opposition to return to nonviolent protest? Who can hold the country together after Assad's departure? War is a costly, deadly last resort. Diplomacy, sanctions, freezing assets, travel bans and international isolation will hasten Assad's demise. He is self-destructing, and we do not need to thump our chests in the midst of a fiscal crisis with the false glory of ""mission accomplished"" in a country that shares borders with Israel, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- A Chinese artist and activist said Saturday that he has been placed under house arrest for planning a demolition party to ""observe"" a government order to raze his studio. Ai Weiwei said he had planned a concert and a river crab feast at the party in Shanghai on Sunday. About 800 people were expected to attend, he said. The term river crab is believed to make a political statement. The Mandarin word for river crab sounds like ""harmonious,"" a word some use to describe government censorship. Ai Weiwei opens London installation ""Sunflower Seeds"" Ai said he was put under house arrest until Sunday to prevent him from attending the party. ""Just recently I heard the new studio I built in Shanghai studio will be demolished all because of my activities,"" Ai said. ""So what is my activity? My activity is very very simple, asking basic right for people to freely express themselves and also to find a new structure, a new way of communicating. Because I'm an artist this is what I do and I believe in that."" Ai said he was not allowed to leave his house, which was guarded by police. ""Please accept my deepest apologies,"" he tweeted to his guests in Shanghai. Ai said he chose to ""celebrate our life"" since the studio was going to be razed anyway. He has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents before. ""They crack down on everybody who has different opinions -- not even different opinions, just different attitudes,"" he told CNN earlier this year. ""Simply to have different opinions can cost [dissidents] their life; they can be put in jail, can be silenced, and can disappear."" The artist helped design the iconic Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but later called for a boycott of the games because he believed China was using them as propaganda. He has also held exhibits in Europe and the United States, and his work is on display at the Tate Modern gallery's Turbine Hall in London, England.","Ai Weiwei says he had planned a party to ""observe"" a government order to raze his studio .

"(CNN) -- In the frenzy over the sudden phenomenal success of Jeremy Lin -- known as ""Linsanity"" -- there's been some talk of race. Floyd Mayweather Jr., the famed boxer, caused controversy when he said the other day, ""Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he's Asian. Black players do what he does every night and don't get the same praise."" Before you get up in arms about Mayweather's comment, first consider the source. Mayweather is known for causing a stir and pushing people's buttons. He's made homophobic and racist comments about sports figures in the past, including champion boxer Manny Pacquiao. So anything Mayweather says you might want to ignore. But does he have a valid point? Is Lin getting this much attention only because he's Asian? Absolutely not. Does race play into the equation? Absolutely. Lin is the first Chinese-American to not just get on the court but make a major impact in the NBA. That is huge. No one since the NBA-ABA merger during the 1976-77 season has scored at least 20 points and seven assists in his first five starts. Nobody. Almost single-handedly, Lin has given new life to the once proud New York Knicks franchise. Yes, there have been other Asians and Asian-Americans who played in the league, but most were of mixed race (Rex Walters, Raymond Townsend, Wat Misaka). We had the star Yao Ming for a while, but he was from China. Lin is from California. He went to Harvard. He can even dance the Dougie. There is a difference. Not all Asians are alike. No one thought much of Lin until he was given a real chance. And it came unexpectedly. The Knicks were reportedly set to waive Lin but gave him the opportunity to play because of a lack of depth at point guard. Lin was on the Golden State Warriors last season before getting waived on the first day of training camp and then was briefly with the Houston Rockets before being let go. Now, there were financial situations involved like salary cap, guaranteed contracts, etc., but there is no doubt in my mind that because Lin is Asian-American, it made it easier for management to overlook his potential. Lin has benefited from playing in New York City -- the media capital of the world -- but his emergence to stardom is due to his talent, his faith and his determination. Has race been on people's minds? Yes. You stick out on the court when you're the only Asian face. While there are Asian-Americans playing in the NFL and Major League Baseball, the NBA is different. Maybe I'm guilty of stereotyping as well, but this is a game dominated by black athletes like Lebron James, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant. If a Chinese-American guy can hold his own against the best athletes in the world, wow! Lin has also struck a chord among Asian-American men. I have heard many negative stereotypes over the years. We aren't tall enough, sexy enough, strong enough or good-looking enough. These stereotypes are still portrayed in our culture today. Just take a look at the Asian male character on the TV show ""Two Broke Girls,"" or read the crude sexual tweet by the sports columnist Jason Whitlock. I have faced my own share of stereotypes as a rare Chinese-American television sportscaster. (I believe I was the first in the country.) Really, not since Bruce Lee displayed his power in ""Enter the Dragon"" have we Asian-American men had someone to rally around. Lin has given us a sense of pride. So Mayweather is right, race does play a part -- but Jeremy Lin is no token minority. The man has game or he wouldn't be getting the attention he deserves. I don't know if he'll have a long career or be an all-star, but you can be sure he is starting to change not just the way general managers and pro scouts look at Asian-Americans playing sports, but also the way our society thinks about them.

"(EW.com) -- Goodbye, Catherine! In preparation for Marg Helgenberger's last episode of ""CSI"" -- which aired on Wednesday on CBS -- EW talked to the 53-year-old actress about becoming the third original star (behind Gary Dourdan and William Petersen) to depart the long-running crime drama, as well as what she'll miss, and whether she'll ever come back. Entertainment Weekly: You say goodbye to the other members of the CSI team in the last scene of your final episode. Was that by design? Marg Helgenberger:  Yeah. I had asked for that to be the last scene 'cause I knew it was gonna be a really intense scene and I just didn't want to play it before anything else. I don't know if pressure is the right word, but I felt like a big bubble over my head, like, ""This is an important day in my life."" It's been such an incredible journey. I just wanted to make sure that...I said the right things. EW: How did you think it went? Helgenberger: I was really happy with the way it went. I mean, the scene, I had tweaked it. They had written it, but I tweaked it and they were okay with that. They said, ""Really, whatever you want to say."" My boyfriend said several times, ""That was just really, really special."" I mean, I knew that I was probably not gonna feel that kind o' love. I mean, who knows? I hope to have another experience like that in my career, but that was a rare experience to end [my time on] the show that I still have enormous love for and respect for and pride and all of that. It was great. It was beautiful. It was really beautiful. Every time I've like thought about that day and leaving, I well up. Jorja Fox had written this card for me with a polar bear on it -- a photograph of a polar bear. What she said in the card was so beautiful about how I'm an endangered species and blah, blah, blah. It was just so moving. So I just feel so blessed to have had this experience all these years. EW: Weren't you supposed to leave last year? Helgenberger: Well, it was originally supposed to be the end of last season. And Carol Mendelsohn had kind of begged me. She said, ""Do you think there's any way I can convince you to exit, not [at] the beginning of the next season, but into the next season? I just think it's better for the show, it's better for you, you can get more attention."" I was open to it because I wasn't exactly quite ready, but this time, I was. And I can't tell you how many times they tried to convince me to change my mind. I mean, even 'til the last night of shooting, they were just, ""Anytime you want to come back, and if we write this great episode,"" and so on and so on. I just have to recharge my battery, step back, and reassess. It's been a long time. Time plays with your mind when you're on a show like that. Twelve years is a very long time. My son was 9 and he's now 21 and he's working in the production office. A day hasn't gone by [during] which I didn't enjoy myself. I mean, there may have been certain locations that sucked, there might have been certain story lines that I didn't really like or the hours, whatever, but there was always something that happened during that day -- shooting day -- which made me laugh. I don't leave going, ""I gotta get out of this job."" EW: But it was hard work, right? Helgenberger: Oh my God, yes. In the first few seasons, there'd be days that were like, 16, 17 hours long. The killer thing about ""CSI,"" especially in those first few years, is that it's supposed to be the graveyard shift of this crime unit in Vegas. So it was so much at night and it just, three, four, five in the morning, in these ungodly locations. That scaled back, especially after season 5. I had it in my contract not to be worked after midnight, but then sometimes I would let it slide. EW: Think back to the making of the pilot. What were your initial thoughts about ""CSI""? Helgenberger: I just thought it was a really special 21st century Sherlock Holmes. All the technology and science kinda was the star. And that had never really been, and that the criminalists became the heroes as opposed to cops or feds or whatever you had seen in series before. It felt effortless -- that's a good word for it. And it just felt like, I've done a series before, ""China Beach,"" and you kinda know when there's like chemistry on a pilot and you know when there's chemistry all around and there's a little magic dust sprinkled over something. EW: How did you feel about Catherine being an ex-stripper? Helgenberger: In the pilot she was described as a single mother and ex-stripper. But it was never really addressed. So the producers said, ""You know, we're just gonna do away with that backstory and we think she should come more out of like some sort of generic [background]."" I don't even remember what they were pitching. I said no, I think that it really says a lot about who this woman is, 'cause it takes a lot to go from that kind of career to this completely different career. And so they acquiesced pretty easily. EW: Talk about when Billy Petersen left the show. Helgenberger: I was very upset that he left. I mean, it wasn't like I didn't see it coming, 'cause he had been wanting off the show for a while. He was pretty vocal about it. He can be a bit of a grump and we used to call him Grandpa, to his face, 'cause he just would always complain. Not in an outrageous way, but he just always seemed to have a complaint or two or three about something or other, whether it was working too many hours or he didn't want to be in this scene or something. So it was clear that he was wanting to go, like, way before he even left. In fact, I was kind of surprised he stuck it out as long as he did. I think it was into the second season, possibly [third], but in his trailer, there was like this molding or something and he started putting down the episodes, like he was kind of obsessed with how many episodes he was stuck having to do still. EW: Your thoughts on Laurence Fishburne? Helgenberger: It was a different show with Laurence than it was with Billy. In many ways, it kind of became a darker -- I don't know if I want to say darker, 'cause there were plenty of dark episodes when Billy was around, but the character that they created for Laurence was one in which he, initially -- I don't know if he had a certain type of chromosome or something [that] he shared with people who have a trait to be serial killers or something like that. So you're already stuck with a dark character, so where do you go from there? But Laurence is a very powerful actor, and I enjoyed working with him. EW: And Ted Danson? Helgenberger: I love working with Ted. He's just so -- well, I don't know if this is the right way to describe it, but he's so light and fun and loose, yet just a really solid actor. He's really, really a good actor and just a great guy and quirky. He's been a lot of fun this season. If I was really open to it, I definitely would have stayed because of Ted. He's just so easy to work with. EW: So you're open to coming back? When? Helgenberger: Well there are only nine episodes left, because they're already shooting episode 13. So that would mean they'd have to start figuring out a way to have me come back now, after this big arc I just had. I'm burned out. I just have to, like I said, regroup.

"(CNN) -- A fire broke out inside the reactor building at a nuclear power plant on France's northern coast, but there were no injuries or release of radiation, French utility EDF reported Thursday. The cause of the blaze in Unit 2 of the Penly nuclear power plant, near the English Channel port of Dieppe, was still under investigation, EDF said. The fire was extinguished Thursday afternoon, and inspectors were inside the unit, the company said. The reactor shut down automatically when the fire broke out, and regional authorities were notified immediately, EDF said. Nuclear power provides more than three-quarters of France's electricity. The two pressurized-water reactors at Penly, designed by the French nuclear company Areva, went online in the early 1990s.","The cause of the fire at the Penly nuclear plant is under investigation .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Bahrain said Friday that they've arrested the daughter of a human rights activist who has drawn international attention and widespread protests with a hunger strike that he's sustained for nearly two months. Zainab al-Khawaja was detained outside the Interior Ministry complex, said her lawyer, who is also representing her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. Her father is striking to protest the life sentence he received for his alleged role in the unrest that continues to embroil his country. The elder activist was arrested last April for his role in anti-government demonstrations in Bahrain in February and March. In June, he and seven other Shiite opposition activists were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family. The Interior Ministry said Zainab al-Khawaja was arrested Thursday night after it told her several times that she was in a restricted area ""in which standing is prohibited."" The ministry also said she ""attacked an on-duty public employee."" Their lawyer, Mohammed Al Jishi, said she had been calling out for her father, who was at the Interior Ministry complex and was to be moved to a military hospital because his condition was deteriorating. He said that the hunger striker was transferred to the hospital Friday, but that the government had not given his family permission to see him. They were told of the transfer Friday. Al Jishi has expressed concerns that his client could soon die and that the last time he saw him was two days ago. The Interior Ministry's general inspector said that ""all policies and procedures of the prison facilities in Bahrain meet international human rights standards, and all detainees have consistent and reliable access to professional medical care,"" according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Tariq H. Al Hasan, a spokesman for the ministry. On March 30, the government reported that Abdulhadi al-Khawaja had low blood pressure and was taken to Bahrain Defense Force Hospital, where he was treated and returned to Jau Prison the following day. Records showed that al-Khawaja had lost about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and had a low hemoglobin level, though not critically low, the government said. He was also reportedly taking fluids, mineral supplements, glucose and juice on a daily basis. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights, a nonprofit human rights group started by al-Khawaja and for which his other daughter, Maryam, works, has appealed for his immediate release on humanitarian grounds. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash in recent months, with the opposition accusing the government of using heavy-handed tactics.

"(CNN) -- France on Saturday welcomed an agreement between military coup leaders in Mali and a regional bloc that would return the country to democratic rule, two weeks after a coup plunged it into turmoil. Mali state television announced late Friday that the leader of Mali's coup, Captain Amadou Sanogo, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had signed up to the plan. The parties agreed to set up a transition process leading to a presidential election, Sanogo said, in exchange for the end of trade and diplomatic sanctions. A transitional prime minister will lead the transition ""to manage the crisis in the north of Mali and to organize free, transparent and democratic elections in accordance with a road map,"" he said. The announcement of a promised return to civilian rule came shortly after separatist rebels, who had captured large areas of Mali's vast Sahara region in the north of the country, declared independence for a region they call Azawad. A French foreign ministry statement urged all parties to put the measures set out in the agreement into effect as soon as possible, especially those laying the groundwork for presidential elections. The presidents of Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, both members of ECOWAS, will meet to discuss the next steps, the foreign ministry said. Once a constitutional government is restored, France -- the former colonial power in Mali -- will resume military and civil cooperation with Mali, the statement said. France will help the future government find a political solution to the problems in northern Mali, where the Tuareg rebels have gained control, it said. France also urged the rebel leaders to seek a political resolution. Journalist Katarina Hoije, in the capital, Bamako, said the coup leaders had been left with little choice but to agree to the plan after coming under sustained pressure from ECOWAS and losing ground to rebel groups. The rebels say they will continue to fight to preserve the territory they have gained, Hoije said, although it is unclear how much control they have on the ground. The rebel declaration of independence was made in a statement posted online by the secretary general of the Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA). The claim followed ""more than 50 years of corruption and poor governance with the complicity of the army and the politicians, putting people's lives at risk in Azawad,"" the MNLA said. In a statement, the African Union expressed its ""total rejection"" of the rebels' independence claim. The African Union will do all it can to restore the authority of the government of Mali to its entire territory and ""bring to an end the attacks being carried out by armed and terrorist groups in the northern part of the country,"" it said. French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said the declaration of independence in northern Mali was meaningless if it was not recognized by African states. The rebels had called a cease-fire Thursday, saying they had captured key territory in the Sahara region and achieved their military mission. The Tuaregs, who consider Azawad to be the cradle of their nomadic civilization, launched an insurgency in January to achieve a separate homeland. The conflict has uprooted more than 200,000 people from their homes. Buoyed by the chaos after last month's coup, the rebels swept through the north and wrested control of several strategic cities, including Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu. The rebels effectively split the West African nation in two, and northern areas remained volatile and tense, preventing aid agencies from accessing displaced people, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu experienced days of looting, abductions and chaos after they were occupied by armed groups. The coup leaders had deposed the democratically elected President Amadou Toumani Toure because of his alleged inability to handle the Tuareg rebellion.

"(CNN) -- Mali state television announced late Friday that the leader of Mali's coup, Captain Amadou Sanogo, and the Economic Community of West African States have agreed to a plan under which the coup leaders will hand over power to the civilian government in exchange for the end of trade and diplomatic sanctions. The statement was read in French over ORTM, the state TV network. The parties agreed to set up a transition process leading to a presidential election, Sanogo said. A transitional prime minister will lead the transition ""to manage the crisis in the north of Mali and to organize free, transparent and democratic elections in accordance with a road map,"" he said. The international community -- including West African states, the African Union and the United States -- had called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule. The African Union and ECOWAS had also slapped the military junta with travel and economic restrictions, and had frozen its assets. Sanctions targeted the supporters and relatives of the military junta and all those involved in contributing to the ""destabilization"" of Mali, the African Union said. Under the sanctions, five neighboring nations were to close their borders to landlocked Mali except for humanitarian purposes and deny the nation access to their ports, freeze its accounts in regional banks, and suspend its participation in cultural and sporting events. The announcement of a promised return to civilian rule came shortly after separatist rebels, who had captured large areas of Mali's vast Sahara region in the north of the country, declared independence for a region they call Azawad.

"(CNN) -- A blockbuster movie could not have been scripted better: a woman whose unparalleled voice earned her the kind of single-name recognition that felt like an unbearable burden. Fitting, then, that superstar Kevin Costner should eulogize his co-star in this way. At Whitney Houston's funeral Saturday, Costner recalled a woman who doubted herself when she need not have. He revealed how Houston was chosen to star with him in the 1992 movie ""the Bodyguard."" Few had confidence in Houston -- she had never acted before. A lot was riding on this role, he said, and the studio was unsure about giving it to a black woman. But Costner thought she was perfect, though she would have to prove it to the studio with a screen test. In her trailer, he took her nervous hands in his; told her she looked beautiful. ""I could still feel the doubt,"" he said. She asked for some time and after 20 minutes appeared for the screen test. ""We hadn't said four lines when we had to stop,"" Costner recalled. ""I needed to know what she had done in those 20 minutes."" He stood her in front of a mirror, her makeup running down her face. In those 20 minutes, she had wiped off the studio makeup and applied her own, the thick heavy kind she wore for her music videos, the kind that melted under the heat of studio lights. She didn't think the lighter makeup made her look good enough. To Costner, Houston seemed so small and sad at that moment. ""You weren't just pretty. You were as beautiful as a woman could be,"" Costner said in front of a packed Newark church. ""Whitney, if you could hear me now, I would tell you: You weren't just good enough. You were great. You sang the whole damn song without a band."" Costner, of course, was referring to Houston's signature song: ""I Will Always Love You"" from ""The Bodyguard."" ""A lot of leading men could have played my part, but you, Whitney, I truly believe, you were the only one who could have played Rachel Marin."" For her closest friends inside that church Saturday, and strangers who continue to draw inspiration from her voice, Costner's words hit a painfully honest note about human frailty. ""It was the burden that made her great and the part that caused her to stumble again,"" he said. Years after ""The Bodyguard"" hit theaters, reports of Houston's struggles with drug addiction and a rocky marriage with Bobby Brown surfaced and her album sales declined. ""The inexplicable burden that comes with fame,"" Costner said. ""Call it doubt. Call it fear. I've had mine. I know the famous in the room have had theirs."" Costner said Houston's own story could help a new generation of young girls who dream big. ""Maybe they're thinking they aren't good enough,"" he said. ""I think Whitney would tell you: Guard your bodies. Guard the precious miracle of your life. Then sing your hearts out, knowing that there's a lady in heaven who's making God himself wonder how he created something so perfect. ""So off you go, Whitney. Off you go,"" Costner said in closing. ""Escorted by an army of angels to your heavenly father. And when you sing before him, don't you worry. You'll be good enough.""","Costner recalls a woman who doubted herself .

"(LifeWire) -- Carol Ann Carnese never considered herself an anxious person. Except when it came to wet wood. Does this small creature terrify you? You might have sciurophobia - the fear of squirrels. ""If I saw someone lick a wooden spoon, I had to turn away,"" says the 41-year-old massage therapist from Portland, Oregon. ""I'd break out into a sweat ... and I'd just get sick to my stomach. I could not even look at someone with a toothpick in their mouth."" It wasn't just looking at wet wood that freaked her out. It was touching it, too. ""I could not eat Popsicles to the end,"" Carnese explains. ""As soon as I got close to the end, I would give it to my kids. I would not even own wooden utensils because I could not wash them. Not even in the dishwasher because they would still be damp when they came out."" Until Carnese was treated by a professional -- a process that involved gradual exposure to wet wood to ""reprogram"" the way she thought about it -- physical contact with wet trees, fences and the deck surrounding her hot tub was out of the question. (Instead, she would wear slippers to walk back to the house post-soak.)  See some examples of unusual phobias » . A common affliction . Carnese's fear of seemingly innocuous objects and situations is no anomaly. Phobias are the No. 1 psychiatric illness in women of any age and the No. 2 in men older than 25, according to the American Psychiatric Association. A ""specific"" phobia, or an ""excessive and unreasonable fear of a specific object, place or situation,"" afflicts about 19 million people in the U.S., according to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America. Fears can range from the relatively commonplace fear of closed spaces, or claustrophobia, to the more unusual, such as a fear of dolls or children, known as pediophobia. ""Phobias can affect anyone,"" says Elizabeth Lombardo, a clinical psychologist in Wexford, Pennsylvania. ""So many highly functioning people have them. It doesn't matter your socioeconomic status, your intelligence level."" Being rational doesn't help . Even realizing that a doll or a wet popsicle stick is harmless doesn't help sufferers overcome their phobias. ""Knowing that it isn't rational or it doesn't make sense doesn't help them get over their fear,"" Lombardo explains. ""Your mind says it's not rational, but your body says, 'Yeah, but I'm scared.'"" Just ask Bryan Schultz, 36, who is afraid of ""any small, furry animal that gnaws on things."" ""Rabbits and squirrels are especially terrifying for me, but even non-rodentia, like ferrets, freak me out,"" says the copywriter from State Center, Iowa. ""I work right next to a park with many trees, and I have to honk the car horn to scare any critters away before I open the door on many mornings."" ""I recognize rationally that it's funny,"" says Schultz, who doesn't consider himself a ""fearful"" person. But that doesn't stop his heart from doing backflips when he encounters a squirrel. Coping mechanisms . Rather than seek professional help, which often involves confronting the feared object or situation directly, phobics may try to manage their anxiety through avoidance. ""I've never sought treatment, partly out of embarrassment and partly because I've learned to cope by making small modifications,"" Schultz says. Instead of walking on the sidewalk, he quickly moves to the street if he spots a squirrel in his path. When a carpool buddy intentionally parked under a tree filled with squirrels as a prank, ""I had to honk the horn and sit in the car for seven minutes"" after his colleague had gone into the office, Schultz says. Peyton Pinkerton, 37, guitarist with the band Pernice Brothers, battles a similar impulse to flee the object of his personal phobia: clowns. ""I was yelled at by a birthday party clown when I was about 4 years old and have been absolutely terrified of them ever since,"" says the resident of Northampton, Massachusetts. ""If I'm surprised by seeing a clown, it's like snakes or rats. My fight-or-flight response kicks in,"" Pinkerton says. ""I have run out of malls, fairgrounds, etcetera, on repeated occasions."" Face, don't flee, the fear . Avoidance and other quick fixes are no substitute for treating the phobia, Lombardo says. ""That's what we call a Band-Aid reaction,"" she says. ""It perpetuates your fear."" The good news, Lombardo says, is that phobias can be cured. If you're suffering from one, she suggests the following: . • Go easy on yourself. ""People are so embarrassed by this,"" Lombardo says. ""They think there's something wrong with them."" But, she says, not beating yourself up is key. • Remember to breathe. ""When people are confronted with their fear, their distress level increases,"" Lombardo says. ""Deep breathing is always a good thing."" • Seek counseling. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which Lombardo practices, can often help patients kick their phobias in eight to 12 sessions. CBT focuses on changing self-destructive ways of thinking. • Face the music. Facing the feared object head-on is important. ""You're retraining your body in addition to your mind. It's like putting your feet in a hot bathtub or cold pool: You wait a little bit, and your body gets used to it,"" Lombardo says. LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

"(Mashable)  -- The internet is growing fast, but Google is growing even faster. According to online security company Arbor Networks, Google now represents an average 6.4 percent of all internet traffic. This is a new record for Google, as it gained more than 1 percent of all internet traffic share since January. Now, only one global ISP handles more traffic, and a lot of that traffic is Google's traffic, anyway. The number is even more incredible if you consider that internet traffic is growing at a staggering 40 to 45 percent each year, and Google is still gaining market share. However, Google's share may be even bigger, possibly up to 8 to 12 percent, if you account for traffic offloaded by Google Global Cache deployments, Arbor Networks' Craig Labovitz claims.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- His demonic face has stared maniacally from the cover of every Iron Maiden album since they released their first LP in 1980. Derek Riggs' favorite image of Eddie, as a clairvoyant, ""because it's so completely manic."" Edward T. Head, better known as Eddie, is a former theater mask who over 30 years has grown a body and morphed into the most recognized member of the band. In the Seventies, he was skull that sat above the drummer. ""It had flashing red eyes and it would spew out this funny stuff and fake blood all over him,"" recalls drummer Nicko McBrain. When Iron Maiden released their first album in 1980 there was no doubt who would be on the cover -- Eddie, as drawn by British artist Derek Riggs. Here, he tells Revealed about the ghoul who made him famous. When you started drawing Eddie back in the 1970s did you ever imagine he'd become such a high-profile character, much-loved by Maiden fans?  See Eddie on stage » . Derek Riggs: As soon as I had finished painting the first picture of Eddie I sat back in the chair and thought ""that picture is going to make me rich and famous""... and then I thought ""don't be silly"" and went off to get a coffee. I showed the picture to my artist's agent who gave it back to me with a grimace and said ""we don't think that picture is very commercial."" I started showing my portfolio to the art directors of record companies who usually drew back in horror as soon as they saw it, one time an art director threw me out of his office because he didn't think it was a proper rock album cover. He pointed to a picture on the wall which was his idea of a rock album cover -- it was an airbrush drawing of a waitress in a short skirt bending over so you could see her knickers. Another record company art director suggested I go and get my hair cut and paint more normal things because I looked ""like a weirdo, or a mental case"", and I shouldn't go around painting things like that and I should get therapy. The picture was unclaimed for a year and a half before Maiden asked to see my portfolio, I gathered things together and thought whether I should take it along as well because it had caused me nothing but grief so far, I kind of thought ""oh well"" and stuck it in anyway. So now I am a bit famous but still not rich... This story, and many others are covered at greater length in my book ""Run for Cover, the Art of Derek Riggs."" which is available exclusively from my Web site; derekriggs.com it also contains a lot of nice and nasty pictures. Do you feel a personal connection to Eddie, like he's your creation, almost your child? At times have you felt like a proud parent? Derek Riggs: I am not Eddie's parent, it's just a picture that I did one day and then kind of got stuck with. I never intended to be painting the bloody thing for twenty years. I didn't even want to paint horror, I was always more interested in science fiction but I couldn't paint the silly looking space ships. I used to paint really weird space ships (they're made by aliens aren't they?) and then the art directors would point to something painted by someone else and say ""spaceships don't look like this ... they look like that"" I soon realized that sci-fi illustration wasn't as creative or original as it looked from the outside. So I went off to try to do some album covers instead. Where did the inspiration come from for Eddie's various guises? Derek Riggs: The various looks of Eddie are often derived from the direction that the band wants to go in at the time. One year it was Egyptian, another year it was sci-fi, and so on. Usually the details of what came after was my doing. They just gave me a direction and then let me run with it. Most of the time the rest of the content was my idea, although sometimes they would have ideas for the actual content of a painting, like the piece of mind cover, which was Steve's idea. A lot of the other stuff, the detail and such, I used to make up as I went along. Sometimes I just got bored and changed him anyway, for something to do. What's your favorite depiction of Eddie and why? Derek Riggs: I like the clairvoyant because it's so completely manic. I didn't plan it like that, the song was about clairvoyance (seeing into the future.) I started out with an idea for something like the Roman God Janus who I think had two faces, and then I gave him three faces (past, present and future) but I couldn't reconcile his face when his mouth was open, so in desperation I rubbed out the bits between his lower and upper jaw (his cheeks) and it looked so mad that I left it like that. You've been quoted as saying that the design for Eddie was based on footage of a decapitated head you saw on a television documentary about the Battle of Guadalcanal in WW2. Is that correct? Derek Riggs: No, that is complete rubbish. I have not been quoted as saying that because I never said anything like it. It's a complete misquote. Also, from a factual point of view it's completely wrong. I wanted to paint a picture of a decaying, semi-skeletal figure in the streets of London. I needed some source material to draw from because I didn't really know how a human head decays. Then I remembered a photo-collage I had done in the 1970's when I was at school. Part of it was a photograph of a decaying head which had been stuck onto a tank. It came from Time magazine and it was captioned as being an American soldier's head which had been stuck onto a Vietnamese tank. Many years later I found the same picture in a collection of Time Photos. There it was captioned as being an English soldier's head stuck onto a Nazi tank. So now I kind of doubt that it was anything but a bit of war propaganda. Anyway, I used that picture as reference for painting the monsters head. Eddie was not inspired by the photo; I used the photo as reference for the painting. The painting was inspired by the English punk rock movement in the late 1970's. They had this kind of street philosophy about the youth of the time being wasted and thrown onto the garbage. It was an attempt to depict that idea visually. But I couldn't sell it to the punks, it scared them too much. Do you think he's aged well? Is the Eddie of today as powerful and compelling as those past? Derek Riggs: Only the ones which I paint. The ones by other people are a bit lame. They all talk like they can paint but when it comes down to it they fail. This is because they talk the talk, but I am the only one who can walk the walk. I have walked all the way out there and all the way back again and I'm still standing (but only just, and my feet are quite sore). My pictures have sold more merchandise than Walt Disney. One for one Eddie outsells Mickey Mouse. I have sold more posters than the U.S. president in an election year. A lot of the ""original"" fantasy ideas you see in the movies and on TV have been stolen directly from my Web site and my published works. I thought it up and someone else just stole it. I do get a bit tired of seeing my ideas used by other people who have no creativity of their own, just a big movie budget. Hey, give ME the big movie budget and see what happens. And stop pilfering from my Web site. Thieves. What is Eddie like, as a ghoul? Have you assigned a personality to him? Derek Riggs: Look, Eddie is a painting. He doesn't have a personality, he doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't growl or bite. He doesn't believe in anything, he is not for anything or against anything. He is a painting ... OK? What are some of the greatest misconceptions about Eddie? Derek Riggs: That he is a real person with a personality. That somehow I am like that, he is my alter ego. Well, he isn't. He is just a painting that I did one day and I kind of got stuck with. He kind of follows me around like Frankenstein's monster. And you think you've got trouble with stalkers. You stopped working for Iron Maiden some time ago. Was it hard letting go of your creation? Derek Riggs: No, by the time I stopped working for Maiden I had had enough of painting Eddie anyway. I really wanted to do something else. I could have made a big fuss about the rights to the character but I didn't want to paint him any more and I couldn't use him for anything much anyway. Also, he was a part of Maiden's core business and it is not in my nature to do people damage in that way. So I put him down and walked away. I do a lot of walking. I have done a couple of pictures for them recently; they seem to be well received by the fans, so we'll see how things go from here. More walking I guess.","British artist Derek Riggs brought Eddie to life on Iron Maiden's album covers .

"(CNN) -- Years before the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein was slaughtering Iraq's Kurds with bombs, bullets and gas. Kurdish refugees fleeing Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons attacks in 1988. The Reagan White House saw it as a ruthless attempt to put down a rebellion by a minority ethnic group fighting for independence and allied with Iraq's enemy, Iran. But Peter Galbraith thought it was something worse. ""A light went off in my head, and I said, 'Saddam Hussein is committing genocide,'"" said Galbraith, who was on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time. An unabashed idealist, Galbraith was known for tackling unconventional issues. ""If you're going to be idealistic in life, you're going to be disappointed,"" he said. ""But that's not a reason to abandon idealism."" Galbraith was one of the first Westerners to witness the effects of the slaughter. During a fact-finding trip for the Senate in 1987, he saw something troubling. ""When we crossed from the Arab part of Iraq into the Kurdish part of Iraq, the villages and towns that showed on our maps just weren't there,"" he said. Bulldozing Kurdish villages was just the first phase of Hussein's war against the Kurds. In 1988, it escalated with chemical weapons. ""Thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people were killed in those attacks, and then Iraqi troops moved into those villages and gunned down the survivors."" Galbraith wanted to invoke the U.N.'s Genocide Convention, which requires countries to prevent and punish such crimes. ""We could not stand aside and allow Saddam Hussein to commit genocide against the Kurds of Iraq."" With the support of his boss, Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Galbraith drafted a bill -- the Prevention of Genocide Act -- that would cut off U.S. foreign aid to Iraq and impose a trade embargo. ""That would have been an appropriate response to a dictator who is gassing his own people,"" Galbraith said. ""I thought with a name like that it would garner a lot of support."" But the compelling name was not enough. So Galbraith went back to the region to gather more evidence.  Watch as Galbraith describes his fight to end the slaughter » . Tens of thousands of Kurds had fled to Turkey. Survivors described blinding, burning clouds of poison gas that dropped people in their tracks. ""These people don't make up these stories. These are real stories. And if you talk to them, if you simply talk to them ... you know that they're telling the truth,"" Galbraith said. His report was still not enough to persuade the White House to punish Saddam.  Watch as Galbraith discusses genocide » . The Reagan administration had invested several years cultivating Iraq as an ally against Iran, their mutual enemy, and as a market for U.S. products, including more than $1 billion a year in farm exports. The Prevention of Genocide Act would end the diplomatic courtship and hurt U.S businesses. Read once-secret documents from the Reagan administration . ""I had a fellow who worked for one of the Louisiana senators call me up really in tears,"" Galbraith said. ""And when I talked about genocide against the Kurds, he talked about the genocide that I was committing against the rice farmers of Louisiana."" Although then-Secretary of State George Schultz warned Iraq that use of outlawed chemical weapons jeopardized the two countries' budding relationship, Schultz's spokesman said imposing economic sanctions would be premature.  Watch as George Schultz explains the administration's position » . To Galbraith, ""that was a morally repugnant statement."" The Reagan administration also claimed Galbraith's bill used ""inaccurate terms like genocide."" But for Galbraith, this was no time for semantics. ""Should we have waited until he used chemical weapons again? Should we have waited until instead of 5 percent of the Kurdish population was murdered -- 10? 15?"" In the end, the House of Representatives killed Galbraith's sanctions bill with backing from the Reagan administration. Politics had trumped principle. Galbraith calls the U.S. policy ""appeasement."" ""We were not able to modify Iraq's behavior,"" Galbraith said. ""And guess what?"" Two years later, in August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, its oil-rich neighbor to the south. This time, the U.S. compared Saddam to Hitler. And with Kuwait's oil at stake, the U.S finally screamed bloody murder.","Years before the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein was slaughtering Iraq's Kurds .

"(CNN) -- If all had gone to plan, Sudan and South Sudan would have been neighbors co-existing in a strained but civil peace, aware of a bitter history but resolved to moving on. Instead, just nine months after jubilant scenes in South Sudan as the nation declared independence, its relationship with the north is deteriorating rapidly amid violence, accusations and arguments. Efforts by the African Union to broker peace have stalled, leading some to question whether the answer might lie more than 9,000 kilometers away in China. A new report from the International Crisis Group says the country is engaged in a ""delicate dance"" as it tries to maintain its historic ties with Sudan, while also courting South Sudan. It argues that China should be doing more to promote peace between the fractious neighbors, who both stand to benefit from Beijing's eagerness to invest in their crumbling and inadequate infrastructure. ""China can and should do more -- in concert with other international actors to -- to ensure peaceful resolution, without compromising its interests or traditional adherence to a principle of non-interference,""said Zach Vertin, senior analyst on Sudan and South Sudan with the International Crisis Group. Sudan denies report that South Sudan downed its fighter jet . China has invested heavily in Sudan's oil industry through state-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). It has a considerable stake in two of the three leading oil consortia operating in Sudan -- the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC) and Petrodar -- according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Last year, 66% of all oil exported from Sudan and South Sudan went to China, although that's only a small fraction of China's total oil imports, according to the EIA. The country still gets most of its oil imports from the Middle East. Oil is one of the flashpoints in the current dispute between Sudan and South Sudan, though it's been a constant source of friction between warring parties in the nation long before the split. When South Sudan broke away from Sudan last July, it took with it 75% of the former country's oil reserves. However, all of the country's refining and export infrastructure remains in the north. In January, South Sudan shut down its oil production after accusing Sudan of stealing oil. Sudan countered that by saying it had seized the crude as compensation for unpaid pipeline and export transit fees. The shutdown is causing both countries financial pain. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil contributes 90% of Sudan's export earnings, and 98% of South Sudan's. The dispute over oil has long plagued the countries that signed a comprehensive peace agreement in 2005 after 21 years of fighting. Part of the agreement included independence for South Sudan, which finally broke away in July 2011. Just nine months later, there are fears the two countries are sliding back towards war. Earlier this week, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon again implored the countries' leaders to immediately end hostilities and implement agreements already reached on security, border monitoring and the disputed oil-rich Abyei area. ""Despite high rhetoric and recent provocations, I think the war calculations remain: Both sides have more to lose than gain from a return to conflict. Border clashes in recent days, however, continue to test those calculations as emotions run high,"" Vertin said. Through its historical ties with Khartoum and its work to nurture a new relationship with Juba, analysts say China occupies a unique position as a potential mediator in their dispute. ""They're in a good position to act as an honest broker and the more that they can do then obviously the better because it's going to save lives,"" said Helen Ware, a former Australian High Commissioner and Ambassador in Africa and now professor of peace studies at the University of New England. ""I think that Chinese should be holding out as many carrots as they can,"" she added. ""They should be trying to get people at the number two level to talk together, so that really people are understanding each other, and there's not such high levels of mistrust."" Ware said the conflict between the two neighbors gives China an opportunity to prove to its other African partners that it offers more than just a source of investment. China could prove ""that it can bring a real advantage to the situation,"" she said. ""In this situation it would be proving it can do what the African Union can't."" A return to war, she said, would make China and its African partners ""slightly twitchy... because of the feeling that we need China to be not just our investment partner, but in a sense our friend, and our friend in times of crisis."" In the next few weeks, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir is due to make his first visit to Beijing as head of state. It will give China another opportunity to nurture its relationship with the South, and perhaps erase some of the ""lingering uneasiness"" the International Crisis Group says Juba feels about China's relationship with Khartoum. ""Resolution of the impasse and resuscitation of oil flows would undoubtedly influence the scope and character of the relationship that emerges; whether the political and economic ties already established between Beijing and Juba are robust enough to weather the current crisis remains to be seen, but both sides hope so,"" said Comfort Ero, Africa program director for the International Crisis Group.","Violence and rhetoric escalating between Sudan and South Sudan .

"(CNN) -- There is a major disconnect between what the Obama administration says and what it does about bailing out countries in the European periphery. For while the administration keeps insisting that Europe has the financial wherewithal to rescue those European countries in distress, it has allowed the International Monetary Fund to bail out Greece, Ireland and Portugal on an unprecedented scale. And it has done so in a manner that puts the U.S. taxpayer on the hook in a major way. And if that were not bad enough, the administration now appears to be acquiescing to substantially bolstering the IMF's available resources with large-scale bilateral European loans. It is doing so for potential massive IMF lending to Italy and Spain that would dwarf anything that the IMF has previously done and that would put U.S. taxpayers seriously at risk. Over the past 18 months, the IMF has lent to the European periphery on a scale that has no precedent in its 67-year history. Whereas even during the Asian and Latin American crises of the late 1990s the IMF never lent a country more than 12 times its IMF quota contribution, its recent loan commitments to Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been more of the order of 35 to 40 times those countries' IMF quotas. In U.S. dollar terms, the IMF's lending commitments made to those three European countries now total around $100 billion. Considering that the U.S. has a 17ยพ% share in the IMF, these lending commitments put the U.S. taxpayer at risk for almost $20 billion should those countries be unable to repay the IMF. And the IMF is making these massive commitments despite the fact that Europe has the money to bail out its own periphery and that Europe contributed nothing to help the United States resolve its housing and banking sector crisis in 2008-2009. The Obama administration downplays the potential risk posed to the U.S. taxpayer by arguing that the IMF has preferred creditor status and that to date, it has never had a significant country defaulting on its IMF loan obligations. What the administration does not say is that the IMF's past loan repayment experience is not particularly relevant to its current European lending programs, since its European lending is so much larger than any previous IMF country loan operation. The administration is also not leveling with the U.S. public as to how ineffectual the very large IMF financial support programs have been to date in resolving Europe's troubled periphery's economic problems. For while these programs have certainly succeeded in kicking the can down the road, they have done nothing to restore solvency in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Indeed, the IMF's recipe of hair-shirt fiscal adjustment within a euro straitjacket that precludes the use of currency devaluation to promote exports as an offset to fiscal austerity has resulted in the deepest of economic recessions in those countries. And those recessions have further compromised the periphery's public finances and increased their public debt burdens. In assessing how serious the risk of IMF lending is to U.S. taxpayers, it is of note that the IMF's loan commitments to Greece, Ireland and Portugal amount to as much as 10% of those countries' gross domestic products. Perhaps more telling is the fact that those loan commitments amount to between one-quarter and one-third of those countries' annual tax revenue collections. The risk to the U.S. taxpayer is all the greater when one considers that the chance of an unraveling of the euro is now a distinct possibility. Were that unraveling to occur in a disorderly manner, it would have a devastating impact on the European periphery's economic outlook and its public finances. Considering the very size of the IMF loans in relation to those countries' tax bases, there would be a material chance that those countries would have difficulty repaying the IMF. Even more disturbing for U.S. taxpayers is the size of prospective IMF lending to Italy and Spain, ostensibly to be financed by European bilateral lending to the IMF. At the recent Cannes European summit, the European Union countries agreed that they would make bilateral loans to the IMF of the order of $260 billion. Those proposed loans were intended to augment the IMF's $390 billion in overall available resources for potential lending to Italy and Spain. Judging by the IMF's European bailout programs to date, if Italy and Spain did have to go to the IMF for large-scale financial support, the exposure of U.S. taxpayers to those two countries could be very large. Indeed, IMF lending commitments to Italy and Spain could be of the order of $750 billion and $450 billion, respectively. Given the U.S.'s 17ยพ% share in the IMF, the U.S. taxpayers' exposure to Italy and Spain as a result of IMF lending could be on the order of $220 billion. Considering the size of the exposure that might arise from IMF lending to the European periphery, the administration owes it to the U.S. public to be up front about the potential cost to the U.S. taxpayer of such lending. At the very least, the administration should call the Europeans on their attempt to bail out the European periphery by using, in significant part, U.S. taxpayer money. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Desmond Lachman.","Desmond Lachman: IMF bailout of Greece, Ireland and Portugal puts the U.S. taxpayer at risk .

"Chicago (CNN) -- More than three years after actress and singer Jennifer Hudson's mother, brother and nephew were killed, jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of the man charged in their deaths. William Balfour, the estranged husband of Hudson's sister Julia, is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother and brother inside their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later inside an abandoned vehicle. Balfour, who was also Julian's stepfather, has also been charged with one count of home invasion. About 150 people are candidates to be among the 12 jurors or six alternates in the case. The process of whittling down this pool began Monday morning in a Chicago courtroom, and by mid-afternoon, nine jurors had been selected while several others had been excused for hardship reasons. Judge Charles Burns has said he hopes to have the jury finalized by Wednesday. Then there will be a break, with the opening statements in the case set for April 23. The judge has told the would-be jurors that he expects the trial to last three to four weeks. Balfour was detained for questioning the day after the victims were found at the Chicago home. Authorities at the time said that they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation, but he ended up being indicted for murder two months later. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyer has said in court there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered three people in rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother, Darnell Donerson. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Hudson, who is on the witness list, is expected to attend the upcoming trial. Her career has continued to blossom and remain varied since her relatives' deaths. Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight, being cast to play Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie in an upcoming movie, releasing a new album and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy awards in February.

"(CNN) -- Ozzie Guillen's remarks on Fidel Castro may be constitutionally protected, but he has learned there is nothing shielding him from the ire of Miami's large Cuban community. His comment to Time magazine that he loves Fidel Castro and later comment that he ""respects"" him rankled the Cuban-American community in Miami, home to the baseball team Guillen manages, the Marlins. The team's stadium is located in the area of the city known as Little Havana. The reaction by the team was swift -- a five-game suspension. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig supported the move. ""Mr. Guillen's remarks, which were offensive to an important part of the Miami community and others throughout the world, have no place in our game,"" he said Tuesday. And the reaction by some in the Cuban-American community has been even stronger. According to local media, one anti-Castro organization, Vigilia Mambisa, called for a boycott of the Marlins and began picketing the baseball stadium Tuesday. The fallout may cost Guillen the trust of Miami fans. ""There is absolutely nothing not protected by the First Amendment that he said,"" Florida International University Professor Howard M. Wasserman said. It was an example of political speech, pure and simple. But free speech can have is consequences, as Guillen is learning. ""The problem is, he's in Miami,"" Wasserman said. Miami's Cuban community is made up of a large number of exiles who fled the Castro regime and who strongly lobby in support of the U.S. embargo against Cuba and other anti-Castro measures. Cuba's current president is Fidel's brother, Raul Castro. In another city, Guillen's comments may not have been as controversial, but in Miami, there is a unique sensitivity to Castro, Wasserman said. ""I think it's kind of silly, but it's where he happens to be,"" he said. If the government had suspended an public employee for political speech, it would be illegal, he said. But the Marlins, as a private entity, can mete out punishment as they see fit, especially when it offends a segment of their fan base. The Marlins have a need and interest to protect their market, and, in fact, are using their own free speech interest in handing down the suspension, the law professor said. Marlins fans on social media came out on both sides of the debate. Guillen apologized Tuesday in Spanish at a news conference, saying his words were misconstrued and that he finds Castro's human rights record odious. But for Cuban and Cuban-American fans, the damage was done. Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald eloquently summed up the emotions that Guillen's comments stirred. ""There are people in South Florida who are angry with Guillen because he struck an emotional and painful nerve. I am unapologetically one of those people because the communist dictator Guillen apparently loves broke my family,"" he wrote in a column. Salguero said he would prefer to see an indefinite suspension for the manager. Other Marlins fans, even if they disagreed with Guillen's remarks, didn't like the way the suspension was handled. Frank Ramirez, a longtime fan, said that Miami ""is the last place you want to say something like that."" Still, he drew a distinction between the ball club suspending Guillen for what he said, rather than acting in response to fan outcries. To suspend Guillen for the content of what he said -- no matter how wrongheaded -- comes across as a violation of his right to free speech, Ramirez said. But if the club instead reacted to business interests such as fear of a boycott or financial loss, then a punitive action is justified. And the action that fans clamor for, Ramirez said, might be more stringent that the five-game suspension. ""I don't think Marlins fans will forgive him for this,"" he said.","Ozzie Guillen's comments are protected by the First Amendment .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hollywood uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer is famous for his almost uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie. Sixth sense: Hollywood action king Jerry Bruckheimer is famous for his uncanny ability to recognize a potential hit movie. Once described as ""the man with the golden gut,"" Bruckheimer's movies have earned more than $15 billion in box office, fueled by a potent mix of fast-moving action, big bangs and even bigger stars. Over the span of almost four decades, Tinseltown's reigning king of action has credits including, 1980s classics ""Top Gun"" and ""Flashdance,"" high-octane action movies ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"" in the 1990s, and most-famously the wildly successful ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise starring Johnny Depp. That ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" Bruckheimer's latest movie, which stars Isla Fisher, has absolutely no explosions, not a car chase in sight and includes gratuitous references shopping and designer high heels should signal to everyone that chick flicks have well and truly arrived. ""The Screening Room"" caught up with Bruckheimer to ask him about the growing power of the female cinema audience, taking risks and his ability to spot movie gold. TSR: You're thought of as the Hollywood action king. Do you think the fact that you're moving into chick flicks with ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" is a sign that Hollywood is taking the female audience more seriously? Jerry Bruckheimer: I think we've always taken the female audience very seriously, but with the success of ""Sex and the City"" and a number of other movies ... we know that there's a big female audience out there, we just need to figure out the films that they really want to go see. Which is hard, you don't really know. Hopefully, they'd want to go and see ""Confessions of a Shopaholic."" Watch Jerry Bruckheimer, director P.J. Hogan and star Isla Fisher talk about ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" TSR: How do you know that a film is going to be a hit? With films like, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Top Gun"" you resurrected genres that were dead. Is it instinct or experience? JB: I think it's just films that I really want to go and see. I really don't know what's going to make a picture successful. I know what a good drama is, and what good characters are, and that you should populate your film with good characters. It's all about what audiences will be captivated by. I really don't know. I just know what I like. TSR: You're one of the most successful producers in Hollywood. What does it take to be a great producer? JB: I love movies and I love making movies. It's not about the money, it's about can you make a good film? can you entertain an audience and do you have good taste in casting and are you a good storyteller? It's all about story-telling. The better the story, the more popular the characters, the bigger your chance is of having a successful film. TSR: And how about taking risks? Do you need to take risks? JB: Well, I do take enormous risks. Making a pirate movie and movies like ""Top Gun,"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" with African-American actors in it when that wasn't in vogue. You know, I do it everyday. TSR: How does it affect you? JB: When they are a success, it makes you feel good. But not all films can be successes, so you've to roll with the punches and just get back up and start all over again. TSR: How has the current economic crisis affected your work? JB: Well, it affects everybody. You know, budgets are tighter and stocks are down a lot for companies. But box-office fortunately for the movie business has been up. Advertisers aren't spending as much on TV, which is not good for television products, but movies are still cheap entertainment. When people can't go away and take vacations, they always can spend a few bucks and go to a movie. TSR: Remakes of 1980s films seem to be becoming more popular -- especially horror remakes. Any thoughts on remaking some of your old films from that era like, maybe, ""Top Gun""? JB: Not yet, but you never know. I mean ""Top Gun"" was one that was a one-off it's hard to remake that or make it a different way. TSR: Do you think long-form TV, shows like ""The Sopranos"" or ""The Wire"" with hour-long episodes and high production values have stolen audiences from the movies? JB: Not at all. I think people still want to get out of their house. I mean you have a kitchen in your house I assume and you do go out to eat, right? It's the same thing. We have TVs in our homes and we watch television and we go on computers and if there's something we want to see [at the movies] we are still going to go out because it's an experience. TSR: And finally, I have to ask you, are there any plans with Johnny Depp to make another ""Pirates of the Caribbean""? JB: Yeah, we are talking about making another one. We have Johnny certainly interested and we have him interested in another one of our projects called ""The Lone Ranger"" so that's two films that we hope to make with him.","Hollywood uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer is famous for his ability to predict hits .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A demonstrator died and several U.S. service members and Afghan police were injured as protests over the burning of Qurans at a U.S. military base turned violent Sunday, said officials. The bloodshed in northern Kunduz province came a day after a gunman killed two U.S. military officers inside their office in the highly secured Afghanistan Ministry of Interior -- one of several incidents targeting allied forces after reports emerged last week that NATO troops had burned Muslim holy books at Bagram Airfield. U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama, have apologized for the burning and called it inadvertent. A military official -- speaking on condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the issue -- said the materials were from a detainee center's library and had ""inscriptions"" that appeared to be used to ""facilitate extremist communications."" Such statements, or explanations, haven't stopped protests from Muslims in Afghanistan, who believe the Quran is the word of God and so holy that people should wash their hands before even touching it. On Sunday, the sixth day of protests, initially peaceful demonstrators in Kunduz attacked a police chief's office and a U.S. military base, Kunduz police spokesman Sayed Sarwar Hussaini said. Some threw hand grenades at the base, known as Combat Outpost Fortitude, with resulting blasts injuring seven U.S. personnel believed to be Special Forces members, said Hussaini. Capt. David Yaryar, a spokesman with NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said there was an explosion and small arms fire. ISAF did not comment on the number or positions of those hurt, though Yaryar did say those hurt were evacuated for medical care. One protester was killed and three wounded in the violence at the military site, according to Hussaini. Another 16 protesters suffered injuries as grenades, pistols, knives, sticks and stones were used to attack the police chief's office in Kunduz, said Hussaini, the police spokesman. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN on Sunday that such unrest and targeting of Americans has gotten ""out of hand and needs to stop."" She urged Afghans to abide by the call of their president, Hamid Karzai, for calm. In a televised address, Karzai said the ""emotions of our people"" over the burned Qurans ""are legitimate and valuable."" Still, he added that staying calm will help stop ""enemies of our peace and stability"" from taking advantage and harming people and property. U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Ryan Crocker, acknowledged ""some tough attacks up north"" in a CNN interview Sunday, while adding that the ""rest of the country ... was pretty calm today."" ""(Such anger generally) tapers off, and I think we're all hopeful that the appeal for calm that President Karzai made today -- and he did so with the backing of the entire political leadership of the country -- will create a condition in which this diminishes,"" said Crocker. At least 29 people have been killed and nearly 200 wounded in recent protests, Karzai said. The death of the demonstrator in Kunduz would appear to raise that death toll to 30. They haven't been the only ones killed in the wake of the Quran burnings. Two U.S. soldiers were gunned down last week at a base in eastern Afghanistan by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. And then, on Saturday, a man went to the Afghan interior ministry, signed himself in and then retrieved his gun, according to an Afghan counter-terrorism official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with the media about the incident. ISAF said that initial reports indicated ""an individual"" -- whom they did not name -- shot dead two NATO service members, later confirmed by an Afghan police official to be an American colonel and major. The Defense Department on Sunday identified one of the officers killed as U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. John D. Loftis, 44, of Paducah, Kentucky. Loftis was 44. The Afghan official identified the suspected gunman as Abdul Saboor, a junior officer in the ministry's intelligence department who the official claimed had spent two months in a Pakistani religious school. ""We believe it was 100% linked to the Quran burning because of the religious background of this junior officer,"" the counter-terrorism official said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, with its spokesman identifying the shooter by the same first name, Abdul, that the Afghan official used. The Afghan official did not say, though, if it was known the gunman was a member of the Taliban. The Afghan interior ministry confirmed the gunman is thought to be one of its employees and that his ""whereabouts are unknown."" Senior Afghan officials, including the defense and interior ministers, have postponed a scheduled trip to Washington to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and others, Pentagon press secretary George Little said. ""(The officials) are consulting this week with others in the Afghan government and Afghan religious leaders on how to protect ISAF personnel and quell violence in the country,"" said Little. Saturday's killing prompted Gen. John Allen -- the commander of ISAF -- to order the withdrawal of several hundred ISAF advisers from ministries in Kabul as a precaution. Such a move raises questions about a U.S. military plan focusing on the use of small teams of military advisers as it withdraws troops. Yet Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, stressed the advisers are still in contact with Afghan personnel. ""We will not let this incident divide the coalition,"" Cummings said. The United States also pulled embedded civilians out of ministries, said Crocker. And France announced Sunday that it was withdrawing all French public officials in Afghan institutions temporarily to ensure their safety. Amid the protests, ISAF said Sunday that its efforts against the Taliban continue to move forward. In fact, Afghan and coalition security forces captured Taliban leaders in the provinces of Kandahar and Ghazni, ISAF announced Sunday. So too was a commander with the insurgent Haqqani network, in his case in Logar province. Crocker highlighted the progress that's been made in Afghanistan since the U.S. embassy opened more than a decade ago with ""nothing -- no institutions, no ministries, no police, no army."" Still, he stressed that the stakes remain high in calling for a continued commitment to the country. ""If we decide we're tired of it, al Qaeda and the Taliban certainly aren't,"" said Crocker.

"Dadaab, Kenya (CNN)  -- In the middle of a famine, there is a place that houses the sickest survivors of all. Along the border between Somalia and Kenya at the International Rescue Committee hospital it is simply called a stabilization center. As a medical term, it refers to the desire to normalize vital signs, replace fluids and treat acute and deadly illness. As you might imagine, however, this place is far from stable, and instead filled with people who are starving to death -- in some cases, their bodies too far gone to even absorb the food finally made available to them. I met 6-year-old Ahmed Mohammad there. As soon as he entered Dadaab refugee camp with his father after 10 days of walking under the East African sun, it was clear his tiny prone body may have been robbed of nutrition for too long. Impact Your World: How you can help . As Dr. Humphrey Musyoka told me, ""He is half the size he should be -- a couple more weeks, and this child would've been lost."" Musyoka knows, because over the last few months, he has seen it happen more times than he cares to remember. There is no way to dignify the description of death by starvation. It is neither quick nor painless. Not too long after the food is cut off, the body resorts to fuel reserves in the liver and fatty tissues. Once the fat is all gone, and the person is a skeleton of what he or she once was, the body searches for protein, and finds it in muscle tissue. Even the muscle of the heart is consumed, leaving someone drained and listless. The body shuts down. The pulse, the blood pressure and body temperature all precipitously drop. Little kids such as Ahmed completely stop growing and become stunted in time. The tools they use here in the stabilization center are rudimentary, and they have little choice -- but they work. A small tape measure is used to measure the child's mid-upper arm circumference or MUAC. It takes just seconds and is predictive of how much deep fat still exists in the body, a key criterion when assessing starvation. In children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, a healthy MUAC is considered to be above 13.5 centimeters, and if it is less than 11.5 centimeters, nearly one in five die. They simply cannot be saved. Ahmed had his MUAC measured in the stabilization center -- 10.5 centimeters. Musyoka shook his head worriedly and immediately started a plan to save Ahmed. An IV was placed, and fluids were started slowly. Too much fluid could overwhelm his system. The same could be said of many foods, which may cause severe diarrhea or vomiting. Ahmed will be given Plumpy'nut, a paste that has a balance of protein, carbohydrates and fat, along with vitamins and minerals. The key is to give a lot of calories in small amounts because Ahmed's stomach is so shrunken from his malnutrition. Ahmed would have his blood drawn to check for anemia and possible bacterial infections. Musyoka said he is cautiously optimistic about Ahmed, but he carries a lot of anguish over what he has seen this summer. ""I have a 5-year-old boy at home,"" he told me as his eyes welled up. I shook his hand, looked him in the eye and said, ""Give him an extra tight hug tonight."" He nodded and said, ""You too."" My thoughts turned to my own three little girls, who are always in my heart. I will, doctor, I said. I will. Watch Sanjay Gupta MD Saturday and Sunday at 7:30am ET.

"(CNN) -- The financial world is in an uproar about the New York Times opinion piece by Greg Smith, a former vice president in Goldman Sachs' equity derivatives business. As a former vice president in Goldman Sachs' equity derivatives business who also made it into The Times when I quit, I can't help but feel a bit upstaged. Part of my resentment comes from the fact that Smith is being touted as a high-level defector from the notoriously secretive ranks of Goldman Sachs. But calling Smith a senior Goldman executive, as many media outlets do, misunderstands the nature of titles at investment banks. Smith was an ""executive director and head of the firm's United States equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa,"" which certainly sounds fancy. But, as the firm took pains to point out in response to the article, there are 12,000 employees with the title of ""vice president"" (in the U.S.) or its international equivalent, ""executive director."" As for being head of that particular business, well, pretty much everyone at any investment bank is the head of some business or another. Clients prefer to deal with the head of a business, so senior bankers are practiced in introducing even their most junior colleagues as the head of something or other. My own semi-official titles -- among others, ""vice president and head of the equity derivatives business for the North American energy industry"" -- were as impressive as Smith's, but what I rarely mentioned was that that business consisted of me and one junior analyst. Smith's business lacked even the analyst! More important, though, it is a mistake to read Smith's piece as a scandalous revelation of the decline of Wall Street culture. Goldman exec quits, calling firm 'toxic' Yes, there was once a time when big investment banks made most of their money by advising clients on mergers and capital raising, rather than by trading with clients. And yes, those times are long gone. But they were long gone when Smith started. And he was in the derivatives sales business, which has always and necessarily been a business in which Goldman is on one side of a trade and its clients -- or, in the more neutral term popular in such businesses, ""customers"" -- are on the other. Each dollar that Goldman makes comes directly out of its client's pockets. Of course, Smith's clients, who included some of the largest hedge funds and asset managers in the world, knew this. They did not come to Smith for impartial advice about their personal and professional problems. Rather they came to him to execute trades at attractive prices and for trade ideas, ideas that they hoped would make them money but that they certainly expected would make Goldman money. Thus, worries that clients will flee Goldman are overblown. Goldman's clients know that the firm is trying to make money off of them -- and they know that every other bank is trying to do the exact same thing. They are not looking for charity. They are looking for good ideas and good execution, and the bank that provides those benefits will continue to get business. One question on everyone's mind is: Why now? March is a customary time to quit, since Smith's 2011 bonus check will have cleared, but why did it take him 12 years to figure out that Goldman's culture was rotten? After all, Matt Taibbi and the SEC have been saying similar things for years. One possible answer is that Smith is part of a broader exodus. The past year has seen many departures by Goldman Sachs partners, including Smith's boss' boss' boss' bosses, David Heller and Ed Eisler. Those career traders are unlikely to have left because they felt sad for clients. Instead, the widespread speculation is that they left because the money isn't good enough. Average pay at Goldman was down 15% in 2011, albeit to a still-healthy $367,000 per employee. Stricter regulations on proprietary trading and higher capital requirements will probably reduce profitability -- and pay -- for years to come. Investment banking and trading are difficult businesses; bankers work long hours, travel frequently and are under intense pressure. Smith is hardly the first banker to worry about whether his work makes the world a better place. Working at an investment bank involves trading off those negatives -- stress, hours and a nagging sense of unfulfilled purpose -- against the positive aspects of the job, which can be loosely summarized as ""huge paychecks."" When that balance changes, a good trader re-evaluates his position. Expect to see more departures from Goldman and its peer firms in the coming months. But don't take too seriously the idea that they're leaving because they're sick of making money off of clients. More likely, they're leaving because they're sick of not making as much money off of clients as they used to.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban claimed responsibility Tuesday for two suicide attacks on government facilities in Afghanistan that killed at least 18 people and wounded 27 others. Many of the dead were police officers. The first attack took place outside the police district administrator's office in the Guzara district of western Herat province when three suicide bombers in an SUV tried to enter the compound, according to Saeed Agha Saqib, the provincial police chief. The bombers detonated their explosives when security forces wouldn't let them through. The blast killed 14 people, including three police officers, and wounded 22 others, Saqib said. In southern Helmand province, a trio of suicide bombers attacked the office of the police chief of Musa Qala district, according to Dawood Ahmadi, a spokesman for Helmand's governor. Two of the bombers were able to blow themselves up. The third was killed by police. That attack killed four police officers and wounded five people, including the police chief, Ahmadi said. The Taliban said they were responsible for both attacks through a phone message to the media. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","The Taliban claim responsibility in a phone message to media .

"(CNN) -- Rick Santorum is emerging as a tragic hero of American conservatism: so much potential, such bad luck. His victories Tuesday night demonstrate what might have happened if the Republican Right had coalesced around him for the past month instead of the hyperbolic Newt Gingrich. But a counting error in Iowa delayed his momentum, and it's only now that the Republicans are realizing just how good a candidate he can be. Unlike Gingrich, Santorum is more than just an anti-Romney vote. People actually seem to like him, and it might have something to do with those nostalgic sweater vests that he wears. Combined with his old school moralism, he sometimes comes off like a sitcom dad of the ""No long-haired hippie is gonna date my daughter!"" variety. While Romney's victory speeches are polished tedium, Santorum's sound like they're being shouted angrily at a terrified prom date running for his life down the asphalt drive. Beyond the great visuals, Santorum is also very good at articulating how conservatives feel about things. Mitt Romney's rhetoric is full of sunbeams and star-spangled banners; the coziness of his brand is epitomized by the fact that 2% of Americans think his first name is Mittens. In contrast, Santorum's voice quivers with a righteous anger that is more appropriate to this political season. Most conservatives don't see the economic issues framing this election as being purely about economics. They see a cultural dimension to Obamanomics that poses a challenge to their way of life -- and Santorum taps into that. He's done a great job of exploiting the administration's attempt to require Catholic organizations to provide contraception coverage to their employees, ratcheting up the rhetoric and calling the president a latter-day Big Brother. His charge that Romney likewise mandated Catholic hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims exploits Republican suspicions that Romneycare and Obamacare are interchangeable. It's notable that Santorum's breakthrough has come in the GOP Midwest heartland. He's made a case that Romney is a Republican In Name Only, and many people are buying it. The mix of fury and folksy is working wonders for Santorum this week, but can he take it all the way to the convention? Probably not. Tuesday's contests gave him no delegates and were won under special circumstances. Newt Gingrich wasn't even on the ballot in Missouri, and it helped that Gingrich and Romney put all their resources into South Carolina and Florida, which allowed Santorum to focus exclusively on Tuesday's caucuses and manufacture a little momentum on the sly. Even with these wins under his belt, Santorum will struggle to catch Romney. The two big primaries left this month are Arizona and Michigan, states that heavily favor Mittens. Santorum is rising fast in national polls (up 5% in a few days, according to Reuters) but is still in fourth place. His bigger problem is that consensus rests with Gingrich being the heavyweight anti-Romney candidate. Santorum has to overcome a fear about splitting the conservative vote if he is to emerge as the right-winger du jour. All this amounts to Santorum being the ""coulda-shoulda-woulda"" candidate of 2012. If only his victory in Iowa had been reported accurately, he might have had bigger momentum going in to New Hampshire and South Carolina. And if only conservatives had coalesced around him rather than Gingrich, he would be the front-runner. And if only Republicans voted on the basis of what they believe in rather than what they think is electable ... The possibilities are fascinating but will probably be largely academic.

"(CNN) -- A small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator at Southern California's San Onofre nuclear power plant during a water leak, but there was no threat to public health, federal regulators said Wednesday. Operators shut down the plant's No. 3 reactor on Tuesday after the water leak was discovered, Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Victor Dricks said. The gas was vented from the steam generator into an auxiliary building, where it triggered a radiation monitor, he said. The amount of gas that leaked was not immediately known, but it was a small amount that won't endanger the public or plant workers, Dricks said. He said the water leak was about six-hundredths of a gallon per minute, far below the levels required to declare an ""unusual event"" -- the lowest of four NRC alert levels. NRC inspectors will conduct a follow-up review of the incident, Dricks said. The plant's owner, Southern California Edison, reported the problem Tuesday, but had no new comment on Wednesday. The water leak occurred in the thousands of tubes that carry heated water from the reactor core through the steam generator, a 65-foot-tall, 640-ton piece of equipment that boils water used to drive the unit's turbines. Though leaking tubes periodically occur in older units, Dricks said, Southern California Edison replaced the steam generators at San Onofre between 2009 and 2011. CNN's Karan Olson and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","A small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator, the NRC says .

"(CNN) -- The pepper-spraying of student protesters at the University of California-Davis was an ""objectively unreasonable"" use of force by campus police, a state review of the incident concluded Wednesday. Scenes of UC-Davis police Lt. John Pike spraying seated demonstrators with the irritant at near point-blank range went viral on the Internet and triggered widespread criticism of school authorities. A 190-page report by a University of California task force concluded that the incident ""should and could have been prevented."" The report spreads blame for the events that led to the confrontation across several members of the UC-Davis leadership but said Pike was primarily responsible for the ""objectively unreasonable decision"" to pepper-spray the demonstrators. ""On balance, the evidence does not provide an objective, factual basis for Lt. Pike's purported belief that he was trapped, that any of his officers were trapped, or that the safety of their arrestees was at issue,"" the report states. ""Further, there is little evidence that any protesters attempted to use violence against the police."" But while criticizing Pike, the report also cites ""systemic and repeated failures"" among campus administrators it said ""put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves."" UC-Davis Campus Police Chief Annette Spicuzza has been on administrative leave since November, along with Pike and another officer who has not been identified. Neither Pike nor Spicuzza agreed to be interviewed for the investigation, largely conducted by an outside risk-management firm, the report notes -- but Pike provided ""a lengthy statement"" to the firm. University administrators were worried that nonstudents from the Occupy movement in the city of Davis and other California cities would take part in the on-campus encampment that student demonstrators had set up. But they failed to determine whether that was true or whether ""other reasonable alternatives"" should have been used to ensure security before sending in police to break up the encampment, the report found. The scope of the police operation was ""ineffectively communicated,"" the report found. UC-Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi apparently believed that no force would be used, while the police operations plan called the use of force ""highly likely in this type of situation based on past events."" The report found the campus police command structure ""very dysfunctional,"" with Spicuzza's lieutenants refusing to follow orders and getting into ""heated exchanges"" with the chief during the protests. Pike became an object of scorn after the protest. Pranksters across the Internet inserted the image of the helmeted officer into famous paintings, photos and movie scenes, while the hacker's collective Anonymous published his home and cell phone numbers online. Attempts to contact him for comment were unsuccessful Wednesday evening. The report accuses him not only of using unreasonable force, but of misusing his now-iconic weapon. The type of pepper-spray canister he carried was ""not an authorized weapon"" under campus police guidelines, and the officers ""were not trained in how to use it correctly,"" the report found. ""And Lt. Pike did not use it correctly,"" the report notes. The model he carried ""is a higher pressure type of pepper spray than what officers normally carry on their utility belts,"" and is designed to be used at distances of six feet or more.","NEW: The report criticizes ""systemic and repeated failures"" by UC-Davis leaders .

"(CNN) -- The Utah Supreme Court has reversed Warren Steed Jeffs' two convictions on charges of rape as an accomplice and ordered a new trial, saying that instructions given to jurors were erroneous. Jeffs, the ""prophet"" of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or FLDS, was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life after he was convicted in September 2007. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. ""We regret the effect our opinion today may have on the victim of the underlying crime, to whom we do not wish to cause additional pain,"" the court said. ""However, we must ensure that the laws are applied evenly and appropriately, in this case as in every case."" In Jeffs' trial, Elissa Wall testified that she repeatedly told him at the time that she did not want to be married and was uncomfortable with sexual advances from her husband, Allen Steed. She said Jeffs advised her to pray and submit to her husband, learn to love him and bear his children, or risk losing her ""eternal salvation."" Wall was 21 at the time of Jeffs' conviction in 2007. Her attorneys made her name public at the end of the trial, with her consent. She is married to someone else and has left the FLDS. The first count of rape as an accomplice against Jeffs was alleged to have occurred shortly after Wall and Steed were married, when the two first had sex, the Utah Supreme Court opinion said. The second was alleged to have occurred after Jeffs refused to ""release"" Wall from her marriage and told her to ""give herself to [Steed] ... mind, body and soul."" Prosecutors relied on three separate portions of the law defining the circumstances under which sex is non-consensual, the opinion said. Under those portions, the victim must express a lack of consent through words or conduct, the victim must be younger than 18 years, and ""the actor"" must be in a position of special trust in relation to the victim. ""Jeffs argues that the instruction erroneously focused the jury on Jeffs' actions and position of special trust, rather than on Steed's, for the purpose of determining whether Wall consented,"" the opinion said. The justices agreed, saying the jurors should have been asked to consider whether Steed was in a position of special trust and whether Steed lured or induced Wall into having sex. ""The state interprets the term 'actor' to mean the 'defendant,' "" the opinion said. ""We conclude that the state's interpretation is erroneous."" ""We're thrilled,"" said Jeffs' defense attorney, Wally Bugden. ""We're overjoyed. We're ecstatic that the Supreme Court agreed with us. ... The state just had the wrong legal theory."" Jeffs is ""an unpopular religious figure in our state,"" Bugden said, and the media have ""had a field day portraying him as an evil, horrible, pernicious individual."" The court, he said, was able to put that aside and base its decision on the evidence and legal theories, not on emotion, and determine that the erroneous instructions led jurors to ""an erroneous result."" The defense has always maintained that marrying someone, encouraging them to make their marriage work and ""be fruitful and multiply ... that is not the same thing as saying to a husband, 'I'm encouraging you to rape your wife,' "" Bugden said. He said he had not had a chance to speak to Jeffs but planned to do so Tuesday afternoon. Assistant Utah Attorney General Laura Dupaix told CNN affiliate KSTU that the opinion is ""going to make it difficult, I think, for us to do future prosecutions in cases where some of these men in positions of power -- almost complete power, like Warren Jeffs is -- to prosecute them for forcing young girls into these marriages. I think that's really the part of this opinion that is most disappointing for us."" The justices sent the case back to the lower court for a new trial. The state has 14 days to request a rehearing with the Utah Supreme Court, said Nancy Volmer, spokeswoman for Utah state courts. The justices would then grant or deny that petition. If a request is not made, the case will be sent back to the trial court within 30 days, and the lower District Court then has 30 days to schedule a hearing. Jeffs is being held at the Utah State Prison in Draper, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. The issue of whether he should be released pending a new trial would be addressed at the District Court hearing, Volmer said. However, Bugden said, Jeffs will be transferred back to Washington County in southern Utah, where he was convicted -- and closer to the FLDS community. ""We will be asking for bail,"" he said. But Jeffs has a federal indictment against him for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Utah. The indictment states Jeffs traveled across state lines in 2006 to avoid prosecution. ""There are federal detainers in place with the Utah State Prison and Washington County,"" Rydalch said. ""Although his attorney is saying he will ask for a bail hearing in the Utah state court, our federal detainers are in place."" Rydalch added if Jeffs is not held on state charges, authorities will bring him into federal custody. Bugden said he expects Washington County prosecutors to decide quickly whether they want to proceed with the case. Jeffs had been awaiting trial in Arizona on four charges of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor. But last month, a judge dismissed those charges. Matt Smith, the Mohave County, Arizona, prosecutor, had asked the court to throw out the charges, citing ""much more serious charges"" against Jeffs in Texas and the desire of his alleged victims that he ""face these more serious charges as soon as possible."" Jeffs was indicted in Texas in 2008 on a felony charge of sexual assault of a child. An indictment accuses Jeffs of assaulting a child ""younger than 17 years of age and not legally married to the defendant"" in January 2005. If convicted on the Texas charges, Jeffs could face a maximum penalty of five to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of $10,000. The FLDS drew national attention when Jeffs was arrested during a routine traffic stop in August 2006. At the time, he was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. The sect is a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church. Its members openly practice polygamy at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, and in two towns straddling the Utah-Arizona state line: Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place. Jeffs had led the sect since his father's death in 2002.","NEW: U.S. Attorneys' Office in Utah says it has federal detainers in place for Jeffs .

"(CNN) -- Xavi Hernandez has signed an extended deal with Barcelona that will keep him at the Camp Nou for the rest of his career, the Spanish club have announced. The midfielder's new contract will be triggered if he plays in over half of Barcelona's games in the final two years of his current deal. Should he hit all the club's targets he will be at Barcelona until 2016, when he'll be 36. Xavi is currently preparing for the World Cup with Spain. Young winger Pedro Rodriguez has also signed a new deal until 2015, with an improved salary and a new release fee of $108 million. Xavi told Barcelona's official Web site: ""I want to hang up my boots here. I wanted to know that I'm not going anywhere. ""I'm very grateful to president [Joan] Laporta and director of sport Txiki Begiristain because they listened to me. It's what I want. I'm a big Barca fan and I'm very happy. ""I've been involved with Barca all my life, coming up through the ranks, and I'd like to hang up my boots here. My only objective is to retire here."" Club president Joan Laporta said: ""It's great news for the club. Xavi's story is a really nice one. A boy who played in the youth teams and made his first team debut when he was 18. ""We should be grateful to Xavi. From the moment he became one of the captains of the team, with players like Puyol, Iniesta, Valdés, Messi and Piqué, he has shown the personal and sporting profile which proves that the youth academy has triumphed."" Pedro has already won seven trophies at Barcelona after making his debut for the club in 2008 and scored 23 goals in all competitions last season. The 22-year-old told the official Web site he was delighted with his improved contract: ""I'm very happy. I'd like to thank the board for the support they have given me.

"(CNN) -- Sharing is a wonderful thing -- when executed correctly. It's super fun to share hugs (when they are wanted, it's important to note), delicious desserts and interesting, thought-provoking books but not so fun to share colds, STDs and/or upsetting, possibly dangerous secrets. Some genres of sharing, however, are a little less black and white. For example: When is it OK to share something rad I just found online? Am I being helpful by passing along/posting said tidbit, or am I slowly morphing into my addled mother, clogging my friends' inboxes with poems about Jesus, kitten GIFs and, if Mama has a dark side, chain letters promising certain death if not passed along to 200 people within the hour? (We wish Mom were still active. ... That was the only weapon in our arsenal.) It's hard to tell in this expansive world wide web of ours, but certain tipoffs can be telling: 1. Does anyone respond when you post your new favorite ukulele cover to Facebook? 2. When you whine about the declining quality of model-train-collecting literature on Twitter, do you score any retweets? 3. Have you enjoyed any real, substantial human interaction in the past month or so? If you answered ""No"" to any of these questions, you might be putting your precious pearls before swine. (And if you answered ""No"" to number three, you might want to go outside. Maybe say ""hi"" to the mailman). In order to reap the praise you so certainly deserve for your expert curating abilities, might we recommend hitting up one of these three social sharing networks instead of appealing to the masses -- you know, before your digital face becomes one that only a mother could love. 1.

Fret not, dear Abby, there are kindred spirits out there, just waiting to ooh and ahh over your daisy-emblazoned babies. Where? Well, on Pinterest, of course! If you haven't heard of Pinterest -- locked away in your cave of mothballs and yarn -- it's a 2-year-old social bookmarking site. Users can create online idea boards of sorts, all centered around categories like art, home decor, technology and more. Boards are themed (""Cat Wedding Ideas,"" ""My Favorite Whiskey Drinks,"" ""Tattoos To Get On My Forehead"" ...) and populated with media collected during one's online travels. The best part of the service, however, is that ""social"" factor: You can follow friends (from Facebook and Twitter) and other users who share your interests, as well as ""re-pin"", ""Like"" and comment on posts that tickle your fancy. Finally, dear Abby, you'll get the respect you deserve for that trove of thimble snaps you've been hoarding on your hard drive! And no, you don't have to like antique thimbles to join Pinterest. This was merely an example. 2. Chill.com . Oh, Ike, you indie-band savant! You're always so up on the latest viral videos zipping around the Web. I mean, Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" was your favorite jam BEFORE that other band covered it using one guitar, and when that vid hit the Web, you were super angry that the original tune's integrity had been jeopardized by what you deemed a ""straight-up stunt"" (you were the first one to share that video, too). Still, your friends have yet to recognize your video-finding genius -- so behind the times they are that they're just now discovering that ""Bon Joviver"" video and they STILL think Rebecca Black is funny. We pity them too, Ike, and no, we can't understand why your band, She's A Witch House (Mighty, Mighty), has yet to take off, either. We know that no one will every truly understand you, we get it, but we think you'll be able to find some kind of solace in Chill.com, a video-sharing site that's a lot like Pinterest in some respects. The site allows users to create ""Categories"" of videos and share them with other users. So, dear Ike, you can create a cache of ""Super Sell-Out"" vids or ""Songs That Think They're About Anarchy."" Or, you know, ""Videos of Dogs Sleeping In Funny Places,"" if you're so inclined. As with Pinterest, you can also follow other users, re-posting, commenting on and expressing your emotions (via a series of emoticons) about their videos. The site even has a Chat feature, so, friend Ike, you don't have to limit your rants and raves to the confines of a mere comment box. 3. This is My Jam . Oh, Sad Sarah, we know you were dumped ... mostly because Facebook tells us that you listened to ""The Cave"" by Mumford & Sons 70 times in a row on Spotify (that jam is one of the top breakup tunes, the Web tells us). You apparently didn't want to hide your shame by turning on private listening, but we, your Facebook stalkers, are kind of bummed out by your musical sad-making. Also, you obviously want Billy the Break-Up-er to know just how tortured you really are and perhaps come running into your open arms! Well, why not make more of a statement with your sad song of choice and share it via This Is My Jam, a social site that allows you to choose one tune to put on display as the object of your musical obsession for seven whole days, complete with a description of why said tune struck your fancy. Other users can follow you, so fret not: Your pain will be on full display, complete with comments and likes. Oh, and you're encouraged to pick a new tune every week, so, yeah, you have about six more days left until we're all over your tears.","Pinterest users can create online idea boards centered around art, technology and more .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- There are rock stars, and then there are Rock Stars. Eddie Van Halen is a Rock Star. Eddie Van Halen wanted to create a guitar that was practically indestructible -- at least by him. Take an incident in the summer of 2007. A security guard stopped me as I attempted to drive through the gates of Center Staging, a rehearsal studio across the street from Burbank Airport. ""That's odd,"" I thought. ""They've never had security before. I wonder what's going on?"" Pretty soon, I discovered the reason for the limited access. A black BMW convertible drove up, and a baby-faced teenager jumped out of the driver's seat. The passenger door opened, and out walked Eddie Van Halen. Everyone stopped talking and stared, including Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, who were outside taking a break from their own rehearsal. Van Halen and the other members of the band had just announced a big reunion tour with original singer David Lee Roth at a splashy news conference in Beverly Hills, and I had inadvertently discovered where they were prepping for their journey. Eddie and his son Wolfgang -- named for Mozart -- greeted a couple of people in the parking lot and quickly disappeared inside the soundstage. Moments later, the earth trembled as the loudest guitar I've ever heard in my life was fired up. It was like a sonic boom -- only the sound wasn't coming from the airport. It was coming from inside the soundstage. The legendary guitarist launched into the familiar intro to Van Halen's 1978 hit, ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love."" That was followed by ""Runnin' With the Devil."" Joss Stone ran out of her own rehearsal studio -- barefoot -- and begged a security guard for entry. She was turned away. Months later, I would catch Van Halen, the band, during their triumphant hometown concert in Los Angeles. Little did I know that during that tour, Eddie had been road-testing a series of prototype guitars he was designing with Fender. The instrument was called ""the Wolfgang,"" after his son, who's Van Halen's current bass player.  Watch Van Halen show off his new axe » . After years of wearing down metal frets and having pieces of his guitar rip off or malfunction during shows, Van Halen says he's built a guitar that even he can't destroy. On the Wolfgang, frets are fashioned of stainless steel, and metal gadgets are custom-made by a company that specializes in medical tools. Sections of wood are left unpainted so the instrument can breathe and age -- ""like a Stradivarius,"" the 54-year-old musician explains with a degree of pride. We recently caught up with Eddie at his 5150 Studio, high in the hills above Los Angeles. It's where the album ""1984"" was recorded, along with every subsequent Van Halen record. The studio sits on seven acres, just a stone's throw from the Tudor mansion he bought in 1980. He and his fiancee/publicist, Janie Liszewski, scoot around the property in golf carts. The red, white and black-striped motif of his signature Van Halen guitar is painted on the walkway. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: You've been tearing guitars apart and redesigning them all your life, haven't you? Eddie Van Halen: It kind of started when I went to a Radio Shack-type of store in Pasadena. They had a 12-string guitar hanging there, and I didn't want 12 -- I wanted six. And so I asked the guy, ""Could I take six strings off and try it?"" And the guy said, ""No, not unless you buy it."" So I borrowed the money from my parents, bought it, took six strings off and voila -- did what I wanted. The guitar -- it's on the first album cover. It's called Frankenstein. I'm always tinkering with stuff. And basically, the new Wolfgang is a combination of all the years of tearing things apart, ruining things, creating things and coming up with things that I later found out I could patent. CNN: How many guitars have you accidentally broken on stage? Van Halen: On stage? (He shrugs.) During the last show, I actually tried to break a Wolfgang, and it wouldn't break. I picked it up and I couldn't break the damn thing. I threw it up in the air, and later put it out in the rain. I picked it up half an hour later, and it was still in tune. It pissed me off. CNN: The Wolfgang sells for about $3,000. Are you worried about introducing a high-end guitar when the economy is taking such a hit? Van Halen: I just don't think that way. I'm really not a businessman, so to speak. The only reason I do it is because people are always asking me where they can get what I use. CNN: Who are some of the musicians who have asked? Van Halen: Everybody uses my stuff. They just don't like talking about it. CNN: I'm told you can hear things that most people can't with the naked ear. Van Halen: I have selective hearing. (Laughs) CNN: I think a lot of men do! Van Halen: Obviously, I've lost a little bit, at very high frequencies -- which is kind of like a woman screaming at ya. CNN: ""Ed, did you take the trash out?"" ""Can you wipe the dishes?"" Are you hearing anything? Van Halen: What was that? (Laughs) I don't know. I'm blessed with a good pair of ears. That's how I fooled my piano teacher. I'd watch his fingers and I'd listen to it, and I just kind of basically learned it by myself. I can't read music. Instead, I'd do stuff inside the piano, do harmonics and all kinds of crazy things. They used to put me in these annual piano contests down at Long Beach City College, and two years in a row, I won first prize -- out of like 5,000 kids! The judges were like, ""Very interesting interpretation!"" I thought I was playing it right. But everything is open to interpretation. Imagine if Beethoven had a tape recorder. Then you'd know exactly what he meant. Maybe he meant (singing the opening notes to the Fifth Symphony), ""Da da da da"" instead of ""Boom boom boom boom!"" Who knows. CNN: Did you ever take formal guitar lessons? Van Halen: No. That's why I do all this crazy stuff. It's not taught. CNN: Do you think you'd approach music differently if you had taken guitar lessons? Van Halen: Probably. But you only have 12 notes. Do what you want with them. CNN: What kind of music do you listen to when you're at home? Van Halen: I don't listen to anything, really. Believe it or not, I'm so slammed with ideas, and the man upstairs overloads me with stuff, so I'm always doing my own thing. CNN: How was it having Wolfie on the road with you on the last tour? He was 16 when he took over as Van Halen's bass player in 2007. Van Halen: It was a dream! That kid is truly amazing. I did name him after the right guy. (Laughs) CNN: He's still in high school. Did he have a tutor on the road? Van Halen: Yeah, he had four hours of school and then a gig at night. He worked three times harder than any of us. CNN: How was it touring with David Lee Roth after all these years? Van Halen: It was great. CNN: No smackdowns? Van Halen: No, no. Everything went great. It went smooth. CNN: Is there going to be another Van Halen tour? Van Halen: Oh, I know so. I mean, we're a band! That wasn't just a one-off thing. It's officially a band. And Wolfgang Van Halen is the bass player. Janie and I are getting married in June, and my son's going to graduate, and we'll pick it up after that. Obviously, I hope we record some new stuff. I'm writing, and just doing the same thing I always do. CNN: Is Wolfie going to be in the wedding? Van Halen: He's going to be my best man. My brother's marrying us. CNN: Oh, that's right! Alex (the drummer in Van Halen) is an ordained minister. Van Halen: Yeah. Reverend Al! (Laughs) We're going to do it right here in the backyard. Small, intimate wedding. ... We'll get a string quartet for part of it and a DJ for afterwards, although I'm not much of a dancer. CNN: Sounds like a very traditional, non-rock star-type of wedding. So many people can pick out an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but not a lot of people know who you are as a human being. Van Halen: I just consider myself slightly left-of-center. I'm not your average bear. I -- what's the word? I'm not -- normal. (Laughs) I sound like Michael Jackson. I'm not like other guys. CNN: You hate interviews, don't you? Van Halen: Well, believe it or not, I really don't have much to say -- 'cause the equipment speaks for itself. And so does the music. CNN: If I play your new Wolfgang guitar, will I sound like you? Van Halen: Why would you want to sound like anyone else? Get your own guitar. They're available!","Eddie Van Halen's newly designed guitar is the Wolfgang .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- As I raised my hands toward the ceiling and then pointed them toward my head, I had to wonder: How would the 19th-century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol feel if he knew that a bunch of foreigners were dancing the YMCA at a nightclub named after him? The iconic St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square takes on a brighter, more colorful look at night. Gogol the man is considered the father of modern Russian realism, with works such as ""Dead Souls."" Gogol the cafe-club is considered a favorite hangout for Russians and expatriates alike, perfect for meals, coffee, fruity cocktails and music 'til everyone clears out around 2:30 a.m., when Moscow's ""real"" nightclubs heat up. Since the Soviet Union fell in 1991, Russia's capital city has progressed in many ways, breaking free of old social structures while struggling to maintain its cultural heritage. The city has preserved a lot of its old beauty, boasting monuments such as St. Basil's Cathedral and gorgeous landscapes such as Tsaritsino Park. At the same time, there are Internet cafes and 24-hour bookstores, and you'd be hard-pressed to meet someone who doesn't carry a cell phone. But, as an American studying abroad at Moscow State University, I sometimes felt perplexed in this immense modern metropolis that still makes certain familiar conveniences inconvenient. In Moscow, kiosks for adding money to your cell phone seem far more common than ATMs. Even nice restaurants with $40-minimum meals -- for example, the best beef stroganoff and fried cheese balls of your life -- accept only cash, no cards. After two weeks, I never figured out where to buy a nail clipper -- but I did see Vladimir Lenin's body, perfectly preserved since 1924.  View more photos of Moscow » . At the university, I had to present a special ID card to one set of guards at the entrance, a dorm pass to another crew, and then confront a third layer of hallway-based security before arriving at my room. I also needed written approval from my floor's ""administrator"" to take luggage out of the building. Then, there's money. Moscow, or ""Moskva"" in Russian, holds the distinction of the world's most expensive city, according to Mercer's 2008 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey. Be prepared for fees from your bank and the Russian bank whenever you use an ATM. Try to stay away from touristy restaurants for meals, and do your souvenir shopping at Izmailovsky Market (Metro: Izmailovsky Park) instead of in stores. The expatriates I encountered all echoed the sentiment that Moscow is a city of constant stress. Maybe that's why I will always love most the Moscow I experienced at night. The monuments that look mildly impressive by day suddenly come to life with light against the onyx sky. You can look out over Sparrow Hills and see the endless glittering skyline, or settle down somewhere like Gogol (Metro: Tverskaya) for vodka-enhanced beverages and music from around the world. And, as long as you know ""Mozhna?"" (""May I?"") and ""Spasiba"" (""Thank you),"" it matters less that few people speak substantial English. Café Bilingua (Metro: Chistye Prudy) is another cozy place to mingle with locals and ex-pats for hours on end -- you can have your coffee in the tiny two-story book shop, or take it up to the restaurant and performance section. Another bar I liked is Etage (Metro: Pushkinskaya), right off Pushkin's Square near a large neon-light sculpture of flowers (how would the great poet feel about that?). Nightclubs dedicated to too-many-people-to-move dance floors don't start up until well after midnight. Propaganda (Metro: Lubyanka), conveniently located near the headquarters of the KGB, spins all kinds of dance music -- go on a Thursday evening for a less crowded experience. Then there's The Real McCoy (Metro: Barrikadnaya), so packed with people that merely crossing the room to stand in the bathroom line requires bumping bodies to the beat. At first we couldn't even get in because the bouncer shook his head at my Swiss friend. But, as always, it's all about who you know -- my Spanish friend's Spanish friend had VIP status, so we went as his entourage to an upscale restaurant-like room in the back.   Part of my Moscow nightlife adventures included riding on an overnight train. For my trip from St. Petersburg to Moscow, I had been told at every ticket office that only seats were available. But upon boarding at midnight, I asked a crew member if I could have a bed. Five minutes and $80 later, the fleshy man who took my ticket had locked me into a less-than-closet-sized space with him. I prepared to claw at the door with my untrimmed nails and scream. ""Close,"" he said. Then he unlocked it to demonstrate ""open."" He stepped out, gave me a stiff wave, and said, ""See you in Moskva."" I sighed and fell asleep on the child-sized mattress. Among the plethora of Moscow's unspoken rules: Do not talk in the elevators or hallways of your student dorm. Accustomed to the silence, one night I was surprised to hear the glorious sound of a Frédéric Chopin nocturne coming from behind a security guard's desk. ""Mozhna?"" I asked, pointing to the door his chair blocked. He just shrugged, so I quietly ducked behind him and pulled the handle. Behold, a secret two-story ballroom with tables and chairs and an upright piano in the corner, and a Russian student who abruptly lifted his hands from the piano keys when I sat down. We took turns playing (thus, my failed-love song ""Sad Panda"" debuted on a new continent) and, in broken but passionate  English, he told me how he wished he could sound like the Russian-American pianist Vladimir Horowitz, and said he often comes with his friend to play around 9 p.m. As if it were the end of a great Russian novel, I never heard music in that hallway again.","The preserved body of Vladimir Lenin is on display in Moscow's Red Square .

"(CNN) -- The European Commission warned Hungary Tuesday it faces legal action over controversial reforms introduced by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the move reflects its determination to see that EU law is fully respected. ""We hoped that the Hungarian authorities would make the changes necessary to guarantee respect of EU law,"" he said in a statement. ""This has not been the case so far, therefore we have decided to begin infringement proceedings."" The actions concerns three issues, he said: the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the country's data protection authority. The commission is also seeking more information in regard to the independence of the judiciary, Barroso said. Both the European Union and International Monetary Fund have said they will refuse to extend aid to Hungary, which is struggling financially, unless the government in Budapest guarantees the independence of the central bank. The organizations say they are concerned the Hungarian government will have undue influence over monetary policy. Orban is to meet Barroso in Brussels, Belgium, for talks next Tuesday, the latter said in his statement. ""Hungary is a key member of the European family,"" Barroso said. ""We do not want the shadow of doubt on respect for democratic principles and values to remain over the country any longer. The quicker that this is resolved, the better."" Infringement proceedings are a step preceding legal action, intended to enable a state to make changes to conform with EU law rather than be taken to court. Barroso wrote to Orban in December requesting the withdrawal of two recent bills related to the country's financial stability and the central bank. Orban rejected the requests. The EU then raised the prospect of taking Hungary to the European Court of Justice, Europe's highest court, over Orban's constitutional overhaul. The string of constitutional changes introduced by Orban's center-right government have generated much controversy within Hungary, where his party, Fidesz, has a dominant position in Parliament. Tens of thousands of people protested against the new constitution in Budapest earlier this month, demanding that Orban resign. The demonstration, which lasted nearly five hours, was organized by opposition parties and civil society groups who say the new constitution is anti-democratic. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed similar concerns last year, pushing Orban to commit to ""the independence of the judiciary, a free press, and governmental transparency."" The government has defended itself and blamed opposition parties for bringing the country to the brink of economic and political collapse. It says it is trying to resolve a problem spawned by the previous Socialist government. The new constitution, which took effect January 1, omits ""republic"" from Hungary's official name, and includes several paragraphs that Amnesty International says violate international human rights. The human rights organization has been critical of sections that define life as beginning at conception and marriage as being between a man and a woman. It also expressed concerns about the possibility of life imprisonment without parole, and the failure to forbid discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The demonstration earlier this month was preceded by a series of protests in 2011 against laws introduced by Hungary's populist government. Critics have said that a new media law is restrictive and that a new electoral law favors Orban's party. They have also taken aim at a law criminalizing homelessness.","NEW: The European Commission president says he wants to see EU law fully respected .

"(EW.com) -- The question of whether AMC will indeed split the final season of Breaking Bad is close to an official verdict. Emmy-winning series star Bryan Cranston says AMC will break the award-winning drama's final 16-episode season into two separate runs, as has been speculated for months. ""We're splitting it,"" says Cranston, who's currently shooting the fifth season premiere in New Mexico. ""We're going to shoot the first eight, then take a four-month production break, then the rest will air next year."" The network has not announced a premiere date for Breaking Bad, though actors on the show say the drama will return in July. AMC and Sony Pictures TV have maintained radio silence on the show's return and distribution plan. A studio spokesperson says the four-month production hiatus is ""one scenario"" that's being considered. The network wants to divide the final season so it has a strong summer drama airing this year and the next (it would also presumably allow Breaking Bad to be eligible for two award-season cycles). With Breaking Bad production under way and summer right around the corner, obviously the schedule should get firmed up soon, though AMC has shown a willingness to engage in some production brinksmanship in the past. Cranston, who's directing the upcoming April 11 episode of ABC's Modern Family, is expected to direct the ninth episode of Breaking Bad's final season (the 2013 premiere, assuming all goes according to plan). ""We pick up right where we left off,"" Cranston says of the fifth-season opener. ""We're cleaning up the pieces from last season's huge ordeal where Gus Fring was forced to meet his maker. It's not as easy as Walter thought. And as we've discovered over the years, you don't really know who Walter White is. I'm still discovering who he is and I'm trying to allow myself to be open to him going darker and darker. There's physical danger to himself and his family, plus there's the emotional danger due to his anger and hubris. It's about the evil that men do and where that takes him.""

"(CNN) -- As bloody month after bloody month goes by, the United States grows ever more committed to overthrowing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The cause is undoubtedly a just one: Avaaz, the human rights group that has been most deeply involved in the Syria crisis, reported Thursday morning that ""17 civilians were beheaded or partially beheaded by regime security forces"" outside of Baba Amro, the besieged Homs district that will likely soon fall to al-Assad's tanks, if it hasn't already. Last week, Syrian activists reported that regime soldiers had ambushed and killed 64 men fleeing Homs, dumping their bodies outside the city. And ousting al-Assad would bring strategic benefits, removing Iran's only Arab ally at a time when the Islamic Republic is on its heels, and taking out a patron of hard-line movements like Hamas and Hezbollah that oppose a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the United States has not done all it can to hasten al-Assad's exit. Syria is unquestionably a hard problem -- vastly more complicated than Libya: more ethnically diverse, with a far greater number of outside players involved. Turkey shares a long border with Syria and a fear of Kurdish nationalism; Russia sees al-Assad as its last remaining friend in the Middle East; Saudi Arabia would like to see the majority Sunnis in power; Iraq, Israel and Lebanon fear the inevitable chaos that will follow al-Assad's collapse; and, of course, Iran is deeply invested in the regime's survival. All this rightly makes U.S. policymakers queasy about getting sucked into a potential quagmire just as they are pulling out of two costly wars with little to show for it. Where advocates of military intervention see in Syria another Libya, or even a Kosovo, many see another Iraq in the making. It also means the United States has less leeway to pursue its interests (and values) unilaterally. As long as Turkey, for instance, opposes safe zones along the Syrian border, it's a no go. The man responsible for the carnage in Syria is Bashar al-Assad. Still, the Obama administration has made a number of blunders that, in hindsight, have made this problem harder to solve. Here are six: . 1. Underestimating al-Assad. To its credit, the administration was quick to recognize that al-Assad was in serious trouble. Obama was one of the first world leaders to call explicitly for al-Assad's ouster. But in doing so, was the administration too optimistic about his chances of survival, too naÃ¯ve about the depths he would go to remain in power? 2. Taking force off the table. Yes, the Pentagon is reportedly preparing ""detailed"" contingency options for U.S. military action in Syria. That's what militaries do, and it's only prudent for the United States to monitor chemical weapons sites and eavesdrop on the regime's communications. It's also a good idea for the president to have a full understanding of what his options are and the risks and costs involved. But the administration has been unwilling to make the kind of threats that could make al-Assad think twice about what he's doing. That's understandable: It's hard to make a threat credible if it's obvious to all that you aren't willing to carry it out. But earnest denunciations and multilateral conferences don't seem to be working. Why undercut your diplomacy? 3. Handwringing about al Qaeda. The U.S. intelligence community is concerned about the presence in Syria of fighters from Iraq's al Qaeda branch, who are thought to be behind a spate of bombing attacks in Damascus and Aleppo. That's a reasonable worry. But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went beyond caution this week, tarring the Syrian opposition -- which is overwhelmingly ordinary Syrians, conservative, yes, but not extremists -- with the same broad brush. ""We know al Qaeda [leader Ayman al-] Zawahiri is supporting the opposition in Syria. Are we supporting al Qaeda in Syria? Hamas is now supporting the opposition. Are we supporting Hamas in Syria?"" Clinton said. ""If you're a military planner or if you're a secretary of state and you're trying to figure out do you have the elements of an opposition that is actually viable, that we don't see."" 4. Failing to engage al-Assad's allies. If al-Assad is to fall, the pillars that prop up his regime must first be removed. Iran and Russia, both of which continue to send weapons and advice, if not more, must be convinced that a post-al-Assad Syria is something they can at least live with. Both countries have met with members of the Syrian opposition, indicating they want to explore their options. Perhaps these are merely insincere efforts to help al-Assad divide and conquer. But it's worth exploring what's real and what's not. The same goes for al-Assad's internal allies: Are we doing enough to convince senior military and security leaders that they're better off without al-Assad? 5. Ignoring China. Even if you believe the Russians will never dump al-Assad, what about the Chinese? China also vetoed the most recent U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria, in tune with its habit of standing with Russia against encroachment on the principle of state sovereignty. But Washington has made little effort to engage Beijing on this issue, or to enlist Arab oil suppliers like Saudi Arabia to lobby on the Syrian opposition's behalf. China has few tangible interests in Syria, and might be convinced that a post-al-Assad world is in its broader interest. That would leave Russia isolated and uncomfortable. 6. Focusing exclusively on the Syrian National Council. Underscoring its skittishness about the growing militarization of what is by now a civil war by any reasonable definition, the Obama administration has shied away from dealing with the Free Syrian Army's leadership in Turkey. Perhaps more is going on behind the scenes, but the United States has clearly put its energies behind the SNC. But it is unclear whether this fractious body of exiles truly represents Syrians on the ground, and its relationship with the FSA is poor. The SNC on Thursday announced it was setting up some kind of ""military bureau"" to funnel weapons to the FSA, but it's not yet clear the FSA is truly on board. The SNC has also had a hard time attracting support from minorities, who fear that al-Assad's ouster will put their communities at risk. These points are not an indictment of Obama's Syria policy. There are no good options here, only bad and worse ones. As al-Assad moves to consolidate his brutal victory in Homs and put the rebellion down once and for all, there's still time to rectify our mistakes and shape an outcome that saves lives and protects American interests. But not very much time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Blake Hounshell .","Blake Hounshell says Hom is likely to fall as Syria regime continues brutal crackdown .

CAIFA: To replace that water, registered dietitian Rebecca Scritchfield recommends stocking up on fruits and veggies, which are almost all water, and quite nutritious. SCRITCHFIELD: Some of the nutrients that you get in dairy foods, you can actually get in vegetables. For example, a lot of our leafy greens are a good source of calcium. CAIFA: Fill your cart with alternative sources of fat, instead of processed or, especially, fried foods. SCRITCHFIELD: They're so hot, so hard to digest, with all that extra fat in there. Your best sources of fat in this heat are going to be fat from seeds and nuts and avocados. CAIFA: And most people know to stay hydrated, but check the labels on flavored waters and other drinks. SCRITCHFIELD: A lot of waters are kind of ""fancified,"" and they've got artificial colors and flavors. Some can have more than a day's worth of sugar in just one bottle. CAIFA: Be sure to check the caffeine content of drinks as well. (END VIDEO) Goodbye .

Can I stick with that? CAIFA: You can stick with that in moderation, like all good things. You know, there's a lot of sugar and there's a lot of fat in some ice cream, so you don't want to eat ice cream 24/7, seven days of the week. You might want to stick with sorbet, or another option that the nutritionist gave us is some frozen fruit. Maybe sticking some watermelon or grapes in the freezer, and then take them out for a nice cool snack. AZUZ: All right, Karen Caifa.

"(CNN) -- The website WikiLeaks has begun releasing what it says are 5 million e-mails from the private intelligence company Stratfor, starting with a company ""glossary"" that features unflattering descriptions of U.S. government agencies. In a statement released early Monday in Europe (Sunday evening ET), the website promises a raft of juicy disclosures about Stratfor, a Texas-based firm that promotes itself to corporate and government clients as a source of intelligence on international affairs. The company has been targeted by hackers who have released private data about subscribers in recent months, prompting the company to offer its clients a year of paid identity-protection coverage. There was no immediate comment on the disclosures from Stratfor, and the authenticity of the documents could not be independently confirmed Sunday night. WikiLeaks, a website that facilitates the leaking of confidential information, says the documents will be released through a network of more than 25 news outlets and activist groups in the coming weeks. The first document out was titled ""The Stratfor Glossary of Useful, Baffling and Strange Intelligence Terms,"" featuring brief and sometimes humorous definitions and blunt assessments of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement. Others focused on speculation about the health of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and who was behind a suspected campaign of sabotage against Iran's nuclear program. WikiLeaks has previously published hundreds of thousands of U.S. military and State Department documents, including field reports from the Iraq and Afghanistan and embassy cables that feature the candid assessments of U.S. diplomats. A U.S. soldier, Pfc. Bradley Manning, faces a court-martial on charges that he leaked the documents to the website. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, meanwhile, is in Britain battling an extradition request from prosecutors in Sweden who want to question him about unrelated accusations of sexual assault. Assange has not been charged with a crime and denies wrongdoing.","WikiLeaks begins releasing what it says is a cache of documents from Stratfor .

"(CNN) -- Jeremy Lin, the benchwarmer-turned-star starting point guard for the New York Knicks, has powered his team to eight victories in nine games, and captured the imagination of people around the world. Who could resist this story? It's role model, underdog and the unconventional star all rolled into one. A young kid who no one thought could make it in the NBA relentlessly pursued his dream, even if this meant sitting at the end of the bench or being relegated to the farm team. Shuffled between NBA franchises, this Harvard graduate eventually got his chance on one of the biggest stages in professional sports -- Madison Square Garden -- and shined beyond imagination. The ""Linsanity"" story, as it is known in New York, thrives because it shatters all stereotypes -- an Ivy Leaguer who can play in the NBA; a scholar-athlete who is not just a token ""racial diversity"" player in a predominantly African-American league; a devout Christian, who puts God, family and team before himself in the ""all-about-me"" world of professional sports; an Asian-American in the NBA -- until Lin, virtually an oxymoron. In China today, Linsanity also reigns. You can't find a Jeremy Lin jersey on emptied store shelves (even fake ones). There are millions of microblog posts about the New York phenomenon. Many editorialists have claimed Lin as the ""pride of Zhejiang"" (Lin's grandmother's homeland in China). Others in politically incorrect terms cite Lin as evidence that ""yellow-skinned"" people can excel on the global sports stage if given the chance. Chinese state media extensively reported on ""Linsanity,"" or ""Linfengkuang,"" hailing Lin as the pride of China. Lin's performance on the court unintentionally creates a bond between the United States and Chinese people. Can his layups and intricate passing also help to improve U.S.-China relations after leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping's visit to the United States? Probably not. First, Lin is a Taiwanese-American, born and raised in Palo Alto, California, which is a bit awkward for China. Some Chinese blog posts have taken shots at their own government by saying that had Lin grown up in China, he would have ended up as an illiterate and mediocre player for the People's Liberation Army team, or by needling with the question, ""Why is the first Asian point guard in the NBA not a Chinese national?"" Second, the recent red carpet treatment of China's likely new president, Xi, in the U.S. -- and the absence of any major agreements -- shows that the future of U.S.-China relations will be difficult. Whether it is the economy (demands for China to act as a stakeholder in global economic recovery and trade fairly), security (demands for transparency on its military buildup), global affairs (complaints about China's veto of a U.N. resolution on Syria), or society (demands for better human rights in China), the U.S. list of complaints about China is long. Beijing is concerned that the new U.S. ""pivot"" to Asia is window dressing for an effort to contain China. And the Chinese government is worried about pathological U.S. overspending (with skyrocketing debts borrowed from the Chinese). Though they don't say it in polite company, Beijing's leaders see U.S. complaints as those of a declining power, looking to block China's rise rather than finding ways to solve its own internal problems. And here perhaps is Linsanity's most poignant lesson for U.S.-China relations: China treats well those who succeed, and it politely ignores all others. The recent full-armed embrace of Lin by the Chinese state media -- his Taiwan identity notwithstanding -- is not unlike China's lauding of another Chinese athlete who struck gold on her own: female tennis star Li Na. This tattooed rebel broke from the Chinese state-backed tennis system in 2008, seeking to choose her own coaches and tired of having 65% of her winnings garnished by the government. Termed by the Chinese media as ""Fly Alone,"" Li was an embarrassment to the Chinese government -- until she became the first Asian to win the French Open in 2011. After that, Chinese state media praised her as ""the Empress of French tennis"" and the ""pride of China."" What these sports stars teach us about politics is that complaining about China in hopes that it will kowtow to criticism is the wrong formula for U.S.-China relations. Competing and winning is the way to gain China's respect and cooperation. Linsanity will not tell us any more than this about U.S.-China relations, which is fine.

"(CNN) -- Troops in white gloves and camouflage carried a pair of flag-draped caskets off an Air Force transport in Delaware Monday as the bodies of two senior U.S. military officers killed inside Afghanistan's interior ministry arrived home. Air Force Lt. Col. John Loftis and Army Maj. Robert Marchanti II were gunned down Friday when an Afghan intelligence officer turned his gun on them inside the ministry, an Afghan counter-terrorism official told CNN. Loftis was a career Air Force officer, while Marchanti was a veteran of Maryland's National Guard. The jet carrying their remains landed Monday afternoon at Dover Air Force Base. Marchanti taught physical education in Baltimore County schools for 17 years before resigning to become a full-time, active-duty guardsman. His last assignment was at Carney Elementary, in Baltimore's northeastern suburbs, where kindergarten teacher Beth Avil described him as a ""gentle giant."" ""He was this big, burly guy, and here he was making these connections with these little tiny kindergarteners,"" she said. ""You might think they'd be intimidated, but they had this instant bond."" Marchanti ""loved to work with struggling learners,"" tutoring them on reading skills in the school's computer lab, Avil said. ""We had a little celebration for him before he left,"" she said. ""We had all the kindergarteners in one of the classrooms and made a book for him of him working with all the children in the computer labs, and we had them all saluting. And he just about lost it -- he had tears in his eyes."" When he left, Avil said, Marchanti told them not to worry -- he was going to a desk job. He worked as a construction planning officer in Baltimore, overseeing renovations of National Guard facilities, said Lt. Col. Charles Kohler, a National Guard spokesman. Marchanti was deployed to Afghanistan in September with a unit attached to the Army's 29th Infantry Division, serving as a ""mentor and adviser"" to Afghan national police officers, Kohler said. Both men were fathers -- the 48-year-old Marchanti had four children and a grandchild, while Loftis had two daughters, the Air Force said. Loftis, meanwhile, was part of an Air Force special operations unit and had already served one tour in Afghanistan. He was killed just days after his 44th birthday, his mother, Chris Janne, told CNN affilliate WPSD in Paducah, Kentucky. ""He lived more in 44 years than most of us will live in 80,"" Janne said. Loftis began his Air Force career as a missile officer. But he changed specialties in 2007, receiving training in Pashto -- one of Afghanistan's two major languages -- and went to Afghanistan as a public affairs officer with a NATO provincial reconstruction team, the service said. In 2009, then-Maj. Loftis was featured in a story by the Air Force News Service, which noted that he had been given the Pashto name ""Esan"" -- meaning ""The Quality of Being Generous."" He had been based at Hurlburt Field, near Fort Walton, Florida, before his last deployment. ""He was very much committed to what he was doing in Afghanistan,"" his mother said. ""He felt that the way to help the people there was to become their friends, and he trusted them."" Loftis and Marchanti were killed in a spasm of violence that followed the burning of copies of the Quran, the Islamic holy book, in what U.S. President Barack Obama has called an accident. The Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information, said investigators believe their deaths were ""100% linked to the Quran burning"" because their killer had spent two months in a Pakistani religious school. The slayings resulted in orders from the NATO command in Afghanistan to pull allied advisers from government agencies in Kabul, raising questions about U.S. plans to rely on small teams of advisers as it draws down its force after a decade at war.","Lt.

"New York (CNN) -- Firefighters continue to battle a series of brushfires raging on nearly 2,600 acres in the U.S. Northeast, which officials say were triggered by high winds and dry conditions. Parts of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have been issued warnings by the National Weather Service after a recent dry spell in the region. New York . Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for New York's Suffolk County, where a 1,000-acre blaze broke out Monday. The declaration makes the county eligible for financial assistance. ""It could have been a lot worse,"" he said. The fire began in the area surrounding the Brookhaven National Laboratory, according to County Executive Steven Bellone. The fire continued to rage into Tuesday morning and prompted Suffolk County officials to ask for the emergency declaration, he said during a news conference Tuesday. ""We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to get the fire under control before winds pick up again,"" he said. Two firefighters were released from a hospital Monday with minor injuries, and a third suffered second- and third-degree burns after winds fanned flames in a wooded area where he was working, Bellone said. The injured firefighter, who was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital, is ""doing well"" and ""in good spirits,"" he added. State officials planned water drops Tuesday from a helicopter in an attempt to control the flames, said Jerry Hauer, New York's commissioner of homeland security and emergency services. The National Guard is also on standby in the event that the fire worsens, he said. Homes in Brookhaven and Riverhead, Long Island, were evacuated Monday, and residents were still unable to return as of Tuesday morning, Bellone said. Three homes were destroyed in the fire. The Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island was also hit hard by a five-alarm fire Monday. Four firefighters suffered minor injuries while fighting the blaze, authorities said. The fire was first called in about 11 a.m. Monday, and 168 firefighters were sent to the scene. The fire was under control by around 4 a.m. Tuesday, but firefighters remained at the scene through the morning, officials said. No homes were evacuated. New Jersey . In New Jersey, a wildfire that sprawled across about 1,000 acres of rural forest at its peak had been about 75% contained as of Tuesday, according to Michael Achey, the state's Forest Fire Service spokesman. The flames were reported just after midnight Monday and spread rapidly in Tabernacle and Woodland townships in Burlington County, New Jersey. ""We had a very strong wind yesterday, and that fanned the blaze,"" Achey said. ""The conditions are a little bit better today, but they are still calling for a strong westerly wind."" Twenty-five homes are in the fire area, Achey said, but no homes were evacuated. No injuries have been reported, and the fire remains under investigation, he added. Connecticut . A 60-acre fire in Milford, Connecticut, was about 90% contained Tuesday, according to Chris Zak, a Milford Fire Department spokesman. Two buildings were evacuated, but residents were allowed back into their homes Monday night. The flames whipped through northern parts of Milford -- a wooded, marshy area with very few buildings, Zak said. No injuries were reported. He said his department is accustomed to marsh fires, but Monday's blaze was on a different scale. ""This was a fast-moving brushfire, so it's something we're not used to,"" Zak said. ""The guys did a fantastic job."" By Tuesday morning, firefighters were still at the scene. ""We're aggressively attacking it,"" Zak said. ""It's still windy out here today, so we don't want anything to flare up or rekindle."" Pennsylvania . In southeast Pennsylvania, a blaze that spread over 450 acres at its worst point was about 95% contained Tuesday, said Joe Frassetta, district forester at the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry. Firefighters from 30 different companies fought the fire, which raged in French Creek State Park in Berks County, through Monday night and into Tuesday. Residents of more than 100 homes along the border of the park were evacuated Monday. Flames came within 100 yards of several homes but did not cause any structural damage, Frassetta said. ""For this area of Pennsylvania, this is about as bad as it gets,"" he said. A second, smaller fire in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, was about 90% contained as of Tuesday. Despite several smaller overnight fires, rainfall helped keep the brush blaze in check, said Duane Hagelgans, a regional emergency management spokesman. The 30-acre fire began in a private logging area on Peter's Mountain, Hagelgans said. No homes were evacuated, but volunteer firefighters battled both the blaze and rough, mountainous terrain, which hampered efforts to contain the spreading fire. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Hagelgans said. ""The winter hurt us because its been very dry,"" he said. ""There are a lot of leaves on the ground.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Marine Corps knew of the threat posed by roadside bombs before the start of the Iraq war, yet did nothing to buy protective vehicles for troops, according to a report to be released by the Pentagon. Marines' armored Humvees are parked at a miltary camp in Fallujah, Iraq, in May 2007. Additionally, Marine leaders in 2005 decided to buy up-armored, or reinforced, Humvees instead of Mine Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles to shield troops in Iraq from mines and other explosives -- a decision that could have cost lives, according to the report obtained Tuesday by CNN. The report by the Department of Defense inspector general was requested by the Marine Corps in early 2008 after a civilian employee with the service complained that bureaucratic delays undermined the program to develop the armored vehicles. Inspectors found that the decision not to buy MRAP vehicles in 2005 stopped the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the agency in charge of finding the best protective vehicle from troops in Iraq, from ""developing a course of action ... to attempt to obtain funding for [MRAPs],"" according to the report. The report found that the Department of Defense knew before the war started in 2003 of the threats of mines and roadside bombs in Iraq but did nothing to acquire ""MRAP-type"" vehicles ahead of the invasion. ""As a result, the department entered into operations in Iraq without having taken available steps to acquire technology to mitigate the known mine and IED risk to soldiers and Marines,"" the report said. In response to the report, Marine Corps spokesman Maj. David Nevers pointed out the inspector general found no ""evidence of criminal negligence"" in the Corps' actions. The decision to buy the up-armored Humvee model, he said, was made ""consciously by the Marine Corps leadership because of its proven capability to protect and its tactical utility; the survivability and mobility demanded by the Marines in theater; and its availability, based on an active, responsive production line."" ""The Marine Corps fully cooperated with [inspector general] during this audit,"" Nevers said. ""We are reviewing the report to ensure that our processes best support the war fighter in theater."" A civilian whistle-blower working with the Marine Corps on the MRAP program wrote a scathing report about delays in the procurement process in early 2008. ""If the mass procurement and fielding of MRAPs had begun in 2005 in response to the known and acknowledged threats at that time, as the USMC is doing today, hundreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented,"" Franz Gayl wrote in his January report. He said bureaucratic delays plagued the program at the height of the insurgency, when U.S. troops were regularly being attacked and killed by roadside bombs. Gayl's report prompted the Marine Corps to request the inspector general's audit in 2008. The Gayl report drew attention just months after MRAPs had been pushed into Iraq by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in an effort to protect troops from roadside bombs -- the leading killer of troops at the time.","Report: Buying reinforced Humvees, not MRAPs, possibly cost lives .

"CARACAS, Venezuela (CNN) -- Latin American leaders assembled Monday to mark the 10th anniversary of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's rise to power, a period described by state-run television as ""a decade of successes."" Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, center, is flanked by Bolivia's Evo Morales, right, and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega. Chavez and representatives of the leftist group Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas, or ALBA, walked through the National Pantheon, a square on the edge of the old town of Caracas that holds the sarcophagus of Simon Bolivar, whom Chavez credits with inspiring him as ""the father of the revolution."" In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. In attendance were presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Jose Manuel Zelaya of Honduras and Evo Morales of Bolivia; Roosevelt Skerrit, prime minister of Dominica; and Cuba's first vice president, Jose Ramon Machado Ventura. Absent was Chavez's friend and mentor, former Cuban President Fidel Castro, who has been sick. But that didn't stop Chavez from addressing him. ""Fidel, from here I salute you,"" he said. ""Revolutionary father, from here we, your sons and daughters, salute you!"" Chavez and his allies founded ALBA several years ago as a response to U.S. influence in Latin America. Chavez had a rocky relationship with former President George W. Bush, whom he once called ""the devil."" Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, Chavez stopped frequently to embrace and kiss children, some of whom chanted, ""Chavez! Chavez! Chavez!"" As he held Bolivar's jewel-encrusted sword in his white-gloved hand, Chavez reaffirmed his commitment to the leftist path that has guided him: ""There is no other path to redemption for the human being than socialism,"" he said. With the day declared a national holiday, hundreds of people jammed the square to survey the pageantry. The leaders were to discuss the world economic crisis. Venezuela has been hit particularly hard by the recent drop in oil prices: Oil revenue accounts for about 90 percent of its export earnings, about half of federal budget revenue and some 30 percent of gross domestic product, according to the CIA Factbook. Chavez was elected president in 1998, six years after a failed coup attempt to depose then-President Carlos Andres Perez. Chavez was sworn in on February 2, 1999. He was re-elected in a special election in July 2000 after a new constitution was adopted and again in 2006. The new constitution limits him to two consecutive six-year terms, but the Venezuelan congress recently set a referendum for February 15 that would allow Chavez to run for a third term in 2012. Venezuelans narrowly rejected a similar measure in a December 2007 referendum. Chavez has been campaigning hard in favor of the referendum, which he called for in November, a week after candidates he backed won a majority of seats in local elections seen as a test of his influence. Skerrit brushed aside the possibility that Chavez might lose. ""I want to say to you, my friends in Venezuela, that we will be back to celebrate the 20th, the 30th, the 40th and the 50th anniversary of President Chavez in office,"" he told Chavez supporters who braved a steady downpour to hear him. ""Chavez forever!"" The opposition on Monday denounced Chavez's effort to amend the constitution to get rid of term limits and criticized the declaration of February 2 as a national holiday that resulted in most stores being shut. ""Even today, as we are in this news conference, the national guard is on the streets asking who has opened their stores in order to make enough to carry food to their house, demanding and ordering their closure because today is a holiday, because we have 10 years of bad governance,"" said Tomas Guanipa, director of the opposition party First Justice. But Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, credited Chavez with helping the country. ""These revolutions don't go backward,"" he said. ""We can make mistakes, I can make mistakes, but the people don't make mistakes.""","Latin American leaders visit Caracas, Venezuela, for celebration .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 435 patients, mostly children, have died this year from encephalitis in one of India's most impoverished regions, health officials said. Most of the deaths happened between August and September, according to K.P. Kushwaha, chief pediatrician at BRD Medical College and Nehru Hospital in Uttar Pradesh state's Gorakhpur district. Some 30 to 35 people are being diagnosed daily with the infection in Gorakhpur, he said. The outbreaks are common in the district, near India's border with Nepal. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain, primarily caused by food and drink contamination and mosquito bites. The very young and the elderly are more likely to have a severe case, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. As many as 500 people died last year in the region from the disease, Kushwaha said. In 2009, India reported 774 fatalities from encephalitis, including 556 in Uttar Pradesh, federal data shows.","Some 30 to 35 people are being diagnosed daily with the infection in the Gorakhpur district .

"(CNN)  -- Alinghi will defend the America's Cup against U.S. challenger Oracle in the United Arab Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah next year. Alinghi's America's Cup yacht was unveiled on Lake Geneva with Mont Blanc in the background. The Societe Nautique de Geneve, the home club of the Swiss syndicate, made the official announcement on Wednesday. As the defender, the 2003 and 2007 winners had choice of venue. The battle for the 33rd staging of yachting's most prestigious trophy will begin on February 8, the culmination of a protracted legal battle in the U.S. courts over the rules for the competition. It has led to an unusual head-to-head battle for a trophy which was first contested in 1851 and expanded into a multi-national competition with the last edition hosted by the Spanish port of Valencia. Due to the time of year and perceived favorable conditions, Alinghi have opted for the waters off the smallest of the seven emirates. ""Well we looked everywhere for a venue that suited having good racing and really the whole push was to find a place that we could race on those dates in February,"" said Alinghi's New Zealand skipper Brad Butterworth. ""It's got a great building sea breeze during the day and it's good for these boats to be able to sail them non-stop most days,"" he added. Alinghi, backed by the Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, have just unveiled a massive 90-foot catamaran for the America's Cup, a radical departure from the usual smaller boats that have been used for recent editions. Bitter rivals Oracle, who have their own billionaire backer in software magnet Larry Ellison, have been testing a huge 90-foot trimaran off San Diego for several months. Oracle represent the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco, who were installed as the official challenger of record by a ruling in a New York court earlier this year. The two syndicates will be based in a specially-built marina and luxury resort on the coast of the Persian Gulf with no expense being spared. ""It is a great moment for us to host the America's Cup here. It is significant because it reflects how the emirates have become a place for hosting international events,"" said Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Crown Prince of Ras al-Khaimah.

"(CNN) -- A sharp increase in the number of reported cases of the H1N1 virus in Australia may prompt the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the first global pandemic in over forty years. Australian rugby league star Karmichael Hunt is one of several players being tested for the H1N1 virus. The number of Australian cases of the virus, commonly known as swine flu, has reached more than 1,200, with state and federal medical officers set to hold an emergency meeting in Sydney to review the country's swine flu protection measures. ""We will take each decision along the way in response to the expert medical advice,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). On Wednesday it was announced that the entire Brisbane Broncos rugby league squad had been placed into quarantine after one of their players was suspected of having the virus. The Queensland club confirmed on its Web site that full-back Karmichael Hunt was being tested for the virus, while the sport's governing body, the National Rugby League (NRL), said Hunt had tested positive for the common flu, influenza A. With over 26,000 H1N1 cases worldwide, the WHO could move to Phase 6, the highest on its pandemic alert system. ""It's really a matter of making sure that countries are prepared as possible. We do not want people to overly panic,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director General, told ABC. In a statement a day earlier, Fukuda said the WHO had been working extremely hard preparing countries for what a potential move to a global pandemic would entail. ""I want to point out that by going to Phase 6 the activity has become established in at least two regions of the world,"" he said. ""It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased and that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now.""","Australian cases of the H1N1 virus reach more than 1,200 .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security forces and intelligence officers raided a Palestinian television station overnight and took computers, tapes, transmitters and paperwork, the director of the station said Wednesday. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called it ""piracy."" The raid began at 2 a.m., Wattan TV director Muamar Orabi said. ""Four night-shift employees were detained for more than three hours inside the offices after their mobile phones were taken,"" he added. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the raid had taken place. Israeli Ministry of Communications spokesman Yehiel Shavi said Wattan broadcasts ""were interfering with the signals of Israeli broadcasters"" and said the interference had been stopped ""with the assistance of the IDF."" The IDF said repeated requests had been made to Wattan to stop its broadcasts because they interfered with Israeli broadcasters and flight communications at Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv. But Orabi said his station had never received a complaint about transmission frequencies, and said the response was disproportionate even if that was the reason for the raid. ""Why destroy the TV station when they could have just confiscated the two transmitters?"" he asked. ""This is not the first time this has happened. Wattan TV was destroyed 10 years ago, in March 2002,"" he said. The station called the raid an act of piracy and vowed to continue its work. ""Wattan TV deplores this aggressive behavior against an efficient and effective media organization and will work through its contacts with local and international media and human rights organizations to expose this criminal act,"" the station said in a statement. ""Wattan will work on restoring all the stolen equipment and transmitters and continue interrupted broadcasting."" Fayyad issued a statement saying: ""This piracy and raids of Palestinian media institutions brings back to mind the practices during the beginning of the second Intifadah when Israeli occupation forces raided and sabotaged many Palestinian media institutions including Palestine TV, Voice of Palestine, and Wattan TV."" He said officials will work to put the station back on air immediately.

"(CNN) -- Food and Drug Administration officials plan to investigate whether a form of caffeine sold in lipstick-shaped containers is safe for consumers. The inventor touts AeroShot as caffeine without the coffee, soda, tea or a pill, but a U.S. lawmaker questions whether it's safe. The product comes in a lipstick-shaped dispenser that puffs out a powdery mixture of caffeine and B vitamins into your mouth, where it dissolves and is swallowed. Pre-filled devices can be purchased online or in convenience stores in New York and Boston for about $3. ""No calories. No liquid. No limits,"" its website says. ""Hitting the books. Hitting the gym. Taking a roadtrip. Staying awake at your desk after devouring a bacon double cheeseburger at lunch. AeroShot is specifically designed with you in mind."" But New York's Sen. Charles Schumer said he has some concerns. ""This product could be very dangerous,"" Schumer said. ""There might be legitimate uses. The business man staying up late who doesn't want to drink that cup of coffee, that's OK. But what about kids who go to bars and take several shots of AeroShot so they can drink more?"" Schumer sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration in December urging it to examine the safety and legality of the product. The FDA said it will review the senator's concerns and respond to him directly. AeroShot inventor David Edwards says the product is safe and was ""thoroughly tested"" before it was introduced. ""There are energy shots on the market that have 10 times the amount of caffeine in a single energy shot than we have in the AeroShot ... The fact is we don't have that much caffeine in the product,"" he said. One AeroShot contains 100 milligrams of caffeine dispensed in three to six puffs. ""The amount of caffeine that you would get from one puff of AeroShot is equivalent to about the amount of caffeine in a decaffeinated large Starbucks coffee, so it's really not that much caffeine,"" said David Schardt, a Senior Nutritionist at The Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""For most healthy adults, moderate doses of caffeine â€” 200mg to 300mg, or about two to four cups of brewed coffee a day aren't harmful,"" according to The Mayo Clinic. It warns more than 500mg or 600mg daily can cause problems like insomnia, fast heartbeat, muscle tremors and stomach upset. Schumer has said he is worried that the product could go on sale without government testing. ""The bottom line is this product asks more questions than we have answers and to have it on our shelves before those questions are answered is a serious, serious, serious mistake,"" he said in a news conference Sunday. AeroShots fall under the FDA regulations for ""dietary supplements."" Those products include vitamin C pills at the drug store, some weight loss products and certain energy drinks. The company making them is responsible ""for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading,"" according to the FDA website. It's rare for the agency to prohibit a supplement. In 2004, it stopped the sale of the diet supplement Ephedra, but only after deaths and other serious side effects were reported. ""Manufactures are free, basically, to sell almost any product they want and to make any claims they want about dietary supplements"" Schardt said. ""It's the burden of the Food and Drug Administration to prove that a product is unsafe and the dietary supplement industry has lawyers to defend their products and it's a long involved process.""","Inventor touts AeroShot as caffeine without the coffee, soda or tea .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Rick Santorum, who is campaigning to become America's second Catholic president, disagrees from the bottom of his gut with the first Catholic to hold the office. In October, he told a Catholic university audience that when he read the 1960 speech in which John F. Kennedy said: ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,"" he ""almost threw up."" More recently, he elaborated on his dyspeptic condition in an ABC television interview, calling JFK's credo ""an absolutist doctrine that was abhorrent at the time of 1960."" But the Baptist ministers who witnessed Kennedy's speech surely felt differently. In the 1960s, evangelical leaders were not concerned that Kennedy was too secular; they were concerned that he was too Catholic. For most of American history, the Protestant majority has regarded Catholics with deep suspicion. Many of the 13 colonies banned Catholics from public office and prohibited Catholic rituals. Priests were banished and sometimes executed. After independence, the Constitution protected Catholics from the worst persecutions of the Colonial period, but discrimination persisted, and anti-Catholic paranoia raged with an intensity that would have made Glenn Beck blush. One popular book, ""Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States,"" warned of a secret Jesuit plot to deliver America to the Austrian empire. Its author was Samuel Morse, co-inventor of the telegraph. Such fears diminished as Catholic immigrants assimilated in the 20th century, but many Protestants remained hostile toward Catholic politicians. During JFK's presidential campaign, the Department of Justice documented 144 producers of anti-Catholic campaign literature. The pamphlets warned of Vatican influence over American policy and the prospect of state-funded Catholic schools. Most of the opposition came from evangelical groups like the National Association of Evangelicals and the Southern Baptist Convention. In the face of unrelenting hostility, Kennedy decided to address concerns about his religion directly. Speaking to a group of Baptist ministers in Houston, he reassured them: . ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president -- should he be Catholic -- how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote, where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him, or the people who might elect him."" Perhaps Rick Santorum's father, an Italian immigrant who came to the United States in 1930, heard these words and understood the prejudice that JFK struggled against. But Rick Santorum was only 2 years old when they were spoken. If he has any memory of Catholics' difficult history in this country, he does not publicize it. Nor do other Catholic champions of the religious right in their determination to wash away the old hostilities that divided American Christianity. Evangelicals and Catholics began collaborating politically in the late 1970s. The architect behind their reconciliation was a political strategist named Paul Weyrich. Frustrated by the Republican Party's preoccupation with business interests, Weyrich sought to reorient the party toward religious and cultural issues. To this end, he founded the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the Moral Majority, the first organization to represent what we now call the religious right. Weyrich, a Melkite Greek Catholic, knew that a Catholic leader would not appeal to evangelicals, so he tried to recruit televangelist Pat Robertson to lead his cause. When Robertson turned him down, Weyrich enlisted the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Falwell would later say that Catholics and evangelicals found common ground in their opposition to abortion, but Weyrich remembered it somewhat differently. He had tried to mobilize evangelicals over abortion and failed. Most Protestants regarded abortion as a ""Catholic issue,"" and many prominent Baptist leaders had even endorsed the Roe v. Wade decision. What actually brought Catholics and evangelicals together was a common enemy. This imaginary enemy has gone by many names. In the 1970s and '80s, it was known as ""secular humanism,"" a fiendish anti-religious movement that had supposedly taken over the schools, the courts, the media and the government. In the 1990s, it was called ""political correctness,"" and rampaged through the universities. When Bill O'Reilly of Fox News announced that Christmas was under siege in 2004, he blamed ""secular progressives"" in the media. Meanwhile, Rick Santorum decries ""cultural liberalism"" and warns that the government is trying to destroy religious freedom by forcing Catholic organizations to insure birth control. Regardless of the name, the supposed enemy's goals remain the same: to eradicate Christianity from the public sphere and replace traditional Judeo-Christian values with a liberal agenda. Its agents are progressive politicians, journalists, professors and nonprofit organizations. Its creed is the separation of church and state that JFK once appealed to in his campaign to become the first Catholic president. The construction of such a villain has been devastatingly effective in uniting the religious right. The same evangelical groups that once attacked JFK as an agent of the pope have become the foundation of Santorum's support in the Republic primary, and his only rival for their vote is fellow Catholic Newt Gingrich. Times have changed. But should Santorum and his conservative Catholic allies succeed in breaking down the barriers between state and religion, they may reap a bitter fruit. For without the secular menace to distract Protestants from their doctrinal differences with Catholics, the old enmities may rise again. And just as religious right leaders seldom extend their demands for religious freedom to Muslims and other non-Christian religions, Catholics might one day find the freedoms that they have come to take for granted are no longer assured. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich.","Michael Wolraich: Protestants were deeply wary of Catholics for most of U.S. history .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court for a third time has turned aside an urgent appeal from Great Lakes states to close Chicago-area shipping channels so invasive Asian carp won't have a doorway into the world's largest freshwater ecosystem. The justices Monday turned aside without comment another request for intervention, the latest chapter in a nearly century-old dispute involving six Midwest states and the Canadian province of Ontario. At issue is a direct challenge to Illinois' complex water diversion and sewage disposal network, which some predict will inadvertently allow the non-native fish to enter Lake Michigan. Some environmentalists and lawmakers fear an economic and ecological disaster if the creatures breach man-made barriers. And there are concerns the fish may have already slipped past locks and entered the massive bodies of fresh water. The fish can grow up to 4 feet in length and 100 pounds in weight, reproduce rapidly, and can gobble up to 40% of their body weight daily, quickly out-competing less aggressive native fish populations. The high court twice before has refused to step into the case. Five states -- Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- had filed a new appeal, demanding permanent closure of a drainage system linking the Mississippi River and the lakes. The justices were asked again to grant a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Illinois to immediately close down much of its Chicago-area shipping locks and dams, and would have prompted rapid construction of a fish-proof barrier. The high court refused that petition, but offered no explanation. The voracious Asian carp has successfully migrated up the Mississippi River to the Chicago suburbs. State officials, businesses, and environmentalists fear it is only a step away from triggering a swift economic disaster across the Great Lakes, saying that once in Lake Michigan the carp would spread quickly to Lakes Erie, Huron, Ontario, and Superior. DNA from the carp was found in 2010 closer to Lake Michigan than ever before -- at a Wilmette, Illinois, pumping station along the lake shore -- raising fresh concerns that the fish has breached an electric barrier placed along a maze of canals and locks in Illinois. Among those being sued are Chicago's local water reclamation agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which helped build the canal system and helps maintain it. Illinois officials say other states and the federal courts do not have the legal authority to order the closing of any federally approved water management project. There are fears that shutting down the locks would lead to massive flooding and cripple the area's commercial shipping industry. The term ""Asian carp"" is actually an umbrella name for at least four large varieties of fish considered nuisance invasive species: the grass, black, silver, and bighead carp. Related to common goldfish, the bigger types are known as prolific jumpers, easily spooked out of the water by passing watercraft. Numerous boaters have been injured by inadvertent collisions with airborne fish. Biologists have been tracking their northern migration ever since they were first imported in the 1960s, traced to an Arkansas fish farmer. Several of the fish escaped during a flood in the 1990s and quickly expanded their range. Their possible presence just miles from the lakes prompted the latest lawsuit over the so-called Chicago Diversion, a project started in the late 1800s to prevent the city's sewage from contaminating Lake Michigan. The project involved reversing the flow of the Chicago River, and connecting it and two other nearby rivers with the Mississippi River basin. That created a connection between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, helping fuel an economic boom in the nation's third-largest metropolitan area. In 1922, Wisconsin sued Illinois to stop the growing water diversion, since other states relied on the drinking water. All other lake states except Indiana joined suit, and the Supreme Court eventually agreed with them, ordering mitigating effects over Illinois' diversion. Now several of those states are asking the justices to reopen the old cases. Such interstate disputes over boundaries and shared natural resources are one of the few instances where appeals can go directly to the Supreme Court, instead of first being heard in lower courts. The Obama administration is supporting Illinois. Justice Elena Kagan was actively involved in the cases when she worked as the Justice Department's solicitor general. Since joining the high court two years ago, Kagan has not participated in any of the current carp-related appeals, including Monday's order. The other states and Canada want the Illinois water diversion projects to be declared a ""public nuisance"" because of the carp emergency. Of more immediate concern, they want Illinois and federal officials to modify their fish-control facilities, including the electric fences, to ensure the fish stay away from the lakes. Electric barriers were first set up in 2002 in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, about 33 miles from Lake Michigan. They became fully operational in 2010, but Army engineers acknowledge the barrier is not 100% effective. It is designed not to kill carp, but to discourage them from going farther. The current case is Michigan v. Army Corps of Engineers (11-541).","Six Midwest states, Canadian province of Ontario want action on Asian carp .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Nicollette Sheridan returns to the stand Friday in her legal battle with show creator Marc Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons. During Thursday's court session, Sheridan, 48, slapped her lawyer to demonstrate how she claims Cherry hit her during a rehearsal. Her wrongful termination lawsuit contends Cherry killed off Edie Britt, the sassy, blond woman Sheridan played, in retaliation for her complaints about being hit. Several of Sheridan's former castmates -- including Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, Felicity Huffman and Neal McDonough -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend Cherry during the two-week-long Los Angeles trial. Cherry's lawyers contend show writers began planning Britt's demise in May 2008, four months before the alleged battery, as a way to shock viewers and raise ratings. The hit was just ""a light tap on the head"" intended to demonstrate ""a piece of physical humor"" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday. Sheridan's dissatisfaction with her lack of lines in a scene preceded the alleged hitting incident, she testified. She wanted to recite a line from a Beatles song -- ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"" -- but Cherry said the music royalties would be too expensive. Without it, her exit from the scene ""wasn't funny anymore,"" Sheridan testified. Sheridan testified that while she explained her concerns to Cherry, the producer asked ""What is it that you want?"" Then he hit her his open right hand, she said. ""It was a nice wallop to my head."" ""It was shocking, humiliating, it was demeaning,"" she said. Sheridan demonstrated the hit in slow motion on her lawyer, Patrick Maloney, but then he asked her to ""hit me as hard as you were hit."" ""I don't want to hurt you,"" Sheridan told her lawyer. The actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force, sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning Maloney's head. ""I'm fine,"" he assured her as she apologized. Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her ""I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness,"" Sheridan testified. But she did not accept it. The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry. ""I thought he could, at least, apologize again and send me flowers,"" she said. But Cherry's reply, delivered by Perkins, was not a second apology or flowers. ""He felt the incident had been resolved,"" Sheridan said he told her. Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on ""Desperate Housewives."" Jurors must decide if the death of Sheridan's character and the end of her employment was illegal workplace retaliation or just a creative decision unconnected to the alleged battery incident. Cherry's defense is expected to present notes made by show writers in May 2008 that document the various scenarios they were considering at the time for killing off Britt. In his opening statement Wednesday, Mark Baute, Sheridan's lawyer, challenged the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an ""effort to backdate the decision"" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident. Britt is ""a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious,"" Sheridan said. ""She has a heart, but people loved to hate her."" She made it clear to jurors she was not like the character she played. ""I think honesty is about the only thing we shared."" Jurors appeared to enjoy several clips of the show, featuring her character seducing a series of men. They laughed several times during the playing of the clips. They were also shown Britt's death scene, in which she crashed a car into a tree and was electrocuted by a fallen power line. Cherry lawyer defense lawyer Adam Levin told jurors that TV writers must ""shock and surprise"" viewers with pregnancies, affairs, marriages, divorces and deaths to ""keep them on the edge of their seats."" ""The unanticipated death of a prominent character can shock the viewing audience and energize the show,"" which Levin said can ""lead to watercooler talk and media buzz,"" increasing ratings. The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said. Sheridan testified that the hangman's noose scene was Cherry's idea, prompted by ABC's request that the season end with something ""more spectacular."" Cherry assured her that her character would ""be saved"" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said. She said Cherry even told the whole cast when they gathered to start the next season's production that ""we know one character we won't be killing off is Edie Britt,"" because people were ""up in arms"" over the possibility. The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the ""blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives,"" he said. After five seasons, ""writers could only do so much with the character,"" Levin said. ""There were only so many husbands she could sleep with."" ABC Entertainment is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate Sheridan's accusation that Cherry hit her and then agreed with his decision to fire her. Although a line producer reported the incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Enquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, Baute said. What followed was a ""fake"" investigation designed ""to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,'"" he said. ""Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down."" The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said. Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.","Nicollette Sheridan returns to the witness stand Friday in her case against producer Marc Cherry .

"(CNN) -- A theater company from South Sudan is translating Shakespeare into the local dialect for the first time, before performing the play at London's Globe Theatre. Six months after the birth of South Sudan as an independent nation, it is a country still trying to define its culture and national identity. The South Sudan Theatre Company (SSTC) is helping to develop that culture by performing Shakespeare's tragedy ""Cymbeline"" in Juba Arabic -- a language spoken widely in South Sudan. ""Shakespeare is a genius writer who wrote about humanity, about greed, jealousy, wars, power, love -- he really speaks to the whole world,"" said Derik Uya Alfred Ngbangu, the SSTC's director and producer. ""We want to do Cymbeline in a way that speaks to the South Sudanese -- in terms of the plot, the kind of conflict that exists here -- and make it our own thing,"" he added. Juba Arabic is a pidgin form of Arabic that takes its name from the South Sudanese capital of Juba. Although English has been named South Sudan's official language since the country's independence, Juba Arabic is still a lingua franca in much of South Sudan, says Ngbangu. The SSTC's production is part of the ""Globe to Globe"" Festival taking place at London's Shakespeare Globe Theatre from April. The SSTC will be one of 37 theater groups from around the world performing interpretations of Shakespeare plays in their local language. The SSTC has already begun adapting Cymbeline and translating it. ""We're looking to cut out unnecessary bits so that 10 actors can do it, instead of perhaps 18,"" said Ngbangu. ""We're looking to have a simplified, shortened text that can be performed in one and a half hours instead of three."" Actors will be drawn from two of South Sudan's established theater groups, the Kwoto Cultural Centre and the Skylark Dramatist Association, and will include graduates of the University of Juba's College of Arts, Music and Drama. Ngbangu says they plan to perform Cymbeline in Juba before taking it to London in May. They are are also looking to make changes to the original to make it more relevant to local audiences, such as using local names and costumes. The original Cymbeline is set against a backdrop of impending war between ancient Britain and ancient Rome, over the king of Britain's refusal to pay tribute to Rome; the SSTC is considering changing that to an impending conflict between south and north Sudan, fighting over oil. Sudan's real civil war between north and south raged for decades, claiming more than two million lives. But Ngbangu says theater survived those dark years of conflict. ""Theater has existed throughout the time of the civil war and difficulties,"" he said. ""War never stopped people coming together through arts -- whether music or drama or dance,"" he added. And he believes theater can help build South Sudan, celebrating the fledgling nation's cultural diversity. ""It is a very cheap art form compared to cinema and TV -- you can do it anywhere -- move it to the villages and contribute to their understanding of their environment, their struggles, you can do it in schools and teach young people how to do the right thing. ""Through theater we can send a lot of messages about unity, about respecting people, about coming together, about tolerance and civilization. He added: ""There is an old saying -- 'give me a theater and I will give you a nation.'"" As casting and rehearsals begin, Ngbangu is excited at the prospect of performing in London. ""I have been to London several times. It is a land of theater, a land that produced a giant like Shakespeare,"" he said. ""To be in London with a Shakespearean play, when we're a country that will be nine months old at the time, it's a great thing.""","South Sudan Theatre Company producing Shakespeare play ""Cymbeline"" in Juba Arabic .

"(CNN) -- One of the world's most iconic works of art will be auctioned in May, and could fetch tens of millions of dollars, according to Sotheby's Auction House in Manhattan. ""The Scream,"" created in 1895 by artist Edvard Munch, will be on display at Sotheby's starting April 27 and then go up for sale May 2. ""Munch's 'The Scream' is the defining image of modernity, and it is an immense privilege for Sotheby's to be entrusted with one of the most important works of art in private hands,"" said Sotheby's Senior Vice President Simon Shaw. ""For collectors and institutions, the opportunity to acquire such a singularly-influential masterpiece is unprecedented in recent times."" Shaw said it is difficult to predict the work's value because of its rare and unique nature, but estimates it could sell for more than $80 million, based on recent sales of other masterpieces. This version of ""The Scream"" is the only one of four original compositions still in private hands, according to Sotheby's. It is currently owned by Petter Olsen, whose father was apparently a friend and neighbor of Munch. ""I feel the moment has come to offer the rest of the world a chance to own and appreciate this remarkable work, which is the only version of 'The Scream' not in the collection of a Norwegian museum,"" Olsen said. He noted that the proceeds from the sale will go toward a new museum and art center in Norway. Sotheby's describes it as a ""defining image of the Expressionist movement"" and ""a pivotal work in the history of art."" ""It is the projection of Munch's mental state that was so artistically innovative -- a landscape of the mind, whose impact is still felt in the art of today,"" the auction house said in a statement. The remaining versions of ""The Scream"" are in Norwegian museums. The first version, created in 1893, was stolen out of the National Gallery of Norway in 1993 but recovered later that same year. The other versions, one created later in 1893 and one from 1910, are displayed in the Munch Museum in Oslo. The 1910 version was stolen in 2004, but was recovered two years later.","This version of ""The Scream"" was painted in 1895 by artist Edvard Munch .

Yet while Yang Lan is an example of the opportunity available in China, she told the TED Global conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, in July, there are also daunting obstacles to progress for many younger people. Start with the gender disparity: Under China's one-child policy, ""because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls, now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women."" TED.com: Understanding the rise of China . China's population is aging, and young people are expected to support their parents financially. In the cities, college graduates can start their careers earning about $400 a month, but the average rent is above $500. Young couples who want to buy an apartment would need 30 to 40 years of earnings to pay for it. A migrant worker force of about 200 million people is caught between the city and the countryside, working long hours at low pay. Income inequality in China, she said, is greater than in the U.S.: ""The bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread. So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest."" TED.com: Hans Rosling on China's rise -- how and when . A good way to gauge the feelings of Chinese youth is to read what they say on microblogs, which she described as the Chinese version of Twitter. ""And because, as you know, the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government, social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit. But because you don't have many other openings, the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong, active and even violent."" Environmental issues animate the conversation on microblogs. Polluted air and water and poisoned food are among the issues. ""All these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet. And fortunately, we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns."" Still, with all the challenges, she said young Chinese adults are well educated and are coming up with creative solutions. Among them, a ""naked wedding"" which doesn't involve nudity but does forgo a ring, a party, a house and a car. Microblogging is enabling people to find missing children and to rescue animals. And Yang Lan is upbeat: China's younger generation is ""going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves.""","Yang Lan is a television star and media entrepreneur in China .

"FUMICINO, Italy (CNN) -- Under a canopy of elegant Italian pines, the foundations of a mini Roman Coliseum are at once unmistakable and exhilarating. The intricate statue head archeologists unearthed while excavating the site at Fumicino, Italy in early 2009 . The structure at ""Portus,"" the Romans' ancient Mediterranean port, has remained undiscovered for eighteen centuries until now. University of Southampton archaeologists have just this summer uncovered the remains of an amphitheater, a Roman warehouse and the ruins of an Imperial palace even though archaeologists have been digging at this site since the 19th Century. ""It's true I think also to say that we have kind of rediscovered it because the great Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani reported the discovery of a theater in the 1860s but nobody could actually find it,"" says Professor Simon Keay, a leading expert on Roman Archaeology at the University of Southampton.  Watch a report on the site's discovery » . ""There is only one imperial Rome, and Rome only had one imperial port and Portus is that port. In a sense it is trying to give an idea not only of the importance by virtue of that but also because the archaeological potential of it is huge,"" adds Keay. The site is a feast for the eyes in the true Roman sense. Excavations have unearthed priceless treasures apart from the foundations of the amphitheater.  See images of the site » . An exquisite white marble head of a statue was found close to the site of the amphitheater. Experts believe it could be a bust of Ulysses or possibly a Greek sailor. Rare and finely carved fragments of columns have also been found. ""When we first started the project, everything you would have seen here was grass, a couple of trees,"" explains Keay. ""We very nearly fell into a hole because we couldn't actually see what we were doing. Clearly we have completely exposed this area and because these buildings are so big it is only by uncovering large areas of them that we can actually understand their function and their development,"" says Keay. The site is ironically less than a mile from Rome's modern transport hub, Fumicino International Airport, and this discovery owes more than a nod to modern technology. Using modern sensors, ground-penetrating radar and probes, researchers complied computer images of what lay beneath. They were dazzled by what modern technology revealed about the ancient past. ""So we then played around with it on the computer screen, we did a virtual reconstruction of it and amphitheater shape grew out of the screen and we knew that we were on to something very special,"" says Keay. The excavations in Fumicino, Italy, just outside Rome, continue in a joint project named ""Portus"" with the University of Southampton, the British School at Rome, The Italian Archaeological Superintendency for Ostia and the University of Cambridge.","Archeologists are excavating site in Fumicino, Italy, just outside Rome .

"New York (CNN) -- Police say a novelty or inert grenade was responsible for the evacuation of a Manhattan skyscraper across the street from the former World Trade Center, the site of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Authorities have since given the all-clear at Two World Financial Center after a bomb squad investigated the incident, according to police spokesman Brendan Ryan. The ""grenade-like novelty item"" was ""mounted on a plaque with a sign: ""Complaint Dept. Pull Pin,"" according to the NYPD's official Twitter account. The package was flagged in the building's mail room at 10:53 a.m. when it was scanned, said police spokeswoman Kim Royster. The building's security personnel initiated the evacuation about seven minutes later, she said. Construction is well under way on One World Trade Center, which is being built near the imprint of the twin towers that fell more than 10 years ago when hijacked planes crashed into them.","NEW: Police give the all-clear; the package contained a novelty or inert grenade .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Maoist insurgents in the Indian state of Orissa have set free the second of two Italians they kidnapped almost a month ago, but a local legislator is still being held, a government spokesman said Thursday. The Italian citizen Paolo Bosusco has been released, said S.K. Panda, a spokesman for the government of Orissa in eastern India. ""He is on his way to Bhubaneswar,"" the state capital, Panda said. Bosusco was kidnapped with another Italian tourist, Claudio Colangelo, in the district of Kandhamal on March 14. Colangelo was set free 11 days later. The guerillas also kidnapped Jhina Hikaka, a member of the state's legislative assembly who is still being detained. Last week, authorities in Orissa agreed to release 27 prison inmates in exchange for the return of the abducted Italian man and the legislator. Orissa's chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, specified that 23 prisoners would be freed to secure Hikaka's release, and the other four for Bosusco's. The captors had set 13 demands, including the withdrawal of government troops from rebel strongholds in the state and the release of fellow Maoists and their supporters from jail. Panda said Thursday that one of the prisoners, who the chief minister had promised to free in the exchange, has been released and others have been asked to file their bail applications. Anti-rebel operations, part of a decades-long conflict, have already been put on hold in Kandhamal, officials said. Maoist militants have been battling the Indian government in several eastern states since the late 1960s in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties. The group says it is fighting for the poor and the dispossessed. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and ""class enemies,"" the insurgents are believed to have carried out attacks on roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","Left-wing insurgents are still holding a state lawmaker in Orissa .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have found the vehicle of a University of Georgia professor wanted in the killing of three people. Authorities examine a Jeep belonging to professor George Zinkhan on Friday in Clarke County, Georgia. Police found George Zinkhan's vehicle early Friday in northwestern Clarke County, home to the University of Georgia, the university said in a statement. Authorities have been looking for a 2005 red Jeep Liberty that Zinkhan was driving when he was last seen six days ago after a shooting left three people dead, including his wife. Last Saturday's shootings happened at a community theater group's reunion in Athens, Georgia, just off campus. The university fired Zinkhan from his job as a marketing professor the day after the shootings. Zinkhan had purchased a plane ticket to the Netherlands for travel on Saturday, said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta, Georgia, office, this week. Authorities have said Zinkhan owns a home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Police Capt. Clarence Holeman identified the dead as Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and an Athens attorney; Tom Tanner, 40; and Ben Teague, 63. Holeman said it appeared that Zinkhan ""and his wife were having problems."" Police said Zinkhan has relatives in Texas as well as in the Netherlands. University Police Chief Jimmy Williams said Monday that authorities do not believe Zinkhan remains on campus or in Athens. However, he said, security has been beefed up on campus, including officers on foot patrols carrying semiautomatic weapons. The victims were all associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings. ""The three people we lost were a part of the rich 50-year history of this theater and, more than that, were vital members of the Town and Gown family,"" the organization said on its Web site. The site described Bruce as ""the binding force that held the Town and Gown community together."" ""Having worked with Town and Gown for over 20 years, at one time or another she served in every capacity at the theater, artistically and administratively, from leading lady to president of the board to chief cook and bottle washer."" Police said Zinkhan arrived while the Town and Gown event was under way. According to Holeman of the Athens police, Zinkhan got into ""a disagreement"" with his wife. He left the scene -- police believe he went to his car, where the couple's children apparently were waiting -- and returned with two handguns. The shootings ""only took a few minutes,"" Holeman said. Police found eight shell casings, he said. After the shootings, Zinkhan left the scene with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- still in the vehicle, police said. He drove to a neighbor's house in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children there. The neighbor, Bob Covington, said that Zinkhan arrived at his home shortly after noon Saturday with the two children. ""He rang the doorbell -- asked me if I could keep his kids for about an hour,"" Covington said. ""I said sure, and he said there'd been some type of emergency, and he took off."" An hour or so later, Covington said, police arrived and took the children.","University of Georgia professor sought in shooting deaths of wife and two others .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome on CNN Student News! So is a story we have coming up on a U.S. Army officer. Hey, everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. We're starting today in the Middle East. First Up: Syrian Conflict . AZUZ: Pressure is increasing for Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, to quit his job. We've talked this week about the violence going on in Syria and the protests there against the country's leader. Yesterday, U.S. officials explained why they believe the Syrian president's got to go. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: The people of Syria deserve a government that respects their dignity, protects their rights, and lives up to their aspirations. Assad is standing in their way. AZUZ: The United States also announced new sanctions -- new punishments --against the Syrian government. Those include limiting access to assets that Syria has in the United States. President al-Assad is also facing heat from European leaders. France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union: all of them calling for him to step aside. I.D. Me . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a stock index that was established in 1896. Most people use me to measure the overall U.S. stock market. I was founded by Charles Dow and Edward Jones. I'm the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and I'm made up of 30 high-profile stocks. Economic Concerns . AZUZ: The Dow is highlighting concerns about the U.S. economy. Yesterday, it dropped more than 400 points. At one point during the day, it was down nearly 530 points. That came after Morgan Stanley -- this major investment bank -- put out a prediction that was pretty negative about economic growth around the globe. So the Dow took a big drop. So what? What does that mean? Well, the Dow indicates not just how major companies are doing, but how investors feel about the economy in general. And if that is dropping, that means investors are pulling money out of the market. They're not feeling confident in it. And this doesn't just affect the U.S. There's a global economy. What happens in one country affects other countries. And that's what we're seeing. Stock markets in Europe and Asia took a hit yesterday, as well. Battle for Jobs . AZUZ: The stock market is one way people determine how the U.S. economy is doing. Another is the national unemployment rate. Right now, it's just over nine percent. Everyone wants to create new jobs. But President Obama and the Republican candidates who are hoping to be the next president don't agree on how to do that. Holly Firfer has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) HOLLY FIRFER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Wrapping up a three-day midwest tour in his home state of Illinois, President Obama held a town hall meeting at a production facility, where he focused on jobs while fighting to keep his. He said by starting with basic ideas, like building the nation's infrastructure, the economy will move in the right direction if Congress does not get in the way. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: These aren't radical ideas. I mean building roads, when did that become a partisan issue? FIRFER: Many feel political bickering in Congress is taking focus away from the real needs of the country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've lost our rating as far as being able to borrow money. It's pretty concerning. FIRFER: Meanwhile in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney claimed the president's inexperience was responsible for the economic crisis and subsequent standstill in Washington. MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: As far as I can tell, he didn't lead a business, didn't lead a state, didn't lead a city. He didn't have leadership experience and therefore didn't know how to work with Congress. FIRFER: Also campaigning in New Hampshire, GOP hopeful Rick Perry continued to tout his record of job creation as governor of Texas and criticized the president for what he called his inability to manage the economy. GOVERNOR RICK PERRY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We spent the last 2.5 years in a grand experiment with the American economy, and it has been a terrible, terrible disaster. FIRFER: According to White House officials, President Obama will address job growth and the nation's debt with a new economic plan some time after Labor Day. In Washington, I'm Holly Firfer. (END VIDEO) Billion Dollar Disasters . AZUZ: Talking 'bout the weather. So far this year, we've seen some extreme weather events: floods, blizzards, tornadoes. You hear a lot about the lives that are lost, the damage that happens. But there's a cost to all that damage, too. Chad Myers is here to take us through some of this year's costliest weather events. Chad, can you start with the total? (BEGIN VIDEO) CHAD MYERS, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: Carl, believe it or not, NOAA now estimates $35 billion -- with a b -- in lost revenues, lost crops, just basicaly lost money over the U.S. from severe weather alone this season. Let's take a look at the top nine. The first one, $9 billion: the tornadoes that rolled through Alabama, especially Tuscaloosa, just north of Birmingham and even into Georgia that night. Seven billion dollars from the tornadoes that hit, including Joplin, Missouri, that leveled part of that town; $7 billion and 177 people dead. Five-and-a-half billion dollars just because of the droughts in the Southwest, especially Texas and Oklahoma. Some spots drier than the Dust Bowl. Four billion dollars with the spring and summer floods of the Mississippi River, all the way down the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico. And then a couple of them all rounded up here, from the Midwest tornadoes, that's including parts of Alabama, Texas and even into the Carolinas. And then April 11, $2.2 billion, no deaths, but that was the North Carolina event there. Tornadoes through the Midwest. The Groundhog Day blizzard: two feet of snow in parts of Chicago. Then the upper Midwest flooding, that's in the Dakotas. In fact, that's still going right now. Hard to believe, $35 billion in losses, Carl. (END VIDEO) Texas Drought . AZUZ: Thank you, Chad. One of the things you heard Chad mention was the drought in Texas. This has been going on for 10 months. It was made worse by a blazing hot Summer. Officials are looking at some of the industries that will feel the biggest effects of this. Number one: livestock. Producers have lost an estimated $2.1 billion. Cotton, next on the list. Around $1.8 billion lost there. This drought is affecting people who produce hay, corn and wheat, as well. The state's agriculture commissioner said the numbers aren't good. But he added that Texas farmers and ranchers will adapt and overcome the drought. Shoutout . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! In the U.S. Army, what is the official name for a one-star general? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it a: A) Brigadier General, B) Major General, C) Lieutenant General or D) General of the Army? You've got three seconds -- GO! All of these ranks are addressed as ""general,"" but a brigadier general wears one star. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Marcia Anderson . AZUZ: That's the rank General Marcia Anderson holds right now. But she's been nominated to get another star and possibly be promoted to major general. It's impressive for someone who, back in college, never thought she'd go into the military. General Anderson sat down for CNN's ""Red Chair"" interview series to talk about how she got to where she is. (BEGIN VIDEO) BRIGADIER GENERAL MARCIA ANDERSON, U.S. ARMY RESERVES: My husband would say that I could talk to a pole, and I do tend to make friends in movie lines buying tickets. When women enlist in the military, I think they should expect to be challenged. They are going to put you in charge of some people besides yourself. They are going to make you responsible for resources. You are going to have to mentor those people. My nomination and hopefully my confirmation to major general, I will be the first African-American female in the Army to have achieved that rank. The biggest pivotal moment in life: the look on my dad's face -- and I'm going to get a little teary here -- the look on my dad's face when he got to promote me to brigadier general. He served in the Korean War at a time when they just were integrating the military. I know he could have been anything, but because of that time, perhaps he didn't get to achieve as much as he could have. I think the biggest ""a-ha"" moment was when I graduated from high school. The world just seemed really bright and I just kind of felt as if anything was possible. I just wanted to be the kind of person that, when I passed away, people would say, ""she tried to treat people the right way."" That would leave me with a really good feeling and I think a really good legacy. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: A valet parks your car. But at this golf course, the valet might bark at it, too! Just another day on the job for Kaleigh. She's a six-year-old dog who helps out the golfers. When they finish a round and drop off their carts, they leave the keys with Kaleigh and she brings 'em back to the clubhouse. So, if you call the person who carries your clubs a caddy, what do you call the dog who gets your keys? Goodbye . AZUZ: A retriever, of course. She just does that all day long; doesn't go out to the holes. She puts the cart before the course! We look fore!-ward to seeing you next week for more CNN Student News. Have a good one.","The daily transcript is a written version of each day's CNN Student News program .

"(CNN) -- Unseeded Russian Ekaterina Makarova upset five-time champion Serena Williams of the United States 6-2 6-3 on Monday to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. The fourth-round match was played as temperatures hit above 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit). Makarova's two previous grand slam appearances -- at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year -- ended with losses in the first round as she faded from a career-high 29th in the rankings -- a position she reached with last-16 appearances in Melbourne and at the French Open. ""I'm surprised because she's a great player and it's really tough to play against her,"" said the 23-year-old Makarova, who will next play her fourth-seeded compatriot Maria Sharapova. Nishikori makes history for Japan . ""But, I don't know, I was just feeling so good and so focused. So I played my game, and that's it. I won against Serena. That's amazing."" Former world No. 1 Williams, seeded 12th, refused to blame the ankle injury she suffered in a warm-up tournament in Brisbane. ""I feel like I didn't play well today. I don't feel like I can't get better. I feel like if I was in a situation where, 'Wow, she played so great, and I played amazing, and I served 80%, and I hit no double-faults, I didn't hit 37 unforced errors,' that would be a totally different situation,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I didn't play well. I'm not physically 100%. So it's just like, you know, I can't be so angry at myself, even though I'm very unhappy. I know that I can play a hundred times better than I did this whole tournament."" Sharapova, the 2008 champion, secured her place in the last eight as she came from behind to beat German 14th seed Sabine Lisicki 2-6 6-2 6-3 in the late match. It was their first meeting since last year's Wimbledon semifinals, when Sharapova also won before losing in the final. Earlier Monday, Wimbledon champion and world No. 2 Petra Kvitova reached the quarterfinals after beating Serbian 21st seed and former No. 1 Ana Ivanovic 6-2 7-6 (7-2). The Czech will next face Italy's Sara Errani, who beat China's Zheng Jie 6-2 6-1. On Sunday, defending champion and 11th seed Kim Clijsters saved four match points as she overcame the opponent she beat in last year's Australian Open final, Li Na, 4-6 7-6 6-4. The former world No.1 was in trouble early on as she turned her ankle in the opening set and needed medical treatment before battling back to book a quarterfinal clash with top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki. Fifth seed Li took full advantage of Clijsters' discomfort by taking the first set, but the Belgian showed typical resilience when she leveled the match after a dramatic tie break, during which she faced match point four times. The setback clearly stunned Li, who quickly found herself 5-2 down in the deciding set before staging a late rally. But the momentum was with the Belgian, as she closed out the match. ""I can't believe I won,"" Clijsters told the Australian Open's official website. ""I knew before the match that it was going to be a tough match but I didn't expect this obviously! ""I don't want to quit my last time at the Australian Open. It [retiring] definitely crossed my mind at some point. But at one point you think, 'Okay, I'm just gonna go for it.' Once I made that decision, I didn't think."" Wozniacki, from Denmark, beat Serbian 13th seed Jelena Jankovic 6-0 7-5 as she continues her quest to secure the first grand slam victory of her career. After wrapping up the opening set in just over half an hour, Wozniacki dropped her serve twice in the second as Jankovic found her feet, but she held her nerve to serve out the match. ""I'm just happy to be here as the winner of the match,"" Wozniacki said. ""I felt like I played some really good tennis out there today. ""She started to play really well as well. She had nothing to lose so she had to go for it. I knew she was a fighter and it wasn't going to be easy. "" Elsewhere Sunday, world No. 3 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus cruised past Czech Iveta Benesova 6-2 6-2 to reach the last eight. She will now face Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, who thrashed Julia Gorges of Germany 6-1 6-1.

"(CNN) -- President Bill Clinton once famously said, ""The most difficult job in the world is not being president. It's being a parent."" As mothers, we both know this well, but we wonder if President Clinton's fellow Democrats share his respect for parents, particularly those who choose to stay home with their children? Yesterday on CNN, Hilary Rosen, a Washington insider who has advised many prominent Democrats, made the ill-advised decision to attack a fellow parent, a stay-at-home mother, by accusing her of having ""never worked a day in her life."" The stay-at-home mother targeted maliciously by Rosen has successfully raised five boys, who all have their own families now and constructively contribute to society. This particular mother has battled cancer and multiple sclerosis. This particular stay-at-home mom travels the country and speaks up on issues of importance to her and for her children and grandchildren's future. This particular stay-at-home mother is also a Republican, her name is Ann Romney and her message is resonating. Therein lies the reason for Rosen's vicious attack. After calls for her to apologize from both the left and the right, Rosen initially refused. But she caved to the building pressure today. In her apology she said, ""Let's declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance."" We couldn't agree more -- so let's look at the substance, and the facts, which is what Ann Romney and many other women have been doing all along. Comment on Romney's wife keeps campaign's focus on women . As her husband moves toward locking up the Republican nomination, recent headlines have screamed that Ann Romney is the ""Romney that Democrats fear most."" And for good reason. Pundits point out that she is passionate, attractive, charismatic and elegant -- all true -- but we would argue that what Democrats truly fear is her message and the impact it is having with women of all walks of life. Recently, Romney made headlines when she said, ""Women care about jobs. Women care about the economy, they care about their children, they care about their debt. They're angry, they're furious about the entitlement debt we're leaving our children."" She is right. Meanwhile, Democrats preen on about the phony ""war on women"" and are increasingly desperate to lure attention away from their disastrous policies. The women we know are smarter than this and realize this is merely a smokescreen meant to distract women voters from the true legacy of the Obama administration: failed economic policies that adversely affect women. In her stunning comments, Rosen claims Romney ""never really dealt with the kind of economic issues that a majority of women in the country are facing."" Moms all across this country look to the unemployment numbers, which have disproportionately affected women, and worry about their families' immediate future and security. Moms look to record high gas prices as they begin to plan summer road trips. Women make 80% of all health care decisions in our country, so it's no wonder a consistent majority of them oppose Obamacare. Moms know how to make and maintain a budget and are left wondering why it has taken Harry Reid over 1,050 days to pass a budget in the male-dominated, Democrat-led U.S. Senate. Moms know the crushing legacy that debt can leave and are outraged that, as of today, each of our children owes $50,017.33 of the national debt. This is the legacy of the Obama administration, and this is why liberals like Ms. Rosen make personal attacks on mothers like Ann Romney, rather than debate the issues most important to women. More and more women like Ann Romney are standing up and speaking out. Women are joining the political arena in droves, both as activists and as candidates. Moms like Mia Love and Martha Zoller have put their name on the ballot in opposition to the Obama agenda. This November, we could elect five new conservative women -- Deb Fischer, Sarah Steelman, Heather Wilson, Linda Lingle and Linda McMahon -- to the U.S. Senate, ending the do-nothing-but-harm reign of Harry Reid. The tea party movement has been fueled and run by ""just moms"" like Amy Kremer who are scared for their children's future and are taking a stand. The left's war on moms exposes their true feelings towards women -- that we are the victims, the proverbial damsels in distress waiting for Washington to come riding in atop its white horse named bureaucracy to fix our families, prescribe our medications and send our children the bill. What the left will learn over the next seven months is that those women aren't victims, they are fierce warriors who fight for their principles. The election of 2012 promises to be fought on the issues and it will be won by women. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Authors: Hilary Rosen's criticism of Ann Romney was unfair and malicious .
They say Romney speaks out on behalf of issues important to women .
Authors: Democrats fear that she resonates with voters skeptical of Obama policies .

"London (CNN) -- Police in England arrested a man Saturday on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United earlier that day, they said Sunday. Charlotte Spink, a press officer for Merseyside police in Liverpool, said the suspect was a 59-year-old from north Wales. She did not name him. He has not been charged. Police earlier said hate crimes officers were involved in the investigation. They appealed to the public to help identify a man who appeared to be making a racist gesture and said Liverpool Football Club was cooperating with the probe. It was the first time Liverpool had played Manchester United since Liverpool's Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra in October. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined Â£40,000 ($63,000), England's Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Liverpool issued a statement saying it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. Suarez did not specify what he said but said it wasn't offensive. ""I didn't insult him. It was only a form of expressing myself. I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him,"" Suarez said, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. Suarez is from Uruguay. Evra was born in Senegal and plays international soccer for France. The commission found that Suarez ""used insulting words towards Mr. Evra"" and that those words ""included a reference to Mr. Evra's color,"" the FA statement said. Saturday's arrest is the second time this month that a person at a Liverpool match has been accused of racism . Earlier this month, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on ""suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense"" following a Liverpool match against Oldham. The team made a public apology after Oldham defender Tom Adeyemi complained of being abused by Liverpool fans during a January 7 match. ""All of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand,"" the club said in a statement on its website. Liverpool is not the only top-flight English soccer team to face allegations of racism. Chelsea's John Terry -- who is also captain of the England team -- has been charged by police for allegedly racially abusing Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, and will face a court case in February. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Police arrest a man on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture .

"(CNN) -- Chinese New Year is a dangerous time for pet dogs in Thailand. Traditionally the time of peak demand for dog meat in Vietnam, the dog smugglers of the Mekong work deep into the night shipping thousands of animals -- sometimes dozens to a cage -- across the river border with Laos to be trucked on to the dinner tables of the nouveau riche in Hanoi. ""I'd say about 98% of them are domesticated -- a lot of them are stolen pets,"" says John Dalley of the Phuket-based Soi Dog Foundation. Soi is a Thai word meaning backstreet or alley. ""They've been trained and respond to commands, some of them are even still wearing collars,"" he says. Gathering dogs for market was once simply a matter of exchanging plastic buckets for the many soi dogs that live around Thai towns and villages. But with demand soaring in the winter months -- dog meat is regarded as a ""warming"" food and one that is believed to confer good luck in Vietnam -- it's a sellers' market. ""The sheer number of dogs required means this method is no longer sustainable and rustlers will travel across most of Thailand in search of dogs,"" says Dalley. ""Some are bought. Others are snatched from streets, temples, and even people's gardens."" The recent floods in Thailand have also been a boon for dognappers for whom lost and displaced dogs are an easy target. Some operators simply drive around in pickups collecting dogs as they spot them. ""One pickup truck stopped in September had 130 dogs in sacks piled in the back,"" says Dalley. ""More than 30 of the dogs were already dead from suffocation."" The trade is illegal in Thailand and while authorities have made a number of raids involving thousands of dogs, the Thai Veterinary Medical Association estimates as many 500,000 dogs are sold across the Mekong every year. This month, a Thai navy patrol rescued 800 dogs packed into 40 wire cages on a six-wheeled truck on the banks of the Mekong River in Nakhon Phanom province. Police said they made one arrest but the other smugglers disappeared into the night. Mekong patrol unit leader Captain Thirakiart Thongaram told Thai media that more than 100 empty cages were found at the scene of the raid indicating that at least 2,000 dogs had already been shipped to Vietnam. Once the dogs arrive in Vietnam -- if they haven't died of trauma, suffocation or starvation en route -- a painful death awaits them. Dog meat aficionados claim that stress hormones tenderize the strong-tasting meat, and killing methods range from beatings to being skinned alive. The dogs, especially pedigree breeds, are sometimes shipped on from Vietnam to southern China where a prime animal will fetch a higher price. ""We know that St Bernard's are highly prized in southern China, but you can see all types of pedigree animals in these captured Thai shipments -- poodles, shih tzus, you name it,"" says Dalley. With market prices in Vietnam generally at between 500-1000 baht ($16-32) for a dog that can sometimes be picked up for the price of a plastic bucket or even less, Thailand's Livestock Development Department has a tough job regulating what has become a booming industry. Dog traders -- who have mounted counter protests in Mekong region provinces where the trade flourishes -- claim there is no direct law against the practice. Smugglers are normally prosecuted under laws that prohibit the illegal trade and transportation of animals. While there are no direct animal cruelty laws in Thailand, prosecutors can charge smugglers with cruelty under Criminal Code laws. The reality, however, is that smugglers often receive light sentences of just a few months in jail and that the thousands of impounded dogs that end up in quarantine centers sometimes find their way back onto the streets and in the dog meat circle again. Soi Dog Foundation and the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are currently working through the Department of Livestock Development to get an Animal Welfare Draft Law through the Thai Parliament. ""This is not about whether it is right or wrong to eat dog meat,"" Dalley says. ""It is about an illegal trade worth millions of dollars per year organized by criminals. ""The way in which these dogs are transported and, if they survive, killed, is horrific.""","Dog smuggling is booming in Thailand around the Mekong border region with Laos .

"Kennesaw, Georgia (CNN) -- It was the most famous high-speed chase of its day. The pursuers didn't have flashing blue lights. They couldn't swing around and cut off the hijacked vehicle. But they didn't have to. The locomotive General weighed more than 20 tons and was confined to a single iron track between Atlanta, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Its top speed was about 70 miles per hour, it had no brakes, and it eventually ran out of fuel. However, ""The Great Locomotive Chase,"" which occurred 150 years ago Thursday, made heroes of Union soldiers and civilians -- who tried to put a critical railroad line out of commission during the Civil War -- and the Southern train crews and troops who pursued them. Several members of the raiding party were the first to receive the new Medal of Honor. The suburban Atlanta town where the chase began and other Georgia communities along the 80-mile route this week are commemorating the wild, failed escapade immortalized in two movies. ""It's the greatest war story ever told,"" said Jere Martin, 60, of Atlanta, as he prepared Thursday to enter Kennesaw's Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, which houses the General. ""It's a classic tale of daring versus persistence."" Civilian leader James J. Andrews and his band of raiders boarded the General in nearby Marietta, bent on damaging the Western & Atlantic Railroad line as well as Confederate communications as they rushed northward to Chattanooga. ""The whole thing was snake-bit from the start,"" said Russell S. Bonds, author of the 2006 book ""Stealing the General: The Great Locomotive Chase and the First Medal of Honor."" ""Two raiders overslept and missed the train, and there was bad (rail) traffic and weather,"" Bonds said. On the morning of April 12, 1862, as the General made a breakfast stop in Big Shanty (present-day Kennesaw), Andrews' men unhooked passenger cars and sped away. Stunned conductor William A. Fuller, thinking Confederate draftees at a camp in Big Shanty might have commandeered the General, literally ran after his train. He came across a handcar and cranked it until he found a train that could follow the General. Confederate horsemen eventually joined the madcap pursuit. As Fuller kept the heat on and changed trains, Andrews' colleagues made two small breaks in the track and cut telegraph wires. Andrews, who thought any pursuit had been stalled, was nearly caught in the town of Kingston, but continued on to a spot near Ringgold, where the General ran out of wood and water as the Texas closed in -- about seven hours after the caper began. That is when he is reported to have said, ""Every man for himself!"" The raiders jumped off, but were rounded up. The cost for taking part in the sabotage attempt was high. Andrews and seven other captured participants were subsequently hanged as spies. A dozen others escaped or were exchanged. Besides the General, the dogged chase involved, in order, pursuing locomotives Yonah, William R. Smith and the Texas. Remarkably, the Texas also survives. Its role often is overlooked. The locomotive, which operated in reverse during its portion of the chase, is housed at the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum. ""When the Texas got in the race, it was a duel between evenly matched locomotives,"" Bonds told CNN. Some consider the hijacking of the General as the Doolittle Raid of its time: An attempt to boost morale and throw a little scare into the enemy. ""It's not a military battle,"" said Richard Banz, executive director of the Kennesaw museum. ""This is an ingenious concept of 'let's go 200 miles behind enemy lines.' "" In the end, however, Andrews and his saboteurs did little damage and failed to burn a vital bridge. Kennesaw, Marietta and other cities along the chase route, which now parallels Interstate 75 in northern Georgia, are sponsoring a range of events through the weekend, including tours, music, living histories and the screenings of two movies about the Andrews raid: Buster Keaton's silent comedy ""The General"" (1927) and Walt Disney's ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" (1956), starring Fess Parker. On Thursday, the General was festooned with red, white and blue bunting as museum visitors took photos and learned more about regional railroad history. It saw service until the early 1960s. Most of its parts, including the smokestack, have been replaced or modified. The wheels and axle are believed to be original. The episode proved the importance of railroads in the war and society, Bonds said. The line is still in operation today, serving as a busy CSX Transportation freight artery. And the chase continues to capture the imagination. ""It is like the Dirty Dozen, the Great Train Robbery and the Great Escape all rolled into one,"" Bonds said.","150 years ago Thursday, Union raiders stole a train in Georgia .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- At the pep rally where Apple debuted its third-generation tablet computer, one question was on everyone's lips: So, what do we call this thing? The answer, according to an Apple spokesman: ""It's just 'iPad.' It's what it is."" Or it is what it isn't. It's not the iPad 3, and it's not the iPad HD. Both names were widely rumored before Apple's coming-out party for the device on Wednesday in San Francisco. It's not New iPad, which is what people on Twitter started calling it during a nearly 90-minute press conference about the device. The longer Apple execs talked about the tablet computer's new features -- better screen, faster connection -- without actually giving it a name, the more anxious the People of the Internet became. ""Come on Apple, name it already,"" one person wrote. ""Is it an Anonymous iPad?"" asked another. Tech writer Omar Gallaga: ""Screw it, I'm just going to call it 'Lover.' "" At a demo of the device after the press conference, the topic was widely discussed among technology journalists, who were trying to confirm what to call the thing. ""It's the new iPad. What are you talking about?"" another Apple spokeswoman said, as if it's common for updated devices to come out with the same names as their predecessors. Perhaps this naming convention -- sticking with a singular product name without numbers or the names of cats to follow it -- isn't entirely new for Apple. One journalist pointed out that the iPod follows the same tack. But there still seems to be potential for confusion, especially since the first-generation iPad was just called ""iPad"" and the next one was called ""iPad 2."" If someone were selling one of these new iPads on Craigslist next year, what would they call it? ""So this is the 'New iPad,' "" said Nick Bilton, a tech writer for The New York Times. ""Is the next one going to be called the 'New-New iPad'? Where do they go from there?"" Maybe ""iPad 4."" That would seem logical if unlikely at this point. On the other hand, Apple has been through this sort of thing before. When the first iPad came out, people online were comparing it to a high-tech tampon. ""I don't think it will be a big deal,"" Ina Fried, a writer for the AllThingsD blog, said of the whole iPad name debate. ""If you recall, people didn't like the name iPad when it first came out. They seem to have sold a few of them."" A few million, that is. The company says it has sold 55 million iPads since the device debuted two years ago. When it comes to tablets, Apple's competitors are scrambling to catch up. It probably would take more than a name snafu to change that.","Apple's new iPad is just called 'iPad'

"(CNN) -- Hours after being released from custody, the daughter of a prominent Bahraini human rights activist was feared to be detained again early Sunday, her family said. Zainab al-Khawaja called her mother Sunday morning, telling her in a brief conversation that she was at a Manama police station and asking for a lawyer to be sent there, the woman's husband, Wafi Almajed, told CNN around 2:30 a.m. Sunday (7:30 p.m. ET Saturday). The call was the first her family had heard from her in hours since she went to the military hospital where her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, is receiving care while he is on a prolonged hunger strike. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja is protesting the life sentence he received for his role in the anti-government unrest that continues to embroil his country. Sunday marks the 60th day of his hunger strike. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights -- a group Abdulhadi al-Khawaja founded -- said the man had recently called his family, saying he had been mistreated by guards and hospital staff. According to the group, he'd threatened his guards that he would stop drinking water, in addition to continuing his hunger strike, unless his treatment improved. Zainab al-Khawaja went to the military hospital Saturday, to try to see her father, the rights group said. Her attempted visit was her second in three days and came just hours after she was released from custody for entering a restricted area in her first attempt Thursday. Her first attempt came after seeing a picture of her father with no shirt -- looking thin and frail since his detention. Zainab al-Khawaja said she ran to the Interior Ministry complex where he was then being held and called out his name. The Interior Ministry said she was arrested Thursday night for being in a restricted area ""in which standing is prohibited."" The ministry also said she ""attacked an on-duty public employee."" She was released Saturday. Mohammed Al Jishi, lawyer for both father and daughter, expressed concerns that Abdulhadi al-Khawaja could soon die. However, Bahrain government spokesman Abdul-Aziz al Khalifa told CNN Saturday that al-Khawaja was receiving ""the utmost care that is available"" and was seen ""very recently"" by international human rights organizations. ""Mr. al-Khawaja is in stable care. He has been provided the best medical care,"" al Khalifa said, adding that the hunger striker has been observed around the clock by three doctors -- one, Danish -- for the past three weeks. Al-Khawaja lived in Denmark and holds Danish citizenship. His family learned Friday that, on that same day, al-Khawaja was being moved to a military hospital because his condition was deteriorating, Al Jishi said. Al Khalifa said al-Khawaja's appeal is scheduled for April 23 and he will get his day in court then. Meanwhile, Bahrain's foreign minister said he has received a written message from his Danish counterpart requesting a transfer for Abdulhadi al-Khawaja to Denmark. Bahraini authorities said they were examining the request. Al-Khawaja was arrested last April for his role in anti-government demonstrations in February and March. In June, he and seven other Shiite opposition activists were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family. The Interior Ministry's general inspector said that ""all policies and procedures of the prison facilities in Bahrain meet international human rights standards, and all detainees have consistent and reliable access to professional medical care,"" according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Tariq H. Al Hasan, a spokesman for the ministry. On March 30, the government reported that Abdulhadi al-Khawaja had low blood pressure and was taken to Bahrain Defense Force Hospital, where he was treated and returned to Jau Prison the following day. Records showed that al-Khawaja had lost about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and had a low hemoglobin level, though not critically low, the government said. He was also reportedly taking fluids, mineral supplements, glucose and juice on a daily basis. Demonstrators and Bahraini authorities have continued to clash in recent months, with the opposition accusing the government of using heavy-handed tactics.","NEW: Al-Khawaja's daughter is at a police station and asked for a lawyer, her husband says .

"Washington (CNN) -- One year after the TSA administrator brought efforts to privatize airport screening to a virtual standstill, Congress has kick-started the program, opening the door for other airports to ""opt out"" of TSA screening. A provision in the just-passed FAA reauthorization bill requires TSA chief John Pistole to approve airport requests to privatize their screeners unless he determines it would harm security. That is likely to open the doors to further privatization, since Pistole has said private screening and government screening is ""comparable."" Currently, 16 airports, the largest being San Francisco International Airport, have private screeners under the Transportation Security Administration's Screening Partnership Program. The screeners are overseen by TSA supervisors, use the same X-ray and scanning equipment and wear similar uniforms. But they work for private companies. One year ago, Pistole announced he was freezing the program, saying he believed airport screening to be a federal responsibility, and saying privatization hurt TSA flexibility and added to administrative costs. Pistole said he would approve additional airports only if there was a ""clear and substantial"" advantage to the federal government. But the TSA checkpoints -- and the 50,000 jobs they represent -- were an irresistible battlefield for free-market Republicans and union-supporting Democrats. At a hearing Monday on the issue, Democrats lamented the provision in the FAA reauthorization, saying it signals a return to the days before the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when private companies provided airport security. ""Let us not forget the lessons of the past ... The 9/11 day of horror was partly on the watch of privatized screeners,"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. Republicans and an association for private security companies called that argument specious. Private screeners were adhering to standards set by the Federal Aviation Administration, they said. Republicans depicted the current system as inefficient, and said the bloat extends to the TSA oversight of privatized airports. ""There are certain airports where contractors do screening and TSA is just there to oversee the screen(ing) process; there are upwards of 50 TSA employees on the payroll,"" said subcommittee chairman Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama. ""Having 50-plus TSA officials in a single airport where they are not responsible for conducting screening is just plain overkill and it's costing the taxpayer huge amounts of money,"" he said. Said Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, ""I want to get you out of the personnel business and into the security business."" Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, called the hearing ""a day late and a dollar short,"" noting the passage of the FAA reauthorization. Congress was ""micromanaging"" Pistole by stripping him of discretion to determine which airports are privatized. Thompson asked Pistole whether privatized screeners performed better than their federal counterparts. ""I believe that they all -- every assessment is -- that they perform comparably to the federalized work force both in terms of security and in terms of customer engagement,"" Pistole answered. The 16 airports that use private screeners are, San Francisco; Kansas City, Missouri; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Rochester, New York; Tupelo, Mississippi; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Key West, Florida; Sonoma, California; Roswell, New Mexico; and seven small airports in Montana. Pistole last week approved privatization of the West Yellowstone Airport, a seasonal airport in Montana that has relied on a flown-in core of screeners. He rejected two other airports.","Congress recently passed the FAA reauthorization bill .

"(CNN) -- In what he described as a candid and comprehensive conversation, Kofi Annan, the special United Nations envoy to Syria, laid out proposals Saturday to President Bashar al-Assad that were aimed at halting the relentless carnage. It was the first time since Syria's long and bloody conflict that al-Assad met with such a high level diplomat. Even as the two men spoke, however, Syrian security forces continued to kill with impunity. At least 63 people were killed Saturday, according to the Local Coordination Committees (LCC), a network of Syrian activists. Another group put the toll at 98. Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, spoke to al-Assad about a ceasefire, the release of detainees and allowing unfettered access to agencies like the Red Cross to deliver much needed aid, a U.N. statement said. Annan also proposed a start to an inclusive political dialogue that would ""address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the people."" He was staying overnight in Damascus and will resume discussions Sunday with al-Assad. Annan also met Saturday with opposition leaders and young activists, as well as prominent members of the business community. Syrian state-run media said the meeting took place in a ""positive atmosphere."" It said Al-Assad told Annan that he was ready to find a solution but that such an effort would first require a look at reality on the ground and not relying on what ""is promoted by some regional and international countries to distort the facts and give a picture contrary to what Syria is undergoing."" He also reiterated that ""political dialogue or action cannot take place or succeed if there are terrorist armed gangs on the ground that are working on spreading chaos and target the stability of the homeland,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said. The Syrian regime has maintained throughout the uprising that armed thugs are responsible for causing the bloodshed. That violence claimed more lives Saturday in villages, towns and cities across the nation. Among the dead Saturday were 16 Free Syrian Army fighters who died in an ambush in Jisr al-Shagur, not far from the northern city of Idlib. Activist Abdel Aziz told CNN that Idlib was suffering the kind of heavy shelling the world had seen in the besieged city of Homs and 46 of the casualties Saturday were in Idlib. He estimated shelling every two minutes and that many residences and buildings had been damaged or destroyed. He also reported that security forces were searching house to house to arrest activists. ""The number of tanks is much greater than defectors,"" Aziz said. ""This scenario is very similar to what happened in Homs."" Violent clashes between government forces and defected soldiers erupted in the town of Daraya, opposition activists said. And in the Daraa village of Jezah, ""the regime's army is indiscriminately bombing the city with anti-aircraft missiles. The village is under siege in all directions,"" said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. The group also reported heavy gunfire in Damascus neighborhoods and gunfire in Hama and Aleppo, where communications and electricity were curtailed. A demonstration in Latakia ""chanted for the disaster-stricken cities and demanded the regime's ouster,"" it said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group, said 98 people died, including 39 military defectors. Among 39 civilian casualties were 25 in Idlib, the group said. It also said 20 government troops, including a brigadier general in a Damascus suburb, were killed. CNN could not verify the casualty figures. Amid the fighting, Annan's visit presented ""a small sign of hope, yet so dim,"" said Abdel Aziz al-Khair, a member of the National Coordinating Body for Democratic Change. ""There is no way that we can have any dialogue with the regime until the security campaign ends,"" said al-Khair, who met with Annan Saturday. ""They keep playing the victim role, (saying) that they are defending the innocent civilians while they slaughter them and blame the bloodshed on others,"" he said. Annan seemed extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Syria and said he had received contradicting reports regarding the ongoing conflict, al-Khair said. Annan distanced himself from military intervention as did opposition members, agreeing that an armed conflict would only worsen the predicament of civilians, al-Khair said. Both Annan and opposition members agreed that plans for a resolution cannot be implemented as long as the bloodshed continues. ""It is too early to apply a plan to resolve the crisis, "" al-Khair said. ""The situation on the ground ... is catastrophic."" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Annan was trying to ""broker a swift transition in which ultimately Assad steps aside and the people of Syria are able to choose an interim government that's representative and leads to elections."" Rice said she wants the situation to be resolved peacefully, ""to the extent that that remains still a viable outcome."" But time was running out for a diplomatic solution, said Haytham Manna of the opposition Coordinating Committee of Democratic Transition in Syria. ""We are getting to the point of no return,"" said Manna, a Paris-based dissident. ""If we can't reach a political agreement today, we will head toward the abyss. ... The regime is pushing the country as a whole toward a full scale armed struggle between the very well organized military institution and our people."" Meanwhile in Cairo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed with his Arab League counterparts on key issues regarding Syria. They called for an end to the violence; independent monitoring; unfettered aid delivery; and support for Annan's mission. But there was no getting around to the contentious nature of Lavrov's presence at the Arab League meeting after Russia vetoed a key United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Syrian regime. China also voted against the measure. Lavrov defended his nation's ties to the region. ""We have always supported the rights of the Arab world for independence and free development,"" Lavrov said. ""If you take the volume of economic ties with any of your countries then what we have, unfortunately, in trade and economy is in comparably low(er) than the volume of trade and economic ties with other outside partners."" Arab leaders called for intervention given the situation within Syria and held firm to their position that al-Assad must step down. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said the Arab League supported Annan's mission but it was also time to send in Arab and other international troops into Syria. The United Nations says more than 7,500 have died in the past year, and at least one activist group says more than 9,000 people have been killed. CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports of casualties or attacks from across Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But a vast majority of reports from inside Syria show a systematic slaughter in an attempt to silence dissidents. CNN's Saad Abedine, Salma Abdelaziz, Hamdi Alkhshali, Ian Lee, Moni Basu and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","At least 63 people, perhaps as many as 98, were killed Saturday .

"(CNN)  -- First trip to Malmo? Here's some insider advice to help you get the most out of your visit. Locals like to take a cold dip after a sauna at Ribersborgs Kallbadhus. Getting around town Most of Malmo's attractions are reachable by foot, but flat terrain and an abundance of cycle paths also make the city ideal to explore by bike. Rentals run around 120 kronor. You can also jump on the eco-friendly buses that criss-cross the city. Visit the tourist office at Central Station for maps. If you opt for a taxi, be sure to set the price of the trip with the driver before setting off. Ice cool  For more than a century, locals have been visiting the Ribersborgs Kallbadhus for a steam in the sauna followed by a dip in the Baltic. The swimming baths are open year-round. If you want to blend in with the locals, brave the elements and hit the baths in the winter for an icy plunge. A better time to visit for the less adventurous is in the summer, when the baths are open for sunbathing. Living green  As part of its post-industrial transformation, Malmo has become a leader in environmental design. The city's green achievements are reflected by the Bo01 housing development, a waterfront regeneration project with a focus on environmentally-friendly living. For the latest in green design, visit the Western Harbor and Augustenborg neighborhoods. For a more informed look, contact the local Environmental Department, which occasionally offers free guided tours of the city's ecologically sustainable areas. Around the Sound  Malmo is located just 35 minutes by train from the Danish capital of Copenhagen, and every day thousands travel between the two cities via the Oresund Bridge. Trains leave from Malmo every 20 minutes for most of the day. After midnight, service is less frequent. The two cities are part of Scandinavia's Oresund region -- the transnational area made up of southern Sweden and eastern Denmark. The best way to explore the Oresund region is with an ""Around the Sound"" ticket, which gives you access to all the trains you need to travel around the area, including the ride across the Oresund Bridge. You can make as many stops as you want as long as you travel in one direction. Tickets are good for two days and also get you discounts to the major attractions in the region. Prices depend on how far you travel and start from 199 kronor. Feasting on crayfish  Swedes are crazy about crayfish, and outdoor festivities celebrating the crustacean are held across the nation to mark the end of summer. In Malmo, head to Stortorget, the city's main square, for one of the biggest crayfish parties in the world. The massive celebration is held annually to kick off the popular Malmo Festival. Swedes like their crayfish cooked in salty water infused with dill. Blend in with the locals by eating it cold with toast and beer. To really get into the tradition, wash down the crayfish with akvavit, a Scandinavian kind of vodka.","Walking is the cheapest and easiest way to explore Malmo .

"Rome (CNN) -- The Italian captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia must remain under house arrest while investigators look into possible charges against him, a court in Florence, Italy, ruled Tuesday, a defense lawyer said. The court rejected a prosecution motion that Francesco Schettino be sent back to jail as well as a defense motion that he be set free, according to lawyer Alessandro Antichi. Schettino's other attorney, Salvatore Parascandola, called the ruling ""quite positive"" as it rejected the prosecution's request to send the captain back to jail. When informed of the ruling, Schettino ""maintained his serenity,"" Parascandola said. Attorneys will likely wait until February 9, when the full text of the court's decision is published, to decide whether to appeal, Antichi said. The captain faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship in connection with the January 13 incident. The vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio. At least 16 people died. Authorities say 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the ship. Schettino has said managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast. He has said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area.","NEW: Cruise ship captain's attorney calls house arrest ruling ""quite positive""

The roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge just days after Dharun Ravi allegedly streamed the encounter remotely and allowed others to view it. ""That viewing lasted, depending upon who you want to listen to, two to five seconds,"" said defense attorney Steven Altman. ""The back of two people from the corner of the room, embracing. ... That was it."" Ravi, 19, faces a 15-count indictment in connection with Clementi's 2010 death that includes charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution. The jury will be confronted with the question of whether Ravi's alleged bullying was borne of a gay prejudice that prompted him to intimidate Clementi because of his sexual orientation. ""These acts were purposeful, they were intentional, and they were planned,"" prosecutor Julia L. McClure told the jury on the first day of the trial. The highly anticipated case drew more than 100 people inside the courtroom. Last year, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man that appeared in the web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi is a citizen of India who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university. A second student charged in the scandal, Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against Ravi. If convicted, Ravi could face up to 10 years behind bars. On Friday, Wei's roommate Cassandra Cicco testified about the alleged video stream. ""I could only really see one of them and his back was to the camera and he appeared to be shirtless,"" she said. ""Someone pressed end on the feed. It ended abruptly and we were all just like -- oh, OK, that happened. And that was the end of it."" Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning bullying.","NEW: ""These acts were purposeful,"" says a prosecutor .

"(CNN) -- Arab League members Sunday called for a joint peacekeeping mission in Syria with the United Nations and urged members to support the Syrian opposition as it faces a bloody government crackdown. The moves are aimed at putting additional pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his government, which has unleashed its army on a popular revolt. The proposed peacekeeping mission would oversee the aftermath of a cease-fire, the Cairo-based Arab League announced Sunday. But Syria quickly said it was not on board with the idea. The Arab League suspended Syria's membership in January, and the Syrian government announced that any decision made without it ""is not binding."" The proposal reflects ""the state of hysteria affecting some Arab governments, especially Qatar and Saudi Arabia, after Qatar's failure to pass a U.N. resolution that allows foreign intervention in Syria,"" according the Syrian government. The league, which suspended Syria in January, said its members have decided to end the previous monitoring mission, which had been in Syria in December and January, to request a joint U.N.- Arab League peacekeeping mission. A communiquÃ© issued after Sunday's meeting called on members to ""open channels of communication"" with Syrian opposition groups and provide ""political and financial support."" It urged members to cut diplomatic and economic ties with Damascus ""except for those that directly affect Syrian citizens."" And it warned, ""The use of violence against Syrian civilians with this extreme cruelty, including the targeting of women and children, lies under the jurisdiction of the international criminal law and requires the punishment of its perpetrators."" The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists, praised the Arab League for ""making the decision to improve its performance in its national and humanitarian duty to the Syrian people."" ""We therefore appeal to brotherly and friendly nations, international organizations and non-governmental organizations around the world to expedite development and relief programs to help Syrians in overcoming the daily oppression and injustice under which they live,"" the LCC said. ""We also call on all Syrian political and activist entities to coordinate their efforts under a consolidated framework to ensure that relief supplies and other assistance are delivered immediately to those who need them."" U.N. officials say about 6,000 have been killed since last March, when al-Assad began cracking down on peaceful protests against his government. Syria has consistently blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the violence, and its allies, Russia and China, vetoed a U.N. resolution February 4 that was aimed at bringing an end to the strife. The Arab League said Sunday it would ask the United Nations to consider its initiative ""as soon as possible,"" although the timetable for any action is unknown. And earlier, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby signaled that he'd had recent communications with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicating that Moscow may alter its positions. In a written statement, Elaraby quoted a letter he said was written by Lavrov, stating that an end to ""any violence must be the main pillar for any proposal."" ""We are ready to support an expanded monitoring mission and folding it under the joint care of the Arab League and the United Nations on the basis of an agreement from all involved parties,"" Elaraby quoted Lavrov. There was no immediate comment from Russia's government about the reported communication or any significant shift in that nation's position. Also Sunday, former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib was named the league's envoy to Syria, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. He will replace Lt. Gen. Mohammad Ahmad al-Dabi, of Sudan as head of the monitoring mission. Michael O'Hanlon: 3 military options in Syria . The latest maneuvering came as opposition activists reported another day of shelling by Syrian forces around the city of Homs. One opposition activist said government forces are using detained civilians as human shields, placing them on tanks to prevent the opposition Free Syrian Army from fighting back. Residents say shelling rained on the city's Baba Amr neighborhood once again Sunday, for at least the eighth straight day. ""My house is dancing. I am almost dead because of the siege,"" said the opposition activist, named Omar. CNN cannot independently confirm details of the fighting in Syria because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists. But despite denials by Syria, virtually all reports from within the country indicate al-Assad's forces are slaughtering protesters and other civilians en masse. In Damascus, meanwhile, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that al-Assad has received a copy of a new constitution -- a development it said shows Syria's serious moves toward reform. ""When the new constitution is approved, Syria will have passed the most important stage of laying down the constitutional and legal structure ... to take the country to a new era of cooperation with all spectrums of the Syrian people to achieve what we all aspire for in terms of developing our country to draw a brilliant future for next generations,"" SANA quoted al-Assad. But the LCC said at least 30 more people died Sunday, including a woman and two children. The dead included five in Homs and nine in Daraa, it said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition activist group, reported different numbers, including 14 dead in Homs. That figure includes a child killed by a sniper in Daraa, three civilians killed in the Baba Amr shelling and a civilian shot dead near the town of Bab Houweid. The observatory also said a member of Syria's army was killed in Daraa and eight were killed in Hama, as were civilians in each city. Syria said Sunday, via SANA, that ""martyrs"" of two terrorist attacks in Aleppo were buried. How Syria differs from Libya . The situation continues to draw commentary and proposals from prominent figures worldwide.One was al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri who, in a video posted online Saturday, characterized al-Assad ""the butcher son of a butcher"" and praising the Syrian people for waging ""jihad."" A U.S. official said ""it is not a surprise that Zawahiri would try to appear relevant by releasing this new video,"" noting that he also tried to do so during Egypt's recent revolution. The official added there is no sense that Syrian opposition leaders favor their nation moving toward ""extremism,"" if al-Assad is ousted. Then on Sunday, from St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI backed ""legitimate aspirations"" of the Syrian people and called on ""everyone, and above all the political authorities in Syria, to favor the paths of dialogue, reconciliation and commitment to peace."" The international community has repeatedly failed to convince al-Assad's regime to stop the massacre, so it's unclear what effect the Arab League proposal could have. Saudi Arabia is among the most outspoken nations, with Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal saying Sunday that ""the Syrian leadership has chosen chaos."" ""It is killing its people and destroying the nation only to maintain its authority,"" he said. ""What is happening in Syria leaves no doubt that it is not ethnic or sectarian war or urban warfare. It is a campaign of mass cleansing to punish the Syrian people and enforce the regime's authority without any humanitarian or ethical regards."" The Saudis have brought forth a draft resolution that it expected to be considered Monday by U.N. diplomats. It will be submitted to the U.N. General Assembly, where vetoes are not allowed, but resolutions are not legally binding. Russia and China have vetoed previous U.N. Security Council attempts at passing a resolution condemning the Syrian regime. The latest, three-page draft ""strongly condemns"" the violations of human rights by Syrian authorities. It cites ""the use of force against civilians, arbitrary executions, killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, interference with access to medical treatment, torture, sexual violence and ill-treatment, including against children."" The text was provided to CNN by a diplomatic source on the condition that it not be posted in full because it could be amended. U.N. officials estimate 6,000 people have died since protests seeking al-Assad's ouster began nearly a year ago. The LCC says the toll has far exceeded 7,000, with nearly 700 killed in the past week -- about two-thirds of them in Homs.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Three people were killed and seven others injured, two of the seriously, when an improvised explosive device went off Monday near government offices here. It is unclear who is behind the blast, a rare occurrence in the Himalayan capital, although a previously unknown group, United Ethnic Liberation Front, has claimed responsibility, police Officer Dhiraj Singh said. ""We cannot verify that as we are still investigating,"" Singh said. No arrests have been made so far. The explosion happened outside a court house and less than 200 meters from the Central Secretariat, which houses most government ministries. Two people died on the spot while third died while undergoing treatment at hospital. All 10 victims are men. As Nepal prepares a new republican constitution and adopts a federal model, various ethnic groups in a population of about 27 million are demanding special rights and calling for provinces based on ethnicity.","Bombing occurs near central secretariat in Nepal's capital .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan rage over the burning of Qurans by NATO troops continued Thursday even after a President Barack Obama apologized for the ""error."" Afghanistan erupted in violent demonstrations after the troops burned the Islamic religious material at the beginning of the week. Two American troops were killed Thursday by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform, a U.S. official said, asking not to be named discussing casualties. The gunman is thought to have been acting in conjunction with a protest outside the base, the official said. In a letter delivered to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Obama called the act ""inadvertent,"" Karzai's office and National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday. ""We will take the appropriate steps to avoid any recurrence, including holding accountable those responsible,"" Obama said in the letter delivered by Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan. Karzai said that he had appointed a team composed of Muslim legal scholars from the Ulemma Council and Ministry of Haj to travel to Bagram and investigate. Obama's apology brought this rejoinder from GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich: ""The president apologized for the burning, but I haven't seen the president demand that the government of Afghanistan apologize for the killing of two young Americans."" The protest and shootings came as the Taliban called on Muslims to attack NATO military bases and convoys and to kill soldiers following the admission that NATO troops had incinerated the books at Bagram Airfield. Afghan officials investigating urged Afghans to ""exercise self-restraint"" and ""avoid resorting to protests and demonstrations that may provide ground for the enemy to take advantage of the situation."" The investigators called the burning ""insulting and shameful,"" saying NATO officials had promised to bring the ""perpetrators of the crime ... to justice as soon as possible."" ""As the situation is still under investigation, it would be premature to speculate on any potential outcomes,"" said NATO International Security Assistance Force spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings. ""Any disciplinary action, if deemed warranted, will be taken by U.S. authorities after a thorough review of the facts pursuant to all law and regulation and in accordance with due process."" Muslims believe the Quran is the word of God, so holy that people should wash their hands before even touching the sacred book. Desecrating the Quran is seen as an act of intolerance and bigotry. At least two demonstrators also were killed in the exchange of gunfire near the base where the two Americans died, said Haji Mohammad Hassan, chief of Khugyani district in eastern Nangarhar province. Two U.S. soldiers and seven demonstrators were injured in the clash, too, he said. ""We don't know who started the shooting first and what kind of guns were used, but we have started our investigation to find out the details of the incident,"" Hassan told CNN. Another demonstration occurred near a Norwegian-run Provincial Reconstruction Team compound in Maimana, the provincial capital of Faryab province, a regional police spokesman said. Afghan security forces prevented the 700 to 800 demonstrators from entering the compound, said police spokesman Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai said. They burned a few civilian vehicles parked near the compound, he added. American diplomats in Kabul and the north and south of Afghanistan were on lockdown for a second day in the face of protests, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Thornburg said. At least five people were killed Wednesday in demonstrations. The commander of NATO's ISAF, Gen. John Allen, apologized Tuesday. The materials had been gathered for disposal and were inadvertently given to troops for burning, Allen said. ""It was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of Islam,"" he said. ""It was a mistake. It was an error. The moment we found out about it, we immediately stopped and we intervened."" The Taliban on Thursday rejected the apology. In an e-mail, the Islamist militia accused ""the invading infidel authorities"" of trying to calm the situation with two ""so-called show(s) of apologies, but in reality they let their inhuman soldiers insult our holy book."" They called on Afghans to take revenge ""until the doers of such inhumane actions are prosecuted and punished."" ""We should attack their military bases, their military convoys, we should kill their soldiers, arrest their invading soldiers, beat them up and give a kind of lesson to them that they never dare to insult the holy Quran,"" the message said. Afghan religious scholar Anayatullah Baligh said it can be appropriate to burn a damaged Quran to dispose of it, but that it should be done by a Muslim performing the act respectfully. ""I can't tell you whether Americans intentionally burned the copies of the holy Quran to make Muslims angry or if they did it mistakenly,"" he said, but said their ""carelessness"" was ""a crime they have committed against the holiest book of 2 billion Muslims around the world."" A military official told CNN on Thursday that it was unclear how many Qurans were involved and that some had been partially burned. The inability of most American troops at the base to read the texts could have contributed to the mistake, the official said, asking not to be named discussing an ongoing investigation. A second military official said the materials had been removed from a detainee center's library because they contained ""extremist inscriptions"" and there was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."" U.S. apologies have not appeased Afghans, who massed outside the Bagram base Tuesday, chanting ""Death to America! Death to the Afghan government! Long live Islam!"" Protesters burned tires and threw rocks Wednesday outside Camp Phoenix near Kabul International Airport, the U.S. Embassy said in its official Twitter feed. In Jalalabad, hundreds chanted ""Down With America."" Authorities have questioned some troops as part of their investigation, but no one has been detained, a coalition official said. Last year, when Florida pastor Terry Jones presided over what he called a trial of the Quran and burned a copy, Afghans took to the streets. In the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, demonstrators stormed a U.N. office and killed 12 people. In Kandahar, three people were killed, and nine in another when police clashed with stone-throwing demonstrators. U.S. officials condemned the pastor's act.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Investigators of singer Whitney Houston's death have wrapped up the logistical part of their inquiry by having contacted all physicians and pharmacies with ties to Houston, and nothing so far appears criminal, sources close to the investigation said Friday. Authorities, however, said they're still reviewing additional medical information that will be used in their final ruling on her cause of death, and Houston's toxicology report should be complete ""on or around March 23rd,"" the sources told CNN. Officials are still trying to speak with Houston's only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown, 18, before closing the case, the sources said. Investigators have contacted her relatives, but it's unclear whether the daughter will agree to be interviewed, sources said. The daughter was interviewed briefly by Beverly Hills police the day her mother died, but she was too distraught to offer helpful information, the sources said. She was taken twice to a Los Angeles hospital briefly after her mother's death, a source close to the family said last month. Houston, 48, died February 11 in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the day before the music industry gathered for the annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Last month, officials with the Los Angeles County coroner's office said her body had no visible signs of trauma and foul play wasn't suspected. Her cause of death was listed last month as ""deferred,"" officials said. More official details on the investigation haven't been released because the Beverly Hills Police Department was granted a ""security hold"" on the case, the coroner's office said. Common in high-profile cases, the hold restricts the release of information in a case. Authorities have said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's room at the Beverly Hilton after her unconscious body was found in the bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party at the hotel. Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos over her career. A Los Angeles County coroner official last month downplayed the suspicion that drugs had played a major role in her death. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that ""not many prescription bottles"" were found in the singer's hotel room after her death. The amount of medications recovered by investigators was less than usually present in deaths attributed to overdoses, Winter said. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" he said last month. In recent years, the singer's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction.","Investigators have contacted all the doctors and pharmacies tied to Houston, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Students at Ohio's Chardon High School prepared to head back to class Friday for the first time since a gunman walked into the school's cafeteria and killed three teenagers. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire Monday morning. The person who authorities say is responsible, 17-year-old T.J. Lane, was charged Thursday afternoon with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault, the latter related to an individual who was ""nicked in the ear"" by a bullet, according to Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney David Joyce. Some students were with their parents in the school, situated in a community of about 5,100 people some 30 miles east of Cleveland, on Thursday and counseling has been made available at various locales since the shooting. ""I watched families walk through the school holding hands, I watched people helping each other come back into the school,"" said Geauga County Sheriff Dan McClelland of the scene inside the school Thursday. ""It was an incredible spirit of Chardon. I'll never forget that. This is why we live here."" Friday marks the first full school day since the incident, a return that administrators and staff touted as key to helping people through the healing process. School superintendent Joseph Bergant said that staff spent two days working on the transition, expressing confidence that they'll be ready to provide comfort and support to those still trying to make sense of this week's carnage. Frank Hall, an assistant football coach and study hall teacher who chased the gunman from the school, said Thursday it was important that students and staff return -- if for no other reason than to show that ""show that terror and evil do not win out."" Coach deflects ""hero"" label . ""I'm here to tell you that tomorrow our schools will be open, our teachers will be there, our administration will be there, our parents and community, but more important our children will be there,"" said Hall. Meanwhile, the legal process continues. Joyce, the prosecuting attorney, filed charges against Lane around 3:40 p.m. Thursday in juvenile court. After the defendant's next court appearance next Tuesday, a March 19 hearing is scheduled that is tied to a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. The murder charges state that the teenager ""purposely and with prior calculation and design"" fatally shot three people while at Chardon High. The prosecutor has said that the sophomore confessed that he took a .22-caliber gun and a knife into the school Monday morning and fired 10 rounds as frightened students and some teachers ran for cover. By the time the bloodshed ended, three were killed: Daniel Parmertor, 16, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead Tuesday. This is not Lane's first brush with the law, according to juvenile records released by authorities this week. When he was 15, Lane was charged with juvenile assault for putting his uncle in a choke hold and punching him in the face, according to an incident report from the Geauga County Sheriff's Office. The report stated that Lane's aunt called 911 in December 2009 to report the boy and his uncle ""were physically fighting"" -- and, at one point, the teen teamed up with his then 16-year-old brother, who himself was later charged with simple assault. Two sheriff's deputies arrived to find the uncle ""bleeding from the mouth and ... on the kitchen floor."" Lane pleaded ""true,"" the equivalent of guilty, to lesser charges of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to up to 30 days in a detention center, fined and ordered to complete 24 hours of community service, according to court documents. At the time, Lane was in his grandparents' custody, according to the complaint. Lane's driver's license was recently suspended for two and a half months after he was ticketed for ""failure to control"" a vehicle. The license was reinstated in early February upon his completion of a mandatory driver improvement program, records show. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall. ""I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people,"" said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather. ""There are five families, including ours, that have been affected by this. No one has the right to shoot other people because they've had a rough life."" At an earlier news conference Thursday, relatives of two of the slain children described what the boys were like . ""My brother was the happiest kid on the planet,"" Dominic Parmertor said of Daniel. ""He never got mad at anybody. He just loved to have fun. And when he was happy, other people were happy."" ""He would never do anything bad to anybody,"" Dominic Parmertor added. ""He was going to change the world. He was an amazing individual."" Phyllis Ferguson, mother of Demetrius Hewlin, said her son donated his organs. His death was ""not in vain,"" she said. ""For his one life, he gets to change eight lives."" She described her son as a ""computer nerd"" and ""health nut"" who loved football and worked out regularly. ""Most of all, I'm gonna miss his hugs and kisses,"" she said. Ferguson had a message for parents: ""No matter what you're going through ... you grab your children, you kiss them and tell them you love them."" Ferguson said she didn't do that on Monday, because Demetrius was running late. Both Daniel and Demetrius were shot in the head, their relatives said. The mother of one of the wounded children spoke as well. Holly Walczak's son Nick was wounded in his arm, neck and back, ""which created a spinal shock,"" she said, adding that he is in serious condition but doctors are optimistic for his recovery. If a teacher had not pulled him to a safer place, it is likely Nick would have died as well, she said. Ron Parmertor, Daniel's uncle, called on young people to watch out for potential signs on social media that someone they know maybe troubled. If something posted on a social network ""doesn't look right, tell your mom and dad, tell the police, tell a counselor, tell a neighbor, tell a friend. Just tell somebody,"" he said. And, he added, to anyone who is having trouble dealing with the tragedy: ""Please talk to somebody.""
